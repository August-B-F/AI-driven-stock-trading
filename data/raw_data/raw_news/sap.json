In addition, in four of the five vendor assessments, SAP was named a Leader.\n\nAccording to the IDC MarketScape, \u201cThe company\u2019s ability to cover end-to-end operations and integrate planning within a core system comes ready to implement.\u201d The report also noted that \u201cSAP\u2019s size and scope is globally expansive, and the company\u2019s client base in supply chain planning is extensive.\u201d\n\nOther key strengths recognized include:\n\nAnalytics and dashboarding with both web-based and Excel-based interfaces\n\nReady-to-implement and business-tested sets of algorithms across planning\n\nfunctions\n\nfunctions Synchronized planning integrating finance, supply chain planning, and execution\n\nAI and machine learning demand planning enabling what-if scenario modeling, demand sensing, analytics, new product introduction, and more\n\nInventory optimization integrated with SIOP and S&OP processes\n\nSAP was also positioned in the remaining supply chain planning vendor assessments:\n\nSAP\u2019s composable approach to providing planning solutions for its customers coupled with native integration between those composable elements and ERP systems allows companies to orchestrate their supply chain to help meet their specific needs. That same composability can allow companies to extend and expand their solutions at their own rate with minimal disruption to existing processes.\n\nNative connectivity with SAP\u2019s ERP and additional extended function applications can provide the data foundation for multiple artificial intelligence use cases. AI use spans advanced algorithmic machine learning, generative AI for analysis of complex structured and unstructured data, and, soon, agentic AI to analyze data, initiate actions, and ultimately recommend and execute planning decisions. Since supply chain orchestration requires multi-enterprise collaboration, SAP helps provide trading partner connectivity through its best-in-class business network, which can not only connect trading partners for business transactions but also for end-to-end, collaborative, and continuously interactive planning processes.\n\nSupply chain business needs to go far beyond distant promises of what could be and requires solutions that solve real problems today, leveraging the right technology in the right place for the right purpose. SAP\u2019s strategy is to provide data, applications, and AI that help keep the business running while continually evaluating evolving technologies that can be practically applied.\n\nSAP is delighted to be recognized by the IDC MarketScape in supply chain planning. We remain committed to being a trusted partner, providing reliable software solutions that help meet the evolving needs of our customers. We will continue to incorporate new and cutting-edge technologies where they offer clear business value, helping our customers to excel and be their very best.\n\nSources: IDC Marketscape: Worldwide Supply Chain Planning Overall 2024 Vendor Assessment, November 2024, IDC #US52694624e; IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Supply Chain Planning for Process Industries 2024 Vendor Assessment, October 2024, IDC #US51273023e; IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Supply Chain Planning for Distribution Industries 2024 Vendor Assessment, October 2024, IDC #US51272924e; IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Supply Chain Planning in Discrete Manufacturing 2024 Vendor Assessment, October 2024, IDC #US51272724e\n\nJay Foster is global product marketing director for Supply Chain Planning at SAP.",

            "content": "The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as AI agents, will bring more automation and efficiencies across work environments, but it does not mean humans can be left out of the equation.\n\nSAP, for instance, is heralding the transformation of business operations through \u201cautonomous, collaborative AI agents\u201d, where the next frontier of AI will unify people, data, and processes to augment outcomes.\n\nSpecifically, its AI copilot Joule is built with the ability to autonomously \u201creason, plan, and execute\u201d collectively across multiple applications.\n\nThis means, for example, its Joule platform can bring together AI agents to settle a payment dispute, which involves monitoring and assessing accounts, analysing data, providing recommendations, and generating reports.\n\nHowever, it does not mean humans are no longer needed to oversee such tasks, said SAP\u2019s CTO and chief AI officer Philipp Herzig, said in an interview with FutureCIO.\n\nThe German software vendor adheres to a \u201cstrict\u201d ethics policy that requires human oversight in every use case for AI, whether it involves traditional AI tools or emerging ones such as AI agents, said Herzig.\n\nHumans remain in the loop and always have to be the last decision maker, he said.\n\nAsked if this was necessary even as AI advanced, he replied affirmatively, noting that SAP initiated this AI policy long before EU AI Act was established and before industry discussions centred on the need for GenAI (generative AI) regulations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important design principle\u2026[and one] we believe is key to create trust and necessary, for many years on, to make sure whatever goes into an SAP system is sound and safe from a compliance perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also is critical that the AI systems can carry out tasks according to a company\u2019s business rules, which Herzig noted can prove to be a tough engineering challenge.\n\nThis requires the ability to leverage large datasets to drive the right outcomes with respect to logic and reasoning, for various business functions, such as HR and financial planning, he said.\n\nOrganisations have to ensure AI-driven workflows do not deviate from business rules that still need to be applied to these tasks, he noted.\n\nThis involves providing the AI models with the metadata, description of APIs (application programming interfaces), and semantics, amongst others, so the AI agents can carry out the various steps to fulfil a task. Fulfilling a customer order, for example, will require checking the inventory and looking at the production capacity, he said.\n\nThe AI algorithm needs to have the capability to fulfil such tasks in the right, logical way, that adheres to all required business rules. He pointed to SAP Knowledge Graph, which he said was designed to address this for enterprise customers.\n\nThe knowledge graph taps the software vendor\u2019s data, including business process metadata and data models, to ground AI models. To carry out a payment dispute, for instance, Joule AI agents would leverage the knowledge graph to pull together related orders, invoices, and payments from SAP applications, to carry out the task.\n\nPowered by contextual data across core business functions, such as CRM, HR, and ERP, SAP further believes its agentic AI products can \u201cseamlessly integrate\u201d business operations and transform \u201cthe future of work\u201d.\n\nChange management plays an important role as workplace evolves\n\nIt highlights the importance of change management as the way people work is evolving, said Herzig, who assumed the newly created role of chief AI officer in February last year and in January 2025 added CTO to his resume.\n\nHis predecessor and former CTO Juergen Mueller stepped down last September following an incident at a company event, during which Mueller was deemed to have behaved \u201cinappropriately\u201d.\n\nAsked what typically would be discussed during his meetings with other SAP\u2019s leadership team such as the CFO and HR head, Herzig said: \u201cA discussion we always have is the impact on human. Change management with AI is a very important topic because it\u2019s very clear that the way people work is fundamentally changing.\u201d\n\nNoting that SAP\u2019s 40,000 developers worldwide use various GenAI and other AI tools, he underscored the need to ensure such tools are adopted to improve efficiencies and to increase AI literacy across the organisation.\n\nAny concerns that AI will replace jobs also need to be addressed, he said, adding that companies should work to support employees along their AI journey.\n\nIn a separate announcement this week, SAP Labs Singapore said it was working with the National University of Singapore (NUS) to hire and train nine researchers in its AI team over the next five years.\n\nParked under the Industrial Postgraduate Programme, this initiative will see new researchers recruited from NUS and hired to work on AI research areas that \u201ccomplement\u201d the work of SAP Labs\u2019 local team.\n\nThe Singapore lab was established in 2022 along with the pledge to hire 200 AI engineers. It currently has a headcount of 420, with hires from local universities and institutes of higher learning, SAP said. It added that the local engineering team also supports the company\u2019s agentic AI roadmap and capabilities.",

            "content": "SAP's cloud applications are becoming increasingly attractive for local users, as the results of this year's investment report from the German-speaking SAP user group (DSAG) suggest. According to the report, the usage figures for S/4Hana Cloud show significant growth. According to the report, 33 percent of respondents in the DACH region (2024: 11 percent) now rely on the private cloud offering and thirteen percent (2024: 6 percent) on the public cloud variant.\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe gap to the discontinued model of traditional ERP program packages (51%) narrowed significantly year-on-year. Furthermore, for the first time, more cloud than on-premises S/4Hana systems are being used in companies.\n\nIn terms of investment, cloud ERP systems are also literally taking off. 68 percent (2024: 18 percent) state that they want to invest in S/4Hana Cloud (private and public). In other words, more money will continue to be spent on the cloud versions of the ERP package than on the on-premises counterpart. Meanwhile, 38 percent of respondents in the DACH region also gave a positive assessment of SAP's cloud ERP policy, compared to the disastrous thirteen percent from the previous year.\n\nSurvey with other addressees\n\nAt the presentation of the report, DSAG CEO Jens Hungershausen pointed out, however, that the current results are only comparable with those of the previous year to a limited extent. This is because the questionnaire for the participants was sent out by SAP this time. As a result, significantly more larger companies were surveyed. On the other hand, the target group was also more heterogeneous, as one in five of the participating SAP user companies is not a DSAG member.\n\nAccording to Hungershausen, the trend reversal towards the cloud must therefore be read against the background of the changed survey structure. \"It is often large companies whose digital transformation strategy is a reason to migrate to the cloud,\" says the user representative. At the same time, they usually also have greater investment power. In addition, some of the marketing and sales initiatives to support SAP's cloud policy, such as the Rise with SAP Migration & Modernization programme, had not yet \"taken off\" last year. The program, which includes incentives for moving to the cloud, was rated as highly or moderately relevant by 40 percent of respondents.\n\nApproval for SAP's transformation programs\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe Rise with SAP (private cloud) transformation program has also become significantly more important. 48% of respondents (2024: 16%) stated that they already use or intend to use the program. The number of companies not planning to use Rise fell from 61% to 23% within the space of a year. Grow with SAP, i.e. the transformation to S/4Hana Public Cloud, is also experiencing slightly weaker growth in importance.\n\nSAP BTP: From data silos to integrated business processes This online workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to integration and data management with the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and shows how business applications can be connected to SAP BTP. Participants will learn how to merge data from different systems, improve its quality and create a standardized database for business processes. Registration and dates at: heise.de/s/lw1xn\n\nIn view of the acceptance and popularity of Rise with SAP and Rise with SAP Migration and Modernization, DSAG sees this as confirmation that on-premises customers should not be left out in the cold. Nevertheless, Hungershausen complains that some user companies feel under pressure from SAP to move to the cloud.\n\n\"The pace that the software manufacturer is setting here is not sustainable for every company. SAP must not pressure its customers to make quick decisions for the sake of its own share price,\" said the DSAG board member. \"Instead, SAP must ensure that companies have a realistic, economically viable and strategically sensible migration perspective. Freedom of choice, long-term planning security and fair conditions for on-premises customers are still needed.\"\n\n(mki)",

The prototype is being used successfully by clubs such as TSG Hoffenheim and FC Bayern Munich, as well as by the German Football Association (DFB).\n\nWith the help of an Apple Vision Pro, game scenes can be reproduced and analyzed in 3D from the perspective of each player.

This makes it easier to recognize situations in which different player behaviour might have made more sense.\n\nUsing an app on the Apple Vision Pro, the prototype is designed to help teams optimize their performance - whether it's preparing for an upcoming match or analysing player performances in past games. Timo Gross, Head of Match Analysis at soccer club TSG Hoffenheim, sees great potential in the simulation of match scenarios using immersive 3D technology. \"This improves player training and tactical understanding,\" he explains. \"I even believe that this has the potential to pave the way for a new approach to player development, especially at youth level.\"\n\nsap.com",

To support these critical decisions, SAP and the NHL are introducing the SAP-NHL Front Office App for iPad.\n\nThis powerful tool can streamline and centralize access to key data, helping general managers and hockey operations departments manage roster planning, salary cap considerations, and player contracts more efficiently.\n\nEnhancing and advancing the game of hockey Explore the NHL\u2019s journey with SAP\n\nDriving innovation in hockey\n\nFor over a decade, SAP and the NHL have worked together to advance and enhance the game through cutting-edge technologies. From bringing real-time data and insights onto NHL benches with the SAP-NHL Coaching Insights App for iPad to supporting the League\u2019s sustainability efforts with NHL Venue Metrics and reimagining the NHL EDGE advanced stats section on NHL.com, each innovation has put data at the center of decision-making for League stakeholders, players, coaches, and fans alike. Now, SAP and the NHL are extending this approach with the SAP-NHL Front Office App for iPad, bringing the same level of informed decision-making and operational efficiency to NHL Club front offices.\n\nUnlocking new insights for NHL front offices\n\nPowered by SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), the SAP-NHL Front Office App for iPad consolidates multiple NHL-owned data sources into a single, intuitive platform. By providing a centralized view of team, player, and League data insights, front offices can make more informed, real-time decisions with greater accuracy and efficiency.\n\nThe SAP-NHL Front Office App for iPad consists of three core sections:\n\nLeague View: Displays each Club\u2019s current cap and projected off-season cap situation, along with a draft grid tracking future picks, transaction history, and conditional picks. Daily transaction alerts and customizable filters enhance visibility into player movements.\n\nDisplays each Club\u2019s current cap and projected off-season cap situation, along with a draft grid tracking future picks, transaction history, and conditional picks.

Advanced filters allow sorting by roster status, player position, and contract details, while visual indicators highlight free agents and cap impacts. Player View: Offers comprehensive NHL player profiles, including bio details, contract history, game logs, and transaction history for a complete career overview.\n\nAdditionally, the app introduces enhanced data points such as Long-Term Injury designation, projected off-season cap room, projected free-agent status for all players, complete language related to No Move/No Trade clauses, retained salary transaction information, detailed waiver status, and performance bonus tracking. By integrating this information into a single platform, the SAP-NHL Front Office App for iPad can equip teams with the tools they need to navigate complex decisions more efficiently.\n\nCourtesy of the NHL\n\nBuilding on a strong technical foundation\n\nThe SAP-NHL Front Office App for iPad is part of the NHL\u2019s broader initiative to enhance the distribution of official Central Registry player and Club data, ensuring that all NHL teams have timely and consistent access to critical League information. Since 2017, iPads have been a core part of NHL game operations, delivering real-time insights and video to coaches and players on the bench. Developing the SAP-NHL Front Office App for iPad was a natural next step to bring the same level of efficiency and accessibility to front-office decision-makers.\n\nTo support this expansion, the NHL leveraged its existing SAP BTP infrastructure, which provides the League with a scalable, cloud-based platform for application development, automation, data management, analytics, and AI. By building the SAP-NHL Front Office App on SAP BTP, the League extended its technology ecosystem while seamlessly integrating new capabilities to support evolving business needs.\n\nEnsuring the NHL is future-ready\n\nBeyond front-office operations, SAP and the NHL continue to collaborate on optimizing League-wide business processes. As part of its commitment to innovation, the NHL also recently selected SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition and SAP SuccessFactors solutions to help enhance workforce management and streamline financial operations.\n\nAs hockey continues to evolve, SAP remains dedicated to delivering technology-driven solutions that empower NHL Clubs, drive League-wide efficiency, and unlock new possibilities for the sport.\n\nDanielle Venino is part of Integrated Storytelling for Global Sponsorships at SAP.",

They will become more productive more quickly by using a tool like this.\u201d\n\nHowever, said Scott Bickley, an advisory fellow at Info-Tech Research Group, \u201cMost enterprises are not going to invest in multiple AI platforms, so the race is on for which solution can do the most to bring them towards their goals. It is unrealistic to expect companies to invest in AI solutions from Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP, and others. SAP has an advantage in that ERP solutions are the system of record and house a lot of critical data. SAP is banking on this fact to make it the system of choice and to use SAP Business Data Cloud to integrate non-SAP data sources into its AI ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAnd, he cautioned, \u201cProspective buyers should be cautious, however, as it is early days for all of these solutions. Nothing is proven at this point. Running proof of concept exercises while avoiding major financial commitments is critical at this stage. SAP\u2019s solution is part of the BTP suite, so this is a consumption-based license model.

            "content": "The global supply chain landscape remains under pressure, facing unprecedented challenges and poised to undergo seismic shifts based on geopolitical conflicts, climate events, and workforce shortages. Persistent disruptions are sending shockwaves through the global economy, forcing companies to reimagine their operations and seek innovative technologies to build resilience against an increasingly unpredictable future.\n\nIn this era of constant disruption, SAP stands at the forefront of supply chain transformation. Our vision is clear: to empower our customers with transparent, resilient, and sustainable supply chains. We\u2019re committed to delivering innovative cloud solutions and collaborative business networks that enable autonomous supply chains seamlessly integrated with SAP Business Suite.\n\nTo spearhead this critical business, SAP recently appointed Dominik Metzger as the new president and chief product officer of Supply Chain Management at SAP. Metzger brings a wealth of experience and deep-rooted passion for tackling supply chain complexities. His years of hands-on work with customers navigating disruptions and driving transformation make him uniquely qualified to lead SAP\u2019s new unit. This team combines SAP\u2019s digital supply chain, business network, and field service management solutions, positioning the company to address the multifaceted challenges of modern supply chain management.\n\nNearly three months into this role, I caught up with Metzger to hear about how he\u2019s adapting and his vision for the future of supply chain management at SAP.\n\nQ: Having spent the last five years working in a variety of roles at SAP, what are your priorities for the new role?\n\nA: During my time at SAP, I\u2019ve seen how supply chain management has transitioned into a dynamic and connected ecosystem that demands constant collaboration, end-to-end data integration, and agile processes to keep pace with constant disruptions. My chief priority is to ensure that we help customers not only respond to disruptions but also proactively prepare and act. We can do so by leveraging AI, generative AI, real-time data, and predictive analytics with the power of SAP\u2019s technology. Our vision is to build an autonomous supply chain, enabling customers to have highly efficient processes and personalized, context-rich insights that incorporate data from across the enterprise. This approach allows their teams to focus on truly complex decisions.\n\nA risk-resilient and sustainable supply chain is one that is connected, contextualized, and collaborative Learn more\n\nWith SAP Business Suite, we offer our customers deeply connected, end-to-end supply chain processes\u2014from product data management for discrete and formulated products to planning the demand, supply, production, and inventory levels to purchasing parts and materials to manufacturing execution, logistics, and finally asset and service operations. These processes are turbocharged with a wealth of AI capabilities to help truly bring the experience to a business user.\n\nYet, AI is only as good as the data it runs on, so we are committed to ensuring all processes are relevant and responsible. Our recent launch of SAP Business Data Cloud (SAP BDC) is a cornerstone of helping our customers fix their data at its very core, within the context of their business process. This makes any ontology or data semantic discussion obsolete: SAP can provide out-of-the-box, semantically aligned data products, spanning end-to-end supply chain functions, enriched with unstructured data through our partnership with Databricks.\n\nOur AI-first strategy will help enable companies to leverage the wealth of structured and unstructured data to become highly adaptive and, ultimately, autonomously act on even the most complex disruptions. This holistic approach helps guarantee that customers will shape their supply chain strategies with real-time intelligence. By embedding this technology deep into SAP\u2019s supply chain management applications, we can drive greater productivity, improve operational efficiency, and create more resilient, agile networks that can adapt to shifting market conditions. We are now conquering the next frontier of truly autonomous supply chain agents, contextually rich and deeply anchored in customers\u2019 business processes.\n\nNow, one of the most valuable sources of data we have not yet discussed: data out of your n-tier supply chain. In the highly interconnected environments companies are operating in, the supply chain business is a network business. My top priority is to enable our customers to benefit from the immense value of SAP Business Network. Our emphasis lies on increasing operational visibility and efficiency. Deep collaboration can enable buyers to identify new sources of supply, even during times of disruption. With market conditions constantly shifting, we are helping businesses to identify risks in the depth of their upstream supply chains to keep operations running and significantly reduce time to recovery.\n\nHow has your previous experience helped shape you for this position?\n\nMy career has taken me around the world\u2014from Southeast Asia to Europe to the Northeast United States\u2014and through various roles. In my early days, I served as a supply chain application consultant, learning the nuances of SAP technology, the intricacies of industry processes, and the challenges that go along with technology transformations for SAP customers. This helped shape my approach, as I aim to deliver real value by ensuring our solutions are adaptable and capable of driving meaningful business outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, while I\u2019m now based in Munich, Germany, I spent years of my adult life in Singapore and New York City. I was exposed to different business cultures, market dynamics, regulatory environments, and languages. This reinforced the importance of flexibility, creativity, and inclusivity, as SAP supply chain management strives to build globally scalable solutions. In this new role, I\u2019m combining those insights and experiences to guide supply chain management at SAP. I want our offerings to align with the real-world challenges our customers face daily, regardless of whether they\u2019re a retailer in Asia or a manufacturer in North America. Ultimately, my experience has driven my commitment to ensuring our solutions are relevant, adaptable, and impactful.\n\nCan you share some insight into what we can expect from SAP\u2019s supply chain management team over the coming months?\n\nWe will focus on integrating SAP\u2019s broader AI-first, suite-first strategy that enables customers to seamlessly implement advanced technologies into their daily operations. Our focus will be on expanding automation, improving supply chain orchestration, and bolstering business network collaboration\u2014all critical steps to maintaining resilience in an ever-evolving market.\n\nAnother priority is reducing emissions and helping customers meet sustainability goals. Through SAP Green Ledger, customers can integrate carbon emissions data into existing digital supply chain technology, aligning sustainability with sourcing and supply chain management strategies.\n\nMy team is also working on several exciting product launches, including announcements at SAP Sapphire in May and SAP Connect in October. Be sure to tune into both events for more information.\n\nA strong, diverse, and collaborative team is essential in addressing any client challenge. By uniting diverse perspectives and expertise under one vision, we can develop platforms that deliver meaningful, long-term business outcomes for SAP customers around the world.\n\nTo learn more about Metzger\u2019s insights on supply chain management, listen to a recent episode of the Future of Supply Chain podcast: AI & Manufacturing: Smart Technologies for a New Era of Industry.\n\nCindy McKendry is director of Corporate Communications for Intelligent Spend and Supply Chain at SAP.",

That\u2019s why SAP and NVIDIA are deepening our work together to deliver more advanced AI capabilities into the hands of businesses worldwide.\n\nWith NVIDIA\u2019s latest announcement of Llama Nemotron reasoning models, SAP is strengthening its agentic AI strategy to help drive even greater business impact. These models allocate more compute time before responding to improve accuracy and enhance AI agents with advanced decision-making and execution capabilities. By integrating them, Joule agents will become more adept at tackling complex business challenges\u2014leveraging deeper contextual reasoning, making more precise decisions, and seamlessly interacting with enterprise data and systems to deliver more intelligent and autonomous operations.\n\nTransforming business today: What SAP and NVIDIA have already achieved\n\nThe long-standing partnership between SAP and NVIDIA has already delivered AI innovations that are transforming business operations. Across industries, these AI innovations are revolutionizing how enterprises implement SAP solutions and develop applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).\n\nAI agents that work together\u2014and work for you\u200b Meet Joule\n\nFor example, consultants working on digital transformation projects, such as those driven through RISE with SAP, are now leveraging SAP Joule for Consultants, enhanced with NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 Retriever microservices, to quickly surface relevant insights from SAP-exclusive content.

LLMs trained on ABAP and SAP\u2019s enterprise logic enable developers to write, explain, and optimize SAP-specific code efficiently. As a result, enterprises can reduce development time, improve code quality, and accelerate innovation, modernizing their SAP environments more effectively.\n\nBeyond implementation and development, AI is reshaping how businesses visualize and interact with their products. Leveraging NVIDIA Omniverse technologies, SAP Intelligent Product Recommendation can bring real-time 3D visualizations to complex products, transforming how companies design, manufacture, and market their offerings. Businesses can now simulate entire supply chains before making capital investments, optimize factory layouts with physics-based modeling, and enhance customer engagement through realistic, interactive product experiences that improve decision-making.\n\nThese AI-driven advancements are already reshaping operations in manufacturing, retail, and asset-intensive industries, enabling users to make more informed decisions, unlocking greater efficiency, and enhancing customer satisfaction.\n\nWhat\u2019s new: Advancing AI reasoning agents to transform work\n\n\u201cSAP\u2019s AI agents, orchestrated by Joule, reason through challenges, solve complex problems, and drive efficiency,\u201d said Kari Briski, VP, Generative AI Software for Enterprise, NVIDIA. \u201cSAP plans to integrate NVIDIA Llama Nemotron reasoning models to enhance AI-driven automation and enable businesses to optimize operations.\u201d\n\nWith the integration of NVIDIA Llama Nemotron reasoning models, SAP will continue to advance the reasoning of Joule agents, redefining enterprise automation and allowing enterprises to scale automation with confidence and drive efficiency across end-to-end business processes.\n\nThe future of business AI\n\nTogether, SAP and NVIDIA are redefining how enterprises use and benefit from AI\u2014bringing automation, intelligence, and efficiency to every facet of business operations. From advanced AI agents that execute complex cross-functional workflows to AI-driven development and immersive digital experiences, the possibilities are expanding rapidly.\n\nLearn more about the SAP and NVIDIA collaboration today.

The group is preparing the trees for the warm days and cold nights that prompt the sugar maple trees (Acer saccharum) to produce sap for transformation into maple syrup\u2019s golden goodness.\n\nEach gallon of maple syrup requires about 40 gallons of sap, creating a hive of activity for the weeks-long sap season each year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m involved because of the student experience and to promote trees and forests to people around the state, creating materials like maple syrup that link people to the resource. There\u2019s also a lot of satisfaction that comes from having something you grew or made and can enjoy later,\u201d Worthley says.\n\nConnecticut is in the heart of the sugar maple range and ranks eleventh nationally in maple syrup production. The UConn Sugar House is one of many throughout the state offering a high-quality and delicious product each year.\n\nMaple syrup production in the United States increased in 2024, with the highest yield from the past 25 years, due in part to an increased number of taps and favorable weather conditions.\n\nDespite strong promotional campaigns from Vermont, New York, and Canada, once sap is syrup, it\u2019s basically impossible to tell where it came from. As long as the sugar producer uses high-quality production methods, all of these syrups will taste about the same.\n\n\u201cAll the more reason to support Connecticut maple producers,\u201d says Worthley.\n\nThe timeless tradition began with Indigenous cultures in North America, who moved their families to a sugar bush, or stand of sugar maple trees, in late winter as the snow began to melt.\n\nThe sap\u2019s sweetness was likely discovered by sap icicles on the trees, and this led to collecting sap for use throughout the year. Without pots for boiling, the Indigenous people made three types of sugar instead, and later the tradition evolved to syrup production.\n\nUConn\u2019s sugar house is tucked in behind the Farm Services buildings, near where the Woodsmen Teams maintain their timber mill and practice yard.\n\nExtension professionals, faculty from the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, and UConn students have made syrup here for over 30 years, preparing the next generation of maple producers and selling their syrup to support the sugar house and equipment.\n\n\u201cOur student-run maple program illustrates one of the great benefits that the UConn Forest provides to our campus community, the hands-on, practical educational experiences that our students can engage in,\u201d says Robert Fahey, Goerge F. Cloutier Professor in Forestry. \u201cThrough work experiences and internships we are able to provide training that gives our students the technical skills they need as well as real-world experience conducting and managing forest-related activities such as maple-syrup production, creating value-added wood products, and trails and recreation management.\u201d\n\nFor some students, this is just one element of their \u201cforest education.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to learn what the forest is capable of, how we utilize forests, and that it\u2019s not just by cutting them down,\u201d says Zach Placzek \u201925 (CAHNR). Placzek\u2019s desire to protect the forest led him to seek certification to fight fires, and he is working with the UConn fire chief to help establish a controlled burn operation to control invasive species in a recently harvested area of the forest.\n\nThe 2,100-acre UConn Forest has several sugar bushes, and the students rest a sugar bush and use another at times as part of their forest stewardship. Sugar maple trees thrive on north facing slopes with deep soils, and while the UConn Forest has several such locations, Worthley also mentions growing more sugar maple trees, and perhaps developing or cultivating a stand closer to the sugar house.\n\n\u201cThe ability to produce maple syrup locally in Connecticut is one of the many positive benefits created by living in a well-forested state\u201d says Amy Harder, associate dean for Extension. \u201cMany producers also benefit from integrating agritourism into their operations so the public can see, smell, and taste the entire experience \u2013 something my family loves to do!\u201d\n\nSap runs just below the bark on sunny days, dripping from the taps into the buckets or lines affixed to each tree. Once the sap really starts running, the students need to empty the tank at the sugar bush daily. It\u2019s transported back to the sugar house on campus in their 60-gallon transfer tank and pumped into another tank outside the sugar house. Gravity feeds the sap into the evaporator inside the house.\n\nThe wood-fired pans are heated to 219 degrees Fahrenheit, boiling the water out of the sap, with steam rising through the vent in the sugar house\u2019s roof. Sap becomes syrup as the water evaporates and the sugar content increases. Next, it\u2019s filtered to remove any solids and then reheated to over 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Bottles are carefully filled with the 180-degree sap and turned upside down to seal the lids.\n\nMaple syrup comes in four colors, Golden, Amber, Dark, and Very Dark. Lighter syrup \u2013 golden and amber \u2013 is from early sap and has a milder flavor. The lighter colors are often the syrup of choice for breakfast foods, added to coffee, or drizzled over ice cream. Later season sap is darker because it has more sugars in it, and the sugars make the darker syrup with its robust flavor. Many people use darker syrups for baking and cooking, although some prefer this flavor on breakfast foods.\n\nSap season wraps up by the end of March, sometimes earlier if the weather warms faster than expected. The students clean the equipment and conduct any needed repairs or maintenance on the equipment before storing it for next year. UConn\u2019s 30-year-old evaporator is in its last season, and the off-season challenge this year is fundraising to replace it.\n\n\u201cFor myself, being a researcher and doing a lot of outreach work with the local professional foresters, I find immense value in having this living lecture hall to teach from,\u201d says Amanda Bunce, a Ph.D. student studying tree biomechanics and silviculture. \u201cStudents do much better learning in the real thing than from a classroom, and I find it so much easier to share my own enthusiasm for ecology when we\u2019re out in it.\u201d\n\nFind a Sugar House near you in Connecticut by visiting Connecticut Grown.\n\nThis work relates to CAHNR\u2019s Strategic Vision areas of Advancing Adaptation and Resilience in a Changing Climate and Fostering Sustainable Landscapes at the Urban-Rural Interface.\n\nFollow UConn CAHNR on social media",

            "content": "Presented by SAP\n\nSometimes two contradictory forces can be true at the same time.\n\nIn the past 20 years, we\u2019ve seen an explosion of innovative new technologies for businesses but slowing business productivity growth. Between 1995 and 2005, productivity in the U.S. grew at 2.6%. But in the decades since 2005, it grew at just 1.4% \u2014 a drop of nearly 50%, according to McKinsey. And this happened during a time when the internet matured, smartphones and mobile apps became pervasive and there were big advancements in ERP technologies.\n\nIt is clear from the data that innovation alone doesn\u2019t lead to broad-based productivity gains. And that is a problem because when businesses are more productive, everyone benefits. This is especially important to take note of right now as new data and business AI innovations are reaching the market with breakneck speed. But these innovations are also bringing more complexity. What really matters is how you use data and AI together. Clean and meaningful data is the foundation for relevant AI. At the center of this is ERP data.\n\nWhy is ERP data so valuable? Because it is structured, describes processes, and has a sematic meaning.\n\nExamples include purchase orders, invoices, financial postings in a general ledger and supplier delivery schedules. ERP data has business semantics that connects individual data sets and that\u2019s what makes it possible to truly understand how businesses run. When you add in industry-specific data \u2014 like energy prices, interest rates and consumer trends and preferences, it becomes even richer. Considering that over 80% of the business data generated in the world runs through an SAP system, this is knowledge that is unique to SAP. We know how businesses run best across any industry and geography.\n\nEmerging AI applications as a force multiplier\n\nThe cloud has changed the game as how this data is accessible. On top of this data, a new class of AI-driven applications can be built that is relevant to a business and their industry and is useful through an intuitive user interface. That\u2019s what creates a force multiplier for business productivity and business value. That\u2019s exactly what SAP is focused on right now.\n\nIn the past few weeks, SAP has announced a series of data and AI innovations to make businesses more productive. This includes Joule for Developers, which is an AI-powered assistant that understands SAP\u2019s development framework and empowers developers of all skill levels to be more productive, creative and proficient in accelerating ABAP, Java and JavaScript-based application development and automation. Last month, we announced our Business Data Cloud, as our solution to unify all SAP and third-party data for our customers, providing the trusted data foundation organizations need to make more impactful decisions. In combination with our partner DataBricks, BDC combines structured data with unstructured data such as customer feedback, industry trends, etc., leading to better decision making.\n\nUnifying AI across the organization\n\nThe source that is generating the necessary operational data is the SAP Business Suite. It represents a comprehensive set of integrated applications that seamlessly connects every part of their business. And that really speaks to the elegance of the SAP system \u2014 that everything works together seamlessly and provides customers a 360 view on their business.\n\nThink of it like an orchestra. Instead of individual musicians playing different instruments, an orchestra creates music and harmony because they play seamlessly together. In other words, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. That\u2019s what the SAP Business Suite does for business data.\n\nA great example is KIND, which is the health and wellness division of Mars, Inc. Their recent growth created lots of complexity. They needed to rethink their decentralized ways of working. So they implemented SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition as their new business technology foundation while partnering with implementation experts from Accenture. As a result, they can better access and leverage their ERP data in the public cloud, leading to operational efficiencies and better use of analytics to drive better decisions for efficient business operations.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the next wave of AI is agentic \u2014 agents or services that come as software. For example, think of a service to enter and process travel expenses. What is still needed is software that stores the data in a structured way, a system of record, etc. But what is changing is the user experience. In the case of SAP, our UX is Joule and it is becoming the orchestrator of services.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single business technology conversation today that doesn\u2019t start and end with the impact of data and AI. But just like an orchestra, it can either be noise or music depending on how it all comes together. Companies that embrace an active approach of data management supercharged by generative AI will stay ahead of what\u2019s coming next and create a blueprint for a new era of business productivity growth.\n\nJan Gilg is Chief Revenue Officer, Americas and SAP Global Business Suite.\n\nsales@venturebeat.com.\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they\u2019re always clearly marked.

            "content": "Adding daffodils to a floral bouquet is often considered a big no-no as they can kills your other flowers - but florists have revealed a nifty trick that means you can include daffodils in your spring bouquets.\n\nIf you\u2019ve gone to the effort of planting daffodils , then wouldn\u2019t you want to enjoy them as part of a floral display? Daffodils' toxic tendencies around other flowers can mean you\u2019re left wondering what to do with daffodils after flowering .\n\nBut florists say that following this easy hack and letting your daffodils rest before including them in your display is a simple way to ensure a beautiful bouquet that doesn\u2019t wilt - this is everything you need to know.\n\nHow to include daffodils in a bouquet\n\nWhen you cut daffodils, they release a sticky sap is that can be toxic to both people and plants - and once added to a vase of water can poison the water, causing your other flowers to die and wilt.\n\n\u2018Daffodils are toxic to other flowers because they release a chemical called lycorine and other alkaloids, as well as calcium oxalate crystals, which can be harmful to surrounding plants,\u2019 explains Larry Walshe , celebrity florist and events designer.\n\n(Image credit: Future PLC/ David Brittain)\n\nSo, when looking to create a bouquet on a budget , you want to avoid the sap mixing in with the water or coming into contact with your other flowers - and this can be achieved quite simply.\n\n\u2018While daffodils look beautiful on their own, mixing them with other flowers is an easy way to brighten up a room and create depth to your bouquet,\u2019 says David Denyer, flower expert at Eflorist .\n\n\u2018So to do this, simply place your cut daffodils in some water for a few hours and allow the sap to drain before adding them to an arrangement of other flowers.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s it! Don\u2019t worry about having to isolate your daffodils every time you cut the stems and change the water of your bouquet\u2014the initial draining and isolation should do the trick.\u2019\n\n(Image credit: Future PLC/ David Brittain)\n\nBut that\u2019s not all, Larry also has a few tricks up his sleeve to prevent toxic sap ruining your efforts.\n\n\u2018Some florists apply floral stem sealers (\u00a313.99 on Amazon) or dip the ends of daffodil stems in hot water (for 5-10 seconds) to stop sap flow. Another trick is wrapping the bottom of the stem with floral tape to create a barrier,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018For maximum safety, you can place daffodils in small water tubes (\u00a36.99 on Amazon) or separate containers within the arrangement. This prevents any sap from leaking into the shared water.\u2019\n\nYou should also consider pairing daffodils with hardier plants, such as hyacinths and irises, as they are less likely to be affected by daffodils compared to roses and tulips.\n\nFor many of us, daffodils are the sign that spring has sprung, and I always feel a sense of cheer when I spot the bright yellow heads emerge - which is why they deserve a place in a vase in spring.\n\nWhat you need:\n\n33 Pcs Flower Water Tubes \u00a36.99 at Amazon Keeping you daffodils in individual tubes keeps the stems - and therefore the sap - away from your other flowers and prevents them from poisoning the water. Floral Supplies Parafilm Roll of Waterproof Stem Tape 13mm X 22m (green, 2 Rolls) \u00a313.99 at Amazon Florists tape can be placed on the end of the daffodils stem, prevent sap from leaking into the water. Cheerful Daffodils \u00a325 at Flying Flowers If you haven't got any daffodils in bloom, don't worry, you can purchase a bunch to integrate into your bouquet.\n\nWill you be trying this hack out? Let us know how it goes.",

            "content": "As steam rises from sugarhouse cupolas and early morning coffee pots, sugarmakers are working overtime to turn maple sap into golden syrup. But as it turns out, they aren\u2019t alone: other living things are sugaring too, and their stories affect the syrup that is poured on your pancakes (or into your morning coffee).\n\nMany sugarmakers\u2019 most familiar \u2014 and troublesome \u2014 non-human coworkers are red squirrels, which chew holes in the soft plastic lines of sugarbush tubing networks to get at the sap inside. In a 1992 study, biologist and author Bernd Heinrich found that red squirrels are not just sap thieves: they also \u201ctap\u201d their own sugar maples, biting through the trees\u2019 outer bark and returning to lick up partly-dried streaks of candied sugar and syrup. Heinrich noticed that his local red squirrels had much in common with human sugarmakers: they selected sugar maples almost exclusively, got up early to check their taps, and sugared only on warm days in late winter and early spring.\n\nSome winter birds, including the evening grosbeak, Bohemian waxwing, and cedar waxwing, also enjoy maple sap, which they sip from the broken ends of sugar maple twigs \u2014 but only as part of a balanced winter diet. Grosbeaks eat a healthy mix of tree seeds, buds, and overwintering insects, while waxwings have a serious sweet tooth (or beak?) for the fruits of trees such as crabapple, hawthorn and cedar.\n\nYellow-bellied sapsuckers, our most creatively-named woodpeckers, excavate rows of shallow \u201cwells\u201d in the bark of a few favored tree species. Their taste in trees changes through the year, and in late spring, maples are on the menu. During frequent visits, they renew their wells, lap up sap, and gobble insects trapped within it.\n\nAs sapsuckers seem to understand, insects are probably the biggest group of sap-eaters in our northern forests. One Canadian study documented 28 species of winter-active beetles, caddisflies, fireflies, and moths at sap pails, including multiple owlet moths in the family Noctuidae. Although the noctuids, which some sugarmakers call \u201csap moths,\u201d are dressed in unassuming browns and grays, they have a remarkable trick up their sleeves: flying and feeding in near-freezing temperatures, even though they are cold-blooded. In another study, Heinrich found that noctuid moths were shivering themselves up to temperatures as hot as 95\u00b0 Fahrenheit, and then using their dense, fuzzy coats and clever circulatory systems to hold onto the warmth. If you\u2019re a moth, this is a pretty good trick, as most of your avian predators are still on vacation in late winter and early spring.\n\nAll this maple drama is visible to the naked eye but put a drop of maple sap beneath a microscope, and you\u2019ll find a whole world of very small organisms enjoying their own maple feast. Studies find that bacteria and yeasts with names like Pseudomanus tolaasii and Mrakia gelida live on maple bark and inside the tubing of sap collection networks. As the days warm, these microorganisms proliferate, eventually turning sap brown and mucky and spoiling late season syrup.\n\nBut the maple microbiome isn\u2019t all bad! Many of those wonderful, elusive flavors \u2014 the ones that evoke notes of vanilla, pine, butter and even flowers \u2014 get their start when microorganisms break the sucrose in maple sap into other forms of sugar like glucose and fructose, as well as aromatic compounds like vanillin and syringaldehyde. While these names may sound strange, they taste delicious; and they\u2019re important enough that they explain much of the change in syrup flavor and color, from \u201cgolden-delicate\u201d to \u201cdark-robust,\u201d as spring progresses.\n\nMaples also derive surprising benefits from the microorganisms in their sap. Research shows that some strains of bacteria and yeast in maple sap act like a biological band-aid, proliferating at the site of injuries and staunching the \u201cbleeding\u201d of broken sap vessels until the tree can heal. This response can be frustrating if you\u2019re a sugarmaker and the injury is a freshly-drilled taphole, but as far as the tree\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s just what the doctor ordered!\n\nAs the sugaring season continues, remember you\u2019re not the only one enjoying the bounty of maple trees, and take a moment to think of the yeasts, birds, squirrels and moths. While some might be stealing a taste of maple sap, others have helped give your syrup that special, nuanced flavor.\n\nSam Blair is a graduate student at the Yale School of the Environment, where he is pursuing a Master of Environmental Science.

            "content": "Welcome to the Cloud Wars Minute \u2014 your daily cloud news and commentary show. Each episode provides insights and perspectives around the \u201creimagination machine\u201d that is the cloud.\n\nIn today\u2019s Cloud Wars Minute, I explore how SAP Business Network is transforming supply chain resilience and driving a 404% ROI for customers through AI, automation, and end-to-end data integration.\n\nHighlights\n\n00:09 \u2014 We\u2019ve been doing an ongoing analysis of SAP Business Network. We had great conversations with Manoj Swaminathan, President and Chief Product Officer for SAP Intelligent Spend and Business Network and Business Network, and Tony Harris, Senior Vice President and Head of Marketing and Solutions for SAP Business Network.\n\n01:00 \u2014 A top customer priority is to establish supply chain resilience. SAP Business Network has been designed for this, bringing end-to-end data, automation, and visibility, so that companies get past faxes, emails, and PowerPoint. They\u2019ve also been using SAP Business AI to enrich these processes. Every year, SAP Business Network facilitates commerce exceeding $6 trillion.\n\n02:14 \u2014 What are some of the outcomes that customers are finding from using SAP Business Network? The one number that really made my head spin a little bit was when they said that SAP Business Network customers, over a three-year period, experienced an ROI of 404%. They\u2019re also able to accelerate their deliveries by 27%.\n\n03:08 \u2014 SAP Business Network is now fully integrated with all the major parts of SAP: the new Business Data Cloud, Business AI, and the Business Technology Platform. Because of that, it works seamlessly with SAP\u2019s enormous portfolio. It allows the data to be pulled together from across all those different areas and harmonized\u2014so important here in these days of AI and agents.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\n03:40 \u2014 The big thing that also comes out of that is the ability for customers to harmonize procurement and supply chain processes, something that in the past has often been, if not in conflict with each other, at least not fully harmonized\u2014to allow these companies to get the best out of both, simplify things, and enable the generation and use of better data from across that.\n\n04:56 \u2014 Because it is fully tied in with the SAP Business Suite, those applications generate a massive volume of data on a continuous basis, all of which can be tapped into by agents working within the SAP Business Network. It\u2019s such a timely and unique, highly differentiated product line and service that SAP offers.",

            "content": "The Hoosier state is no stranger to maple products. Up until the late 19th century, people would boil maple sap down into sugar cakes to facilitate transportation, Bell said. The cakes were solid blocks of maple sugar that would last longer than sap, according to the Indiana Maple Syrup Association website.\n\n\u201cRight now, he's got raw sap heating up and going to a point to where it boils,\u201d Nowling said, referring to Michael Bell, the man in charge of Hinkle-Garton's syrup-making operation. \u201cAnd then eventually it will boil and boil and boil until it concentrates, gets all the water out of the sap, or most of the water out of the sap. And what you have left is pure gold. It's maple syrup, the best you can possibly eat.\u201d\n\nBob Nowling, a volunteer at the Indiana Maple Syrup Weekend on March 8 in Bloomington, kept an eye on the boiling liquid. The sap needed to go from a 2% sugar content to 66%.\n\nSteam rose from a vat of maple sap, filling the tent with a smoky, sweet vapor that spilled out into the open air behind the Hinkle-Garton farmstead.\n\nThe IMSA website also reported that in 1840, Indiana farmers produced almost four times as much maple syrup \u2014 when sugar cake volume is converted to gallons \u2014 as Vermont did in 2020. Vermont is the current largest producer of maple syrup in the United States.\n\nThough Indiana doesn\u2019t produce as much maple syrup as it used to, there are still around 170 producers of various sizes in the IMSA. The association provides resources for syrup makers, including information about equipment, syrup grades and caring for maple trees.\n\nThe IMSA promotes the yearly Indiana Maple Syrup Weekend, which began in 2015. Doug Mark, the public relations officer for the IMSA and a third-generation syrup-producer, said the festival is a chance to raise awareness of maple syrup\u2019s continuing legacy in the Hoosier state.\n\nSydney Weber | IDS Bell displays a thermometer used for gauging the temperature of maple syrup. Bell said that getting the finishing temperature of the syrup right is one of the toughest parts of making syrup at home.\n\n\u201cA lot of people aren't aware that maple syrup is produced in Indiana at all,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd so, it's a chance for people to get out and find out about something that's, you know, historically happened in Indiana for a long time, but a lot of people still aren't aware of.\u201d\n\nBell brought up maple syrup\u2019s wartime history in the United States. He\u2019s heard stories of families restarting syrup production because of World War II sugar rationing.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of the Philippines and German U-Boat attacks limited the U.S\u2019 ability to import sugar, and the government rationed it, a National Parks Service blog explained.\n\n\u201cAnd then the other cool thing to me was that prior to the Civil War, if you were in the North, making your own sugar meant that you weren't getting sugar from the backs of slaves,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo that was very much a a political statement.\u201d\n\nMaple Syrup Weekend events took place all over Indiana this year, from Bloomington to Nappanee . Mark said that 12 sugar camps participated this year, with activities like tours and pancake eating. Sugar camps are locations where maple syrup is produced.\n\nAt the Hinkle-Garton farmstead on 10th Street, Bell sold maple syrup, cookies, cream, candy and sugar, as well as recipe books and make-your-own maple syrup guides.\n\nVisitors could also see Bell and Nowling making syrup and smell the sweet aroma of boiling sap. Samples of both were available.\n\nBell began making maple syrup 15 years ago, and like Nowling, keeps coming back to maple syrup production because of the smell. It makes all the effort worth it, he said.\n\nAnd much effort is required; Bell said it takes 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup. This involves two trees, each with two to three sap taps, each tap generally yielding one quart of finished syrup.\n\nThe cold temperatures Bloomington experienced this winter provided the conditions that maple trees need to start the year\u2019s sap run.\n\n\u201cYou know, the sap has to have a kind of a mechanical or a hydraulic reason to rise up into the tree,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo, when you get a freeze, there are gas chambers in the twigs, and as that gas contracts it's drawing the sap up out of the ground into the tree. So, then you kind of freeze overnight, everything stops. And then the next day, when you get the thaw, the sap runs back into your bags.\u201d",

            "content": "More than half of companies have not started the migration process[1]. As they consider upgrading their identity management solutions, they can stay with SAP as it evolves to encompass cloud and SaaS environments or migrate to a more comprehensive identity governance solution that provides deep visibility and control across the enterprise.[1]\n\nMigrating identity security from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud can be complex. Existing integrations with applications and systems can be disrupted. Established access policies need to be reviewed and adjusted. Functionality gaps can create security risks, and customizations may be lost during migration. Identity solutions specific to an ERP vendor may also not work with the organization\u2019s full range of non-ERP applications. Maintaining regulatory compliance is also a must.\n\n\u201cMoving SAP access controls and separation of duty policies to the cloud is an opportunity to rethink security and efficiency,\u201d says Amit Saha, Co-Founder and Chief Growth Officer at Saviynt, Inc. \u201cBy reassessing actual access needs, enterprises can design SAP cloud policies that embed zero trust and least privilege principles from the start\u2014enhancing security while optimizing licensing costs.\u201d\n\nCloud drives identity security evolution\n\nIdentity and access management have changed dramatically in recent years. Legacy solutions built for on-premises environments were limited to regulating user access to specific applications.\n\nLegacy identity management solutions typically rely on on-premises directory services like Active Directory to manage user credentials within a corporate network. Access controls are usually specific to individual applications, requiring users to juggle multiple passwords. Administration is labor-intensive and error prone. Oversights and human errors are a constant risk.\n\nAs devices and cloud applications have proliferated, organizations need a more sophisticated approach that provides a governance framework based on user identities and behaviors.\n\n\u201cThe old R/3 on-premises was a lot easier to protect,\u201d said Britta Simms, Global Enterprise Platform Security Lead and Managing Director at Accenture, during a panel hosted by Kuppingercole. \u201cThe way SAP has evolved, you need to look across the enterprise and not just rely on securing your network.\u201d\n\nModern solutions regulate access and give administrators a comprehensive view of how assets and applications are used to protect against evolving threats and oversights that expose data. They encompass security, compliance, and risk management into a comprehensive identity and access governance approach that ensures policies are enforced consistently across an organization.\n\nUser access is based on policies to prevent oversights such as employees having authorization to both initiate and approve transactions. Artificial intelligence and analytics monitor and adjust access permissions dynamically, giving administrators deeper insights into access patterns and anomalies.\n\nBenefits of modern identity management\n\nCloud-native identity security systems can span multiple cloud applications with standardized controls and high levels of automation. Advances in cloud computing, zero-trust security models, and AI-driven automation simplify administration and user experience. Users need only authenticate once to access all the applications they require. This is a tremendous advantage in a multi-device world.\n\nModern identity security systems use password-less techniques like biometrics complemented by almost unbreakable multi-factor authentication. Attribute-based access control and risk-based access dynamically adjust access privileges at a fine level based on behavior and context. Session recording and detailed audit trails enhance accountability and compliance.\n\nThe typical six- to 12-month migration process to a modern identity security solution can be shortened considerably by choosing a partner that brings existing workflows, keys, vaults, and forms along during the migration. Leveraging pre-built integrations, implementing zero-trust principles, and automating identity lifecycle management also smooth the migration path.\n\nThe coming end of life for ECC and S/4 HANA on premises should not be a cause for concern but a catalyst to fortify protections with a future-proof solution that can grow and evolve with changes in business and technology.\n\nSaviynt\u2019s Identity Cloud provides industry-leading support for organizations modernizing their ERP program while maintaining strong identity security postures. In partnership with Accenture, Saviynt delivers a comprehensive framework to streamline identity governance, enhance compliance, and mitigate risk throughout the ERP migration journey.

The new solution helps centralize operational data and can integrate finance, procurement, and merchandising processes.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re a franchisee with a handful of stores or the biggest retailer out there, there\u2019s a certain level of complexity that comes with running any retail business, especially with consumers who expect a very flexible fulfillment experience,\u201d Howell said during a press briefing. \u201cIn order to really fulfill these expectations profitably and meet the needs of these consumers, we believe that this retail-tailored ERP solution is going to make the difference for them.\u201d\n\nSAP also announced plans to bolster its retail offerings with two new tools\u2014a refreshed loyalty management cloud service and a generative AI assistant designed to give store employees and consumers an easier way to find what they need.\n\nSAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition retail, fashion, and vertical business is available immediately, while the shopping assistant, which is based on Joule, SAP\u2019s unified copilot, will be released during the first half of 2025.\n\nThe shopping assistant is designed to make recommendations and help shoppers find what they are looking for more easily while also helping store associates close sales. Because it can be integrated into the retailer\u2019s ERP system, users can discover specific information, like the current availability of stock.\n\nThe new loyalty management application takes data from SAP S/4HANA Cloud and applies AI to create profiles around customers and their shopping behavior and preferences.\n\nHowell identified the customer experience in retail, including product recommendations and helping consumers search, \u201cas areas where retailers can start consuming AI.\u201d She also expects retailers to be early adopters of AI tools to help with their pricing strategies and to use generative AI copilots, including SAP\u2019s offering, to ask questions and get answers immediately\u2014about inventory for example\u2014wherever they are.\n\nWhile it\u2019s still early days in terms of adoption, almost every retailer presenting in the SAP booth theater at the show said they are preparing to implement AI tools and some said they are already testing AI tools in specific use cases. And SAP\u2019s retail team made it clear at the NRF show that SAP is ready to help.",

            "content": "It\u2019s maple season in New Hampshire, and it\u2019s not too late to become a maple producer yourself. For NHPR\u2019s How to New Hampshire series, NHPR\u2019s Morning Edition host Rick Ganley visited Steven Roberge, the State Extension Forester with the University of New Hampshire and a maple syrup expert, for tips on how to tap maple trees and make syrup for the first time. He works with amateur and professional maple syrup producers, and he also taps hundreds of trees on his Peterborough property as a hobby sugar maker.\n\n\u201cI was exposed at a pretty young age to sugaring, and it was just a cool thing to do,\u201d Roberge said. \u201cIt's just fun to be out here. I think it's just another way to enjoy being outside in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nHere are some of Roberge\u2019s tips for beginners .\n\nFind a healthy maple tree\n\nYou can tap a few different maple species in New Hampshire for sap, but sugar maples are best because they have a higher sugar content in the sap. Look for a tree that\u2019s 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Avoid tapping smaller trees because the tapping wound could do significant damage.\n\nSap yield is tied to the size of the canopy and the health of the tree. So pick a tree that has a full, lush canopy in summer months.\n\nGet some basic equipment for the tapping process\n\nThe very basic set up and process for tapping includes:\n\n\n\nCordless drill : You\u2019ll use this to make a small hole in the tree. Make the hole on a part of the tree that has clean wood \u2013 no scars, wounds or signs of decay. Drill only 1.5 to 2 inches into the tree at an even level.\n\n: You\u2019ll use this to make a small hole in the tree. Make the hole on a part of the tree that has clean wood \u2013 no scars, wounds or signs of decay. Drill only 1.5 to 2 inches into the tree at an even level. Tap: The tap fits into the hole you make in the tree. Taps come in all shapes and sizes and can be made from metal or plastic. Make sure your drill bit matches the tap size. Roberge says he uses a 5/16\u201d drill bit for a 5/18\u201d tap in his backyard.\n\nThe tap fits into the hole you make in the tree.

Roberge says he uses a 5/16\u201d drill bit for a 5/18\u201d tap in his backyard. Hammer: Use any type of hammer to tap \u2013 not pound \u2013 the tap into the hole you drilled.\n\nUse any type of hammer to tap \u2013 not pound \u2013 the tap into the hole you drilled. Bucket: Hang a food-safe bucket on the tap and the sap will flow from the tap into the bucket.\n\nHang a food-safe bucket on the tap and the sap will flow from the tap into the bucket. Bucket lid: Get a food-safe bucket lid that allows the sap to flow into the bucket but also keeps out rain and debris. Roberge has a rounded lid that fits onto a galvanized bucket for this purpose.\n\nJackie Harris / NHPR Just a few basic equipment items can get you ready to tap a maple tree. If you don't want to bother with boiling the sap to turn it into syrup, just drink the sap itself.\n\nStart tapping when a freeze-thaw cycle is in the forecast\n\nThere\u2019s no specific date to start tapping, but sap starts to flow in trees when temperatures are above freezing during the day and below freezing at night.\n\nRoberge looks for a 10-day forecast that shows that freeze-cycle, and you can tap during and after that window. He says it\u2019s ideal, however, to start tapping before that cycle happens so you can catch all the sap when it starts running.\n\n\u201cDown here in the southern part of the state, that can range anywhere as early as January,\u201d Roberge said. \u201cUp north they're usually a little later because they're just a little colder. Around mid-February I'm starting to think about tapping in Peterborough.\u201d\n\nCollect sap daily\n\n\u201cSap is just like milk,\u201d Roberge said. \u201cIt can spoil, so you want to keep it below 40 degrees.\u201d\n\nCollect sap daily and store it somewhere cool like a fridge or freezer. You can also store the sap in a garage or snow bank if temperatures are reliably below 30 degrees in your location. Freezing syrup is fine \u2013 it\u2019ll thaw out during the boiling process.\n\nGet a large, shallow pan to boil the sap in\n\nBoiling sap turns it into shelf stable syrup. Big sugar houses and regular hobbyists use evaporators, but they can be pricey. A beginner option for boiling is a buffet pan.\n\n\u201cWhen we boil we want surface area,\u201d Roberge said. \u201cSo we don't want the big deep frying turkey pot that you'd have for Thanksgiving. You want a nice big flat pan.\u201d\n\nRestaurant supply stores sell buffet pans that work well for boiling sap. Roberge says they should be stainless steel and about 6 inches deep.\n\nJackie Harris / NHPR There\u2019s no specific date to start tapping, but sap starts to flow in trees when temperatures are above freezing during the day and below freezing at night.\n\nBoil, don\u2019t simmer, the sap\n\nBoil the sap directly over a hot fire that is consistently fed until the sap turns into syrup. Roberge recommends getting cement blocks and balancing the rim of the buffet pans on the blocks, over an outdoor fire. He says to keep the fire hot.\n\n\u201cI usually recommend to folks that if they're gathering their sap daily and storing it, Saturday morning it's time to boil, and that's going to be your day,\u201d Roberge said. \u201cSo invite some friends over, have something to do while you're boiling. And by the end of the day you might be able to process all that sap.\u201d\n\nRemember in New Hampshire you will need a fire permit if snow isn\u2019t covering the ground.\n\nEnjoy your syrup\n\nSap becomes syrup when the boiling gets to about 219 degrees. You can check the temperature while boiling with a candy thermometer. When it\u2019s cool, bottle it up and enjoy!\n\nOr if you don\u2019t want to go to the work of boiling to make syrup, there\u2019s an option for you, too.\n\n\u201cYou can just do what my son does [and] just drink the sap, too,\u201d Roberge said.\n\nJust remember it won\u2019t last very long in the fridge. But we find that syrup also doesn't stick around for long if it tastes good and someone is making pancakes.\n\n",

            "content": "The legal action follows more than 18 months of administrative rate requests and unsuccessful negotiations with DSS, according to a statement issued by the association on March 11, which noted:\n\n\u201cAfter great effort made by the FQHC\u2019s to work with DSS and reach resolution, the offer made by DSS offers inadequate rate adjustments, failing to address the FQHCs\u2019 financial concerns, and requires them to surrender their due process rights under the law.\u201d\n\nJoanne Borduas, who chairs the association\u2019s board of directors, said DSS\u2019s offer was for \u201cless than reasonable costs and came with unacceptable policy stipulations that we would be made to agree to in order to get the grossly inadequate proposed rate rebasing, which would be paid over a four-year schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur request to DSS was clear,\u201d said Borduas, who also serves as CEO of Community Health and Wellness Center of Greater Torrington which also has centers in North Canaan and Winsted.\n\n\u201cWe want DSS to follow the Federal law and compensate us accordingly so we can continue to care for our most vulnerable populations, and we need that to happen now because our 440,000 patients, 264,000 of whom are enrolled in Medicaid across our FQHC network, need us.\u201d\n\nBorduas noted that the decision to move forward comes after years of CHC/ACT and health centers making \u201cgood faith efforts\u201d to get this important process changed to comply with federal law.\n\nShe said the financial strain on the state\u2019s health centers has reached a point where vital services are at severe risk, including those under the umbrella of Community Health and Wellness Center.\n\n\u201cAs of now we continue to operate without additional cuts or layoffs, however, it is difficult to fill vacant positions. It is difficult to recruit in this environment. We need to stay competitive with workforce wages in order to recruit providers, and that is difficult to do.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cWe cannot provide raises for our staff who are extremely valuable, care about our mission and the people we serve and who work hard every day, and we cannot think of expanding services to meet community needs because there is an associated cost.\u201d\n\nIn response to Declaratory Ruling Request filed with the state Department of Social services, that agency\u2019s spokesperson, Christine Stuart reported on March 13 that the department acknowledges receipt of the request and \u201cshall be analyzing and responding in due course and in compliance with statutes pertaining to petitions of state agencies for a declaratory ruling.\u201d\n\nDSS 2024 report: state\u2019s method cost effective\n\nIn 2024, the Department of Social Services issued a \u201cfinal report\u201d into the state\u2019s Medicaid program which found the state\u2019s operating methods to be \u201ccost-effective and high-performing, while identifying some areas where further improvements can be made.\u201d\n\nThe analysis, which was conducted by Accenture and Manatt at the request of the state, evaluated the current program\u2019s cost efficiency, quality and access, \u201cwhile also exploring whether other models of operations could be an improvement over the current system, which operates through an administrative services organization model.\u201d\n\nThe report found that Connecticut\u2019s program \u201cstands out as a model of cost-efficiency, with per capita spending 14% lower than the average of most northeastern states, and administrative costs significantly lower than managed care states (3.8% vs. 9.4%).\u201d\n\nThe DSS \u201cfinal report\u201d further noted: \u201cIt also shows that the state is meeting national benchmarks to provide reliable service delivery while maintaining fiscal responsibility and is performing above the median on approximately 70% of national adult and child quality measures,\u201d and suggests other states \u201ccould benefit from reviewing Connecticut\u2019s program as a blueprint to achieve similar results.\u201d\n\nThe Community Health Center Association of Connecticut is not convinced.\n\nIt maintains that as the state\u2019s health centers begin to \u201csuspend vital services, freeze hiring and deplete their cash reserves,\u201d they have been left with no choice other than to pursue legal remedies. \u201cThey are not seeking special treatment, but simply asking DSS to follow the law as written.\u201d\n\nCHWC\u2019s dental services \u2018not sustainable\u2019\n\nSpeaking to her experience as CEO of Community Health and Wellness Center of Greater Torrington, Borduas explained that adjusted rates for medical and mental health were received by the state Department of Social Services for adding the North Canaan Health Center.\n\n\u201cMedical rates per our 2024 cost per Medicaid patient leaves a $122.48 gap between reimbursement and cost per patient. This difference,\u201d she noted, \u201cis what we lose for every patient enrolled in Medicaid that we care for.\u201d\n\nBehavior health is better compensated, said Borduas, but dental, which was offered at Community Health and Wellness Center\u2019s Torrington and Winsted locations, is compensated $137.15 below 2024 costs and as a result, \u201cCHWC has had to unfortunately suspend our dental services having incurred $350,000 in losses for restorative care in 2024.\u201d\n\nThat included services like dentures, bridges, crowns and root canals, and an analysis of full services is in process and will likely yield greater losses, said Borduas. \u201cThe low Medicaid reimbursement that applies to 60% of our patients, the large gaps in payments are simply not sustainable.\u201d\n\n440,000 patients served by FQHC\u2019s\n\nConnecticut\u2019s federally qualified health centers provide critical medical, dental and behavioral healthcare to more than 440,000 of the state\u2019s neediest and most marginalized residents.\n\nOn average, 60% of patients at the statewide centers have Medicaid coverage, where their care cannot be denied, according to the association.\n\n\u201cThe FQHC\u2019s need a rate-setting process that makes sense and follows the law, to ensure that all Connecticut residents, regardless of their income or background, can continue to access the care they need,\u201d added Borduas.\n\nShawn K. Frick, CEO of the Community Health Care Association of Connecticut, noted that \u201cThe Connecticut legislature has been consistently supportive of our work, but our attempts to address this issue through the legislative process have been consistently opposed by the administration.\u201d",

SAP SE (NYSE: SAP) today announced new research that reveals 44 percent of C-suite executives would override a decision they had already planned to make based on AI insights. Another 38 percent would trust AI to make business decisions on their behalf.\n\nThe \u201cAI Has a Seat in the C-Suite\u201d survey, conducted by Wakefield Research and sponsored by SAP, polled 300 C-Level executives at companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue in the United States. Additional findings included:\n\n74 percent of executives place more confidence in AI for advice over their family and friends.\n\n55 percent of executives work at firms where AI-driven insights have replaced or frequently bypass traditional decision-making. This is especially true for companies with $5 billion or more in revenue.\n\n48 percent of executives use generative AI tools daily; 15 percent use AI multiple times per day.\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\u201cMost executive decisions are based on a combination of the data, how they feel and discussions they\u2019ve had with people they trust,\u201d said Jared Coyle, chief AI officer for SAP North America. \u201cWhat this data tells us is that AI is part of that trusted inner circle.\u201d\n\nFor a majority of the executives surveyed (52 percent), AI is trusted most to analyze data and make recommendations for decision-making. Executives also have confidence in AI to spot risks or issues they hadn\u2019t previously considered (48 percent) and to offer alternate plans (47 percent). They\u2019re also using AI in a multitude of other ways, including: enhancing product development (40 percent); supporting budget planning (40 percent); and performing market research (40 percent).\n\nAnd the benefits of AI extend beyond the office: 39 percent of executives feel they experience a better work-life balance because of AI; 38 percent report improved mental well-being; and another 31 percent claim to experience reduced stress.\n\nCoyle noted that many businesses still struggle with building a foundation of reliable data critical for this kind of trust because of misalignment between IT and business functions, integration challenges across systems or even concerns with the quality of the data itself.\n\n\u201cThe only way to ensure reliable business data for AI is to have one common semantical data layer for your business,\u201d he said.\n\nTo that end, Coyle points to the SAP Business Data Cloud solution, the company\u2019s latest fully managed SaaS data management solution that unifies all SAP and third-party data throughout an organization. By connecting data from every part of the business and harmonizing it more easily and quickly than ever before, SAP Business Data Cloud can help customers make more impactful decisions faster and fuel reliable AI.\n\nVisit the SAP News Center.

Yet tonight, we might have a blizzard.\n\n\u201cToday we looked at pictures of an octopus and sea anemone that one of our classmates took on a trip to Mexico. We also looked at pictures of owl pellets found in our woods.\n\n\u201cWe then went outside and looked at the owl pellets. We saw bones in it, and it looked gross. It makes us think we have at least one owl in our woods.\n\n\u201cWe looked at our 3 tree branches to study their growth. We noticed the red maple and buckthorn were starting to bloom, and the river birch did not look much different.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all for today, stay tuned for the next OGE Phenology Club nature episode.

We had sunshine, rain, snow and wind!\n\n\u201cOn the lake we saw slush on top of the frozen lake, deer tracks frozen into the lake ice, an otter hole with aquatic vegetation on the ice around the hole and swans flying overhead. Long Lake currently has 17-18 inches of ice.\n\n\u201cIn the forest we tapped maple trees, no sap is running yet. We saw green hepatica leaves, maple trees with buds, two Blue Jays and granular snow that reminded us of sugar or salt.\n\n\u201cIn the night sky we saw Jupiter and the moons of Jupiter. We also saw our moon in the first quarter phase, this moon phase is halfway between a new moon and a full moon. The part we see will be getting bigger from now until the full moon on March 14. On this date there will also be a total lunar eclipse. The earth will be directly between the sun and the moon. The moon will look red because of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\n\u201cCheck it out on Friday night after midnight and remember to unplug, get outside and LIVE CONNECTED!\u201d\n\nPike Lake Elementary near Duluth\n\nPike Lake Elementary School phenology report: March 11, 2025 Listen \u2022 3:47\n\n\u201cGood morning my name is Ellie, and this is our report for the week of Feb. 16 from Pike Lake Elementary School.\n\n\u201cWarm temperatures, great flocks of birds, and flowing maple sap are the highlights of our week. Last week we had a high temperature of 48 and a low temperature of 11 degrees. The combination of temperature above and below freezing has created perfect conditions for sap flow. Here are some other observations we have made over the past week.\n\n\u201cGood morning. This is Avery. Ellie and I were talking about the large flocks of chickadees we were observing last week. We got together and did some research. We found that for increased protection from predators it is best to have more eyes to spot the danger. Additionally, it improves the chances of locating food. We observed both Black-capped and Boreal Chickadees.\n\n\u201cI am Sonja. Last week we observed a Pileated Woodpecker at our bird feeder! Their size is very impressive. I learned that they grow up to 19 inches long! Their eggs are white without any markings. Based on the color, ours was a male.\n\n\u201cAdele here. Watching the bird feeder, I discovered a mesmerizing bird! My partner told me that it is called a Purple Finch! The bird I was captivated by was a reddish male. I learned that they can be found in large flocks and have greenish blue eggs.\n\n\u201cMy name is Aubre. My friends and I had a rewarding time watching the birds at our school bird feeder. We have observed two kinds of chickadees, two kinds of nuthatches, many varieties of finches and a Pileated Woodpecker.\n\n\u201cHi, I am Piper. When I looked down at the ground I saw a cluster of leaves. I was wondering why they were there because there were no leaves on the trees. I thought the leaves would have disintegrated over the winter. I did some research and found out that it takes a couple of years before a leaf will fully decompose. If the leaves are broken into tiny pieces, it takes less time.\n\n\u201cThis concludes our report from the outer reaches of the Proctor School District. Be aware. Things are happening out there.\u201d\n\nNorth Shore Community School near Duluth\n\nNorth Shore Community School phenology report: March 11, 2025 Listen \u2022 2:14\n\n\u201cHello from North Shore Community School on the north shore of Lake Superior. This is the Phenology report for the week of March 1, 2025. My name is Cadence, and I am your phenologist for this week!\n\n\u201cOn Monday, March 3, we started the day with some freezing rain that made our sidewalks very slippery. On Tuesday, March 4-5, we saw a snow accumulation between 3-4 inches to our playground areas that were previously showing grass. The snow was very sticky, making it great for building forts and snowmen! On Thursday, March 6, Mrs. Rolfe\u2019s class was by the creek and found that they could break the ice on the creek and saw running water under the ice.\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, March 5, Mrs. Rolfe\u2019s class went to chickadee landing and bird watched. They saw a couple of Red-breasted Nuthatches, several Pine Siskins, White-breasted Nuthatches, a Downy Woodpecker, and a lot of chickadees.\n\n\u201cAnnabell has noticed some deer bedding down alongside her driveway. On Tuesday, March 4, Mrs. Rolfe saw a skunk in Lakeside. On Wednesday, March 5, Samantha saw that there were three deer playing with a fox in their pasture.\n\n\u201cThe pussy willow buds in the swales at NSCS are getting very large but have not broken open yet.\n\n\u201cThis concludes the phenology report.

But there are many customers who still haven\u2019t moved to SAP RISE and are natively hosting their SAP systems on AWS. They are always looking at optimizing their SAP systems operational efficiency to meet and improve their stringent availability and performance requirements and have relied on functionality of AWS Systems Manager for SAP to meet that goal. In this blog, you will learn how to automate Start/Stop operations of your SAP NetWeaver ABAP applications based on HANA database using the latest enhancement to AWS Systems Manager for SAP.\n\nAWS Systems Manager for SAP is an automation capability to manage and operate your SAP applications on AWS. It provides a seamless integration between AWS services and SAP applications running on AWS. We are excited to announce that last month we released two new capabilities for AWS Systems Manager for SAP to support NetWeaver ABAP applications based on HANA database. Customers can now register SAP NetWeaver ABAP applications based on HANA database as well as automate the start and stop operations of those applications, deployed in Single, Distributed and Highly Available (HA) topologies using AWS Systems Manager for SAP. This enhancement covers a wide range of SAP applications, including S/4HANA and BW/4HANA, and extends support to additional application servers and web dispatcher components. This new functionality simplifies the management of complex SAP landscapes, improves operational efficiency, and provides enhanced support for high-availability and distributed configurations.\n\nSAP NetWeaver applications can be registered and managed with AWS Systems Manager Application Manager console or AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).\n\nAWS Systems Manager for SAP is available to you at no additional cost. You only pay for the AWS resources that you provision to manage and operate your SAP environments.\n\nGetting Started\n\nIn this blog we will share details on how to register an SAP NetWeaver ABAP application based on HANA database and automate its start/stop operations using AWS Systems Manager Application Manager console.\n\nPlease complete all the prerequisites listed below before going to the next step.\n\nPrerequisites 1 \u2013 Get started with AWS Systems Manager for SAP\n\nPrerequisites 2 \u2013 Register SAP HANA database with AWS Systems Manager for SAP\n\nSAP NetWeaver ABAP based application registration\n\n1.

Provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SAP HANA database that is associated with your SAP ABAP application by selecting Browse databases\n\n\n\n10. (Optional) Under Connected Web Dispatcher components you can provide the following details of up to 5 of your SAP Web Dispatcher resources that your application is using. SAP Web Dispatcher resources are only discoverable by Systems Manager for SAP after you input these details:\n\nSAP System Identifier (SID) is the SAP System Identifier (sapsid) of your SAP Web Dispatcher resource.\n\nInstance ID is the Amazon EC2 instance ID on which your SAP Web Dispatcher is currently running. Select Browse instances to find the instance ID.\n\n\n\n11. (Optional). Under Application tags, you can add 100 tags associated to your resources.\n\n12. Select Create.\n\n\n\n13.

AWS Systems Manager for SAP is application aware, and it will stop all the SAP components in a graceful manner, before shutting down the EC2 instance.\n\nSelect Stop to stop the applications.\n\n16. You can monitor the operation status by clicking on the operation ID provided in the flash banner or by selecting View operations from the Actions menu.\n\nUnder Events, you can see the sequence in which the application components are being stopped along with the current progress of the operation. These operation events are at the granularity of individual SAP component, like SAP application server, ASCS, ERS, Web Dispatcher and database and in the event of a failure, customer will easily know the component that failed to stop and can troubleshoot that component further\n\n17. Upon successful completion of the operation you will see the message the application was stopped successfully.\n\n18. Refresh the page and go to Resources tab to see the applications status under Topology\n\n\n\nStart operation\n\n19.

            "content": "How do these new assurance standards align with other global frameworks, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) or the SEC\u2019s climate disclosure rules?\n\nThe new assurance standards are designed to be \u2018scalable and adaptable\u2019 with other global frameworks, such as the EU CSRD and the SEC\u2019s climate disclosure rules. These regulations are primarily designed to stimulate transparency, so all companies and their finance departments are adhering to standardised sustainability reporting. We\u2019ve all greatly benefitted from it, with the ultimate goal being to root out greenwashing and fraudulent claims.\n\nThat said, business leaders must remember that these standards and regulations weren\u2019t designed to provide decision-useful information for operational management. Instead, CSOs need to collaborate closely with CFOs, leveraging technologies like AI to make sustainability part of the bottom line and managing 'carbon books' with the same precision as financials. With all this information in one place, they can see the full picture and spot areas of risks and opportunities. It's a complete transformation in how businesses can align their financial strategies with sustainability goals.\n\nHow can technology help companies ensure the accuracy and integrity of sustainability data?\n\nIf data accuracy and integrity is the heart of sustainability management, technology is what powers it by automating data collection, processing, and reporting. Take SAP Green Ledger, for example: It is the most comprehensive carbon accounting system globally that integrates directly with customers\u2019 financial data. It enables businesses to use verified and reported real data, not estimates, to allocate carbon emissions to specific business transactions. That means customers can use SAP Green Ledger to integrate financial and environmental data in line with their individual and unique sustainability journeys. This level of data granularity also helps them to adapt to evolving regulations and international standards.\n\nWhat innovations in supply chain tracking or carbon accounting are helping tech companies meet these stricter reporting requirements?\n\nAt SAP, we have everything it takes to be the pioneer in carbon accounting. SAP Green Ledger mirrors the logic of our financial and accounting systems, which are at the core of our Cloud ERP portfolio. As a result, SAP Green Ledger empowers organisations to accurately account for, analyse, and report carbon footprints across products, services, and organisational units like finance and supply chain.\n\nIt enables businesses to drill-down on revenue, cost, and profit in relation to emissions along org structures, time dimensions, and value chains.\n\nFor example, Covestro, a world-leading manufacturer of high-quality polymer materials, is using SAP Green Ledger in an early pilot phase to test the linking of carbon dioxide values generated during the manufacture of specific products in the supply chain.\n\nHow do you balance the need for greater sustainability reporting rigor with ensuring it doesn\u2019t become an overwhelming burden on business operations?\n\nMy advice is to stick to your enterprise resource plan. Sustainability needs to be a business process and not a reporting exercise. When it becomes a business process, with all departments aligned on the overarching sustainability goal, you can move toward the big picture. There\u2019s no point in planting a garden if you aren\u2019t clear on how to help it grow.\n\nExplore the latest edition of Sustainability Magazine and be part of the conversation at our global conference series, Sustainability LIVE.\n\nDiscover all our upcoming events and secure your tickets today.\n\nSustainability Magazine is a BizClik brand",

            "content": "When he started tapping trees for the 2025 sugaring season, Paul Zononi of Paul\u2019s Sugar House in Williamsburg was shocked to find that the sap came at a trickle \u2014 and with only half of its typical sugar content.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this over 50 years and I can\u2019t remember another time I\u2019ve seen this,\u201d said Zononi, a first-generation sugar maker who has been making maple syrup since he was 8 years old.\n\nHis current operation has about 3,300 taps, which typically produces around 1,400 gallons of syrup a year. But this year, things have been off to a strange start.\n\nUsually, it takes about 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of syrup, and that sap has a sugar content of roughly 2%. But recently, Zononi has been seeing sugar contents closer to 1%, meaning it takes double the amount of sap \u2014 about 80 gallons \u2014 to make just 1 gallon of syrup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s double the labor, double the time, double the sap for the same amount of syrup,\u201d he said.\n\nNot only that, but Zononi\u2019s sap has been running slower than usual, and because some of his trees look particularly unhealthy this year, he isn\u2019t even tapping all of them.\n\nZononi isn\u2019t the only one who has seen some different trends in his sap this year. Chip Williams of Williams Farm Sugarhouse in Deerfield said the season has gotten off to a slow start. Throughout February, trees were not producing as much sap and the sap that was produced had half the sugar content needed. Sugar content has risen to where it needs to be in recent days, but the Deerfield sugarhouse lost about a month of production time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that we have a good month of March,\u201d Williams said on Friday. \u201cIn years past we\u2019ve made over half our stock in February. We didn\u2019t do that this year so we\u2019re going to need a strong March.\u201d\n\nWilliams said you can never predict how a season will go, and in a good season Williams Farm Sugarhouse can produce between 1,000 and 1,600 gallons of syrup. They typically begin tapping trees in January, but this year they have not collected enough sap until recently and are behind on production.\n\n\u201cWe boiled last weekend, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSteve\u2019s Sugar Shack in Westhampton and North Hadley Sugar Shack in Hadley have seen the change as well \u2014 a slower flow of sap and about a 1% sugar content compared to the more typical 2% sugar content.\n\nSteve Holt of Steve\u2019s Sugar Shack said that, while it varies from year to year, he had produced 161 gallons of syrup by this time last year, and has produced just 24 gallons this year.\n\nWhile the restaurant side of Holt\u2019s business has still been booming, he said more syrup will be needed, because his customers go through 8 gallons of syrup each week even though the restaurant is only open two days per week.\n\nHolt said he assumes the recent drought conditions in the region have something to do with this change in sap trends. He noted that this year, the leaves \u201cturned brown and fell off early.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trees basically shut down early,\u201d he said, meaning they had less time to photosynthesize and make sugar.\n\nZononi also has a few theories as to why his sap harvest might be struggling this year, and they have to do with changing weather patterns. Namely, rain early in the season and pervasive drought conditions may have impacted the health of his trees and the amount of time they had to photosynthesize and create syrup. This pattern of weather may also be the culprit for a fungus that appeared on the leaves, giving them a spotty appearance and limiting the amount of green surface area where the leaves could take in sunlight for photosynthesis.\n\nZononi also noted the unpredictable temperatures that have been at play this winter. For a good syrup season, sap has to freeze at night and thaw completely in the morning for optimal flow. But with some of the warm spells and cold snaps that have touched the region on and off for months, Zononi said that cycle may have been disturbed, and he believes the ground and the trees might still be a bit too cold for a good sap flow.\n\nHolt has a similar theory for what has been at work in his own trees.\n\n\u201cThat freeze-thaw cycle hasn\u2019t been happening continuously, so sap hasn\u2019t been flowing as well,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhile this year has been different so far, Howard Boyden of Boyden Brothers Maple, a fourth-generation maple sugaring business in Conway, is not too worried. Rather, he sees this year\u2019s weather patterns as a return to \u201ca traditional New England winter,\u201d and a more traditional sap harvesting season, which he said used to have an early March start and run through about mid-April.\n\n\u201cWe got off to a late start in comparison to the past few years, but throughout my lifetime we\u2019ve historically started the season in March,\u201d Boyden said.\n\nBoyden said he does not think droughts have had much impact. In Franklin County, the only major drought that occurred was in the late summer. He said the trees he\u2019s seen look healthy and he believes the challenging start to the season has been a result of changing weather patterns. This year, however, freezing conditions remained.\n\n\u201cWe need the warm days and the cold nights to get the sap to flow,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis year was much more of a typical winter. We tapped mid-February and didn\u2019t get much sap till recently. I think the trees are still frozen.\u201d\n\nWith the freezing weather, production started slowly, but has begun to pick up in the past few days. Boyden said so far he has produced 150 gallons of syrup in Conway. Boyden Brothers Maple typically produces 1,000 gallons of syrup each sugaring season.\n\n\u201cThe sap is flowing now and we\u2019re doing good,\u201d Boyden said. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll reach that (1,000 gallon average) as long as the right weather conditions remain.\u201d\n\nWilliams said he is hopeful the weather cooperates and they are able to recover from the slow start.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a slower start, but it\u2019s been warm the past few days,\u201d Williams said.\n\nZononi also reported that sugar contents have begun to rise in the sap harvests as of Thursday.\n\nBoyden added that this weekend is Massachusetts Maple Weekend, and despite the slow start to the season, sugarhouses across the state will be open to visitors and showing off how they make their maple products.\n\n\u201cIf you drive around and see smoke and people around a sugarhouse,\u201d Boyden advised, \u201cpop in and get a tour and a sample.\u201d\n\nAlexa Lewis can be reached at alewis@gazettenet.com.

The formula might come from science, but the result is pure magic, especially to Vermonters, who\u2019ve been tapping and sugaring in the Green Mountains longer than the state\u2019s existed.\n\nThe state\u2019s sole outpost of IHOP, which closed in 2024, was the only branch in the country to serve real maple syrup. In part, this is because state law strictly prohibits labeling any product maple \u2014 or even \u201cmaple flavored\u201d \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t contain pure maple syrup. But more importantly, serving fake maple syrup would put a thumb in the eye of Vermont pride.\n\nThe Green Mountain Audubon Center in Huntington, Vermont, gives visitors a chance to tap a tree and collect sap from a bucket. Photograph by Ben Stechschulte, Redux\n\nAs such, any traveler seeking the full Vermont experience must travel through maple country. And the closer you can get to the sugarhouse, the purer the experience. Visitors will also learn how the Vermont maple landscape is breaking ground with new forms and formulations. Here\u2019s how to tap the best of all.\n\nFrom legend to dollars\n\nTo the Abenaki, Iroquois, and Micmac, maple passes into legend. As the story goes, maple trees originally supplied villagers with pure syrup until a trickster poured water into the trees to create a sap that flows just once a year, when the lake freezes, game disappears, and crops hibernate.\n\nAt some point during the colonial period, the practice was shared with arriving settlers, who adopted it. Later, maple sugaring also became a moral crusade that offered a home-grown alternative to imported, enslaved-produced cane sugar. It wasn\u2019t until the mid-to-late 1800s that the industry began to take off, after the invention of the evaporator pan and metal taps.\n\nToday, maple in Vermont is big business, amounting to around $100 million per year. In fact, this most rural state in the country produces 53 percent of the national total of maple syrup and 70 percent of all maple sap sales in the country. To say it\u2019s integral to all things Vermont is an understatement, and the evidence pours liberally on far more than just pancakes, from cheese, eggs, and meat to bread, baked beans, and beer.\n\nSugar maples and red maples are the types of trees that produce most of Vermont's maple syrup. Photograph by Ben Stechschulte, Redux In March, sugarhouses welcome visitors with tours, tastings, demonstrations, and more. Photograph by Art Fleury, Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe right kind of maple trees\n\nNot every maple tree produces the right sap for syrup, so you can\u2019t just tap any and wait for the magic to happen. At the top of the maple pole is the sugar maple, which gets its name from the high concentration of sugar in its sap. Red maples also produce a lot of syrup sap in Vermont. Other types of maples, such as silver, are used less frequently and can alter the flavor. Find Vermont\u2019s highest concentration of maple trees in Orange County, just south of the state capital, Montpelier.\n\nThe sugaring season begins when the temperature rises above freezing during the day but dips below at night \u2014 triggering the flow of sap. That generally occurs between February and April, when Vermont sees the fewest visitors, thanks to cold air, muddy ground, and slushy roads. But this is prime time for maple lovers, as sugar-shack chimneys pump out hot steam as the new sap condenses into syrup.\n\nDecoding the language of maple\n\nThere\u2019s no one maple syrup to rule them all. In fact, the flavor, color, and consistency change as the season progresses, with early maple light and delicate and later maple smoky and spicy. These are categorized by grade, and they guide any journey into maple.\n\nFor generations, these grades fell into into \u201cFancy,\u201d \u201cGrade A Medium Amber, Grade A Dark Amber, Grade B\u201d and \u201cGrade C.\u201d But a 2014 law changed them to Golden, Amber, Dark, and Very Dark to fit national standards.\n\nThe state\u2019s highest concentration of maple trees is found within Orange County, Vermont.

Fresh maple syrup comes out of the evaporator at 218\u00b0F. Photograph by Robert Nickelsberg, Getty Images\n\nSoon after, this new maple language began adding further terms in a bevy of value-added products. This got a jumpstart in 2016, when Oprah Winfrey listed the Runamok Maple Syrup Gift Box by Runamok Maple on her Oprah\u2019s Favorite Things list. It contained three very non-traditional versions \u2014 bourbon barrel-aged, cinnamon and vanilla, and hibiscus. This success spurred other new-school maple producers to follow suit with a variety of infusions, from apple brandy and coffee bean to lemon thyme and, yes, pumpkin spice. Even sparkles find a home in Vermont maple syrup now.\n\nWhere to taste Vermont maple\n\nIn Vermont, maple is rarely more than a few steps away, as even the local gas station, especially Maplefields, carries syrup, sugar, candies, and creams at any time of the year. However, the sweetest spot for Vermont maple tourism is March \u2014 the heart of the sugaring season. At this time, sugarhouses welcome visitors with tours, tastings, demonstrations, and more.\n\nFarmer Harold Eastman pours hot maple syrup from his orchard onto cold snow for the Vermont treat of sugar-on-snow. Photograph by John Titchen, Three Lions/Getty Images\n\nIn fact, the state hosts an annual open house weekend at sugarhouses throughout the state. Many celebrations include activities and family fun along with all the maple you can eat, including the most Vermont way to eat maple \u2014 sugar on snow. This sweet treat is created by drizzling maple syrup heated to 235\u00b0F on fresh snow.\n\nOne particularly great place to taste it is the Green Mountain Audubon Center, which hosts an annual Sugar on Snow Party. Along with sugaring demonstrations, the event also gives visitors a chance to tap a tree and collect sap from a bucket. If you miss the party, the sugarhouse remains open to the public until mid-April.\n\nAnother great maple experience is at the von Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, where visitors can strap on snowshoes in February and March for a Maple Sugaring Tour of its own sugar bushes and sugaring operation \u2014 and wear boots for visits during the rest of the year.\n\nIn Montpelier, visit the Morse Farm Maple Sugarworks, home to one of Vermont\u2019s oldest families, who\u2019ve been tapping trees almost as long as Vermont\u2019s been a state. The farm, sugarhouse included, is open all year and hosts a robust, maple-packed gift shop, as well as a hiking trail through the sugarbush. Other maple stops include winners of the annual Vermont Sugar Makers Awards, including Stewart Maple in Shrewsbury, Goodrich Maple Farm in Cabot, and Green\u2019s Sugarhouse in Poultney.\n\nYou can also dive deep into the history of maple at the New England Maple Museum in Pittsford.\n\nMaple syrup grades are Golden, Amber, Dark, and Very Dark. Photograph by Caleb Kenna, The New York Times/Redux\n\nTo stretch the maple boundaries, check out other businesses that make special uses of Vermont maple. This includes several breweries and distilleries, including Lawson\u2019s Finest Liquids taproom in Waitsfield, which serves the Mad River Maple Ale and Vermont Spirits Distilling Company in Quechee, serving maple-derived Vermont Gold Vodka. Restaurants like Maple Soul in Rochester also regularly work maple into the menu, including in dishes like maple chili wings, maple bourbon apple crisp, and maple brioche.\n\n(Related: How to plan the ultimate road trip through New England)",

            "content": "What do we mean by \"cloud\"? Deployments, servers, subscriptions, mindset. These are all topics that can be examined quite transparently, but \"cloud\" faces the same challenge as other buzzwords: there is no universal definition. As a rule, the definition of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is commonly used.\n\nISO 22123-1\n\nThe German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), on the other hand, follows the ISO standard (see ISO 22123-1). ISO describes the whole thing using the most complex language possible: \"A paradigm for enabling network-based access to a scalable and elastic pool of shared physical or virtual resources according to the principle of self-service and on-demand administration.\u201d\n\nCrucial to the BSI's choice of definition is that cloud computing is described as a \"paradigm\"\u2014in other words, a fundamental way of thinking. This proves helpful, because if we look at the technical fundamentals or deployment models, we see that it is not just a matter of looking at things from a technical perspective, but that mindset also plays a role.\n\nReturning to the cloud, there are several operational levels to discuss. First, there is the delivery model. In the SAP ERP area, we need to decide between private and public cloud. Multi-cloud or hybrid scenarios are also relevant for many companies.\n\nSaaS, IaaS, or PaaS?\n\nOn the other hand, there are service models, mostly on a subscription basis: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which are based on the application, platform, and infrastructure layers of cloud computing. GROW with SAP, for example, is delivered as SaaS in the public cloud, while RISE with SAP combines components from SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS and is, according to SAP, a business transformation-as-a-service.\n\nCloud mindset\n\nThere is one perspective missing from the cloud discourse that I mentioned earlier: the mindset. I once asked Copilot what SAP means when it talks about the cloud\u2014especially in terms of tone and messaging. The answer was: \"Overall, SAP's messaging is positive, forward-looking, and designed to deliver tangible business value, with a focus on security, compliance, and sustainability.\"\n\nBreaking open silos\n\nThe cloud is supposed to unleash our pioneering spirit and take us to new heights. It sounds great, but it also brings with it some very human challenges. When it is necessary to make do with the delivered (but no less efficient) best-practice standard, then change management is necessary. When departments are brought closer together because the cloud breaks down the silos which used to facilitate hiding from difficult discussions, this initially leads to internal resistance. And then it is necessary to find a way to deal with managers' sense of entitlement. They promise the quantum leap through the cloud, but there are twenty years of legacy to work through before they can reach utopia.\n\nFinally, there's just one question left: what does the cloud have to do with meatballs (a movie recommendation, despite the absurd title)?\n\nTo the partner entry:",

            "content": "Send this page to someone via email\n\nWhile the idea of drinking tree sap might sound unusual, Ontario\u2019s maple producers are hoping to turn maple water into the next global must-try beverage.\n\nMany are familiar with the rich sweetness of maple syrup, the thick, amber liquid made by boiling down the sap of maple trees. However, many are unaware that the sap itself can be enjoyed as a refreshing low-sugar drink.\n\nThis beverage, known as maple water, is clear, slightly sweet (containing just two per cent natural sugars), and has been gaining popularity in the Ontario and wider Canadian market.\n\nIn Ontario, where the maple syrup industry thrives, some maple farmers are pioneering a new market.\n\nOne such company is Sap Sucker, founded in 2015 by a passionate Ontario family with deep roots in maple farming.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAlex Argiropoulos, senior business development manager at Sap Sucker, shares the story of its creation, explaining how many maple farmers grew up drinking maple water.\n\n\u201cThe founder, Nancy Chapman, grew up on a small family farm where they would tap trees just for personal use. They drank the sap straight from the bucket before boiling it down into syrup,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd so, when Nancy wanted to start a business, she thought, \u2018We always drink the sap from the bucket before we boil it down. How can we create something from this?'\u201d\n\nThough the idea of selling maple sap as a beverage is not entirely new in Ontario, turning it into a mass-market product comes with significant challenges.\n\nMaple sap is perishable, typically lasting only 48 hours before spoiling, which makes it a hurdle for any producer aiming to bring it to a wide audience. But with the right equipment and a vision for the future, Sap Sucker has been able to make it work.\n\nGet daily National news Get the day's top news, political, economic, and current affairs headlines, delivered to your inbox once a day. Sign up for daily National newsletter Sign Up By providing your email address, you have read and agree to Global News' Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy\n\nSince 2020, companies like theirs have gained traction in Canada and abroad.\n\nSap Sucker\u2019s maple water is now available across Canada and internationally, from France to Japan, thanks to its positioning as a \u201chealthier alternative\u201d to sugary drinks like coconut water. \u201cPeople love the clean, refreshing taste, with no lingering aftertaste like stevia or artificial sweeteners give you,\u201d says Argiropoulos.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMeanwhile, White Meadow Farms in the Niagara region \u2014 a fourth-generation maple syrup farm \u2014 also sees potential in maple water.\n\nAlthough the farm focuses on maple syrup production, Amanda Bering, a partner at White Meadow Farms, says maple water could become a globally enjoyed beverage with increased consumer education.\n\n\u201cOutside of Canada, it is not widely known how maple syrup is made and that it comes from the sap of a maple tree. So I think you would have to educate people if you\u2019re trying to sell it globally on where it comes from, and what it is and what the health benefits of it are,\u201d Bering explains.\n\n\u201cPeople often don\u2019t realize that maple sap is very slightly sweet, with a sugar content between two per cent and four per cent, so it\u2019s not like drinking pop,\u201d she added.\n\nYnez Giancola, vice-president of finance and operations at Sap Sucker, tells Global that the potential for maple water to complement the market and benefit the economy is clear. However, like all new industries, it will take time and investment to scale.\n\n\u201cConsumers don\u2019t necessarily understand what water from a tree is,\u201d Giancola says. However, she believes that companies like Sap Sucker are tapping into a unique niche that other global beverage brands don\u2019t offer.\n\n'The next big thing'\n\nOntario\u2019s maple syrup industry is already thriving \u2014 the province produces some of the best maple syrup in the world, with Ontario accounting for a significant portion of Canada\u2019s maple syrup exports.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cMaple production supports the Ontario economy, the maple industry, and ensures that our supply chain remains entirely Canadian-based,\u201d says Giancola.\n\n\u201cWith everything going on tariff wise, we\u2019re seeing a lot of extra support for Canadian production,\u201d she added.\n\nIn terms of scalability, both Giancola and Argiropoulos are optimistic about the future of maple water.\n\nThey believe that as more people become aware of it, especially in urban centers, the market will continue to expand. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing growth in national retailers. Customers are now looking for these types of natural, organic and healthy products and we fit in there,\u201d says Giancola.\n\nHowever, there are still challenges to overcome. The equipment needed to make maple sap shelf-stable \u2014 through processes like filtration and pasteurization \u2014 comes with a high initial cost. \u201cFor maple farmers, it\u2019s a large upfront investment,\u201d says Argiropoulos.\n\nWhile the future of maple water is still brewing, Ontario has a central role to play in the growth of the industry.\n\nWith a rich national history of maple syrup production and a fresh twist on an old tradition, Ontario\u2019s maple water could one day become a staple beverage choice in many households.\n\nWhether or not maple water can rival coconut water\u2019s global popularity is yet to be discovered.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHowever, with local producers like Sap Sucker and White Meadow Farms optimistic about innovative products and the support of an increasing number of Ontario-based farmers, it\u2019s clear that the maple water trend is only just beginning.\n\n\u201cIt could be the next big thing,\u201d said Bering.",

Likewise, a study by Grand View Research indicates the global artificial intelligence market is poised to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 36.6% to $1.81 trillion between 2024 and 2030.\n\nBreakthrough innovations, bullish investments, and increasing adoption across industries are catalysts fueling robust growth. Furthermore, the progress made in artificial neural networks (ANN) has dramatically enhanced the integration and utilization of artificial intelligence across various industries.\n\nThe diverse applications of ANNs, such as image recognition, natural language processing, predictive modeling, autonomous driving, and healthcare diagnostics, have been driving market expansion. For example, auto companies are employing ANN to refine autonomous driving functionalities, focusing on object detection, path planning, and decision-making processes.\n\nThe growing accessibility and availability of historical datasets have also accelerated the pace of advancements in artificial intelligence. Now, more unstructured datasets are available to researchers thanks to the development of cloud computing. Furthermore, as AI advances with each iteration, innovation has been spurred by the potential of next-generation computing power.\n\nAmid the robust growth and game-changing innovations, artificial intelligence has become a key technology battleground between the US and China. The emergence of breathtaking AI models from China, such as DeepSeek, has once again underscored how nations are racing to challenge the US regarding AI dominance.\n\nThe enduring geopolitical rivalry and economic competition between China and the United States began to extend into artificial intelligence approximately ten years ago. However, this competition has significantly escalated with the swift rise of DeepSeek and other Chinese generative AI companies. The recent achievements of these Chinese firms have also prompted inquiries regarding the efficacy of strategies like export controls in curbing the technological advancements of foreign adversaries.",

What we need to infuse in the lineup, those players would be available. Along the way, we tried to look at this season and to not give up in any way.\u201d\n\nThe Islanders (29-26-7), who have won two straight and four of five, seem shell-shocked to start without Nelson, giving up 17 of the game\u2019s first 18 shots before Anthony Duclair\u2019s power-play goal made it 1-0 at 10:43 of the first period. Ilya Sorokin made 20 of his 38 saves in the first period as Jean-Gabriel Pageau made it 2-0 at 19:21.\n\nThe Islanders last played on Tuesday and coach Patrick Roy acknowledged the mental adjustment to playing without Nelson played a part in the early sluggishness and lack of physicality.\n\n\u201cWe expected a slow start,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe needed to be stronger on our battles. We had too many turnovers. And with the news as well, it\u2019s all in play.\u201d\n\nIn the third period, defenseman Adam Boqvist added a second power-play goal and Anders Lee also scored.\n\nAlexandar Georgiev made 24 stops for the Sharks (17-39-9).\n\nNewsday reported there was interest around the NHL in Lee and Pageau, with the Hurricanes believed to have made a strong push for Pageau.\n\nLamoriello did confirm he is actively trying to re-sign pending unrestricted free agent Kyle Palmieri. The belief is the extension would be for either two or three seasons with an annual average value just slightly less than his current $5 million salary-cap hit.\n\n\u201cWe would have liked to have kept Brock,\u201d Lamoriello said. \u201cI won\u2019t apologize for that. We made an offer we felt was fair.\u201d\n\nLamoriello said acquiring Ritchie was important to the Islanders. He said Ritchie, 20, completing his final junior season in the Ontario Hockey League, will not have this season burned on his entry-level contract by joining the Islanders but will attend development camp and training camp in September.\n\nLamoriello also added he did not believe goalie Semyon Varlamov (lower body/long-term injured reserve) would play again this season and was not sure Mathew Barzal (lower body/LTIR) could return before the end of the regular season.\u201d\n\nNotes & quotes: Pageau added two assists, giving him 200 for his career \u2026 Defenseman Scott Mayfield was a healthy scratch for the fourth time in six games \u2026 Forward Matt Martin (lower body) was activated off injured reserve in addition to defenseman Mike Reilly, who had been on long-term injured reserve with a heart condition \u2026 Goalie Marcus Hogberg (upper body/IR), out since Jan. 25, fully participated in the morning skate, his second straight practice with the team. He could be activated for Sunday night\u2019s game against the Ducks.",

But is it another SAP product rebrand or is SAP serious about creating an open data ecosystem, leaving behind the legacy of data conservatism?\n\nSAP\u2019s rapid innovation and expansion of its portfolio require a thorough understanding of each product\u2019s role in business. Data professionals face steep learning curves, making it crucial to position each SAP analytics product within the broader ecosystem.\n\nThe Shift to SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC)\n\nWe discussed in an earlier blog the challenges in extracting business data from SAP ERP systems to non-SAP cloud data platforms. SAP initially pursued an open data ecosystem through partnerships with Databricks, Collibra, DataRobot, and Confluence an year ago. While promising, scepticism remained, especially after SAP\u2019s attempt to create its own large language models.\n\nSAP Business Data Cloud (BDC) signifies a shift from this legacy mindset by unifying SAP ERP and third-party data for a single source of truth, enabling AI-driven decisions.\n\nKey Features of SAP Business Data Cloud\n\nInsight Apps: Pre-built SAP content, including Datasphere models and SAC story visualizations, managed by SAP.\n\nFoundation Services & Data Products: SAP delivers operational data as reusable packages for business scenarios.\n\nRole of Datasphere & SAC: Datasphere acts as a semantic layer, while SAC provides visualization for Insight Apps.\n\nBW to BDC Migration: Hybrid migration paths exist for BW customers using BW/4HANA PCE.\n\nDatabricks & Delta Sharing: SAP enables zero-copy delta sharing, allowing ML notebooks within the SAP environment.\n\nBDC was released with controlled availability on February 13, 2025, without Databricks integration. Full availability, including Databricks, is expected by April 2025 in additional AWS data centers.\n\nComponents & Business Benefits\n\nBDC comprises six core components:\n\nFoundation Services: Hosts Data Products for business scenarios.\n\nBDC Cockpit: Central UI for administrators.\n\nDatasphere: Data platform using knowledge graphs to power AI.\n\nSAC: Provides out-of-the-box business stories for critical functions.\n\nSAP Databricks: Facilitates data sharing between SAP and non-SAP Databricks environments.\n\nBW on Private Cloud Edition: Supports legacy BW customers.\n\nSource : SAP learning\n\nImplications for SAP BW Customers\n\nBDC offers a transition path rather than an outright replacement for BW, focusing on:\n\nExtended Data Integration: Connecting BW models with SAP Datasphere and third-party data sources.\n\nGradual Evolution: SAP acknowledges existing BW investments, allowing a hybrid transition.\n\nBusiness Semantic Layer: Simplifies data accessibility and AI-driven insights.\n\nHybrid Transition Path: Enables staged adoption of Datasphere.\n\nBW Roadmap: SAP BW/4HANA remains supported, but innovation shifts to Datasphere & BDC.\n\nRecommendations for BW Customers:\n\nAssess BDC and Datasphere for hybrid use cases.\n\nUse semantic federation instead of full migration.\n\nPlan a gradual transition while maintaining BW logic.\n\nExplore AI-driven insights through BDC.\n\nImplications for SAP Datasphere & SAC Customers\n\nBDC can function without Datasphere but maintains its relevance in two scenarios:\n\nOut-of-the-Box Scenario: Datasphere acts as a semantic layer for Foundation Services.\n\nCustom Scenario: Allows businesses to create custom models combining SAP and third-party data.\n\nSAP Analytics Cloud remains the visualization layer, handling reporting and planning. A migration path to BDC exists but seamless integration is part of SAP\u2019s future roadmap. BDC currently targets new customers.\n\nSource : SAP learning\n\nRole of Databricks in BDC\n\nSAP Databricks within BDC offers limited functionality, focusing on:\n\nZero-copy delta sharing for Data Products.\n\nfor Data Products. ML notebook execution within SAP\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nSource : SAP learning\n\nIntegration with Joule AI Agents\n\nBDC enables Joule AI agents by grounding them in business context via knowledge graph-powered Data Models.\n\nSource: SAP learning\n\nBDC Pricing Model\n\nBDC pricing is based on Capacity Units (CUs). Minimum capacity units is 966.\n\nSAC Public Cloud Edition (PCE) will be moved out of CPEA/BTPEA license and will move from user-based licenses to capacity units-based pricing. Minimum BDC capacity units will equate to a SAC Public tenant capacity units (966) of 25 BI user licenses. Standalone SAC SKUs will gradually be offset as BDC data centers and migration tools become available in H2 2025 and beyond.\n\nwill be moved out of CPEA/BTPEA license and will move from user-based licenses to capacity units-based pricing. Minimum BDC capacity units will equate to a SAC Public tenant capacity units (966) of 25 BI user licenses.

Existing customers can continue using their current licensing model until renewal, after which restructuring may be required.\n\nConclusion\n\nSAP Business Data Cloud aims to unify SAP ERP, big data, and analytics. Its integration with Datasphere, SAC, and Databricks provides a comprehensive data solution, though challenges remain in ensuring seamless single-sign-on and end-to-end authorizations. Time will determine how well these integrations deliver value to businesses globally.",

            "content": "When he started tapping trees for the 2025 sugaring season, Paul Zononi of Paul\u2019s Sugar House in Williamsburg was shocked to find that the sap came at a trickle \u2014 and with only half of its typical sugar content.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this over 50 years and I can\u2019t remember another time I\u2019ve seen this,\u201d said Zononi, a first-generation sugar maker who has been making maple syrup since he was 8 years old.\n\nHis current operation has about 3,300 taps, which typically produces around 1,400 gallons of syrup a year. But this year, things have been off to a strange start.\n\nUsually, it takes about 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of syrup, and that sap has a sugar content of roughly 2%. But recently, Zononi has been seeing sugar contents closer to 1%, meaning it takes double the amount of sap \u2014 about 80 gallons \u2014 to make just 1 gallon of syrup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s double the labor, double the time, double the sap for the same amount of syrup,\u201d he said.\n\nNot only that, but Zononi\u2019s sap has been running slower than usual, and because some of his trees look particularly unhealthy this year, he isn\u2019t even tapping all of them.\n\nZononi isn\u2019t the only one who has seen some different trends in his sap this year. Chip Williams of Williams Farm Sugarhouse in Deerfield said the season has gotten off to a slow start. Throughout February, trees were not producing as much sap and the sap that was produced had half the sugar content needed. Sugar content has risen to where it needs to be in recent days, but the Deerfield sugarhouse lost about a month of production time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that we have a good month of March,\u201d Williams said on Friday. \u201cIn years past we\u2019ve made over half our stock in February. We didn\u2019t do that this year so we\u2019re going to need a strong March.\u201d\n\nWilliams said you can never predict how a season will go, and in a good season Williams Farm Sugarhouse can produce between 1,000 and 1,600 gallons of syrup. They typically begin tapping trees in January, but this year they have not collected enough sap until recently and are behind on production.\n\n\u201cWe boiled last weekend, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSteve\u2019s Sugar Shack in Westhampton and North Hadley Sugar Shack in Hadley have seen the change as well \u2014 a slower flow of sap and about a 1% sugar content compared to the more typical 2% sugar content.\n\nSteve Holt of Steve\u2019s Sugar Shack said that, while it varies from year to year, he had produced 161 gallons of syrup by this time last year, and has produced just 24 gallons this year.\n\nWhile the restaurant side of Holt\u2019s business has still been booming, he said more syrup will be needed, because his customers go through 8 gallons of syrup each week even though the restaurant is only open two days per week.\n\nHolt said he assumes the recent drought conditions in the region have something to do with this change in sap trends. He noted that this year, the leaves \u201cturned brown and fell off early.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trees basically shut down early,\u201d he said, meaning they had less time to photosynthesize and make sugar.\n\nZononi also has a few theories as to why his sap harvest might be struggling this year, and they have to do with changing weather patterns. Namely, rain early in the season and pervasive drought conditions may have impacted the health of his trees and the amount of time they had to photosynthesize and create syrup. This pattern of weather may also be the culprit for a fungus that appeared on the leaves, giving them a spotty appearance and limiting the amount of green surface area where the leaves could take in sunlight for photosynthesis.\n\nZononi also noted the unpredictable temperatures that have been at play this winter. For a good syrup season, sap has to freeze at night and thaw completely in the morning for optimal flow. But with some of the warm spells and cold snaps that have touched the region on and off for months, Zononi said that cycle may have been disturbed, and he believes the ground and the trees might still be a bit too cold for a good sap flow.\n\nHolt has a similar theory for what has been at work in his own trees.\n\n\u201cThat freeze-thaw cycle hasn\u2019t been happening continuously, so sap hasn\u2019t been flowing as well,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhile this year has been different so far, Howard Boyden of Boyden Brothers Maple, a fourth-generation maple sugaring business in Conway, is not too worried. Rather, he sees this year\u2019s weather patterns as a return to \u201ca traditional New England winter,\u201d and a more traditional sap harvesting season, which he said used to have an early March start and run through about mid-April.\n\n\u201cWe got off to a late start in comparison to the past few years, but throughout my lifetime we\u2019ve historically started the season in March,\u201d Boyden said.\n\nBoyden said he does not think droughts have had much impact. In Franklin County, the only major drought that occurred was in the late summer. He said the trees he\u2019s seen look healthy and he believes the challenging start to the season has been a result of changing weather patterns. This year, however, freezing conditions remained.\n\n\u201cWe need the warm days and the cold nights to get the sap to flow,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis year was much more of a typical winter. We tapped mid-February and didn\u2019t get much sap till recently. I think the trees are still frozen.\u201d\n\nWith the freezing weather, production started slowly, but has begun to pick up in the past few days. Boyden said so far he has produced 150 gallons of syrup in Conway. Boyden Brothers Maple typically produces 1,000 gallons of syrup each sugaring season.\n\n\u201cThe sap is flowing now and we\u2019re doing good,\u201d Boyden said. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll reach that (1,000 gallon average) as long as the right weather conditions remain.\u201d\n\nWilliams said he is hopeful the weather cooperates and they are able to recover from the slow start.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a slower start, but it\u2019s been warm the past few days,\u201d Williams said.\n\nZononi also reported that sugar contents have begun to rise in the sap harvests as of Thursday.\n\nBoyden added that this weekend is Massachusetts Maple Weekend, and despite the slow start to the season, sugarhouses across the state will be open to visitors and showing off how they make their maple products.\n\n\u201cIf you drive around and see smoke and people around a sugarhouse,\u201d Boyden advised, \u201cpop in and get a tour and a sample.\u201d\n\nAlexa Lewis can be reached at alewis@gazettenet.com.

            "content": "YOUNGSTOWN \u2014 Usually a labor of love, this year\u2019s maple syrup-making is proving to be a challenge as Mother Nature has thrown local tappers John Slanina and Jerad Sutton a curveball.\n\nSlanina, a member of the Rocky Ridge Neighborhood Association based in Youngstown, and Sutton, owner of Sutton\u2019s Maple Syrup in Southington, are both feeling the sting of an unpredictable tapping season. Unusual weather patterns have made this year\u2019s harvest particularly challenging.\n\n\u201cOur worst year ever was last year, and actually, this year is shaping up to maybe be our new worst year ever,\u201d said Slanina, who helps run a community-based maple syrup operation in Mill Creek Park. \u201cIt just comes down to the trees and the weather. We\u2019re entirely weather-dependent.\u201d\n\nSlanina\u2019s group, a nonprofit that uses syrup sales to fund community development projects, typically produces about 400 bottles of syrup annually. But last year, members managed only 70 bottles, and this year\u2019s output is trending similarly. The ideal conditions for tapping, which are freezing nights followed by above-freezing days, have been elusive.\n\n\u201cSometimes we tap too early, and everything freezes. Last year, we tapped too late and missed the beginning of the season,\u201d Slanina said. \u201cIf it\u2019s too hot for too many days, the trees start to bud, and they dry up. It\u2019s all about timing, and this year, the weather just hasn\u2019t cooperated.\u201d\n\nThe process of tapping trees is no small feat. Slanina\u2019s team drills 2-inch holes into sugar maples, inserts spiles (small tubes that act like straws), and hangs bags to collect the sap. Volunteers then gather the sap daily, hauling it to a sugar shack where it\u2019s boiled down into syrup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ton of hard labor, especially when you\u2019re relying on volunteers,\u201d Slanina said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a lot of fun. It brings the community together, and there\u2019s something magical about turning sap into syrup.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sutton, a fourth-generation syrup maker, is also grappling with the whims of the weather. His operation, which taps nearly 1,500 trees, relies on a delicate balance of cold nights and warm days to get the sap flowing.\n\n\u201cThis year was a little later than usual,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cIn previous years, we were making syrup sooner. But you adjust to what the weather gives you and make the most of it.\u201d\n\nSutton\u2019s family-run business uses a network of tubing to collect sap from hard and soft maple trees, which is then processed using reverse osmosis and evaporators to create the final product. Despite the challenges, Sutton remains optimistic, aiming to produce between 700 and 800 gallons of syrup this season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had days where we\u2019ve made 80 gallons, and other days where we\u2019ve made 150,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the weather and how the trees are running.\u201d\n\nThe process requires hard work and dedication to turn sap into syrup. For Slanina\u2019s volunteer-driven operation, it\u2019s a community effort that brings neighbors together. For Sutton, it\u2019s a family tradition that now includes his children, the fifth generation to join the business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see that they\u2019re interested in it,\u201d Sutton said of his kids. \u201cThey\u2019ll decide if they want to continue at this level or scale back, but either way, I hope they stay involved in maple.\u201d\n\nDespite the hurdles, both Slanina and Sutton agree on one thing: There\u2019s nothing quite like the taste of real maple syrup.\n\n\u201cYour average person probably has no idea what real maple syrup is,\u201d Slanina said. \u201cThey go buy the store stuff, and it\u2019s just corn syrup. I always tell people to find a local producer and give the real thing a try.\u201d\n\nAs this year\u2019s season winds down, both tappers are already looking ahead to next year, hoping for more favorable conditions, and maybe a sweeter harvest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ton of hard work,\u201d Slanina said. \u201cBut when you get that final product, it\u2019s all worth it.\u201d\n\nFor now, they\u2019ll keep tapping, boiling, and bottling, proving that even in the face of unpredictable weather, the maple syrup tradition runs deep.",

Women\u2019s entrepreneurship is growing, with 38 percent of micro, small, and midsize enterprises being women-owned and 10 million women-owned businesses operating in developing countries.\n\nOne of SAP\u2019s industry-leading, strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR) focus areas is powering equitable access to economic opportunity and employment, in alignment with our vision of helping the world run better and improving people\u2019s lives.\n\nThrough our immersive and virtual pro bono consulting programs, SAP employees collaborate with hundreds of impact-driven businesses that are putting people and planet first. Many of these businesses are inspiring women-founded and led enterprises that create long-term, sustainable impact for their communities by directly empowering economic opportunities and employment for many. This has a ripple effect, as it not only directly benefits the impact business or individuals, but it also can lead to poverty alleviation, higher income potential, and stable living environments for those individuals, their families, and the communities they live in and contribute back to.\n\nBy sharing their experience and expertise with these impact businesses, our employees can deliver on the promise of our CSR strategy while growing in their leadership competencies and driving positive change for future generations.\n\nSAP Social Sabbatical is one of our flagship pro bono consulting programs that enables employees to share their knowledge and skills with impact businesses across the globe. Created in partnership with our long-time strategic partner Pyxera Global, employees are placed on highly diverse teams and dedicate their professional expertise during a unique, immersive one-month assignment solving concrete strategic challenges for client organizations.\n\nIn 2023, one of the program\u2019s assignments was in Jakarta, Indonesia, and partnered with an impact business called TORAJAMELO. TORAJAMELO is a slow fashion brand addressing the issue of migration from rural communities, particularly for women, and supporting job creation in these communities. They focus on reviving rural economies with sustainable weaving, creating an ecosystem for more than 1,200 women weavers that improves their ability to self-support through financial stability and connect back to their culture, while also promoting sustainable fashion.\n\nIn partnership with TORAJAMELO, the SAP team drove research and development of a lifestyle rating system for their online fashion cooperative, with recommendations for brand recognition and a dedicated sales channel for artisanal products. Their work supported TORAJAMELO\u2019s long-term social and environmental impact for their customers and beneficiaries, and greatly impacted the employee consultants themselves, personally and professionally.\n\nFor SAP participant Bibiana Becker, the sabbatical reinforced many of her existing worldviews: \u201cThe world is interconnected, and we need to help each other and provide those who lack it with access to education and sustainability knowledge. The women who lead TORAJAMELO are strong, resilient, and hard-working. TORAJAMELO is saving lives.\u201d\n\nOne of these women, TORAJAMELO CEO Aparna Bhatnagar Saxena, shares why doing work that directly impacts the lives of women is so meaningful.\n\n\u201cI am able to work directly on the economic enablement of women, minimizing negative damage on the environment and focusing on revamping our education systems,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a firm believer for a fairer and more prosperous world. Women belong in all decision-making areas of work and life, and all they need is exposure and a platform to develop their skills and capture the opportunities.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if there were any unexpected benefits of working with her SAP pro bono team, Aparna shared, \u201cWe found champions who cared about what we are doing.\u201d\n\nThe opportunity to work with TORAJAMELO opened a wider worldly perspective for the SAP team. Sergio Pascual Logarzo noted how his experience working with them personally and professionally impacted him.\n\n\u201cTheir dedication and commitment to advancing this cause has been a source of daily inspiration,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cBy working with people of different backgrounds, both SAP colleagues and external stakeholders, I gained a new perspective on cultural and social dynamics, learning to see solutions from a more inclusive angle.\u201d\n\nAnother incredible women-led organization that SAP pro bono consultants partnered with last year, among others, was the host organization, Maide Mutfak, in Istanbul, Turkey. Maide is a kitchen incubator that provides both access to production facilities and business consulting, and catering services that emphasize sustainability and inclusivity. The organization empowers local food entrepreneurs and reduces their costs while providing employment and development opportunities to nearby disadvantaged communities, including many women facing socio-economic challenges.\n\nThe SAP team built a strategic business plan for Maide, including a powerful messaging framework and business development road maps.\n\nReflecting on her experience working alongside Maide and the new skills she now brings to her daily work, SAP participant Charmel Bence shared, \u201cOur host client was very welcoming and appreciated every effort we made to understand their business and their challenges. It was very humbling to get to know them and witness their passion, commitment, and perseverance to succeed. Working with Maide has affirmed the need to first seek to understand. Take time to actively listen and walk in their shoes.\u201d\n\nPro bono consulting at SAP is truly an innovation exchange, with the impact businesses adopting new ways of tackling their challenges as they scale and make an even greater impact, and SAP employees being exposed to sustainable business models and bringing new or expanded ways of thinking to their teams at SAP.\n\n\u201cThis experience deeply reinforced my belief in the importance of equitable inclusion while expanding my understanding of the challenges faced by under-resourced food entrepreneurs,\u201d shared SAP participant Danielle Zhang. \u201cSeeing firsthand the systemic barriers they encounter \u2014 whether access to funding, industry knowledge, or market opportunities \u2014 has made me even more aware of the critical role we play in leveling the playing field. True inclusion isn\u2019t just about providing resources, it\u2019s about creating an ecosystem of support, mentorship, and community that empowers diverse entrepreneurs to thrive.\u201d\n\nCollaboration with impact businesses, including those that are women-founded and led, and those that directly support women through pro bono consulting underscores the power of the collective, and the multiplier effect of impact. Working together, corporations and impact businesses are both made stronger through the reciprocal sharing of skills and talents and the shared safety to step outside of comfort zones and gain new perspectives.\n\nWith over 11 million impact businesses operating worldwide, this exchange brings business value back to SAP and scales the important work of these organizations, driving further economic and employment opportunity out to the communities they serve.\n\nAs we celebrate International Women\u2019s Day, the experiences from employees and the inspirational host clients they worked with are a reminder of the extraordinary achievements of women worldwide and the importance of continued efforts to empower their endeavors. These initiatives represent another undeniable way that SAP is helping the world run better and improving people\u2019s lives, one community at a time.\n\nJulia Donovan is program manager of SAP Social Sabbatical for SAP CSR at SAP.",

We'll have much more evening light as we break free, albeit slowly, from the icy grasp of winter.\n\nNow, let's get stuck in some news:\n\nLet it flow: Sticky, sweet sap begins to flow from Massachusetts' maple trees as early as January. But, as Gov. Maura Healey declared, \"Maple Month\" doesn't occur until March. It's around this time of year local sugarmakers begin to boil down their sap supplies into maple syrup and other goodies. And this Saturday and Sunday, you can catch a sugar rush during the state's \"Maple Weekend.\"\n\nThe deets: You can find a sugarhouse near you that produces maple syrup (or maple candy or maple cream or other treats) using this map from the Massachusetts Maple Producers Association. When you visit, you'll learn how maple syrup is made and can try some freshly made products. (Fun fact: Massachusetts sugarmakers produce more than 50,000 gallons of maple syrup annually.)\n\nIt's all in the weather: Sugarmakers produce maple syrup in March due to the month's up-and-down temperatures. \"For the sap to flow in the trees, you want cool nights and warm days,\" Winton Pitcoff, deputy commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, told WBUR's Amy Sokolow. The freezing cold of January and February was not optimal for sap harvesting. Pitcoff says daytime temperatures around 40 degrees are ideal to thaw out the trees and ground. \"That's when the sap starts to run,\" he added.\n\nTry this: Maple syrup can be used on more than just pancakes! These five recipes from Here & Now resident chef Kathy Gunst are a good place to start, if you want to make the most out of your maple syrup haul this weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell is asking her boss for something many of us want: A bigger budget. WBUR's Walter Wuthmann reports that she's requesting a nearly 7% increase as her office takes on more cases against the Trump administration. Right now, the state is part of more than a half-dozen federal lawsuits.\n\nHer case: Campbell is citing her track record so far, having successfully sued the administration over frozen federal funds and the attempted end of birthright citizenship. She also says her office brings in more money than it spends, recouping about $11 for every dollar spent.\n\nThe bigger picture: While Trump claims his administration's efforts are to weed out waste, fraud and abuse, Campbell thinks he's threatening the rights of people in Massachusetts \u2014 and that he won't stop anytime soon. \"When the president tries to use fear, which seems to be his main instrument of power right now, we will not be afraid. And we must, and I tell my team every day, respond,\" Campbell said.\n\nNo, the sky isn't falling: The MBTA is investigating what caused a ceiling panel to come tumbling down at Cambridge's Harvard Station yesterday morning. (If this sounds familiar, that's because the same thing happened just two years ago \u2014 on the same platform.) According to the T, no one was injured, and the collapse did not affect Red Line service, but the panel did show signs of corrosion.\n\nWhat this means for commuters: Harvard Station is fully open to Red Line riders, except for the area where the panel fell. T staff worked overnight to remove other panels like it.\n\nTracking turtles: Researchers from the New England Aquarium are gaining new insight into the lives of loggerhead sea turtles. That's thanks to trackers that were implanted into cold-stunned loggerheads that washed up in local waters.\n\nEach year, aquarium staff treat and release sea turtles stunned by cold temperatures or suffering from boat strike injuries. Recent data show the vast majority of those turtles responded well to treatment and lived many more years as a result. With the trackers, \"we can continue to build the picture of what sea turtles are doing in New England when they're here, where they are exactly,\" Charles Innis, a veterinarian at the aquarium, told WBUR. He hopes it will help NEAQ advocate for legal protections for the turtles in the future.\n\nP.S. \u2014 True or false? Allergy season in Boston has become shorter than it was in the 1970s.

            "content": "Just as the red-hot data-cloud party hosted by SAP and Databricks is heating up, Databricks competitor Snowflake is planning to crash the event by forging its own data-centric partnership with SAP.\n\nWhile some traditionalists might consider such intentions to be tacky or even rude, the truth is that this new trend toward what we can comfortably call partnership promiscuity is becoming an essential strategy in the Cloud Wars here in the early days of the AI Revolution.\n\nBecause why? Because businesses in every industry are betting their futures on AI, but they\u2019ll never cash in unless they can fuel their AI ambitions with world-class data.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nWith its enterprise applications running core operations for many of the world\u2019s largest corporations, SAP has huge volumes of incredibly valuable data. And by forging a recent partnership with Databricks, SAP is making all that data much easier for customers to access and use via the new SAP Business Data Cloud. For more on that, please see my recent analyses:\n\nIn that context, Snowflake\u2019s intentions to get in on the fun with SAP makes perfect sense. And while the partnership has not been disclosed officially, here\u2019s what Snowflake executive vice-president Christian Kleinerman had to say about it on the company\u2019s recent fiscal-Q4 earnings call:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always done bidirectional types of sharing and data movement with a number of partners. While we don\u2019t have a specific announcement to share re SAP today, I can tell you that we are working with SAP,\u201d Kleinerman said.\n\n\u201cWe like what they\u2019re doing with their new Business Data Cloud product, and we have a common commitment to foster an open data environment, and hope to share more with all of you soon.\u201d\n\nThose comments from Kleinerman came during Snowflake\u2019s very impressive Q4 earnings call as it reported product revenue up 30% and projected strong growth throughout its fiscal year ending January 31, with the pace of growth accelerating in the second half as the company expects to generate $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nI think this is a great move by Snowflake, and a great move by SAP. While Databricks might prefer to be SAP\u2019s sole top-level data-engineering partner, Databricks gained enormous visibility and additional credibility by being SAP\u2019s showcase partner for the Business Data Cloud launch, in which SAP CEO Christian Klein played a major part.\n\nPlus, as capable as Databricks is, SAP has massive ambitions in the world of data and AI, so it certainly behooves not only SAP but also its customers for SAP to align itself with a handful of outstanding data-cloud and data-engineering specialists such as Databricks and sometime soon Snowflake and then perhaps \u2014 probably \u2014 others.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. The company\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits.\n\n\n\nThe Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $29.50-$30 band in 2025. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividend payments.\n\n\n\nHowever, declining membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. We expect medical costs to jump over 14% YoY in 2025. A debt-laden balance sheet induces an increase in interest expenses.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of SAP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+48% vs. +2.6%).

Continued strength in the Cloud ERP Suite sales is driving its cloud revenues.\n\n\n\nSteady growth in Cloud backlog at the end of 2024 is an encouraging development.

The surge in hybrid adoption is driving the company\u2019s sales, supported by strategic initiatives to accelerate growth and enhance profitability.\n\n\n\nToyota Motor is working to restore production to normal levels. While prioritizing hybrids, Toyota remains committed to the BEV market, with plans to introduce solid-state batteries that promise extended range and lower production costs. Investor-friendly moves further bolster optimism.\n\n\n\nHowever, significant investments in human capital and expansion initiatives are expected to weigh on operating profits this fiscal year. Elevated R&D expenditures on advanced technologies and alternative fuels support long-term innovation but may constrain near-term margins. Rising debt levels also pose financial challenges. The stock warrants a cautious stance now.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota Motor here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Better Choice have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-75% vs. -8.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $3.29 million is dependent on Asia-Pacific, which exposes the company to regulatory, economic, and competitive risks, while liquidity concerns persist despite recent capital raises. Elevated costs for marketing and supply chain improvements remain a challenge.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Better Choice delivered its first profitable quarter in Q3 2024 with adjusted EBITDA of over $0.2 million and gross margins reaching 40%, driven by operational efficiencies and inventory reductions. Strong supply chain performance (97% fill rates) positions the company for sustained growth.\n\n\n\nAsia-Pacific remains a key driver, fueled by China\u2019s doubling pet ownership trends and demand for premium brands like Halo. The SRx Health acquisition adds scale and enables entry into veterinary pharmaceuticals, enhancing diversification. Digital sales gained momentum, with double-digit subscription growth and a 20% rise in repeat purchases.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Better Choice here >>>)",

With SAP Business Technology Platform and Business Data Cloud as well as the Hana database platform at its side, S/4 can become a productive part of a composable ERP if the clean core concept is implemented stringently and efficiently.\n\nSAP Clean Core could become the seal of quality for S/4 Hana\n\nThe SAP community should set up a \"clean core deal\" because this concept can become a roadmap to an S/4 successor - i.e. a composable ERP. ERP needs a strategy for the coming years. The triumvirate of BTP, BDC and Hana can provide a basis for SAP applications. But the world of applications among IT users is more heterogeneous and agile. In order for an ERP from SAP to find its way in the new IT world, it must implement the clean core concept. This paves the way for interoperability and orchestration with other platforms, AI apps and data tools.\n\nThe Clean Core Deal aims to bring the black box SAP back into the megatrends of the IT industry and thus make SAP systems more compatible for open source, AI and data management. SAP has already taken the first steps, but it is also clear that efforts such as the Business Data Cloud may be a step in the right direction, but they fall far too short, are too hesitant and offer no added value compared to competitors' products.\n\nPlatform architecture with BTP and BDC\n\nThe entire IT industry has entered into a deal; Platform Economy! SAP has a long tradition with platforms, has gained a lot of experience, but has not always had success on its side. The starting signal was probably SAP NetWeaver, followed by many other attempts up to BTP and BDC.\n\nWhere is Hana? At the Steampunk and BTP Summit 2025, the Hana database platform was repeatedly mentioned and praised. This platform is currently barely mentioned in SAP's language. However, the triumvirate of BTP, BDC and Hana can also be a good starting point for existing ECC systems. Numerous existing SAP customers with SAP Business Suite 7 use SAP BTP for proof-of-concepts in the areas of AI and data management.\n\nLack of information and concepts in the SAP community\n\nThe SAP community currently seems to value the design and strategy of platforms more highly than a technical release change to S/4. Platform architectures form the starting point for the Composable Enterprise. In retrospect, S/4 could prove to be an unnecessary intermediate step in the future.\n\nA key driver for a composable ERP based on SAP and non-SAP platforms would be the \"clean core deal\". However, it is failing due to the information and education work and the lack of concept at SAP itself. Only hesitantly is an educational program for existing SAP customers and partners being developed to help them understand the implications of Clean Core, BTP and BDC. SAP still has a long way to go in communicating the knowledge and power of platforms and Clean Core.",

            "content": "Maple trees are the sweet gifts of spring\n\nMaple syrup making time has just about arrived in our area. Maple syrup makers make preparations well in advance in order to be ready for this hectic time of year.\n\nWeather conditions need to be just right for maple sap to flow with above freezing temperatures during the day and below freezing at night. That can happen any time between February through March.\n\nThere is something really extra special about a breakfast of homemade pancakes or French toast topped with real maple syrup. Real maple syrup has not only sweetness and natural flavor but it also has all of the minerals and other nutrient compounds a tree needs to grow and thrive. Those minerals and nutrients are the same ones people require for good health.\n\nIt all starts with finding the right maple trees.\n\nWhile all maple tree species produce sap, sugar maples have the absolute best quality sap with the highest sugar content and is the one syrup makers always choose first. It takes about 40 gallons of sugar maple sap to produce 1 gallon of syrup, or about 10 gallons to produce a quart.\n\nRed maple also makes great syrup, however because it contains more water, it takes much more sap to produce that same 1 gallon of syrup, somewhere in the 60 to 80 gallon range. That\u2019s a huge difference in the amount of energy it takes to remove that larger percentage of water.\n\nLarger maple syrup producers are solving that problem by adopting modern technology such as reverse osmosis to help them get a head start on the syrup making process. That means the amount of water in the sap is not as critical as it once was since they can now remove a lot of the water before they even begin to boil the sap.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how to tell the difference between sugar maple and red maple trees during the winter, take a close look at their twigs and buds.\n\nSugar maple twigs are gray, and their buds have a sharp, pointy shape. Red maple twigs are red toward the end and their buds are rounded at the tip.\n\nTrees must reach a certain size before they are ready to tap, no smaller than 10-12 inches in diameter at chest height. Syrup makers usually use one tap for trees 12 to 18 inches in diameter, two taps for 19 to 25 inches and for larger trees, three taps.\n\nWhile it can vary widely from year to year, on average each tap will produce around 10-15 gallons of sap through the course of the sap run.\n\nAfter a few weeks when the warmer weather arrives, the buds begin to open and sap collection stops. At that time the sap flavor gets \u201cbuddy\u201d and is no longer suitable for making syrup.\n\nAs the tiny leaves and flowers emerge from the buds, it signals spring is on its way.\n\nbdluzen@detroitnews.com.",

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. If SAP doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On SAP's Profit Performance\n\nUnusual items (expenses) detracted from SAP's earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that SAP's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for SAP and you'll want to know about it.\n\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of SAP's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

            "content": "\n\nA Changing Market for SAP Talent\n\nSAP consulting has long been an attractive career path, offering high salaries, and the opportunity to work on complex projects across industries. However, a growing number of SAP professionals are opting for freelance or independent contract work instead of remaining in full-time employment with consulting firms.\n\nOrganizations running SAP systems are experiencing a severe shortage of qualified professionals, and many are increasingly turning to external contractors to meet their project demands.\n\nAt the same time, SAP consultants are rethinking their priorities, with many deciding that working independently offers advantages that outweigh the security of traditional employment.\n\nIn this article IgniteSAP explores why this shift is occurring, the factors drawing consultants toward freelancing, and the ways for consulting firms to retain their top professionals.\n\n\n\nThe Rising Demand for Independent SAP Consultants\n\nOrganizations across finance, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and public services are now reliant on SAP\u2019s ERP solutions to manage business processes, but talent shortages are making it increasingly difficult for companies to find skilled SAP professionals.\n\nAccording to a recent SAP Insider report, the ongoing migration to SAP S/4HANA, combined with the increasing adoption of SAP BTP and cloud-based ERP, has intensified demand for experienced consultants.\n\nThe demand-to-supply gap has driven salaries and contract rates higher, making independent consulting more financially attractive, especially for mid-career and senior-level consultants with specialized skills in SAP finance (FICO), supply chain (SCM), HR (SuccessFactors), and cloud-based integrations.\n\nIn Germany, the earnings of contract consultants specializing in SAP S/4HANA migrations are consistently outpacing full-time salaries. The same pattern is evident in the UK, Canada, and Australia, where contract rates continue to rise due to a scarcity of experienced SAP professionals.\n\nAs demand for SAP expertise grows, businesses are becoming more flexible in their hiring models, and many are engaging independent SAP professionals on a project basis.\n\n\n\nWhy SAP Consultants Are Choosing to Freelance\n\nWhile compensation is a primary motivator, many SAP professionals are drawn to freelancing for more than just financial gain. The flexibility to choose projects, manage workloads, and control their own careers is a powerful incentive.\n\nOne of the biggest frustrations of working in large firms is having little or no control over project selection and work schedules. Many are assigned to engagements based on their firm\u2019s priorities rather than their individual expertise or interests. This can also result in long hours, extensive travel, and limited flexibility in balancing work and personal life. In contrast, independent SAP consultants can choose projects that align with their strengths and career goals, giving them more control over their professional development.\n\nWork-life balance is one of the primary reasons SAP consultants consider leaving full-time employment. Freelancers have greater control over their schedules, and many independent SAP professionals opt to work 40-hour weeks or less, while some take extended breaks between projects.\n\nAnother advantage of freelancing is the opportunity to gain a broader range of experience across different industries. At large firms, consultants may find themselves working on similar types of projects for years, limiting their exposure to new challenges. Independent consultants often work with a variety of organizations, technologies, and business models, helping them broaden their skills and diversify their expertise.\n\nEstablishing a personal brand and gaining direct recognition for expertise is another factor. Within large consulting firms, individual contributions are often overshadowed by the company\u2019s reputation, and career progression can be influenced by internal politics. Independent consultants have opportunities to build direct relationships with clients. Many freelancers also use professional platforms like LinkedIn, SAP Community, and specialist SAP consulting networks to show their specific expertise, making it easier to secure contracts with new clients.\n\nTechnological advancements have also made freelancing more accessible than ever before. Online platforms, remote collaboration tools, and cloud-based SAP environments have reduced the need for physical presence at client sites. Hybrid and fully remote SAP projects have enabled independent consultants to work from anywhere.\n\n\n\nIs Freelancing Right for Every SAP Consultant?\n\nDespite the many benefits, freelancing is not the right choice for every SAP professional.\n\nWhile independent consultants often earn higher rates, they must also take on additional responsibilities, including managing contracts, securing new projects, handling tax obligations, liability insurance, and covering their own benefits.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns for prospective freelancers is income stability.\n\nIndependent consultants do not receive guaranteed paychecks. They must carefully manage their finances to account for potential gaps between projects. While demand for SAP skills remains high, some freelancers will experience periods without work, particularly if they are not active in maintaining client relationships and securing repeat business.\n\nTraditional consulting firms offer clear career paths, health insurance, retirement plans, and training programs. Freelancers must take responsibility for these aspects of their careers, which requires additional planning and financial discipline. This administration takes up valuable time.\n\nAdditionally, some consultants prefer the structure and teamwork found in large firms. While freelancing offers independence, it also means working alone without the built-in support networks, mentorship, and collaborative environments that traditional employment provides.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of working in a traditional SAP consulting firm is access to structured training programs, mentorship, and career development opportunities. Firms often sponsor SAP certifications, provide exposure to large enterprise clients, and offer access to leadership. SAP training costs can add up substantially for independents, as they must retrain periodically to account for advances in technology and working practices.\n\nOn the other hand, freelancers develop their skills by working on diverse projects across multiple industries, and clients value experience alongside certification, if not more so. Independent consultants can also choose to specialize in high-demand areas like SAP S/4HANA migrations, SAP BTP development, or industry-specific SAP solutions. While career progression in freelancing is self-directed, the learning curve is often steeper, requiring continued effort to stay ahead in the market.\n\n\n\nThe Impact on SAP Consulting Firms\n\nMany firms, including large system integrators and boutique SAP consultancies, have relied on a model where they employ consultants full-time, assigning them to various projects based on demand.\n\nThe reliance on independent contractors for SAP projects has grown significantly in recent years. As more consultants opt for freelance work, firms are facing longer hiring cycles, higher attrition rates, and increased salary pressure as they strive to remain competitive.\n\nThis is challenging for companies that depend on long-term, high-margin contracts, where clients expect a steady team of consultants throughout an SAP implementation or upgrade. When employees leave midway through projects, firms must either find immediate replacements (often at higher costs) or delay project timelines, affecting both revenue and client relationships.\n\nSmaller SAP consultancies are feeling this shift acutely. Smaller firms rely on tight-knit teams with specialized skills, so losing even a few key consultants to freelancing can disrupt their ability to take on new projects. This has led many firms to move towards a blended workforce model that incorporates both full-time employees and freelance specialists.\n\n\n\nHow SAP Consulting Firms Can Retain Their Best Talent\n\n\n\nFaced with increasing talent pressure, SAP consulting firms must adapt their strategies to retain skilled professionals. Simply increasing salaries is not enough; companies need to rethink their approach to employee engagement, flexibility, and career development. Here are some useful strategies firms can adopt:\n\n\n\n1. Offering More Flexible Work Models\n\nFirms that offer hybrid work arrangements, remote project options, and flexible hours will have a better chance of retaining talent. Also, while it is impractical for smaller firms, giving consultants more autonomy in their choice of project can help. Some leading SAP consultancies have already adopted a \u201cproject marketplace\u201d model, allowing consultants to express interest in specific assignments.\n\nMany consultants leave firms due to excessive time spent on internal reports, compliance tasks, and unnecessary meetings. Accelerating internal processes can help firms retain talent while improving overall efficiency, and reducing non-billable administrative tasks can improve job satisfaction.\n\n\n\n2. Competitive Compensation and Bonus Structures\n\nTo compete with freelance earning potential, firms must offer performance-based incentives, project completion bonuses, and retention rewards, and make these benefits clear in job postings and candidacy processes. Some leading SAP consultancies are even experimenting with profit-sharing models, where top consultants receive a percentage of project revenue, making full-time roles more financially attractive. This can encourage other consultants to upskill in their efforts to qualify for senior roles.\n\nCompanies can also consider contractor-style pay models for their senior employees, where highly experienced consultants are offered fixed-term contracts with benefits, allowing them to maintain a level of autonomy while staying within the firm.\n\n\n\n3. Career Development and Specialization Opportunities\n\nMany consultants move to freelancing because they feel stuck in repetitive projects with limited exposure to new technologies.\n\nTo counter this, firms should redouble investments in SAP certification programs, specialized training in AI-driven ERP solutions, and cross-functional learning. Also, creating clear career progression paths, such as moving from technical consulting into solution architecture or practice leadership, can provide long-term incentives for consultants to remain.\n\n\n\n4. Recognition and Workplace Culture\n\nConsultants who feel undervalued or overlooked are far more likely to leave. A strong culture of recognition, where contributions are acknowledged, and consultants have a say in project decisions, can significantly improve retention. Firms that build a sense of community, mentorship, and professional belonging will fare better in keeping their top talent engaged.\n\nSeveral SAP consulting firms have started \u201cconsultant councils\u201d, where senior consultants can directly influence company policies, project choices, and strategic direction. This gives employees a greater sense of ownership over their work and reduces the temptation to leave for freelance opportunities.\n\n\n\n5. Develop a Talent Pipeline\n\n\n\nSome attrition in the workforce is a natural feature of large organizations, and in order to counter-balance this, it is necessary to seek out new talent. Developing partnerships with educational institutions can provide increased access to graduate-level consultants, and working with dedicated SAP recruitment consultancies like IgniteSAP can help ensure a steady supply of highly-qualified and experienced SAP talent.\n\n\n\nThe Future of SAP Consulting Careers\n\nFor those who prefer a steady income, structured career advancement, and corporate benefits, full-time consulting may remain the better option. However, for SAP professionals who value flexibility, higher earning potential, and the ability to shape their own careers, freelancing is an increasingly compelling alternative.\n\nConsulting companies that adapt by offering greater flexibility, better compensation structures, and stronger career development programs will be in a stronger position to retain their best consultants, and attract new ones.\n\nThe SAP consulting talent market will increasingly consist of a mix of full-time employment and independent consulting. Companies that integrate freelance consultants alongside full-time teams will be best equipped to navigate the changing talent market, and maintain a competitive edge in providing SAP services.\n\nIf you are an SAP professional looking for a new role in the SAP ecosystem our team of dedicated recruitment consultants can match you with your ideal employer and negotiate a competitive compensation package for your extremely valuable skills, so join our exclusive community at IgniteSAP.",

That\u2019s the sign of thousands of gallons of maple sap being processed and bottled into a golden pour, delectably described by the poet Elaine Equi as a \u201chigh-pitched sweetness, so piercing only a dog can hear it.\u201d\n\nWhile steam rises from the houses, spring snow settles among the groves. It is this forested serenity that Steve Wheeler, a fifth-generation sugarmaker, loves best. Wheeler runs the family\u2019s certified organic maple farm, where, at the age of six, he first started helping his father and grandfather make syrup. Back then, they collected sap in galvanized buckets and hauled them back through the snowy woods. \u201cI\u2019ve spent 50 years making maple syrup,\u201d Wheeler says, \u201cand you\u2019re still excited about next sugar season.\u201d A stiff tariff from the Trump administration on Canadian goods, including the equipment used to make syrup, has unsettled the industry. Wheeler operates his sugarbush with his wife and two sons in the small agriculture-rich town of Derby, Vermont. He hopes to continue running the farm and shop well into the future, passing it on to his descendants if he can. But things have not been so clear cut for sugarmakers lately. A stiff tariff from the Trump administration on Canadian goods, including the equipment used to make syrup, has unsettled the industry and could drive up the price of U.S. syrup. This has coincided with a slow syrup run in February. Such short-term woes are combining with longer-term concerns, as a changing climate alters both production and the business model. So the Wheelers and other sugarmakers are expanding into other tree syrups, to fortify their businesses in the face of changing weather (political and actual) and in hopes of keeping forests healthy. Researchers and farmers alike are investigating species like beech, sycamore, walnut, and even other species of maple. \u201cWhen all of a sudden you can tap a birch tree too, it\u2019s almost magic to me,\u201d Wheeler says. \u201cIt\u2019s like one more thing I can do.\u201d A Short Tapping Season Is Now in Flux\n\nMaple syrups producers, or sugarmakers, are dependent on a single product harvested in a window of just a few weeks every spring. Mark Isselhardt, a maple specialist for the University of Vermont Extension, says that means the biggest challenge to producers is the weather.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really talking about a relatively small number of actual days that contribute the vast majority of sap for your whole crop,\u201d Isselhardt says. \u201cIf it\u2019s all condensed into this few number of days, if anything goes wrong, mechanically or climate-wise or weather-wise, that can have an impact on production.\u201d Maple syrup also depends on a freeze-thaw cycle: When temperatures are below freezing at night but above it in the day, the difference in air pressure helps push sap through the tree and out through the taps. The increase in unpredictability from both climate change and other risks, like invasive species and disease, present challenges to producers, creating uncertainty for the future. Bigger swings in temperature, for instance, mean a much more variable tapping window than decades past. The Wheelers are now tapping maples about two months earlier, for example. Abnormally high temperatures could cause maples to bud too soon, impacting the grade of the syrup. On the other hand, warmer weather can also make the sap flow better in areas that have historically been too cold. Either way, sugarmakers foresee more adaptation ahead. Building More Resilient Forests Through Multiple Species\n\nThe tapping of trees for sap or syrup is an age-old practice. Birch sap, like maple, has long been harvested by Indigenous people living in northern forests. In Canada, for instance, Cree First Nations people have strong traditions of tapping the papery trees to drink the sap directly or boil it down into syrup.\n\nA grove of birch trees.

More than 30,000 developers will focus on improving SAP\u2019s AI foundation and building new use cases. Management expects its current AI implementations to generate around \u20ac300 million in efficiency gains in 2025 and aims to surpass \u20ac0.5 billion in the near term.\n\nSAP\u2019s Robust Outlook\n\nSAP\u2019s outlook for 2025 has been updated and its previous Ambition 2025 plan has been replaced. For 2025, management now anticipates cloud revenues in the range of \u20ac21.6-\u20ac21.9 billion, indicating an increase of 26-28% at cc on a year-over-year basis.\n\nCloud and software revenues are now expected in the range of \u20ac33.1-\u20ac33.6 billion, with an increase of 11-13% at cc on a year-over-year basis. It now estimates 2025 non-IFRS operating profit in the range of \u20ac10.3-\u20ac10.6 billion, indicating a rise of 26-30% at cc on a year-over-year basis. Free cash flow is now estimated to be around \u20ac8 billion at actual currencies.\n\nSAP Faces Multiple Headwinds\n\nDeclining software license and support revenues owing to a shift to the cloud remains a concern. In the fourth quarter, software licenses and support revenues totaled \u20ac3.56 billion, which decreased 3% (down 4% at cc) year over year. Software license revenues of \u20ac0.68 billion declined 18% (down 19% at cc) year over year.\n\nA volatile macroeconomic backdrop, along with increasing costs and stiff competition in the cloud space, is an additional headwind.\n\nHow to Strategize Investment in SAP\n\nSAP has a solid growth opportunity driven by demand for its solutions in the cloud space. Generative AI is emerging as another revenue driver.\n\n\n\nIn the past 60 days, analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current and the next quarter by 4.4% and 5.2%, respectively. The same for the current and the next year is revised upward by 1.7% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, a volatile macroeconomic backdrop, along with increasing costs, stiff competition and expensive valuation warrants caution. SAP is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/earnings ratio of 41.48X compared with the industry\u2019s 28.99X.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAt present, SAP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With Canada\u2019s strict data laws and the government's cloud-smart strategy, SAP Sovereign Cloud helps organizations manage risks related to data security, residency and digital sovereignty. Owing to these features, it forms an essential tool for organizations in highly regulated industries such as the public sector, defense and others.\n\n\n\nFollowing the announcement, SAP\u2019s shares gained 2% in trading and closed at $280.65 on March 3, 2025.\n\nKey Capabilities of SAP Sovereign Cloud\n\nSAP Sovereign Cloud offers a range of capabilities that address security, compliance and operational sovereignty. SAP ensures that both customer and cloud operational data are stored and managed within Canada, complying with the country's data sovereignty laws, including the Privacy Act, PIPEDA and GDPR for European data subjects. SAP Sovereign Cloud operations are managed by SAP Canada employees who hold appropriate security credentials to meet national security requirements. This ensures that only authorized personnel handle sensitive business and government data.\n\n\n\nIt is also built with enhanced cybersecurity measures to protect against evolving threats. Techniques such as software hardening, attack surface reduction and supply chain hardening are incorporated to bolster resilience against probable cyberattacks. In addition, the solution meets some of the highest industry security standards, including ISO 27001, 27017, 27018 certified and SOC 2 Type II audit compliant.\n\n\n\nThe initial rollout of the SAP Sovereign Cloud in Canada includes SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition, SAP Business Technology Platform, SAP Analytics Cloud and Digital Supply Chain solutions (including Integrated Business Planning software). These core solutions ensure that organizations across industries can securely manage critical business processes while maintaining compliance.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, additional offerings expected to be unveiled in 2025 are SAP SuccessFactors HCM and SAP Fieldglass. Management highlighted that its investment in Canadian R&D is a key factor in driving innovation, with more than 50% of its employees dedicated to product development. These efforts not only expand SAP\u2019s global product offerings but also solidify its long-term commitment to Canadians.\n\nSAP\u2019s Zacks Rank & Stock Price Performance\n\nSAP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

At the time, SAP said its supervisory board had reached a \"mutual agreement\" with M\u00fcller for him to leave the company's executive board at the end of September.\n\nIn a prepared statement at the time, M\u00fcller said his behavior had been inappropriate. \"I regret being inconsiderate and sincerely apologize to everyone affected.

            "content": "SAP SE's ( ) periodic dividend will be increasing on the 16th of May to \u20ac2.35, with investors receiving 6.8% more than last year's \u20ac2.20. Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 0.8%, which is below the industry average.\n\nSAP's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Prior to this announcement, SAP's dividend made up quite a large proportion of earnings but only 58% of free cash flows. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business.\n\nAnalysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated.\n\nSAP Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was \u20ac1.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of \u20ac2.20. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.2% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nThe Dividend's Growth Prospects Are Limited\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. SAP hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.\n\nIn Summary\n\nOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've picked out that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

With so many parts to the process, it truly can be a whole family event!\n\nLast year we went to the event at The Pond House in Bloomington and it inspired us to try tapping our own trees at my mom\u2019s house.\n\nIt was a success and although we only tapped one tree and didn\u2019t get a huge amount of sap, it was still fun to experience the process on our own and make a bit of of \u201chomemade\u201d syrup.\n\nFrom pancake breakfasts, to tapping trees, collecting sap, and tasting the syrup \u2013 our list of maple syrup events has something for everyone!\n\nWhen Does Sap Run?\n\nMaple sap runs best when daytime temperatures are in the high 30s to mid-40s and overnight temperatures are below freezing. In Minnesota, sap usually runs from mid-March to mid-April.\n\nHow Does Sap Turn Into Syrup?\n\nSap is converted to syrup through a boiling process. Most of the water boils out of the sap, leaving behind the sugar and flavor. It usually takes 30-40 gallons of sugar maple sap to produce one gallon of pure maple syrup!\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources provides information to try tapping trees at home. In addition, they have many events happening throughout the Minnesota State Parks.\n\n2025 Minnesota Maple Syrup Events\n\nWe are fortunate that there are so many event opportunities throughout our state. Often times, participants can be a part of the maple syrup process.\n\nBelow is a list of events we have found so far. When you find a date that works for you, be sure to check out the event page for more information.\n\nSome of these events are free, while others cost money and require registration.

            "content": "Ontario's maple syrup producers are cautiously optimistic about this year's yield, thanks to consistent cold followed by gradually warming temperatures heading into spring \u2014 the ideal conditions for tapping maple trees.\n\nJohn Williams, executive director of the Ontario Maple Syrup Producers' Association, said the weather this year is much more favourable compared to last year's early start.\n\n\"We're having a more traditional winter, and that bodes well for a good season,\" Williams said.\n\nLast year's maple syrup season was thrown off by sudden warm spells in January and February , prompting producers to tap trees earlier than usual, shortening the period for collecting sap.\n\nBrian Barkley, owner of Barkleyvale Farms in Chesterville, says snow provides moisture, which is essential for keeping the maple trees hydrated. (Submitted by Brian Barkley)\n\nThe irregular temperature swings led to complications with both production and scheduling, according to Williams.\n\n\"It was kind of all over the map last year. It was hard to get your bearings, because most of the traditional markers for temperature and timing and stuff just didn't apply,\" he said.\n\nThis year, temperatures are more consistent, which helps prevent early tapping and ensures a longer collection period. A gradual warming trend over the coming weeks will allow for a more typical maple syrup season, stretching from late March to early April, Williams explained.\n\nBenefits of snow\n\nThe first half of February saw snowstorms dumping significant amounts across Ontario. That deep snow cover has been a double-edged sword for producers, however, offering both challenges and benefits.\n\nWilliams said the deep snow makes accessing production areas more difficult, requiring snowshoes and extensive digging to uncover equipment.\n\nMarc Madore is a maple producer at Vanier Sugar Shack. He says snow will also help prolong the production season. (Submitted by Mac Madore)\n\nOn the other hand, as Brian Barkley, owner of Barkleyvale Farms in Chesterville explained, snow provides moisture, which is essential for keeping trees hydrated and moderating temperatures during warm spells. It also helps to prevent sap from flowing too quickly.\n\n\"Number 1, it's been colder, and Number 2 is that we've got more accumulated snow on the ground at this point. I'd have to say we're starting off better than we did last year,\" Barkley said.\n\nMarc Madore, a maple producer at Vanier Sugar Bush, explained that the snow will also help prolong the season. He believes the return of consistent temperatures will lead to a more traditional maple syrup season.\n\n\"I think it's going to be like a normal season \u2014 like it used to be, if I can use the expression, in the old days,\" he said.",

            "content": "\n\n\n\nSap by Visionnaire\n\n\n\nThere are brands that, when they unite, trigger that moment of lighting, as a stroke of genius that transforms the banal into something almost. And this is precisely what happens when the destinies of Visionnaire are crossing, flagship of luxury furnishings, and lymph, a Plant Based restaurant founded by Edoardo Valsecchi in 2021 and with a restaurant in via Borgognona in Milan.\n\nLymph, Edoardo Valsecchi\n\nThere is no mention of a simple restaurant but of an experience that challenges the laws of physics, as if the design had taken the cuisine by the kitchen and guided it towards Agarthi, the legendary underground kingdom of beauty and light. And the journey to Agarthi is the inspiration of sap by Visionnaire, a concept that combines natural materials such as travertine and Quarzite Emerald Light, with surfaces in Mocha Mousse (Pantone of the year, understood?) Which whisper elegance as if we were stressing a corner of paradise.\n\nEntering the showroom in Piazza Cavour 3 in Milan, you immediately find yourself in an environment that looks like a temple of aesthetics, where even the 18 -meter bar counter (if it is not a record that is not missing) and worked glass tables are not only \u201cfunctional\u201d but create an atmosphere that invites the connection, deep breath and reflection. It is a bit as if we entered an intimate refuge, a sanctuary of good life that celebrates the art of living together and enjoying beauty, be it in the form of furnishings or dishes.\n\nLymph, the cheese and pepper to the anacardi\n\nAnd the cuisine? Linfa from Visionnaire shows that you can be ethical and at the same time super gourmet. It is a bit like finding a balance between yoga and pizza, between mindfulness and pasta: an art that seems impossible, but that lymph almost provocatively realizes. The cacio and pepper at the anacardi would also give the most traditionalist of the Romans while the vegan cutlet makes the best fried chicken of all time, net of the fences erected by the food tribes. Ah, and let\u2019s not forget Shitake\u2019s rag\u00f9, a dish that makes you think that perhaps, after all, meat is not even so necessary. And then there is also the artisan pizza, leavened for 48 hours with high hydration flours.\n\nFor sushi lovers, however, Linfa performs an operation worthy of a laboratory experiment: the sushi plant-based and gluten-free sushi. Tuna and salmon? No longer, thanks, but a surprising recreation based on pea proteins that could make you forget raw fish once and for all. And to make everything even more captivating there is a wine list, also rigorously vegan and natural, which accompanies you on a journey that starts from the Italian lands, passing through France, without forgetting a good glass of champagne, because luxury every now and then is a necessity.\n\nSap by Visionnaire, a glimpse\n\nIn short, here we are from the parts of the philosophy of life rather than in the territory of pure nourishment, an act of love for health, the environment and our future. And to those who think that eating well cannot also be an act of responsibility, here the lymph responds with a selection of ingredients from vertical agriculture, such as that of Planet Farm, and by suppliers that respect very high standards of sustainability. It is no coincidence that Visionnaire has been defined as a benefit company since 2021 and undertakes to operate in compliance with the environment and people, through responsible, transparent and aware practices. Linfa from Visionnaire arises as a perfect example of how luxury and sustainability can coexist, how beauty can rhyme with responsibility. A sort of silent revolution: a cuisine that does not need to shout to get noticed, but that has the strength to transform every dinner into an act of care for our body, our spirit and our planet. And who would not want to be part of all this, even if only for an evening?\n\nVisionnaire Milan\n\n\n\nShowroom, Piazza Cavour 3, Milan. Opening hours: from Monday to Saturday, from 10.00 to 19.00 Link from Visionnaire, from Monday to Saturday, from 12.00 to 15.00 (evening opening in conjunction with the Salone del Mobile)",

            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Mass firings at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have resulted in what is essentially a shut down of the unit responsible for licensing US remote sensing satellites, according to multiple sources, with license holders receiving emails notifying them all correspondence would now be handled by NOAA\u2019s Office of General Counsel.\n\n\u201cThis is a temporary arrangement to address continuity of operations as no senior personnel remain in the office due to reductions in force,\u201d reads a copy of the email from the Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs (CRSRA) division seen by Breaking Defense. \u201cCRSRA is unable to state when this arrangement might end.\u201d\n\nCRSRA is the division within NOAA\u2019s Office of Space Commerce responsible for regulating space-based commercial remote sensing, including work involving companies such as Planet, Maxar and BlackSky that provide imagery to the National Reconnaissance Office for use by the Defense Department for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. NOAA, in turn, is under the Department of Commerce.\n\n\u201cThe email is correct, the Office of General Counsel will be supporting the continuity of license applications and processing for companies involved in the process,\u201d a spokesperson for the Office of Space Commerce told Breaking Defense in an email.\n\nWhile it is too soon to judge the impact of the situation, if extenuated the likely outcome would be a slow down in the approval of new licenses for aspiring satellite imagery firms and of any pending license modification requests from current operators.\n\nThe Trump administration began firings Thursday at NOAA, with some 800 personnel out of a total staff of some 13,000 terminated, the New York Times reported today. Among those was the head of CRSRA Sarah Brothers, sources who deal with CRSRA told Breaking Defense.\n\n\u201cPer our long-standing practice, we do not discuss internal personnel and management matters. NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation\u2019s environmental and economic resilience,\u201d the Office of Space Commerce spokesperson said.\n\nNOAA operates US weather satellites also used by the military, and has been central to research on climate change.\n\nIn addition, the Office of Space Commerce sent out a notice today that it has cancelled a planned March 5 meeting of the NOAA Advisory Committee on Excellence in Space (ACES). The industry group has been active in helping the Office of Space Commerce on a number of key issues, including how to best provide oversight and management of on-orbit activities that fall between the cracks of current federal regulatory regimes.\n\nThe notice, also reviewed by Breaking Defense, does not indicate whether the planned meeting would be rescheduled. However, the space-focused news outlet Payload today reported that ACES has been swept up in the cull of advisory committees mandated in a Feb. 19 Trump administration executive order seeking to slash the federal bureaucracy.\n\nFurther, the head of the Office of Space Commerce\u2019s program to create a civil space traffic management regime designed to take the burden of warning non-military satellite operators of potential on-orbit crashes off DoD\u2019s shoulders, Dmitry Poisik, also has been fired, the same sources told Breaking Defense.\n\nPoisik was hired in July 2024 as the first director of the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCCS) program, and thus fell under the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s order for termination of all federal agency \u201cprobationary\u201d employees. In most federal agencies, personnel who have yet to complete one full year in their job are given \u201cprobationary\u201d status.\n\nNonetheless, work under the TraCCS program appears to be continuing, with the Office of Space Commerce today issuing a call for industry comment on its proposal for a new \u201cpathfinder\u201d project. \u201cThe pathfinder would investigate commercially available capabilities for the identification and cataloging of space objects immediately after their launch and deployment,\u201d the notice explains.",

            "content": "Software licenses, a global IT problem\n\nOf course, every IT user is under a license obligation to software providers and must then develop the best possible strategy in accordance with that fact. For many years, SAP has been extremely restrictive in distributing free software licenses for proofs of concept, as numerous SAP partners have informed E3 magazine. While Microsoft offers 180-day trial licenses for its server products at any time and without red tape, SAP only offers free licenses for a few days, if at all.\n\nThe system of trial licenses for 30 to 180 days is well established in the IT industry. After downloading the software, it is often only necessary to register with an e-mail address for activation. SAP, on the other hand, takes quite a strict and restrictive approach to issuing free text licenses. Many innovations result from an experimental approach that should not carry such a high cost in the early stages.\n\nIG SAP CH complains about SAP's licensing policy\n\nAt the annual SAP Community Survey, IG SAP CH (SAP Switzerland Interest Group) complained about the challenging licensing policy of the ERP world market leader SAP: \"There are currently significant developments and discussions in connection with SAP's licensing and migration policy: reduction of credit values for license migrations, pressure to switch to cloud models, products are being discontinued and successor products are much more expensive. There are intensive discussions about how SAP customers can strengthen their position together. SAP's strategy of gradually making traditional on-prem models and private cloud solutions unattractive via an alternative hyperscaler, as well as providing products and services exclusively via the RISE/GROW construct, is putting companies under considerable pressure. This is problematic because there is no objective reason not to offer licenses in other forms. This approach suggests that SAP is deliberately using its dominant market position to force customers into its cloud strategy. Such a strategy can only be implemented by a company with a dominant position in the market.\u201d\n\nDo all SAP customers agree? IG SAP CH wants to know what customers think! For the fifth time, the SAP user association is conducting an online survey: what are the current challenges in an SAP environment? How robust is your company\u2019s current SAP strategy? How are SAP's communications regarding RISE perceived? Are the RISE and GROW initiatives clear and understandable, and does this SAP technology promote transparency on important issues? What is the planning and progress of the migration to S/4 Hana and what are the experiences before, during, and after the project?\n\nThe opinion of every SAP customer counts, and IG SAP CH is looking forward to as many participants as possible! The survey is open until March 15, 2025 (German only): https://forms.office.com/e/kiHhf6UUSp\n\nSAP BTP licenses\n\nThe BTP platform is a special challenge for SAP customers because it consists of many different components and thus cannot be licensed uniformly. At the start of many ERP projects, it is often unclear which software components will be needed for development and customization. This makes it almost impossible to estimate costs.\n\nThe licensing conditions of an IT platform such as SAP BTP must be well planned. At the Steampunk and BTP Summit 2025, attorney Dr. Jana Jentzsch will give a presentation on SAP cloud licensing in general and BTP in particular. Registration is still open for the Summit in Heidelberg on March 5 and 6.",

Those longer days provide more sun and warmth during the days, while the nights remain cold.\n\nThis year, the maple sugaring season at Codorus began on Jan. 8, and will typically run until the end of February or early March, Weidner said.\n\nOnce the right season is found, the next step is finding the right trees - as you already know - maple trees.\n\nWeidner explained that the best and easiest way to identify maple trees is by their distinct leaves, which can be identified during the spring, summer, or fall, then marked to be tapped in the winter.\n\nDuring the winter, one method of identification for maples comes from the branching types of local trees.\n\nThere are three main types of branching, opposite, where branches leave the main stem directly across from each other, alternate, where branches are staggered from the main stem, and most rarely, whorled, where branches encircle the main stem.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, only four trees have \"opposite\" branching - maples, ash, dogwoods, and horse chestnuts, said Weidner.\n\n\"You're a quarter of the way there if you find opposite branching,\" said Weidner.\n\nAmong one of the most visible signs of a maple tree, Weidner shared, is sooty mold, a type of black fungus that is attracted to the sugar in the sap of maple trees. The mold grows on the bark of maple trees while feeding on sap that comes out of the tree, resulting in a burnt look to the trees.\n\nThe fungus is harmless to wildlife and the tree, Weidner noted, and does not damage the tree or affect consumption of the sap inside the tree.\n\nOnce a maple is found, Weidner notes that the health of the tree should be considered before the tree is tapped for sap.\n\nTo avoid injuring the tree, a tree must be at least 12-inches across to be tapped for sap, which typically indicates an age of over 30 years. A tree of over 20-24 inches can sustain two taps, she added.\n\n\"You want to be very careful to not injure the trees,\" said Weidner.\n\nThe best flow of sap is found on the south-facing side of the tree, she said. which typically gets the most sun. Other indicators of a good spot to tap would be in the area between a big root below and a big branch above.\n\nThe 'sugar queen of Codorus'\n\nThe programs began in 2021, Weidner shared, after she was hired as a full-time park educator at Codorus in 2020, having prior worked at the park only seasonally in the summer.\n\n\"We didn't have a wintertime educator,\" Weidner noted, which prevented a truly hands-on experience of an activity that takes place over the winter.\n\nWeidner, an Adams County native and a trained environmental educator with a degree in aquatic biology, has been involved in maple sugaring programs for over 20 years, she said.\n\n\"Growing up, we made maple syrup now and then,\" said Weidner, who noted that maple sugaring can be done in one's own backyard. As for the educational side of maple sugaring, Weidner was introduced into more of the sugaring world when she first began working at a small nature preserve 20 years ago prior to working with state parks.\n\n\"You don't see it a lot down here in south central Pennsylvania,\" said Weidner of maple sugaring, \"since we don't have the thousands of maple trees the way they do up north or in Canada.\"\n\nAt Codorus State Park, Weidner said the park has around 100 taps in around roughly 70 to 85 maple trees, though there are many more maple trees around the park that could potentially be tapped.\n\nRecently, a business donated 5-gallon water cooler jugs to the park, which were able to collect additional sap at a time with trips to empty them over the course of a day.\n\nWeidner, who is deeply involved in the effort, shared that \"everything I touch is sticky,\" with a laugh. In her own words, Weidner is the \"sugar queen of Codorus,\" helping educate visitors about maple sugaring and assisting with running the park's sugaring efforts.\n\nThe programs draw varying attendance, with one drawing over 100 attendees, though some may have just a handful in attendance. Weidner designs the programs for all-ages, and said she gets a good response from both the adults and children in attendance.\n\nTo keep the little ones engaged, though, she focuses on providing hands-on opportunities, where children may assist with tapping a tree, collecting sap, and various other aspects during the program.\n\n\"If you can get something in their hands, the kids can care a whole lot more,\" she noted.\n\nThe passion involved in the program is clear, however.\n\nOn a recent year, Weidner even made an effort to give a hug and a thank you to every tree as they removed the spouts.\n\n\"They gave us something tasty, we gotta thank them,\" laughed Weidner.\n\nA volunteer effort\n\nWeidner isn't the only one behind the surprisingly labor intensive effort to produce maple syrup at Codorus State Park - she has friends, too.\n\nSpecifically, the Friends of Codorus State Park, a volunteer group founded in 2006 that assists the park staff with upkeep and other efforts, along with fundraising for park improvements and events.\n\n\"I couldn't do it without them,\" said Weidner.\n\nThe volunteers assist Weidner with collecting the sap and with the production of syrup out of that sap.\n\nDuring a recent maple sugaring program, many of those volunteers were on hand, working to collect the sap, boiling off the high water content of the sap, filtering the syrup, filling bottles, and then selling the syrup to program attendees.\n\n\"Being able to produce enough syrup to sell to the public as a fundraiser is huge,\" said Weidner.\n\nIt's a unique and labor intensive process to make maple syrup, as Weidner shared that it can take around 40 to 60 gallons of raw sap to produce just one gallon of syrup.\n\nThat's because, as she explained, sap is around 98% water and 2% sugar, requiring the boiling off of the majority of the water to produce syrup. During the programs, Weidner gives each participant a chance to taste raw sap - with many remarking that it simply tastes like water.\n\nWhen conditions are right with a freezing night and warm day, the park's trees may fill the 100 collection buckets around 3 times a day, resulting in potentially hundreds of trips to collect sap - something Weidner says she could not do without the volunteers.\n\n\"You can kind of tell why they keep coming back,\" laughed Weidner, \"we have fun.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday, Feb. 25, the park had collected 505 gallons of sap. Those 505 gallons, the park volunteers said, resulted in 12 gallons of bottled syrup so far for 2025.\n\nWhile sap is being boiled, volunteers have to skim foam off the surface of the boiling sap, which increases the surface area for evaporation.\n\nThe process, as described by park volunteer Gordy Lillich, is an \"old art.\" At Codorus, the evaporators that boil the sap are simply powered through firewood, and much of the process happens not all that different than it has happened for many years.\n\nThe sap is poured through filters a total of three times during the boiling process, to remove any particulates.\n\nIf you go:\n\nAttendees are suggested to dress for the weather, and parking is available at the visitor center located at 2600 Smith Station Road, or the Friends of Codorus building at 1066 Blooming Grove Road.\n\nThe last two sessions of this year's maple sugaring program will be held on March 8, with one session at 10 a.m. and one session at 1 p.m., according to the park's schedule.\n\nFollowing the programs, visitors can purchase freshly made syrup, with an eight-ounce bottle costing $12, and a three-ounce bottle costing $7. Magnets and other park items are also available at the stand following the programs.\n\nIn comparison to many store-bought offerings, the park's bottled syrup has just one ingredient: sap.\n\nFunds raised by the sales and programs go entirely towards supplies for future maple sugaring programs, and the park itself.\n\nCancellations due to weather will be announced on Codorus State Park's Facebook page.\n\nThe Friends of Codorus State Park group is always accepting new volunteers, they shared, for the syrup program and more. Those interested in volunteering can find more information on their website or by contacting the Friends at contact@codorusfriends.org.\n\nHarrison Jones is the Hanover reporter for the Evening Sun.",

Credit: University of Queensland\n\nUniversity of Queensland studies have used a natural tree sap gum and light to extend the shelf life of fresh fruit and vegetables to combat food waste.\n\nThe Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation (QAAFI) research used edible coatings made from gum Arabic or acacia gum enriched with extracts from native Australian plants to stop the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms.\n\nThe research team also used light and curcumin, a compound extracted from turmeric, to deactivate fungal spores on food.\n\nQAAFI's Dr. Maral Seididamyeh said both methods were effective in keeping food fresh for longer.\n\nThe research was published in Food Control, the Journal of Food Science, and the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules.\n\n\"Using our edible coating, we were able to prevent the growth of spoilage microorganisms in freshly cut capsicum for around 10 days in the fridge,\" Dr. Seididamyeh said.\n\n\"This was mostly due to the organic acids and phenolic compounds found in the aqueous extracts of plants like Cape York lilly pilly, boonjee tamarind, and Tasmanian pepper leaves.\n\n\"These extracts showed promising antimicrobial properties and the sensory analysis also revealed the fruit looked and smelled better.\n\n\"The curcumin-based photosensitization technique completely deactivated the fungal spores responsible for gray mold in fresh produce.\n\n\"When applied to strawberries, it reduced decay incidence and severity by 20% without compromising the fruit's color or firmness.\"\n\nDr. Seididamyeh said chemical-free methods for preventing food spoilage were in demand.\n\n\"Bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites are becoming resistant to synthetic chemicals used to preserve food,\" Dr. Seididamyeh said.\n\n\"Consumers are increasingly favoring products made with natural preservatives over synthetic additives.\"\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' data showed 17% of food was lost to spoilage and other issues at retail outlets and in homes.\n\n\"The research results are promising, but more work is needed, especially since photosensitization is a relatively new concept in the food industry,\" Dr. Seididamyeh said.\n\n\"Photosensitization is already used in medicine through photodynamic therapy to destroy abnormal cells in the treatment of cancer and precancerous conditions.\n\n\"The edible gum coating, embedded with extracts from native Australian foods and leaves, and curcumin are currently quite expensive.\n\n\"To help make this a mainstream solution, further funding will be needed to refine the technology for its integration into commercial packing and processing lines.\"\n\nMore information: Maral Seididamyeh et al, Gum Arabic edible coating embedded aqueous plant extracts: Interactive effects of partaking components and its effectiveness on cold storage of fresh-cut capsicum, Food Control (2024).

            "content": "The Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) remains one of the most controversial economic policies in Nigeria over three decades later.\n\nIn 1986, Ibrahim Babangida (IBB), then military head of state, developed the SAP, to reduce government intervention, promote the private sector and diversify the economy, but in turn, it sparked inflation, poverty and increased external debt.\n\nThe SAP was not all bad for Nigeria, however, as its recommendations were necessary to solve the economic crisis facing the country.\n\nThe scarcity of foreign exchange and essential items which dodged the period disappeared following the liberalisation of the FX market, even though it led to a sharp depreciation of the naira.\n\nRead also: Babangida\u2019s a journey in service: A memoir of deflections\n\nHere are five charts showing the impact of IBB\u2019s SAP on Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nExternal debt jumped to $23bn\n\nDebt owed to external creditors spiked by 51.41 percent to $22.68 billion in 1990 from $14.98billion in 1986.\n\nMultilateral creditors (such as the IMF and World Bank) rose by 103.17 percent, increasing to $3.84 billion in 1990 from $1.89 billion in 1986. This indicates Nigeria\u2019s heavy dependence on bilateral loans from developed nations.\n\nParis club debt jumped by 69.91 percent to $17.171billion in 1990 from $10.228billion in 1986, while non-paris declined by 71.55 percent to $1.675billion in 1990 from $2.873billion in 1989\n\nRise in poverty levels\n\nThe implementation of SAP deepened poverty levels in Nigeria following its inflationary impact and the job losses it triggered.\n\nPoverty rate increased to 13.6% from 12% between 1985 and 1993.\n\nRead also: Why Nigeria joined Organisation of Islamic Countries during my regime Babangida\n\nInflation rate peaked\n\nHeadline inflation rate rose from 5.72 percent to 59.97 percent within seven years due to depreciation of naira, removal of price control and subsidies as well as increased money supply.\n\nNaira weakened from N2/$ to N22/$\n\nThe decline in naira value against the dollar from N2/$ to N22.05/$ between 1986 and 1993 happened as a result of the change to a system where the forces of demand and supply determine the rate as opposed to government fiat as was the case before SAP. It didn\u2019t take time for the artificially propped currency to slide after the market was left to determine the exchange rate.\n\nThe decline in global oil prices also slashed oil revenues, the country\u2019s biggest source of foreign exchange, heaping pressure on the naira.\n\nRead also: Babangida: Ghost of June 12 still haunting some people Atedo Peterside\n\nKey non-oil sectors benefited from SAP\n\nAgriculture GDP recorded a tenfold increase from N35.70 billion to N295.32 billion between 1986 and 1993, this was because SAP was aimed at promoting self-sufficiency in farming.\n\nIndustry also increased to N417.06 billion in 1993 from N65.5 billion within seven years due to the SAP\u2019s role in driving industrial expansion following a wave of privatisation of inefficient government assets. That helped to attract investments, liberalise trade.\n\nFinancial institutions and manufacturing GDP also jumped thanks to the reforms introduced by SAP.\n\nShare",

            "content": "Sap flowing from maple tap. (Photo credit: Jennie Mazzone, Penn State)\n\nFRANKLIN CO., Pa. \u2014 February is coming to an end. Warmer days are just around the corner, and so is maple sugaring season. Have you ever wondered how the maple tree produces the sweet sap we use to make syrup? Maple sap flow is driven by physiological processes in the tree\u2019s xylem tissue and specific weather conditions.\n\nIn plant biology, we learn that phloem tissue transports the sugars (photosynthate) within the tree, while xylem tissue transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves. However, during the leafless, dormant period of late fall and winter, maples concentrate sugar in their xylem sap. This sugar is produced when ray parenchyma\u2014living cells that extend horizontally through the xylem\u2014use enzymes to convert starch into sucrose. These sugars help protect plant tissues from freezing.\n\nSap flows in late winter/early spring when temperatures alternate between freezing and thawing, below and above 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) respectively. During this time, ice crystals that formed in xylem fiber cells over the winter begin to melt. At the same time, the sucrose produced by the ray parenchyma cells becomes concentrated in the xylem vessels. These processes create positive pressure inside the tree. If the tree is tapped or wounded, the sugar-filled xylem sap leaks out because the positive pressure inside the tree is higher than outside air pressure. When nighttime temperatures drop below freezing, a negative pressure (suction) develops, drawing water into the tree from the soil to replenish what was lost. Once the freeze/thaw cycle ends and the buds break dormancy, the pressure differential inside the tree will stop, and so will the flow of sap from the tap hole.\n\nThe unique anatomy and physiology of maple trees, combined with the environmental conditions of our region, allow sap to flow. However, it is still up to us, the sugar makers, to do the hard work of collecting and boiling sap to produce the sweet, delicious maple syrup product we know and love. Starting with a higher sugar content sap (e.g. sugar maple) can help speed up the process. To learn more about the production of maple syrup, visit the Penn State Extension website: https://extension.psu.edu/.\n\nReferences:\n\nBlumenstock, M., Hopkins, K. and Lilley, J.

As the pioneers and leaders of the digital adoption platform (DAP) category, WalkMe has consistently tracked digital adoption\u2019s evolution.\n\nTransform your business for a digital and sustainable future Learn how\n\nAptly for our time, this year\u2019s report focuses on the state of AI adoption in organizations across the globe. There is no doubt that AI is transforming enterprise ambitions, but its success depends on people. The human part of the equation seems to be what is standing in the way of realizing the great promises of AI.\n\nThe findings must be considered in context of the consistently missed opportunity that has characterized many digital transformation efforts. BCG research shows that while digital transformation leaders generated $9 trillion in shareholder value from 2018 to 2023, others missed $5 trillion in potential gains. Enterprises now face a choice: continue accumulating transformation debt and lag behind the competition, or embrace digital adoption as the bridge to AI-powered success.\n\nThe report outlines seven digital adoption best practices and their business impact. Implementing even a single digital adoption best practice can nearly triple digital transformation ROI from 22 to 64 percent. Success in the AI era will not be won with technology alone, but with holistic adoption excellence.\n\nFor our fourth annual State of Digital Adoption Report, we surveyed nearly 4,000 enterprise leaders and employees globally and dove deep into AI adoption trends. Likely the most comprehensive research into today\u2019s digital adoption efforts, it provides a blueprint for harnessing AI to achieve HyperProductivity. At WalkMe, we\u2019re committed to helping you turn the promise of digital transformation into measurable business impact.\n\nHere\u2019s a peak into some of the findings:\n\nDespite AI spending projected to grow 64 percent in 2025 \u2014 from $14 million to $23 million at large enterprises \u2014 many organizations struggle to translate investment into impact. Our research highlights that while 79 percent of executives express confidence in achieving AI transformation goals, only 28 percent of employees feel adequately trained, and just 25 percent can use AI to work more efficiently. This readiness gap proves that without strategic adoption, AI investments often fail to deliver meaningful business value. The cost of the resulting digital inefficiencies at large enterprises was found to be over $104 million in 2024 alone due to underutilized technology and poor productivity practices.\n\nWhile executives estimate an average of 37 applications are in use at their organizations, WalkMe data shows the average large enterprise actually has on average 625 applications in use \u2014 a 17x discrepancy or visibility gap of 1,600 percent. How can organizations effectively optimize their technology investments if they lack the visibility into what applications are actually being used and how? The answer is, of course, they can\u2019t. Enterprises must first discover precisely which applications are in use across their organizations before meaningful productivity gains can be realized. It\u2019s the most basic first step in setting up each individual employee, team, and business unit for success using the technology tools that are already being paid for.\n\nNinety-three percent of enterprises surveyed are reevaluating their IT infrastructure, software applications, and talent strategies to ensure AI success. With so much in flux at even the world\u2019s most innovative companies, one thing is clear: AI\u2019s promise can only be realized if people are using it. Enterprises that invest in human-centric workforce AI adoption will not only maximize their AI investments, but will also lead the charge in shaping the future of work.\n\nThe digital adoption imperative is not only motivated by ROI, employees are all but crying out for help using these increasingly complex and numerous technologies at work. The report found that employees are still struggling with the technology tools available to them, so much so they waste an average of 36 working days a year dealing with technology frustrations. That\u2019s akin to having every single employee take almost two full months off purely to deal with digital friction.\n\nWe can do better.\n\nI invite you to explore more of this year\u2019s findings and talk to WalkMe about how your workforce can thrive with AI and achieve HyperProductivity.

            "content": "AI-Supported Consulting\n\nAI-generated code is already shaping how SAP projects are planned, executed, and maintained, in deep AI-human collaborative development workflows, affecting both functional and technical consultants.\n\nAs AI-powered tools automate configurations, assist with coding, and improve decision-making, consultants must rethink their responsibilities and adapt to new ways of working. The role of an SAP consultant is shifting from hands-on system development to guiding AI-driven processes, validating automated outputs, and applying expertise where human oversight remains necessary.\n\nThis article from IgniteSAP explores how AI-assisted tools such as SAP Build, SAP Joule, and AI-supported development environments are changing how businesses interact with their SAP systems, requiring consultants to work alongside AI. Understanding this transformation is essential for professionals who want to continue contributing meaningfully to modern SAP projects.\n\n\n\nSAP Build: No-Code and Low-Code Development\n\nSAP Build is reshaping how functional consultants interact with system development.\n\nIn the past, business users relied on IT teams to build applications and automate workflows. Now, no-code and low-code platforms enable functional consultants to create and refine business processes without extensive technical knowledge. AI assists in generating scripts, automating approvals, and identifying gaps in system logic.\n\nFunctional consultants are expected to work more closely with AI-driven automation, validating whether generated workflows meet business objectives. While they do not need to become programmers, they must develop an understanding of how AI-assisted tools operate, how to refine automated outputs, and where to step in when AI suggestions do not align with business expectations.\n\n\n\nThe Changing Role of Functional Consultants\n\nAs AI takes on a larger role in process automation, consultants must also adapt their approach to business analysis. AI-generated data models provide suggestions for process improvements, cost reductions, and performance optimizations. Consultants must interpret these findings, communicate them to stakeholders, and determine when AI-generated recommendations require adjustment based on broader business priorities.\n\nSAP projects are increasingly dependent on predictive analytics and automated decision-making, but AI lacks the ability to consider factors that are not present in its training data. Consultants are expected to fill this gap by bringing strategic thinking into the equation. This requires a blend of business expertise, technical awareness, and the ability to explain AI-driven recommendations to non-technical stakeholders.\n\n\n\nAI-Generated Code and SAP Development\n\nFor technical consultants, AI-driven tools can now support the creation of SAP ABAP scripts, automate common development tasks, and identify areas where performance improvements are needed.\n\nWhile this is an advantage, it also introduces new challenges. AI-generated code is not always optimized for efficiency, security, or long-term maintainability. Developers must check whether AI-created scripts meet system performance standards or if they introduce unnecessary complexity.\n\nInstead of spending most of their time writing code manually, technical consultants are focusing more on reviewing, refining, and testing AI-generated outputs. AI may produce functional code, but it does not account for real-world business requirements, regulatory considerations, or long-term system performance. This means that consultants must have a strong understanding of how AI-driven development tools operate, where they fall short, and when human intervention is required.\n\n\n\nSAP Build Code\n\nWith the growing use of SAP Build Code (an offering designed to complement, but distinctly different to SAP Build), developers are working alongside AI-powered tools to speed up software creation. AI suggests coding structures, automates debugging, and generates components for SAP Fiori applications.\n\nDevelopers must assess whether AI-generated code follows best practices, adheres to business rules, and integrates smoothly with other SAP modules. This requires not only technical expertise but also a strong understanding of business processes and system dependencies. AI can automate repetitive tasks, but it cannot make complex architectural decisions or predict long-term scalability issues.\n\nThe increasing adoption of AI-driven integration tools is also affecting technical consultants who work with SAP BTP and middleware solutions. AI is now capable of assisting with API management, automating system connections, and identifying potential bottlenecks in data exchange. This reduces the complexity of manual integration efforts, but it also means that consultants must understand how AI-driven middleware operates and when it may generate incorrect configurations.\n\nSAP consultants working in integration must now focus on overseeing AI-assisted processes, ensuring that automated connections function as expected and that data integrity is maintained. AI can accelerate system integration, but without proper validation, it may introduce errors that could disrupt business operations.\n\n\n\nSAP Joule\u2019s Role Will Expand in AI-Assisted SAP Consulting\n\nSAP Joule is emerging as a core AI assistant within SAP\u2019s ecosystem, providing real-time support for code generation, system configuration, and decision-making. Its expanding role in AI-generated SAP code is reshaping how functional and technical consultants interact with SAP systems, requiring them to develop new skills and approaches.\n\nJoule is not yet fully autonomous in writing code. It supports predictive completion and explanations rather than generating full ABAP scripts independently.\n\nJoule\u2019s recommendations often require human review to verify correctness, efficiency, and compliance with business standards. Consultants must therefore shift their focus from writing code from scratch to evaluating AI-generated scripts, debugging inconsistencies, and refining auto-generated logic for better performance.\n\n\n\nThe Role of AI in SAP DevOps and Automated Testing\n\nAnother area where AI is influencing SAP development is in DevOps and system testing. AI-powered tools assist in code validation, regression testing, and automated deployment processes. AI-generated test scripts can identify vulnerabilities before they affect production systems, allowing teams to address potential issues early.\n\nHere again, consultants must still be involved in reviewing test results, adjusting AI-driven assessments, and manually testing areas where automated processes may not be sufficient. As AI takes over routine validation tasks, consultants are expected to focus on higher-level system architecture, security, and performance optimization.\n\n\n\nThe Security Risks of AI-Generated SAP Code\n\nWhile AI-generated SAP code can reduce development time and improve automation, it also introduces new security challenges. AI does not inherently understand business-specific security policies, regulatory constraints, or industry compliance standards. It can generate functional but vulnerable code, exposing SAP systems to potential breaches.\n\nConsultants must now take a more proactive role in security assessments, identifying weak points in AI-generated scripts and ensuring that AI-assisted development follows security best practices. This is especially important in industries with strict regulatory requirements where compliance violations can lead to legal and financial penalties.\n\n\n\nThe Growing Need for AI Governance in SAP Consulting\n\nAI-driven automation also raises concerns about governance and accountability. Organizations using AI-generated SAP configurations must track how AI-driven decisions are made and determine who is responsible for errors or misconfigurations.\n\nSAP is introducing AI governance frameworks to address these concerns, but businesses still require consultants who understand compliance requirements, assess AI-generated outputs, and guide organizations in managing AI-driven automation responsibly.\n\nGovernments and industry regulators are beginning to tighten requirements for AI-generated enterprise software. This includes mandates for explainability, transparency, and auditability of AI-assisted decisions. Consultants who specialize in AI governance, security auditing, and regulatory compliance will find increasing demand as organizations seek expert guidance in navigating new regulations.\n\nSAP professionals must stay ahead of emerging compliance requirements to remain relevant in AI-powered ERP environments. Organizations will look for consultants who can evaluate AI-generated configurations, prevent compliance risks, and guide businesses through AI-driven regulatory audits.\n\n\n\nHow AI is Affecting Hiring Trends\n\nThe job market for SAP consultants is shifting as businesses seek AI expertise.\n\nCompanies value consultants who can work alongside AI, assess AI-driven automation, and apply expertise where automation alone is insufficient.\n\nJob postings increasingly reference experience with AI-driven process automation, AI-assisted development workflows, and AI-powered security and compliance measures. Consultants must develop a working knowledge of AI-driven SAP tools to remain competitive.\n\nSAP professionals who adapt to AI-driven changes will see expanded opportunities in consulting, implementation, and advisory roles. Companies are also looking for SAP consultants who understand AI governance, interpret AI-generated recommendations, and refine AI-driven business processes. The ability to evaluate and adjust AI-generated code, workflows, and automation scripts will be a key differentiator in the hiring market.\n\nOrganizations that lack internal expertise in AI-assisted SAP implementations are seeking external specialists who can guide them through AI adoption.\n\nIndependent consultants who understand AI-driven ERP automation, AI-powered process optimization, and AI-integrated security measures will find high-value contracts.\n\nThe need for traditional SAP consulting skills will persist for some time, particularly in areas like business process knowledge, industry expertise, and integration skills, but the role of AI in SAP is creating new needs.\n\nThe key is to diversify skills, as SAP professionals who rely solely on traditional configuration and development work may see reduced demand for their services. As AI automates routine SAP tasks, businesses will reallocate budgets toward AI-driven consulting expertise rather than manual system customization.\n\n\n\nAI-Focused Training and Certification Paths for SAP Consultants\n\nSAP is offering new certifications and training programs focused on AI-assisted ERP management, AI-driven business process automation, and AI-integrated compliance and security measures.\n\nCourses and certifications focused on SAP AI, SAP Joule, AI-driven security audits, and AI-powered business process automation will become increasingly relevant. Consultants should stay informed about AI-driven SAP advancements and develop expertise in managing AI-assisted system configurations.\n\nSAP professionals must commit to ongoing learning and skill development to remain competitive in AI-driven consulting environments. The most successful consultants will be those who embrace AI-driven tools, refine AI-generated outputs, and guide organizations in adopting AI-powered SAP solutions responsibly.\n\nThe ability to interpret AI-generated configurations, adjust automated workflows, and manage AI-driven risk and compliance factors will define the next era of SAP consulting.\n\n\n\nSAP Consulting in an AI-Powered Future\n\nAI-generated SAP code is reshaping the consulting profession, requiring both functional and technical consultants to develop new skills and adapt to AI-driven automation. The focus is shifting from manual configuration and development to overseeing AI-generated outputs, refining AI-driven business processes, and ensuring compliance with AI governance frameworks.\n\nSAP professionals who embrace AI-driven changes will continue to find opportunities in consulting, AI governance, and AI-assisted business strategy.\n\nThose who develop AI-focused skills, learn AI-assisted security and compliance measures, and adapt to AI-driven ERP workflows will be the ones who thrive in the next generation of SAP consulting.\n\nIf you are an SAP professional looking for a new role in the SAP ecosystem our team of dedicated recruitment consultants can match you with your ideal employer and negotiate a competitive compensation package for your extremely valuable skills, so join our exclusive community at IgniteSAP.",

It brings together the power of SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud and SAP Business Warehouse (BW). And its set-up encourages companies to embrace reusable data products and a data mesh approach.\n\nAt a practical level, SAP Business Data Cloud aims to give customers far greater visibility into business processes, customers, the supply chain, financials etc \u2013 all in real time. There\u2019s no more time wasted, or potential insights lost because of difficulties marrying up data from spreadsheets and disparate systems. Instead, there\u2019s an opportunity to make everything far more efficient. That\u2019s where the magic lies.\n\nCompanies still running SAP BW 7.5 should pay particularly close attention, because that solution is going out of support in 2027. Many organisations still rely on SAP BW to store all their critical business logic \u2013 such as controlling, KPI definitions and approval processes. This is unsurprising, because for years, BW was the only viable way to get data out of the ERP and into a data warehouse for reporting and analytics.\n\nNow, it\u2019s crunch time. With end-of-maintenance for BW 7.5 fast approaching, companies must decide whether to simply move all their legacy business logic to SAP Business Data Cloud, or whether to seize the moment to rewrite their data strategy and reshape how the business works with data. It\u2019s a classic case of migration versus transformation, and we believe many organisations will seize the opportunity to change.\n\nOf course, SAP Business Data Cloud is brand new, so some functionality isn\u2019t available yet, however by switching to SAP Business Data Cloud now, you can take advantage of new functionality as it\u2019s released.

Composed of teachers, parents, community partners, and local leaders, these committees serve North, Central, Southwest, and Southeast DeKalb.\n\nThese committees meet monthly to offer impartial, data-driven recommendations to the Board of Education and District leaders. Their vital contributions include:\n\nProposing equitable boundaries, facility uses, and program enhancements.\n\nIdentifying ways to eliminate inequities and improve academic opportunities for all students.\n\nProviding insights on enhancing family and community engagement in schools.\n\nUltimately, this collaborative \u201creimagining\u201d process focuses on program reviews, community feedback, and potential reorganizations to better serve students and families.\n\nKey Takeaways from the January 29 Session include:\n\nFiscal Responsibility and Redistricting\n\nManaging school capacity is crucial as under-capacity facilities incur high fixed costs such as staffing, safety, and maintenance. It is also essential to redistribute resources effectively to relieve overcrowding in certain schools while addressing the underutilization in others.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Support\n\nFamilies value clear feeder paths from elementary to high school, so adjusting school boundaries based on proximity can effectively address changing demographics. Moreover, consistent transparency through community meetings, social media, and sharing positive school stories will help build trust and reduce resistance to change.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities in Mapping and Planning\n\nCommittee members considered shifting away from rigid geographic zones to models that promote individual choice and acknowledge shared regional boundaries. They suggested redefining educational experiences by increasing hands-on learning opportunities and improving technology for parental engagement, focusing on a 20 to 50-year outlook.\n\nReimagining the School Experience\n\nA thorough analysis of community feedback, enrollment trends, and future workforce demands should inform decisions regarding program placement, transportation needs, and enrollment capacities. Furthermore, District leadership should consider factors beyond immediate enrollment fluctuations. To this end, DCSD is working to design a modern, adaptable system that ensures student continuity while remaining financially sustainable.\n\nDCSD appreciates the feedback from committees as they analyze data and refine proposals. This process allows for reorganizing buildings, boundaries, and programs for the first time in nearly 15 years. Demographic changes and uneven resource use and allocation highlight the need for planning to improve student success.\n\nFollowing the 24-month SAP process, DCSD will review school boundaries every five years to align with E-SPLOST planning and ensure fiscal responsibility. The goal is to provide a high-quality education that prepares students for college, careers, entrepreneurship, or military service, with final recommendations expected by March 2026.\n\nThe upcoming combined meeting will be a District Committee of the Whole for all four regional committees on Wednesday, February 26, at the Administrative Complex at 1701 Mountain Industrial Boulevard in Stone Mountain, from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Meeting videos and more information about the Student Assignment Project are located at dekalbschoolsga.org/SAP.",

            "content": "Submitted By: Jennie Mazzone, Penn State Extension Franklin County Master Gardener Coordinator, and Penn State Mont Alto Forestry Instructor\n\nFebruary is coming to an end. Warmer days are just around the corner, and so is maple sugaring season. Have you ever wondered how the maple tree produces the sweet sap we use to make syrup? Maple sap flow is driven by physiological processes in the tree\u2019s xylem tissue and specific weather conditions.\n\nIn plant biology, we learn that phloem tissue transports the sugars (photosynthate) within the tree, while xylem tissue transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves. However, during the leafless, dormant period of late fall and winter, maples concentrate sugar in their xylem sap. This sugar is produced when ray parenchyma\u2014living cells that extend horizontally through the xylem\u2014use enzymes to convert starch into sucrose. These sugars help protect plant tissues from freezing.\n\nSap flows in late winter/early spring when temperatures alternate between freezing and thawing, below and above 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) respectively. During this time, ice crystals that formed in xylem fiber cells over the winter begin to melt. At the same time, the sucrose produced by the ray parenchyma cells becomes concentrated in the xylem vessels. These processes create positive pressure inside the tree. If the tree is tapped or wounded, the sugar-filled xylem sap leaks out because the positive pressure inside the tree is higher than outside air pressure. When nighttime temperatures drop below freezing, a negative pressure (suction) develops, drawing water into the tree from the soil to replenish what was lost. Once the freeze/thaw cycle ends and the buds break dormancy, the pressure differential inside the tree will stop, and so will the flow of sap from the tap hole.\n\nThe unique anatomy and physiology of maple trees, combined with the environmental conditions of our region, allow sap to flow. However, it is still up to us, the sugar makers, to do the hard work of collecting and boiling sap to produce the sweet, delicious maple syrup product we know and love. Starting with a higher sugar content sap (e.g. sugar maple) can help speed up the process.

University University of Georgia\n\nBurnout from financial stress may lower job satisfaction, new research indicates.\n\nStress from work can often leave people feeling tired and overwhelmed. Anxiety in other parts of life could make this even worse, according to a the new study.\n\nBurnout is a familiar, exhausting feeling to many people. While it\u2019s usually associated with work, outside factors like financial stress may play a role, too.\n\nThe researchers surveyed over 200 full-time employees in the United States and found that current worries about money management may increase levels of burnout and reduce job satisfaction. This hints that stress in one aspect of life can bleed into others.\n\nCamden Cusumano, lead author and doctoral candidate at the University of Georgia\u2019s College of Family and Consumer Sciences, drew a medical parallel: just as injury in one part of the body could lead to pain in another, personal financial stress can manifest in someone\u2019s work performance.\n\nThere are three major signs of burnout: The first is depersonalization, where you feel detached from yourself or those around you. The second is emotional exhaustion, often leaving people feeling sluggish. And lastly, there\u2019s reduced personal accomplishment, where your achievements feel less satisfying.\n\nAll three of these aspects mesh into a feeling that can leave employees tired and disengaged from their work. And while a higher workload or lack of autonomy could be to blame, the researchers wanted to see if factors outside of work had a role in both burnout and job satisfaction.\n\nThrough an online survey, 217 full-time employees voiced their experiences with burnout and how satisfied they are with their jobs. They also answered questions related to current money-management stress and how they felt about their financial security in the future\u2014both key components of financial well-being.\n\nBased on the employees\u2019 responses, those who were more stressed over current money management had a higher rate of burnout, and thus, lower job satisfaction.\n\n\u201cWe call them different life domains. There\u2019s the work domain, there might be the family domain, things like that,\u201d says Cusumano.\n\n\u201cBut sometimes there\u2019s spillover from one to the other. My finances might impact the way I\u2019m feeling about the stress in my family, or if I\u2019m working long hours, that might cause some conflict with my family as well.\u201d\n\nFuture financial concerns may also play a role in job satisfaction. If a worker is feeling stressed about their current position, believing their financial situation may improve could improve their views on their job.\n\n\u201cCurrent money management stress is associated with job satisfaction indirectly through burnout,\u201d says Cusumano. \u201cAnd expected future financial security has a direct association with job satisfaction.\u201d\n\nSo how can you deal with burnout? The researchers say that employees can help ease their worries by staying aware of sources of financial stress in their lives. They compared financial well-being to a resource and note that conserving those resources may help ease anxieties.\n\nEmployers can also play their part in assisting their employees and increasing job satisfaction.\n\n\u201cSome companies are actually providing financial counseling to some of their employees,\u201d says Cusumano. \u201cThey\u2019re paying attention to how finances can really permeate different areas of life.\u201d\n\nPrograms that focus on current financial stress could help improve burnout, while emphasizing how someone\u2019s job can benefit future financial security may improve job satisfaction directly. If employers keep these differences in mind, that could help them design programs that truly benefit their workers.\n\nThe study appears in the Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health.\n\nSource: University of Georgia",

            "content": "SouthCoast family has been making its own maple syrup for 24 years. Here's how they do it.\n\nSEEKONK \u2014 Back in 1999, Mark and Susan Lockwood purchased an 8-acre property they call White Pine Farm dotted with maple and oak trees at 192 Woodland Ave. It was around that time that Mark began reading manuals on the practice of maple sugaring and was inspired to try his own hand at tapping the trees in his backyard.\n\nThat first attempt turned into a hobby 24 years in the making.\n\nIt begins with drilling the first holes into select trees on their property around President\u2019s Day weekend and finishes weeks later with a daylong boil of the sap they've collected. February is a prime time for syrup-making, and this year is no different.\n\n\u201cHe should have been born 100 years ago,\u201d Mark\u2019s wife, Susan, joked. She brought out a jug of pure maple syrup from last season, and as Mark poured some out to sample, she explained they usually end up with more than they use.\n\nSusan said they hardly douse breakfast foods in the sweet stuff, but their son Matt Lockwood said he and his wife, Courtney, \u201cmake it a point\u201d to use the homemade syrup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never sold it,\u201d Mark said. Rather, tree-tapping is a family tradition, not a business, and this weekend, the Lockwood\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, Sarah and Kyle Pelletier, and grandchildren Juliana, Emilia, and Cooper Pelletier, will be over for the \u201cfirst boil\u201d of the season.\n\nSweet treat: Maple syrup is a breakfast staple. Is it healthier for you than sugar?\n\nWhat does the tree-tapping process entail?\n\nMatt admitted that while the process may be \u201cprimitive,\u201d it works, when the weather permits. The best time to tap is when temperatures are below freezing at nighttime and above freezing during the day. This winter\u2019s high wind gusts have stalled the process a bit, Susan said.\n\nWhen the weather is below freezing, maple sap, which is the consistency and color of water, freezes within the tree. But when liquid, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear it start dripping,\u201d Mark Lockwood said, imitating the pinging sound sap makes as it collects. Unlike gummy pine sap, the sap from maple trees is thinner and easier to handle.\n\nThere\u2019s science to drilling into trunk of the tree, Matt said, adding that \u201cit does not hurt the tree,\u201d which, he says, is a common misconception. Following the swell of a root from the ground up to the trunk is a good place to drill, like an artery, Matt said. Similarly, sap flows from the roots to the boughs of maple trees.\n\nEmpty gallon milk jugs do the trick to collect the sap; they shield the sap from bugs and they\u2019re easy to hold and pour from. Once they\u2019re full, the sap gets dumped into bigger buckets, and stored in a walk-in refrigerator temporarily, \u201cor else it\u2019ll sour,\u201d Mark said.\n\nSap is filled with a host of electrolytes and has other health benefits, Matt added, but to sweeten the raw sap and allow it to take on the classic dark amber color, it needs to be boiled.\n\nThough the Lockwoods just invested in a reverse osmosis system, they generally use a homemade outdoor evaporator to begin the boiling process that is later finished in the kitchen.\n\n10Best: The best small-batch American maple syrups to try\n\nHow much of a sticky situation do the Lockwoods find themselves in at the end of the season?\n\nLast year, the Lockwoods placed 41 taps and wound up with 100 gallons of sap. It boiled down to just 3 gallons of syrup.\n\nMark said a 40:1 ratio is a good rule of thumb, with 40 gallons of sap equivalent to 1 gallon of maple syrup. This year, White Pine Farm will only place 25 taps.\n\nThey filtered the sap at around 5:30 a.m., Matt recalled, and lit the fire under the evaporators at 6 a.m., and had to quit before all the sap was boiled because \u201cwe ran out of firewood,\u201d Mark said.\n\n\u201cWe had so much of it,\u201d he said of the sap.\n\nSap boiled for longer makes for thicker syrup.\n\nNow, Mark, 64, and Susan, 62, are hoping to step back from the process as Matt picks up the tradition with the maple trees at his own property in Norton. While tree-tapping is more common in New Hampshire, Vermont, or in western Massachusetts, Matt said, it\u2019s uniquely alive and well in the SouthCoast, too.",

We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes. What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet. A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.\n\n\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City. Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts. As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.\n\nYannick Leclerc Yannick Leclerc, right, runs Maple3 with his business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet\n\nMr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes versus just boiling it into syrup.\" He joined the company back in 2016, three years after it was founded by his business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace. Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings. \"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.\n\nGetty Images \"Tapping\" trees for sap involves drilling holes and attaching a pipe\n\nFor the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033. By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up. Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study. Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits. \"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\" However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.\n\nJeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world. His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go. He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms. \"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says. Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.\n\nGetty Images It is hard to see maple water ever surpass the popularity of maple syrup",

If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 30% which is fairly sustainable.\n\nXTRA:SAP Historic Dividend February 23rd 2025\n\nSAP Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from \u20ac1.00 total annually to \u20ac2.20. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.2% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.\n\nDividend Growth May Be Hard To Achieve\n\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. SAP hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.\n\nIn Summary\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think SAP's payments are rock solid. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for SAP that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is SAP not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Image: ABeam Consulting\n\nUpfront investments in on-premises hardware and software often lead to long-term technology debt.\n\nAs these systems become obsolete, organisations experience performance issues and rising maintenance costs.\n\nHeavy capital investments in hardware can be a financial burden, especially when infrastructure underutilisation occurs.\n\nHow modern ERP addresses public sector pain points\n\nModern ERP systems come equipped with advanced, built-in security features to comply with the latest data protection regulations and address evolving cybersecurity threats.\n\nThese features include encryption, AI-driven threat detection, and multi-factor authentication to safeguard sensitive citizen data.\n\nCloud-based ERP systems offer increased flexibility and scalability by reducing the need for on-premises infrastructure. This enables agencies to adapt to evolving demands without requiring a complete system overhaul.\n\nAdditionally, modern ERP solutions are less expensive to maintain compared to legacy systems, which often incur significant hardware and upkeep costs.\n\nGovernment agencies can improve resource utilisation by adopting scalable cloud infrastructure.\n\nStarting small and scaling as needed ensures cost efficiency, significantly reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to traditional on-premise hosting.\n\nThis eliminates the need for upfront investments in hardware, software, and licenses.\n\nHidden costs, such as operational downtime during updates or migrations, can disrupt services and erode public trust.\n\nRegular software updates across the full solution stack ensure system stability, security, and compliance.\n\nBuilt-in innovation updates help public sector organisations stay ahead of the curve without the hassle of manual upgrades.\n\nIntegrated systems is the foundation for AI innovation\n\nIntegrating ERP systems and data across multiple departments into a centralised platform eliminates silos and provides seamless access to information.\n\n\"When data is no longer scattered and is available for analysis, public sector agencies can harness the full potential of analytics to make well-informed, data-driven decisions,\u201d said Padiyara.\n\nSAP\u2019s S/4HANA ERP software, for example, combines transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP) processing on a single in-memory platform, enabling real-time data processing and analysis.\n\nOLTP systems store and manage day-to-day transactional data, whereas OLAP systems aggregate and analyse data from multiple sources for deeper insights.\n\n\u201cThis eliminates the need for separate systems, allowing organisations to streamline operations and gain instant insights for more informed decision-making,\u201d he explained.\n\nImpact of innovation on public service delivery\n\nPadiyara emphasised the need for public agencies to modernise ERP systems to meet evolving technological and usability demands.\n\nModern ERP solutions offer intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that enhance user satisfaction, reduce learning curves, and facilitate quicker adoption.\n\nAI-driven procurement analytics tools optimise procurement costs by analysing vendor performance and pricing trends.\n\n\u201cAI is also central to Singapore\u2019s Smart Nation initiatives, helping manage infrastructure such as traffic flow and energy usage. In healthcare, AI-driven solutions enhance supply chains by ensuring timely delivery of medical supplies and anticipating demand surges during emergencies,\u201d he added.\n\nABeam Consulting serves as a one-stop shop for implementing SAP\u2019s ERP software, which integrates key business functions, processes, and workflows. Image: ABeam Consulting\n\nAcross various functions, including budgeting, staffing, and inventory management, predictive analytics enable agencies to forecast resource needs, allocate them efficiently, and minimise waste.\n\nMore advanced use cases, such as AI-powered sentiment analysis dashboards, allow agencies to analyse public feedback and improve service delivery.\n\nThe integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices into ERP systems facilitates real-time tracking and management of public infrastructure, such as traffic systems and utilities.\n\nIoT-enabled ERP solutions support predictive maintenance and improved asset management.\n\nMoreover, mobile-first ERP designs empower both citizens and public servants by providing on-the-go access to essential services.\n\nFor example, SAP S/4HANA Finance enables managers to approve purchase orders and invoices in real time through the Fiori mobile app, streamlining financial operations and improving efficiency.\n\nBy modernising ERP systems, public sector agencies can achieve greater transparency and deliver public services that are not only more efficient and secure but also more accessible and innovative.",

            "content": "First of all, I hereby wish Gen. Ibrahim B Babangida (rtd) a most happy 80th birthday anniversary. I say this from the bottom of my heart. I sincerely wish I could reminisce about the lau\u00addatory and gay experiences of this Reporter, who in April 1986 became State House (Dodan Barracks) Cor\u00adrespondent for the leading newsmag\u00adazine of that era, the Newswatch. As experiences go, I could focus on, say my first trip to Abuja, for the 1986 Independence Anniversary. There was no Aso Rock Presidential Villa State House then. A few flats in Wuse Zone Three, very close to the Halli Brothers junction was what could then be called the State House.\n\nIt was in one of the rooms there that I overheard a telephone con\u00adversation that later became conse\u00adquential in Nigeria. Babangida\u2019s Number Two man, Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe (rtd) asked his media aide how things were in Abuja. The aide related to him that a new pro\u00adgramme for the anniversary activi\u00adties had just been released, and that instead of Ukiwe going into the pa\u00adrade grounds (in Area Ten) directly before the military President, that in the new one Ukiwe would enter the parade grounds before the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Domkat Bali, and then Gen Ibrahim B Babangida (rtd) would come in.\n\nI heard Ukiwe say clearly: \u201cIn that case then, I will not come to Abuja. It had been agreed that I will not be attending purely military activities, where Gen Bali would be the Num\u00adber Two after the President. But he too will not attend non-military ac\u00adtivities, where I will be the Number Two to the President\u201d. And because Ukiwe failed to attend the 1986 Abuja ceremonies, he was cashiered.\n\nYet, to write about such would be a disservice to Nigeria. This is especially so as some persons have started a calculated attempt to, by sheer force, browbeat all of us into forgetting the disaster Babangida brought on the nation when he an\u00adnulled the June 12, 1993 election. Be\u00adneath that in order of consequence lies his smuggling of Nigeria into the Organisation of Islamic Coun\u00adtries (OIC) and his introduction of Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) into the country.\n\nRecently, there has been a burst of activities in the Nigerian firmament as Gen. Ibrahim B Babangida\u2019s asso\u00adciates try to paint the legacy of his eight- year long administration in a favourable light for his 80th birthday. But all their efforts may be as fruit\u00adful as deodorized bullshit; it will still smell and appear nasty.\n\nThose same associates of IBB, may not remember it now, but they and their champion had a chance to work out a wholesome legacy but that did not matter to them as they pursued their narrow-minded and personal interests, as against the in\u00adterest of the nation. They were sure and autocratic footed in their des\u00adpotic ways, disdaining all attempts to call them to order or to walk in another direction.\n\nBabangida\n\nThe result is that for almost 30 years Babangida has remained alive to see his name being used as a bye word for nothing wholesome. Before I go into the intricate details, I must take journalistic notice that soon, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s as\u00adsociates will also ask the citizenry to be magnanimous enough as to grant Buhari stratospheric pass marks concerning the way and manner he ran his administration. In fact, Bu\u00adhari said recently that he hoped his\u00adtory would be fair to him. On reading him, I wondered if he does not know that the moment he assumed office as President, he started writing his personal and his administration\u2019s history. Attempting to change that history after he would have left office would be akin to someone blowing against the wind. Even Babangida himself has shown us how to judge Buhari; he said that compared to is successors\u2019, (and that includes Buhari\u2019s), his own anti-corruption record appears angelic. Ah ha!\n\nSo, what I have for the likes of the newspaper columnist and Econo\u00admist, Mr. Dele Sobowale, is serious pity, as he attempts to present Baban\u00adgida in more favourable light. It is a mission impossible.\n\nI know that the likes of Sobowale have argued that it is satanic to judge a man whose presidency spanned all of eight years on just one act; his an\u00adnulment of the June 12, 1993 election. Some have even argued that 28 long years have passed since 1993 and so Nigeria must have had several op\u00adportunities since then to correct that mistake, no matter how costly. To such people I have only a reminder: \u201c\u00e4 fool does not know the gravity of an offence\u201d. IBB and Dele Sobowale are no fools but verybright minds, and so they should know the grav\u00adity of that terrible offence. There is another reminder; societal wounds are difficult to heal. I sincerely wish that the present leaders should take this lesson to heart and begin to correct their mistakes, because the since 2015, Nigeria\u2019s unity has been steadily shredded.\n\nUnlike coup speeches, Indepen\u00addence Anniversary addresses are often well-prepared documents and are signpost for the future. On Oc\u00adtober 1, 1995, IBB pointed out four main problems with the Nigerian economy which he had to tackle. One; \u201cDecrease in our domestic pro\u00adduction while our population con\u00adtinues to rise\u201d. But did the domestic production increase under IBB? No, is the answer. Many manufacturing plants began to close under Buhari\u2019s military administration owing to a lack of raw materials. But this indus\u00adtrial sickness turned an epidemic under IBB. And that trend has yet to be reversed.\n\nTwo; \u201cDependence on imports for both consumer goods and industrial raw materials\u201d. Yes, IBB vowed to change that trend, but he failed woe\u00adfully. That failure has been replicated by every succeeding administration.\n\nThree; \u201cA grossly widening gap between the rich and the poor.\u201d That gap became really accentuated for the first time during IBB\u2019s regime and has only worsened afterwards.\n\nFour; \u201cThe big role played by the public sector in economic activities with hardly any concrete results to justify such a role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn that speech IBB announced a ban on the importation of maize, rice and vegetable oil to \u201cshift attention from buying and selling syndrome ad parasitic services \u2026to increased total real production, rising labour productivity and greater efficiency in investment\u201d. Please, could anyone point out in which way IBB\u2019s regime succeeded in any of the above points.\n\nIn his 1986 Independence Anni\u00adversary speech, IBB promised to: 1; Restructure and diversify the productive base of the economy to reduce dependence on the oil sector and imports. 2; To achieve a fiscal balance of payments viability over the medium term and 3; to lay the basis for a suitable non-inflationary growth over the medium and long-term. Did he succeed?\n\nNew Year day 1986, IBB increased petrol pump price from 20kobo per li\u00adtre to 39.5 kobo; a near 100% increase. That introduced Nigeria\u2019s to IBB\u2019s legacy \u2013 Structural Adjustment Programme. I am not an Economist but I am ready to debate any pro-IBB Economist on the effects of SAP.\n\nYet, SAP had actually started on January 27, 1986, when IBB in\u00adtroduced the Second-tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM). In two weeks flat the value of the Naira fell by 66%. In January 1985, the N1 fetched $1.2. Within five months of SFEM, five Naira bought a dollar, at the official rate and it was N7 to $1 at the parallel market. The 5.4 pre- SFEM inflation rate surged to 10.2 within a year.\n\nSince then, the economy has been crashing and crashing. Let nobody tell me about the Third Mainland Bridge or the Rural Life for Women but instead tell me how IBB grew the economy and jobs. My challenge is mainly directed at Mr. Dele Sobow\u00adale for he is an Economist. Sobowale and the other Babangidaists whould be ready after that to join me in re\u00advisiting the June 12, 1993 election annulment and the result of IBB\u2019s smuggling Nigeria into the Organi\u00adsation of Islamic Countries.\n\nBabangida has not apologised to Nigerians for foisting SAP on the na\u00adtion. He has not appologised to the nation for smuggling Nigeria into the OIC and thus added, by that sin\u00adgular act, the religious divide that is tearing Nigeria apart today, into the age-old ethnicity issues. Now ethnic\u00adity and religious divide have turned Nigeria into a killing field.\n\nThen there is the Babangidanom\u00adics which was hinged solely on SAP. He has not yet appologised for it. Not even when ani-SAP riots broke out in May 1989 did he plead with Nige\u00adrians or try to seek a better route to economic paradise for Nigeria. He berated Nigerians then, saying that the rioters were merely using SAP \u201cas an excuse to wage war against the government in order to destroy the credibility of the military insti\u00adtution\u201d.\n\nA month after that, at the inaugu\u00adration of the Armed Forces Consul\u00adtative Assembly on June 5, Babangi\u00adda told critics of SAP that he would not change the direction he was tak\u00ading Nigeria to economically because: \u201cThis administration is committed to the programme because there is no viable alternative. We cannot and should not abandon this programme midway because the pains of trying to re-introduce it at a later stage will be worse than the current pains\u201d.\n\nAnd he actually said this then, to justify the SAP decisions: \u201cThe re\u00adports we have received and which we would like the opponents of SAP to know is that the prevailing situation in Nigeria is by far better than in any other African country. It is even bet\u00adter than the condition in most Third World states\u201d.\n\nDid Babangida bother to listen to the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN)? Actually, Baban\u00adgida listened to nobody. Had he a listening ear, he would have heard MAN\u2019s complain in August 1988, that capacity utilization was a lowly 35 percent \u201cbecause of inadequate and inefficient infrastructural facilities, high interest rates, especially for the small and medium-scale manufac\u00adturing enterprises, sharp increas\u00ades in the cost of imported inputs arising from the devaluation of the Naira\u201d.\n\nAnd on top of all the social and economic and religious problems Babangida unleashed on Nigeri\u00adans, he annulled the freest and fair\u00adest election in the land to date. And what is his excuse: that he was forced to do so or there would have been a violent overthrow of the civilian re\u00adgime that would have resulted. Haba, IBB, haba, have you forgotten the person who said, proudly, satiated with power, that his critics should remember that \u201cwe are not only in government; we are in power?\u201d Why didn\u2019t he use that power to retire the coupists if he knew what they were up to? Instead, he used the power to annul an election. IBB is 80 years old. I will respect his age and even pay due homage. That is why I am seeking soft ways of telling him that even his Number Two man, the late Augustus Aikhomu was not aware of his decision to annul that elec\u00adtion. The Military High Command did not know. His spokesman, Duro Onabule, did not know. His political advisers such as the late Prof Omo Omoruyi did not know.\n\nIBB annulled that election be\u00adcause he wanted to remain in pow\u00ader. And for that, he owes Nigeria an apology.\n\nPS:\n\nFirst published in this column on Aug 15, 2021, this piece is being republished in response to the recent launch of IBB\u2019s autobiography, \u201cA Journey in Service\u201d.",

When we realized that, that's when we got started in doing all this.\"\n\nJust because nature provides the trees doesn't mean easy work for the family.\n\nWeather dictates each sap-collecting season, and the farm is grateful that 2025 is off to a much better start compared to 2024.\n\nWRTV\n\n\"The cold weather, the great winter temperatures and the snow has made this a really great season,\" Patrick Deak explained. \"We've collected over 1,200 gallons of sap so far.\"\n\nIn order for the sap to start flowing in the trees, temperatures during the day need to warm above the freezing mark. Temperatures at night need to cool back into the 20s.\n\n\"That is the perfect sap running season!\" Patrick Deak exclaimed.\n\nIf the farm knows temperatures will be near this criteria, they will drill holes into the trees, insert spiles into the hole, and then hang a blue collection bag under the hole. This year, they tapped their first tree on January 26.\n\nWRTV\n\nWhen temperatures warm during the day, the pressure inside the tree also increases. This pushes the sap out of the tree, through the drilled hole, and into the collection bag.\n\nAt night, when temperatures cool and pressure decreases, the flow of sap stops.\n\nOther factors that influence how much sap is produced are how much rain we have in the fall or how much snow we have in the winter because this provides moisture into the ground.\n\n\"Everything that we do is dependent on the weather,\" Patrick Deak said.\n\nWRTV\n\nCollecting sap to be made into maple syrup isn't a full-time job for the Deaks, but this hobby still includes three to four hours of collecting sap each night during the season.\n\nThe farm hopes their collection will run all the way through mid-March. In the few years they have been operating, their record for sap collection is 2,500 gallons. They are hopeful this year for a yield of 3,000 gallons.\n\n\"That will give us only about 75 gallons of syrup, which for us is a lot of syrup,\" Patrick Deak said. \"That's a lot of pancakes!\"\n\nWhen temperatures are consistently in the 40s or 50s, that is when trees begin to bud. This is usually the end of the collection season because sap starts to turn bitter.\n\nWRTV\n\nIt got warm quickly in 2024, which meant that the season ended early. This was on top of other problems caused by weather.\n\n\"It was really dry, so when sap did run, it didn't run very well,\" Patrick Deak explained. \"It was a very light season.\"\n\nOnce all the sap is collected, the farm will then turn it into maple syrup. It is bottled and eventually sold at farmer's markets.",

It is known to be effective in improving osteoporosis, promoting immunity, improving high blood pressure, preventing osteoporosis, and relieving hangovers due to its rich mineral content.\n\nAccording to Gyeongsangbuk-do Province on the 22nd, the sap of Goroseo in the province will be collected in earnest from the middle of this month in Ulleungdo Island, including Umsan Goroseo.\n\nAmong them, the Umbrella Monozo sap is known to have excellent purity and quality due to the influence of the marine climate and clean environment. It is characterized by a higher sugar content than other saponins, which have a unique ginseng scent.\n\nFor stable collection of elixir sap, it is important to work at a time when the appropriate temperature persists. It is best when the daily temperature is more than 10 degrees Celsius under the condition that the minimum temperature at night is below minus 2.1 degrees Celsius and the maximum temperature during the day is below 10.6 degrees Celsius. Due to the nature of the harvest, it can only be collected and eaten from winter to early spring, so if you miss this period, you have to wait until next year.\n\nMonozoan sap is recognized as a filial piety crop that gives additional income to forestry workers due to its various effects. As a result, it is contributing to the improvement of forestry income by collecting elixir sap in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeongsangnam-do, Jeollanam-do, and Gangwon-do. According to the Korea Forest Service, as of the end of 2023, 13.2 billion won in annual income was generated from the collection of elixir fluid nationwide. The price of elixir sap varies slightly from region to region and is distributed at various packaging prices.\n\nAn official from Gyeongsangbuk-do said, \"We are also conducting on-site inspections of areas permitted for liquid collection, including compliance with correct collection methods. We are striving to maintain the quality of liquid to ensure safe food.\"",

            "content": "For decades, SAP was known as an \u201cengineers\u2019 company\u201d due to its complex enterprise management software, which traditionally required lengthy implementation processes and large teams of specialists. However, in the age of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, the German company is evolving its software to be so user-friendly that users can simply ask a question to get the information they need. Quite literally, SAP\u2019s software is learning to \u201ctalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe customer can now \u2018talk\u2019 to the management system,\u201d said Adriana Aroulho, president of SAP Brasil. \u201cFor example, they can ask, \u2018How are sales in the North region?\u2019 and get the data immediately. It\u2019s much easier.\u201d\n\nThis new interface is a result of SAP\u2019s development of digital agents. These are intelligent software tools capable of gathering data from different sources within an organization\u2019s internal systems to provide consistent and rapid answers to business inquiries.\n\nThe goal is for users to interact with these systems as intuitively as they would with general-purpose assistants like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini.\n\nBy the end of the year, SAP plans to launch 25 digital agents, completing the project. Three are already available, supporting sales, services, and finance functions. Voice command capabilities will be gradually introduced.\n\nAt the same time, SAP aims to attract more companies to its Business Technology Platform (BTP), where clients can develop their own automation tools or digital agents and share development insights within the user community.\n\n\u201cVarious programming languages are supported, and everything is protected by compliance rules to ensure data privacy,\u201d Ms. Aroulho said. These rules comply with advanced data protection laws, such as Brazil\u2019s General Data Protection Law (LGPD) and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nDigital agents are the most visible part of SAP\u2019s strategy to maintain the relevance of its management software\u2014which automates functions such as supply chain, accounting, and inventory management\u2014while extending its influence as cloud computing becomes the dominant business environment.\n\nThis strategy is driven by the growing importance of business data in decision-making and the need for companies to access this data quickly through the cloud. \u201cData is the most valuable asset. If digital platforms aren\u2019t fed with high-quality business data, they become limited,\u201d Ms. Aroulho said.\n\nSAP has shifted away from the traditional software licensing model. While it continues to support legacy clients who use licensed software, the company is focused on migrating customers to the cloud, where all new clients are onboarded.\n\nThis transition not only reduces the high infrastructure costs associated with running traditional software\u2014since clients now acquire computing power as a service\u2014but also paves the way for the growth of artificial intelligence applications.\n\nApproach to AI\n\nUnlike some competitors, SAP chose not to develop its own large language model (LLM), which typically powers virtual assistants. \u201cThat was never our purpose,\u201d Ms. Aroulho said. Instead, SAP made its platform compatible with all existing LLMs, giving customers the freedom to choose the AI model that best suits their needs.\n\nHowever, SAP did develop a generative AI copilot called Joule, which is integrated with other systems and plays a key role in the new user-friendly interface.\n\nOne example from SAP\u2019s own operations is in human resources. Using Joule, managers can automate the setting of objectives for their team members, streamlining the performance evaluation process. The tool can also assist in recruitment by crafting job postings after a \u201cconversation\u201d about the role\u2019s requirements and then publishing them on authorized platforms.\n\nSAP ended fiscal year 2024 with revenue of \u20ac34.18 billion, a 10% increase from 2023. Cloud revenue reached \u20ac17.14 billion, 25% higher than the previous year, underscoring the company\u2019s strategic shift. Net income for the year was \u20ac5.28 billion, a 22% increase from 2023. For the current year, SAP expects cloud revenue to grow by 26% to 28%, reaching between \u20ac21.6 billion and \u20ac21.9 billion.\n\nWhile SAP does not disclose results by country, Brazil was highlighted as one of the standout performers during the earnings announcement at the end of January. The strong performance was driven by the rapid migration of Brazilian clients to the cloud, Ms. Aroulho said.",

It now offers a workshop designed to transform AI adoption into a structured, achievable process. Tailored support focuses on scaling AI initiatives confidently and responsibly in cloud solutions from SAP.\n\nAdding a business AI accelerator workshop to SAP Preferred Success demonstrates SAP\u2019s commitment to going beyond advancing technology adoption. Combining deep expertise, strategic frameworks, and cutting-edge AI capabilities, the workshop helps empower companies to unlock their full potential with bold innovations and measurable business outcomes.\n\nSetting a transformative foundation for AI integration\n\nSupported by a comprehensive framework, the business AI accelerator workshop provides essential knowledge, strategic frameworks, and a clear action plan to leverage AI for improved business processes, data-driven decision-making, and enhanced customer experiences. But what makes this new addition remarkable is its focus on delivering reliable, relevant, and responsible AI.\n\nGet more done faster with AI that actually understands all your business processes and data Learn more\n\nEnhanced with the software industry\u2019s broadest data sets, the service can integrate AI into business processes while upholding the highest standards of ethics, data privacy, and governance. This can enable companies to embrace AI with trust and transparency while achieving tangible outcomes.\n\nAccelerating time to value is another key benefit of the workshop. By rapidly deploying AI models and solutions, organizations can quickly realize the benefits of automation, optimization, and data-driven decision-making. They can participate in tailored sessions to identify high-impact use cases that align with their unique needs and plan a road map for simplifying the complexities of integrating AI capabilities into existing processes.\n\nBeyond its technical strengths, the workshop emphasizes effective change management and comprehensive governance. These practices can foster organizational buy-in, strengthen compliance, and support a smooth transition to AI-driven operations.

It begins by introducing foundational business AI concepts, SAP\u2019s AI strategy, and the AI services available from SAP. This initial overview highlights AI\u2019s possibilities, helping organizations understand its potential impact on business operations.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the workshop conducts an AI readiness assessment of the customer\u2019s SAP landscape, IT infrastructure, and overall consumption behavior. This evaluation identifies suitable AI use cases and establishes a tailored road map for AI adoption.\n\nIn parallel, the workshop can strengthen governance, compliance, and ethical considerations by establishing a comprehensive data governance framework. This helps ensure data accuracy, legality, privacy, and security across AI applications, enabling organizations to maintain high data quality, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder trust while mitigating legal risks.\n\nChange management is another essential component of the workshop. Organizations can learn best practices for AI adoption in SAP solutions, including strategies to secure organizational buy-in, reduce resistance, and transition smoothly into AI-driven operations.\n\nNext, a resource and skill set evaluation is conducted to help identify gaps in AI expertise. Organizations can leverage this information to build a skilled team capable of effectively adopting AI solutions and sustaining long-term success.\n\nThe workshop then focuses on strategic use-case identification, guiding participants through interactive sessions to uncover high-value AI opportunities aligned with business goals. This process can provide customers with AI use cases tailored to meet each organization\u2019s specific needs and strategic objectives.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, organizations can gain a comprehensive action plan that helps transform insights into execution\u2014driving AI adoption with confidence while fostering co-innovation and collaborative growth.\n\nShaping the future with AI and innovation at the core\n\nWe at SAP and our customers can work together to shape a future where technology drives meaningful impact with the business AI accelerator workshop. Whether identifying impactful use cases relevant for business or adopting AI-driven solutions, organizations can maximize the value of their technology investments and help ensure lasting outcomes with greater agility, scalability, and efficiency.\n\nDiscover how the SAP Preferred Success offering can guide your organization toward bold innovation, measurable outcomes, and lasting success.\n\nKiron Satyavarapu is global solution owner of SAP Preferred Success at SAP.",

            "content": "Arguably the world\u2019s hottest major enterprise-software company, SAP has more than enough market momentum to entice any ISV in the world to jump at the prospect of forming a partnership \u2014 so who is Databricks and why did SAP select it to join forces in launching the SAP Business Data Cloud?\n\nAnd by the same measure, why is Databricks touting its willingness to pour $250 million into ensuring success for Business Data Cloud customers and ecosystem partners?\n\nWith the position SAP now holds in the market \u2014 Q4 Business Suite revenue up 35% to $4.1 billion and total cloud backlog up 41% to a whopping $65.8 billion \u2014 SAP could have forged a partnership with any one of a slew of specialized data-engineering companies. And the reason it picked Databricks is the reason that more and more Cloud Wars Top 10 are making moves of various kinds: to give themselves the ability to meet the explosive demands from their customers for AI solutions and services that can drive big-time business transformations and superb business outcomes.\n\nSimplifying the Data World for Customers\n\nIn launching its new Business Data Cloud, SAP said it wanted to make it much easier and much faster for customers to be able to take full advantage of all of their data, both inside and outside SAP systems, by providing a \u201cunified experience that delivers transformational insights across all lines of business.\u201d From the Feb. 13 press release:\n\n\u201cToday, SAP announced SAP Business Data Cloud, a fully managed software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution that unifies and governs all SAP data and seamlessly connects with third-party data. As an evolution of our industry-leading data, planning, and analytics solutions, SAP Business Data Cloud brings together SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud, and SAP Business Warehouse with a unified experience that delivers transformational insights across all lines of business.\u201d\n\nThe big challenge SAP had to overcome was how to ensure that this vision would include not only the structured data already in SAP systems, but also the unstructured data that is so incredibly vital in fueling powerful and relevant AI capabilities.\n\nIn an interview with cnbc.com, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi recently outlined what I believe is the overarching strategy behind the partnership, which not only vaults SAP into the red-hot data-cloud category but adds significant additional momentum to its hypergrowth arc that Databricks said now equates to an annualized run rate of $3 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Databricks Lakehouse architecture lets you blend structured data that people generally used for BI workloads, which is the kind of stuff that tells you about the past, together with unstructured data, which is the main source for AI,\u201d Ghodsi said on the cnbc.com interview.\n\n\u201cNow get one platform where you have all that data, and the data scientists can go ahead and build agents that actually learn on that data. We call this \u2018data intelligence\u2019: the AI understands the data that you have inside SAP.\u201d\n\nFor all of its prowess with data residing in its own systems that power a huge chunk of the global economy, SAP understood that the AI Revolution requires it to be able to extend rapidly and aggressively into the world of unstructured data to enable its Business AI solutions \u2014 and the fruits of its new Business Data Cloud \u2014 to be able to yield the best possible insights for customers.\n\nSAP said that by bringing \u201cthe power of Databricks directly into SAP Business Data Cloud,\u201d the two companies are opening the door to \u201ca new era in enterprise data management, with two leaders in their domains coming together to redefine how applications and data platforms work together.\u201d\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nIn the Databricks announcement of the partnership, SAP product-engineering leader Muhammad Alam said the partnership \u201crepresents a turning point in how enterprise data is harnessed\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re fusing SAP\u2019s proven expertise in mission-critical applications with Databricks\u2019 cutting-edge data engineering and AI capabilities to help our customers unlock the next era of digital innovation.\u201d\n\nBefitting such an ambitious outlook, Databricks said it is prepared to pump $250 million into ensuring successful outcomes for customers and partners, which represents a commitment in both capability and financial heft that was for SAP no doubt a non-negotiable element of the deal. In that context, here are three key factors behind SAP\u2019s selection of Databricks for this hugely important initiative that I\u2019ve excerpted from the Databricks announcement:\n\nThe financial commitment: \u201cDatabricks recently announced $15B in fundraising and intends to earmark a quarter of a billion dollars ($250M) to help make customers and system integrator partners successful with SAP Databricks across deployment and migrations, ultimately unlocking the tremendous business value of SAP data.\u201d Boosting the value of SAP data for AI: \u201cSAP applications power enterprises\u2019 most important decisions around business planning, procurement, HR and travel management. Every enterprise wants to maximize the value of their SAP data by combining it with data from their other business-critical systems. Yet, those systems are varied, and many still sit on-premises in legacy platforms, making it difficult to develop advanced analytics and AI applications. SAP Databricks will have all the relevant datasets enriched and ready to be used for everything from data warehousing to building AI that can reason on that data.\u201d Foundation for \u201cdomain-specific AI applications\u201d: \u201cEvery organization is searching for a faster, more reliable way to translate their data into strategic advantage,\u201d said Ghodsi. \u201cTogether with SAP, we\u2019re helping businesses seamlessly unify their data sources, streamline analytics, and accelerate the development of domain-specific AI applications.\u201d\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

            "content": "December 2024 witnessed a landmark moment in enterprise AI: the announcement of Salesforce Agentforce 2.0. Amid a flurry of AI agent launches from Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP, Salesforce took center stage, redefining the conversation around AI-driven business automation. At the Agentforce 2.0 event, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff declared, \u201cThe AI revolution isn\u2019t coming\u2014it\u2019s here.\u201d With its pre-trained autonomous agents, low-code Agentforce Builder, and deep integration with Salesforce Data Cloud and Slack, Agentforce 2.0 cemented Salesforce\u2019s position as the leader in AI-powered digital workforces.\n\nBut Salesforce isn\u2019t the only major player in this space. Since December, Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP have been rolling out their own AI-powered agents, each claiming to revolutionize how businesses operate. Here\u2019s how these platforms compare in the battle for AI agent supremacy.\n\nWorkday\u2019s AI Agent Strategy: HR & Finance Automation\n\nWorkday\u2019s AI ambitions center on HR and finance, where it already serves as the system of record for workforce data. Its latest innovation, the Workday Agent System of Record, provides a governance framework for both human employees and AI-powered agents, ensuring seamless automation. More significantly, Workday is pioneering role-based AI agent descriptions, enabling enterprises to define and standardize AI agent roles for enhanced discovery, selection, and composition. This framework allows AI agents to integrate into structured workforce environments with predefined capabilities, much like APIs for enterprise automation.\n\nWorkday\u2019s role-based AI agents include:\n\nContracts Agent : Extracts key obligations from contracts and automates follow-ups.\n\n: Extracts key obligations from contracts and automates follow-ups. Payroll Agent : Monitors payroll transactions and flags anomalies in real time.\n\n: Monitors payroll transactions and flags anomalies in real time. Policy Agent: Enforces HR policies and provides proactive guidance.\n\nBy leveraging Workday Illuminate, its AI platform that processes over 800 billion transactions annually, Workday ensures its AI agents are deeply embedded in HR and finance operations. Furthermore, Workday\u2019s role-based metadata standardization could shape the future of enterprise AI marketplaces, much like standardized APIs transformed software integration. This approach contrasts with Salesforce Agentforce\u2019s more customer-facing automation focus.\n\nServiceNow\u2019s AI Agent Strategy: Enterprise Workflow Orchestration\n\nServiceNow is positioning itself as the control tower for AI agents across IT, customer service, and HR workflows. Its AI Agent Orchestrator and AI Agent Studio empower organizations to:\n\nCoordinate multiple AI agents across different business units.\n\nacross different business units. Build custom AI agents with a no-code interface .\n\nwith a . Deploy pre-built AI agents that integrate with ITSM, HR, and security workflows.\n\nServiceNow\u2019s Workflow Data Fabric ensures AI agents have real-time access to enterprise-wide data. Unlike Salesforce Agentforce, which enhances CRM workflows, ServiceNow\u2019s focus is on cross-functional enterprise automation, particularly in IT service management (ITSM).\n\nSAP\u2019s AI Agent Strategy: Enterprise-Wide AI & Data Governance\n\nSAP is embedding AI across its massive ERP footprint, with Joule AI agents driving automation across finance, supply chain, HR, and customer service. Key differentiators include:\n\nSAP Business Data Cloud : A unified data platform integrating SAP and non-SAP data.\n\n: A unified data platform integrating SAP and non-SAP data. SAP Knowledge Graph : Context-aware AI reasoning across enterprise processes.\n\n: Context-aware AI reasoning across enterprise processes. AI Agent Builder: Low-code tools for creating industry-specific AI agents.\n\nSAP\u2019s strength lies in its ability to link AI agents across business processes\u2014from procurement to order-to-cash\u2014whereas Salesforce Agentforce excels in sales, service, and marketing automation.\n\nHow Salesforce Agentforce 2.0 Stands Apart\n\nWhile Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP focus on back-office automation, Salesforce Agentforce is built for customer-facing AI workflows. Its key features include:\n\nPre-trained AI Agents : Industry-specific AI agents ready to automate sales, service, and marketing tasks.\n\n: Industry-specific AI agents ready to automate sales, service, and marketing tasks. Agentforce Builder : Low-code customization tools.\n\n: Low-code customization tools. Slack Integration : AI agents embedded in Slack for real-time collaboration .\n\n: AI agents embedded in . Salesforce Data Cloud: AI agents act on real-time customer data.\n\nCompetitive Breakdown: Where Each Vendor Stands\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how these vendor strategies compare.\n\nVendor Primary AI Agent Focus Data Foundation Key Differentiator Salesforce CRM & Customer Engagement Salesforce Data Cloud Deep CRM integration & Slack capabilities Workday HR & Finance Automation Workday Illuminate Governance of AI agents in workforce management & Role-based AI metadata ServiceNow IT & Workflow Automation Workflow Data Fabric Multi-agent orchestration across business units SAP End-to-End Business Processes SAP Business Data Cloud & Knowledge Graph Cross-functional AI agents spanning multiple SAP modules\n\nThe Future of AI Agent Interoperability\n\nAs enterprise AI adoption accelerates, organizations will increasingly rely on AI agents from multiple vendors to streamline workflows, automate decisions, and enhance business agility. While today\u2019s AI-powered platforms\u2014Salesforce Agentforce, Workday AI Agents, ServiceNow AI Orchestration, and SAP Joule\u2014largely operate within their respective ecosystems, the industry is moving toward a future where AI agents from different vendors collaborate seamlessly across enterprise functions.\n\nThis AI Agent Workflow Diagram illustrates how enterprise AI agents from Workday, ServiceNow, and Salesforce could interact with HR, IT, and sales functions. The sequence diagram showcases AI-driven automation in payroll processing, IT service management, and customer engagement, highlighting seamless data flow across ERP, CRM, and enterprise data cloud systems. Source: SalesforceDevops.net\n\nTo illustrate this vision, we present the following diagram, which imagines a multivendor AI agent ecosystem where intelligent agents work together to fulfill distinct enterprise roles. In this scenario:\n\nHR Managers leverage Workday AI Agents to automate payroll processing, enforce policies, and ensure compliance, while connecting with financial systems via ERP.\n\nto automate payroll processing, enforce policies, and ensure compliance, while connecting with financial systems via ERP. IT Administrators rely on ServiceNow AI Orchestration to manage IT support tickets, predict infrastructure failures, and ensure system security, with real-time insights from enterprise data clouds.\n\nto manage IT support tickets, predict infrastructure failures, and ensure system security, with real-time insights from enterprise data clouds. Sales Representatives use Salesforce AI Agents to retrieve customer insights, personalize engagement, and drive revenue growth through CRM-integrated automation.\n\nThese AI agents don\u2019t just execute tasks\u2014they communicate, share insights, and adapt in real time to enterprise needs. In a fully interoperable landscape, AI agents could dynamically integrate with multiple systems, exchanging structured knowledge through standardized frameworks. This level of cooperation would enable enterprises to:\n\nReduce silos by creating a network of AI-driven assistants across business units.\n\nby creating a network of AI-driven assistants across business units. Improve decision-making with AI agents that analyze and respond to cross-functional data.\n\nwith AI agents that analyze and respond to cross-functional data. Enhance efficiency through automation that is not limited by vendor ecosystems.\n\nThe Embedded AI Agent Battle Is Just Beginning\n\nWhile we are still in the early stages of AI agent adoption, companies are already laying the groundwork for this future. As vendors refine their agent architectures, interoperability will be key to unlocking the full potential of AI-driven automation. The race is on to define the standards, governance, and technical frameworks that will bring this multivendor AI agent landscape to life.\n\nEach vendor is leveraging its system-of-record dominance to deliver AI agents that streamline workflows. While Salesforce is pushing AI-powered digital workers for front-office automation, Workday is focusing on AI governance in HR/Finance, ServiceNow is orchestrating AI-driven ITSM, and SAP is embedding AI across enterprise operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\n2025 will reveal how enterprises adopt these AI agents. Will companies embrace multiple AI agent platforms, or will one vendor dominate enterprise AI automation?\n\nOne thing is clear: the age of AI-powered digital workers is here, and the battle for AI agent supremacy is just beginning.\n\nMoreover, Salesforce and Workday have a history of technical alliance announcements, signaling potential for deeper collaboration. Adam Evans, Salesforce AI GM, in a recent press release, explicitly endorsed Workday\u2019s agentefforts, reinforcing the strategic importance of standardized AI agent definitions. This alignment could pave the way for enhanced AI agent interoperability across platforms and accelerate the evolution of enterprise AI marketplaces, where role-based agents are seamlessly discoverable, composable, and deployable.",

            "content": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that SAP SE ( ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does SAP Carry?\n\nAs you can see below, at the end of December 2024, SAP had \u20ac11.4b of debt, up from \u20ac7.17b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. On the flip side, it has \u20ac11.2b in cash leading to net debt of about \u20ac208.0m.\n\nA Look At SAP's Liabilities\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that SAP had liabilities of \u20ac19.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of \u20ac9.24b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of \u20ac11.2b and \u20ac7.48b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by \u20ac9.60b.\n\nSince publicly traded SAP shares are worth a very impressive total of \u20ac321.4b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. But either way, SAP has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nSAP has barely any net debt, as demonstrated by its net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.022. Happily, it actually managed to receive more interest than it paid, over the last year. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like an Olympic ice-skater handles a pirouette. Another good sign is that SAP has been able to increase its EBIT by 26% in twelve months, making it easier to pay down debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if SAP can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find to be interesting.\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, SAP produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 70% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\n\nOur View\n\nSAP's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its net debt to EBITDA also supports that impression! Overall, we don't think SAP is taking any bad risks, as its debt load seems modest. So the balance sheet looks pretty healthy, to us. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

            "content": "Organizations with limited experience in the SAP ecosystem may face a steeper learning curve during initial adoption. Teams heavily invested in diverse technology stacks should carefully plan integration strategies. The platform\u2019s comprehensive nature may present complexity challenges for smaller development teams without proper training and support.\n\nAdoption streamlines application development workflows by reducing reliance on senior developers while preserving enterprise-grade quality. Organizations can expect faster project delivery using lower-skilled resources, though initial training on SAP-specific tools is required. IT organizations benefit from standardized development patterns and reduced maintenance, thanks to CAP\u2019s built-in best practices.\n\nDevelopment time directly impacts market competitiveness and operational costs. As business demands rapidly outpace IT budgets and development resources, these tools can serve as a differentiator, enabling teams to meet and exceed goals. Each month of delay brings missed market opportunities, mounting technical debt, and increasing strain on limited developer resources.\n\nBy leveraging CAP, the advantages of faster application development and reduced development effort extend beyond deployment to reduce the full lifecycle costs of enterprise development.\n\nSAP Build takes an innovative approach to enterprise application development by combining Joule, an AI-powered development tool, with the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) to deliver a unified platform that accelerates development while enforcing enterprise-grade best practices and standardization.\n\n1. Solution Value\n\nToday\u2019s enterprises struggle to deliver business-critical applications amid scarce senior developer resources and mounting technical debt. Traditional development approaches require extensive coordination between business units and development teams, creating bottlenecks that delay digital transformation initiatives and slow market responsiveness.\n\nSAP Build transforms this landscape by combining the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) with AI-powered development tools. In benchmark testing, the platform demonstrated extraordinary efficiency gains: 3x greater development velocity and a 59% reduction in overall workload compared to traditional approaches.\n\nBy providing pre-built components, standardized patterns, and automated testing tools, SAP Build enables organizations to accelerate development while maintaining enterprise-grade quality. The platform\u2019s integration with SAP systems and AI-assisted development (including for mobile) has shown particular strength in reducing time on task, with time spent on specific actions cut by 30%. Most significantly, these gains are achieved while reducing dependency on senior developers\u2014allowing organizations to scale their development capacity without compromising standards or accumulating technical debt.\n\n2. Urgency and Risk\n\nScarcity of experienced developers, particularly senior-level talent where salaries have risen over 25% since 2021, and mounting technical debt force organizations to make critical decisions about their application development strategies. The growing compensation requirements for senior developers, now averaging $150,000-$175,000 annually in major markets, combined with fierce competition for their skills, intensifies the need for solutions that can effectively leverage junior and mid-level talent. Delays in modernizing development practices directly impact market competitiveness and operational costs.\n\nUrgency\n\nSAP Build effectively addresses escalating development resource constraints through its AI-assisted development environment and Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). The benchmark study validates this approach, demonstrating that SAP Build requires 59% less development effort than traditional methods and improves development velocity by 3x.\n\nFor enterprises, these efficiency gains translate to immediate business impact:\n\nIndustries with customer-facing requirements like financial services, retail, utilities, and telecommunications can deploy new features in days instead of weeks.\n\nIndustries dependent on supply chain efficiency like manufacturing, consumer goods, natural resources, and logistics can adapt rapidly to market changes without waiting for senior developer availability.\n\nOrganizations across all sectors reduce technical debt through standardized development patterns, automated quality controls and declarative programming models.\n\nOrganizations that delay adoption face quantifiable costs. GigaOm\u2019s analysis shows that traditional approaches consume 3x more weighted development effort while delivering slower results. This resource drain grows more acute as senior developer availability decreases and technical debt compounds.\n\nRisk\n\nWhile SAP Build\u2019s comprehensive platform accelerates development, organizations must manage specific implementation risks. These risks, identified as part of GigaOm\u2019s benchmark analysis, impact both development and technical integration and must be carefully planned for using SAP\u2019s extensive support resources, including:\n\nSAP Learning Hub for structured training paths\n\nTechnical documentation and implementation guides\n\nDeveloper tutorials and how-to videos\n\nSAP community support forums\n\nDirect access to SAP experts through standard support channels and partners\n\nImplementation best practices and reference architectures\n\nOrganizations can leverage these resources to mitigate common risks around developer onboarding, system integration, and deployment planning.\n\nDevelopment Impacts\n\nInitial velocity slightly decreases during the 4-6 week platform onboarding period, after which velocity increases.\n\nTeams require structured training on CAP development patterns and SAP ecosystem concepts. Because CAP is built on Java and JavaScript, developers can leverage their existing Java/JavaScript expertise.\n\nJunior developers need guidance transitioning from traditional frameworks to SAP Build\u2019s development model.\n\nTechnical Integration Challenges\n\nOrganizations running diverse technology stacks should plan their API and data integration points, though the SAP BTP integration suite makes this effort much easier.\n\nExisting custom frameworks may require refactoring to align with CAP architectural patterns.\n\nApplications with complex third-party integrations need additional testing and validation. Again, SAP BTP can be applied to manage this challenge.\n\nRisk Mitigation Activities\n\nCommit to a phased deployment starting with smaller applications.\n\nEstablish dedicated training programs aligned with team size and expertise.\n\nAdopt parallel development approaches during the transition period.\n\nDefine clear governance for maintaining compliance and security standards.\n\nSAP offers support working with its clients developing a center of excellence in SAP Build.\n\n3. Benefits\n\nSAP Build combines AI-assisted development with the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) to revolutionize enterprise application delivery. The benchmark study demonstrates concrete improvements in speed, quality, and resource utilization that translate directly to business value:\n\nDevelopment velocity: Teams achieve a dramatic 3x improvement in overall development velocity compared to custom approaches. This dramatic gain impacts delivery time and enables organizations to respond more quickly to market opportunities and business demands.\n\nTeams achieve a dramatic 3x improvement in overall development velocity compared to custom approaches.

This streamlined codebase not only minimizes technical debt, it enhances long-term efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\n4. Best Practices\n\nTo fully leverage SAP Build, organizations should adopt a structured implementation approach that prioritizes proper environment setup and team enablement. The benchmark study revealed that teams achieved optimal results when following a methodical adoption path that balanced quick wins with sustainable development practices. Consider these proven implementation guidelines:\n\nEnvironment setup and training: Invest in comprehensive training on both SAP Build and the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), as understanding these foundations significantly impacts team productivity.\n\nInvest in comprehensive training on both SAP Build and the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), as understanding these foundations significantly impacts team productivity.

Quality assurance process: Implement regular code reviews and testing protocols. The benchmark revealed that teams using SAP Build\u2019s built-in testing tools achieved more consistent quality outcomes with fewer senior developer resources.\n\n5. Organizational Impact\n\nSAP Build adoption affects workflows across development, operations, and business teams. The benchmark study indicates successful implementations follow a structured approach over three distinct phases of learn, develop, and iterate.\n\nLearn: The initial transition (weeks 1-6) focuses on core platform skills and process alignment. Development teams learn the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) methodology while operations teams adapt deployment procedures. Business units revise their requirements and feedback processes to match the platform\u2019s accelerated development cycle.\n\nDevelop: As teams gain proficiency, the 3x increase in development velocity drives operational changes. Project managers adjust estimation models, security teams implement standardized compliance checks, and business units compress feedback cycles. These changes enable faster feature delivery while maintaining consistent quality and security controls.\n\nIterate: Teams experience compounding efficiency gains as they master the capabilities of SAP Build. Development teams leverage advanced CAP features and reusable components while operations teams streamline deployment pipelines. Business analysts accelerate validation through direct prototyping, while Joule AI, trained specifically on SAP data and processes, helps all teams optimize their development workflows. SAP BTP services create opportunities to integrate with lines of business to amplify impact over time.\n\nPeople Impact\n\nThe platform reshapes traditional development roles. Junior developers take on more complex tasks through guided frameworks, while senior developers shift focus to architecture and innovation. The benchmark showed a 59% reduction in development effort, allowing teams to complete more projects without additional staffing. Training costs peak during the first quarter but decrease significantly as teams master the platform.\n\nInvestment Outlook\n\nSAP Build follows a dual licensing model through the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP): user-based licensing and runtime-based licensing. This hybrid approach provides cost optimization flexibility\u2014organizations pay for developer access during development while production costs scale with actual application usage. A typical enterprise implementation starts with licensing for core development teams (10-15 users), while production costs are optimized based on actual usage.\n\nImplementation costs include:\n\nInitial platform licensing\n\nTraining program development\n\nSystem integration services across platforms and ecosystems\n\nInfrastructure adjustments\n\nOngoing support and maintenance\n\nThe benchmark study indicates that organizations should budget for 4-6 weeks of reduced team velocity during initial implementation. However, the documented 3x advantage in development efficiency typically offsets these costs within the first year of operation.\n\n6. Solution Timeline\n\nImplementing SAP Build can vary depending on the complexity of the projects, the size of the development team, and the organization\u2019s familiarity with the SAP ecosystem. Organizations that take on the initial setup and onboarding process themselves can expect the work to take a few weeks to a few months. This includes setting up the development environment, training developers on the platform and CAP, and integrating with existing systems. Note that SAP offers services that can significantly reduce this time expectation. Ongoing optimization and further integration may require additional time and resources as the organization gains more experience with the platform. Factors such as the complexity of the application being developed and the level of customization required can also impact the timeline.\n\nFuture Considerations\n\nOver the next three years, organizations can anticipate SAP Build to further mature and evolve, with enhancements in AI capabilities, expanded language support, and deeper integration with the SAP ecosystem. SAP\u2019s roadmap likely includes advancements in areas such as intelligent code completion, automated testing, and improved developer collaboration tools. As the low-code/no-code and pro-code markets grow, SAP Build is well-positioned to be a vital tool for organizations seeking to accelerate application development and drive digital transformation.\n\n7. Analyst\u2019s Take\n\nEnterprise application development platforms are evolving to address the fundamental challenges of developer scarcity and accelerating business demands. SAP Build stands out in this market through its combination of AI-assisted development and the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). The benchmark study validates this approach, showing 3x greater development velocity and a 59% reduction in overall development effort.\n\nThe platform is particularly effective for organizations that prioritize standardized development practices and maintain significant SAP investments. Its comprehensive approach to enterprise application development provides clear advantages for teams seeking to reduce technical debt while accelerating delivery.\n\nTwo factors require attention during adoption: integration planning for organizations with diverse technology stacks and structured training programs to ensure team readiness. Organizations that address these elements systematically typically see positive returns within the first quarter of implementation.\n\n8.

This increased reseller activity is directly attributable to our decision to expand our sales force in that group.\n\nGen AI everywhere\n\nBut it was to generative AI potential that most attention was turned in the CEO\u2019s post-results announcement call with analysts as Fernandez declared:\n\nWe believe gen AI-enabled transformation is a generational opportunity that will fundamentally change the way companies operate as well as the way consulting services are sold and delivered. The gen AI platform capabilities of AI XPLR have now been extended with ZBrain's ability to orchestrate and build complex multi-agent workflows, which should allow us to compete strongly in this rapidly growing space. More importantly, what's most differentiating is the power of our combined end-to-end capability. AI XPLR's capability to dynamically ideate and evaluate agentic gen AI solutions with the advanced open-source orchestration capabilities of ZBrain. This capability allows us to serve clients from ideation to implementation in one fully-integrated platform. It also provides clients with a single platform that they can license to fully support their entire AI center of innovation.\n\nMost importantly, clients are now moving from awareness and education activities around gen AI to actually spending money on budgeted projects, he added:\n\nWe continue to see gen AI opportunities emerge. We conducted hundreds of meetings with Global 2000 organizations from our introduction of AI XPLR earlier in the year. These demo meetings and conversations have provided us with valuable adoption insight along with the implementation concerns and limitations of our prospects. These initial meetings are now starting to become new gen AI-enabled transformation opportunities that position us to serve our clients strategically and broadly.\n\nTo meet those opportunities, Hackett continues to strengthen its AI arsenal. Fernandez cited as a case in point:\n\nWe also continue to innovate and make powerful improvements to AI XPLR. In fact, we will release a new version 3 during this first quarter. The most important of the enhancements in version 3 is our ability to dynamically simulate an organization's enterprise gen AI solutions by leveraging Hackett's proprietary IP to identify automation opportunities and related data source requirements at a work step level. This enables us to identify, design and evaluate meaningful AI use cases and identify the related AI agents required to build these solutions. Given the strategic access and proprietary and expanding platform capabilities of AI XPLR, it was natural for us to extend our AI implementation capabilities to be able to fully develop and implement gen AI solutions that we were identifying.\n\nIt was the same basic driver that led to the acquisition of Indian AI champion LeewayHertz last September, he added:\n\nThis acquisition also included a sophisticated gen AI orchestration platform, ZBrain, which we agreed to contribute into a joint venture with the LeewayHertz founder. The JV, which is to be named ZBrain, brings together the AI XPLR and ZBrain software platforms and will focus on licensing the platforms and creating what we believe to be a first-of-a-kind gen AI ideation through implementation software-as-a-service offering.\n\nExec focus\n\nAll told, the foundations are now in place for the next phase of a concerted generative AI push, argued Fernandez, with top tier executives as the target audience for advisory services:\n\nThere is no doubt that in just one year, our aggressive pivot to become the architects of our clients' gen AI journey is being well received and has significant value creation potential for our organization\u2026We are now working on launching a premium gen AI solutioning advisory program to fully leverage our solutioning innovation and implementation knowledge from our platforms and clients' engagements that will be directly targeted and the program will be directly targeted to AI leaders, CIOs, and CTOs who require this knowledge.\n\nThe timing is right for all this, suggests Fernandez:\n\nIn 2025, we expect IT budgets to increase with increasing attention and allocations to the rapidly-emerging gen AI solutions and the related opportunities and threats it brings to all industries. While in 2024 gen AI budgets were primarily focused on developing awareness of AI, in 2025, you will see increasing amount of IT budgets specifically allocated to gen AI initiatives in high feasibility and high impact areas. We also expect to see an increasing investments in data quality and value initiatives that are critical to any gen AI strategy.\n\nAs for the recent attention that\u2019s been given to China\u2019s DeepSeek, that isn\u2019t going to do any harm in focusing exec attention, he concluded:\n\nI'll call it a wake-up call. I think is great news for end users and people that plan to adopt gen AI capabilities throughout these next few years.\n\nMy take\n\nWe see increasing activity. But more importantly, we see clients with budgeted 2025 initiatives planned, which really changes the engagement for us.\n\nHackett\u2019s \u201caggressive pivot\u201d towards gen AI services has been a work-in-progress, but it\u2019s clear that Fernandez expects great things in the coming months:\n\nWe're better prepared than where we were a year ago, and clients don't need to be convinced about the gen AI opportunity, what it means to their industry\u2026Once you're able to demonstrate value with a select or a few use cases or solutions as we refer to them, we believe that clients will continue to increase their spend in the category. So, look, it's very promising.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan then. We\u2019ll check back in on progress as the year progresses.",

The \"commercial model is still to be agreed, including if this will be via SAP RISE or non-RISE on hyperscaler.\"\n\nAn indicative sum of \u00a381 million ($102 million) is on the table for the system integrator contract, which could last four years plus two one-year extension periods.\n\nWhoever considers bidding for the job should be prepared for a complex project. A market engagement notice published in October last year said the 25-year-old SAP ERP applications \"form a fundamental platform in supporting the core NIE Networks business and market processes.\"\n\n\"Multiple internal non-SAP applications and external partner systems are integrated with the SAP system estate, working together to provide end-to-end business capabilities and overall compliance with regulatory, market, and statutory obligations,\" it said. Work is set to start in January 2026.\n\nIn the contract notice published this month, NIE Networks said that as well as the 1999 ECC implementation, SAP Business Objects (reporting and BI) and supplier relationship management was added in 2008.\n\nIn 2012, it made a \"strategic investment\" to implement a separate instance of utility application SAP IS-U and SAP Business Warehouse (data warehouse), \"further adding to the utilization of SAP products and establishing a core technology platform on NIE Networks Ltd IT estate.\"\n\nAs well as grappling with the complexity of the project, any winning bidder will have to deal with the timeline.\n\nMainstream vendor support for ECC ends at the end of 2027, after which extended vendor support is available for a 2 percent premium, which does not provide product updates, although the vendor does provide patches and bug fixes.\n\n\"NIE Networks Ltd plans to upgrade to SAP S/4 HANA to ensure interoperability with current systems be maintained and to fully leverage new technologies and functionalities on an established platform, thus maintaining a stable and secure system within the company's IT estate,\" the company said.\n\nThe Register has asked NIE Networks why it has decided not to move to the cloud and use RISE with SAP, the vendor's preferred method for getting there. \u00ae",

            "content": "ERP \u201cLifecycles\u201d\n\nFor years, SAP consulting worked in the following way: a company invests in a major ERP rollout, consultants configure and deploy the system, and once the project is completed, the system remains largely unchanged except for occasional maintenance or minor enhancements. Eventually, when the system is no longer meeting business needs, another large-scale upgrade or reimplementation occurs.\n\nOrganizations now view ERP as a continuously evolving system that must adapt to ongoing business and technology changes. This change affects how SAP solutions are designed and delivered, but also how SAP consultants structure their work, how ERP investments are budgeted, and how technical challenges are managed over time.\n\nThis article from IgniteSAP explores how the industry-wide shift toward the continuous improvement model in SAP services affects implementation practices and the careers of individual consultants.\n\n\n\nWhy Traditional ERP Projects Are Becoming Less Common\n\nThe primary driver behind this shift is the need for business agility. Companies can no longer afford to wait five or ten years for a major upgrade when market conditions, regulatory requirements, and technological advancements are changing constantly. Instead, they need continuous improvements that allow them to evolve their ERP systems in real time.\n\nAt the same time, SAP has moved away from the on-premise, big-bang upgrade model. With SAP S/4HANA Cloud and RISE with SAP, businesses don\u2019t \u201cown\u201d ERP software in the traditional sense. Instead, they subscribe to a service where updates, new features, and optimizations are introduced several times a year rather than every few years.\n\nOn-premise instances of S/4HANA are still widely-used but the direction of travel for the industry is towards cloud-based SAP, and SAP consultants now support ongoing system evolution, performance tuning, and business process optimization, and they are expected to stay engaged long-term, helping businesses take advantage of new updates and capabilities as they become available.\n\n\n\nHow This Impacts SAP Project Costs and Consultant Billing Models\n\nThe financial structure of SAP projects has also changed. Previously, companies made large capital expenditures when purchasing software licenses and funding implementation projects. Now, with cloud-based ERP and subscription services, ERP costs are spread over time as operational expenditures, meaning that businesses allocate continuous budgets for incremental improvements, rather than securing massive funding rounds for periodic overhauls.\n\nFor SAP consultants, this is gradually leading to a reduction in large, high-fee implementation contracts in favor of long-term service agreements, retainers, and managed services contracts. Instead of billing for project-based deliverables, many SAP professionals are shifting to subscription-based consulting, ongoing system monitoring, and continuous advisory engagements.\n\nThis has also caused a shift in pricing models toward value-based consulting, where fees are tied to measurable business outcomes rather than billable hours or project milestones.\n\nConsultants who adapt to this new reality by positioning themselves as ERP lifecycle advisors rather than project implementers will benefit from greater job security and consistent revenue streams. Those who continue relying on traditional project-based work may find fewer opportunities.\n\n\n\nHow SAP\u2019s AI Strategy Is Reshaping ERP Lifecycles\n\nMany of the manual tasks that SAP consultants once performed are now handled by AI-powered tools which can monitor, analyze, and suggest optimizations in real time.\n\nJoule, SAP\u2019s AI copilot, continuously learns from business data, identifying opportunities for automation, workflow improvements, and smarter decision-making. Similarly, SAP Signavio AI-Powered Process Insights allows organizations to assess how well their processes are performing and make data-driven refinements without needing external analysis.\n\nFor SAP consultants, this reduces the need for traditional configuration work, and at the same time, there is a growing demand for AI expertise, requiring consultants to train and fine-tune AI models rather than manually designing business processes. Organizations now expect consultants to drive business value through AI-driven ERP enhancements, transitioning from reactive system management to proactive ERP self-optimization.\n\nIn essence, the role of the SAP consultant is evolving from an ERP configuration specialist to an AI-enhanced business process advisor. Those who can effectively integrate AI into SAP lifecycles and guide businesses in leveraging these intelligent tools will be in the highest demand.\n\n\n\nThe Technical Challenges of Continuous ERP Evolution\n\nWhile continuous ERP improvement offers many advantages, it also introduces new challenges that SAP consultants must address.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is keeping up with frequent updates. In traditional on-premise ERP models, companies had years between major upgrades, allowing plenty of time for testing, validation, and change management. With SAP S/4HANA Cloud and other cloud-based SAP solutions, updates occur several times per year.\n\nFor SAP consultants, this means helping businesses manage update cycles without disrupting daily operations, testing and validating system changes before deployment, and ensuring that new features don\u2019t break existing processes.\n\nConsultants are also redesigning ERP architectures to be more flexible, avoiding heavy customizations that make future updates difficult.\n\nMany organizations built heavily customized SAP systems in the past, making upgrades complex and risky. Now, with frequent updates, customization must rely on pre-configuration options and standardized implementation processes to optimize scalability and upgradability in clients\u2019 systems.\n\nAnother major challenge is managing ERP security and compliance in a constantly evolving system. Businesses must ensure that frequent updates do not introduce security vulnerabilities or cause compliance risks, especially in regulated industries.\n\n\n\nHow This Affects SAP Consultant Career Earnings and Financial Opportunities\n\nAs the ERP consulting landscape moves from large, one-off implementations to continuous service models, the way SAP consultants earn and structure their careers is shifting.\n\nFor many SAP professionals, this transition means moving from fixed-scope project billing to retainer-based agreements or value-based pricing models. Rather than being compensated for hours worked, consultants are increasingly paid based on measurable business outcomes: such as process efficiency gains, automation effectiveness, or cost reductions enabled by SAP optimization.\n\nThis model offers greater financial stability, as SAP consultants who establish long-term client relationships enjoy recurring revenue streams rather than the uncertainty of securing new projects every few years.\n\nIt also introduces new issues, such as:\n\nConsultants must continuously demonstrate value rather than delivering a completed system and moving on.\n\nThe demand for generalist SAP configuration work is declining, while expertise in process automation, AI integration, and ERP lifecycle strategy is becoming more lucrative.\n\n\n\nHow SAP BTP is Reshaping ERP Consulting Work\n\nAs companies adopt continuous ERP evolution, they are increasingly turning to SAP Business Technology Platform for integration, automation, and system flexibility. Instead of customizing SAP S/4HANA\u2019s core system, businesses now extend and enhance their ERP capabilities through BTP\u2019s modular, event-driven architecture.\n\nFor SAP consultants, this is where the high-value work is shifting. Expertise in SAP BTP is quickly becoming a key differentiator, as businesses seek professionals who can:\n\nDevelop event-driven ERP architectures that allow real-time data exchanges between SAP and third-party applications.\n\nImplement process automation using tools like SAP Workflow Management and SAP iRPA (Intelligent Robotic Process Automation).\n\nHelp businesses transition away from legacy ERP customizations by leveraging BTP\u2019s low-code/no-code development environment.\n\nAs SAP S/4HANA Cloud updates are rolled out frequently, businesses need consultants who understand how to maintain and extend their ERP systems without causing disruptions.\n\n\n\nCareer Specialization in the SAP Lifecycle Era\n\nWith ERP evolving into a continuous business function, SAP professionals must consider how they can differentiate themselves in this new landscape.\n\nSome of the most promising career paths in the SAP ecosystem include:\n\nAI-Driven ERP Optimization \u2013 Specializing in SAP Signavio Process Intelligence and machine learning for business process refinement.\n\nSAP BTP Architecture & Integration \u2013 Helping businesses build scalable, event-driven ERP ecosystems using SAP Integration Suite and API-based workflows.\n\nSAP Security & Compliance Advisory \u2013 Ensuring businesses remain compliant with evolving regulatory standards while implementing AI-driven threat detection and risk assessment solutions.\n\nConsultants who focus on one of these specializations will find that demand for their expertise continues to grow.\n\n\n\nWhy Long-Term Advisory Roles Are the Future of SAP Consulting\n\nBusinesses now seek long-term ERP transformation partners who can guide them through ongoing adaptation and system enhancement.\n\nThis means SAP consultants must focus on ERP lifecycle management rather than discrete implementations, providing continuous advisory services and developing expertise in AI, automation, and integration.\n\nSAP consulting firms are also changing their service models in response to this shift. Many firms are now offering subscription-based ERP consulting, where businesses pay for ongoing system support and advisory services, though hybrid deployment models are also a popular compromise with large customers who originally had extensive on-premise systems, so skills related to on-premise implementation will still have a place in the industry for some time yet.\n\n\n\nHow SAP Consultants Can Stay Ahead\n\nThe old model of SAP consulting, where consultants were brought in for a project, implemented a system, and then moved on, is rapidly becoming obsolete. A new SAP consulting landscape is emerging, where continuous improvement, automation, and AI-driven insights define how businesses manage their ERP environments.\n\nThe ability to adapt has never been more important. Professionals who align their careers with continuous ERP evolution will thrive, while those who cling to outdated project-based models may struggle to find opportunities\n\nThe future of SAP consulting will consist of helping businesses navigate an ERP journey that never truly ends. Those who recognize this shift and adjust their approach accordingly will find themselves at the forefront of SAP\u2019s evolving digital landscape.\n\nIf you are an SAP professional looking for a new role in the SAP ecosystem our team of dedicated recruitment consultants can match you with your ideal employer and negotiate a competitive compensation package for your extremely valuable skills, so join our exclusive community at IgniteSAP.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nEurope is back and means business in the artificial intelligence race. That's the sentiment echoed at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris as France President Macron touted a $112.8 billion investment in AI. The massive investment comes as four of the biggest US tech giants plan to spend $325 billion to further strengthen their AI ambitions in 2025.\n\nFrance's $112.8 billion underscores Europe's desire to take on the US and China, which have dominated the AI debate on innovations and investment in recent years. For starters, the US is receiving praise as part of the $500 billion Stargate project as China appears to have an edge on innovation following DeepSeek's revelation of cost-effective AI models.\n\nCritics of Europe have long argued that the continent has overregulated the tech sector, hindering innovation. Nevertheless, some in the technology sector believe that Europe is headed in the right direction, even though that perception hasn't completely changed.\n\n\"As a European region, at least, we are starting to see global leaders emerge, and that's the thing we really need,\" Victor Riparbelli, CEO of AI video company Synthesia, told CNBC in an interview on Monday.\n\nWhile there appears to be a tussle or fierce competition between nations to spearhead the AI revolution, China has made it clear that it is willing to work with other countries. Beijing insists it is willing and ready to promote development, safeguard security, and share achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative, Zhang Guoqing, AI has become an essential driving force for the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. China has always participated in global cooperation and governance on AI with a highly responsible attitude.\n\nCorporations between nations instead of competing against each other to control the spoils are key to unlocking the full advantages of the AI revolution. Likewise, economists at Goldman Sachs expect widespread adoption of generative AI to raise US labour productivity by 15% over the next 10 years. It is also likely to unlock about $4.5 trillion in annual US GDP.\n\nAI economic benefits are anticipated to flow to hardware and infrastructure providers early on. Later, they will spread to platform and application developers, and finally, they will manifest as increases in productivity and efficiency throughout the industry as a whole. According to the Goldman Sachs team, the US AI investment cycle will peak at 2% of GDP before declining as the compute costs of running AI queries and training AI models decline. Investment in AI software was expected to rise gradually over time as end-user adoption rose.",

With that ambitious foundation in place, SAP is also accelerating its rollout of new agents to be managed and optimized by its Joule \u201corchestrator,\u201d and has also rolled out an Agent Builder leveraging all of the impressive new capabilities within the Business Data Cloud. For more on those moves by SAP, please see my two recent analyses:\n\nFinal thought\n\nWhile my focus today has been on these two heavyweights and their early approaches to the new post-applications reality, Oracle will also be a major player in the worlds of agents and data, while Workday has rolled out several new agents to optimize HCM and Financial workflows for customers.\n\nAnd of course Microsoft is complementing its big early position around Copilots with a major commitment to agents as well.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no doubt that as the Agent Wars intensify, the biggest winners will be the customers.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

This blog outlines the key considerations and benefits of deploying SAP archiving solutions in Azure, drawing insights from a recent KGS Software GmbH webinar on the topic. Whether planning your first steps or optimizing an existing setup, this checklist assists with clarity on how to approach SAP archiving in Azure.\n\nUnderstanding SAP Archiving in Azure\n\nSAP archiving involves the storage of structured and unstructured data to meet compliance, reduce database load and optimize costs. By leveraging Azure\u2019s robust services, businesses can achieve high-performance, cost-efficient and legally compliant archiving. The middleware solution, often acting as a bridge between SAP and Azure storage, plays a crucial role in ensuring seamless integration.\n\nChecklist to Start SAP Archiving in Azure:\n\nAssess Your Current Environment Determine if SAP processes are already running in Azure or if a migration is planned.\n\nIdentify existing archiving solutions and evaluate their limitations. Choose the Right Middleware Select a middleware solution, such as the Intelligent Archive (tia), to connect SAP systems with Azure Blob Storage or other storage services.\n\nEnsure compatibility with SAP interfaces like ArchiveLink, CMIS and ILM. Decide on Storage Configurations Leverage Azure Blob Storage for long-term data retention, scalability and performance.\n\nConfigure storage redundancy options (e.g., geo-redundant or locally redundant) to ensure disaster recovery capabilities. Adopt Containerized Deployments Use containerized solutions for flexible, resource-efficient deployments. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Apps can streamline operations.\n\nEmploy cloud-native tools for monitoring and management, such as Azure Monitor. Ensure Legal Compliance Enable features like immutability (WORM \u2013 Write Once, Read Many) for data protection and retention management.\n\nConfigure legal hold policies to safeguard critical data for compliance audits. Plan for Hybrid Architectures For organizations with mixed cloud and on-premises environments, deploy hybrid solutions that optimize costs and access speed.\n\nConsider temporary on-premise caching for frequently accessed data. Monitor and Optimize Costs Use Azure\u2019s pay-as-you-go model to align costs with usage.\n\nOptimize cloud expenses by reducing unnecessary data access or configuring efficient storage tiers (hot or cold).\n\nSome of the Benefits of SAP Archiving in Azure include:\n\nScalability: Near-unlimited resources to manage growing data needs.\n\nSecurity: Enterprise-grade protection through encryption, private endpoints and retention policies.\n\nCost Efficiency: Pay only for resources used, avoiding upfront hardware investments.\n\nCompliance: Features like immutability and retention periods ensure adherence to legal standards.\n\nHigh Availability: Guaranteed uptime of 99.9% or more.\n\nSAP archiving in Azure can offer organizations a robust, compliant, and cost-effective solution. By adopting a streamlined middleware approach and leveraging Azure\u2019s extensive services, businesses can optimize their data archiving processes while ensuring scalability and security.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nWhat it means for SAPinsiders\n\nEmpowering IT Managers and Compliance Officers: For IT managers, compliance officers and ERP administrators, SAP archiving in Microsoft Azure represents a transformative leap forward in managing enterprise data. This technology simplifies your day-to-day operations by providing a centralized, scalable platform for securely archiving SAP data. Whether ensuring compliance with legal regulations or seeking to optimize performance by reducing database loads, Azure can offer flexibility and robust features to support one\u2019s objectives. From automated legal hold policies to enhanced disaster recovery capabilities, integrating SAP archiving with Azure eliminates manual processes and streamlines decision-making, enabling closer focus on strategic initiatives rather than operational bottlenecks.\n\nRiding the Cloud Wave: The global enterprise data management market is poised to reach over $150 billion by 2030, fueled by an exponential rise in data generation and the push for digital transformation. Vendors like Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud are leading this charge, offering sophisticated cloud solutions that address scalability, cost efficiency and compliance needs. In the SAP archiving space, Azure stands out with its seamless integration capabilities and advanced features such as immutability and geo-redundancy. Competitors like AWS Glacier and Google Cloud Archive provide similar services, but Azure\u2019s strong middleware ecosystem and enterprise-grade security give it a competitive edge, especially for SAP-centric organizations looking to modernize legacy systems.\n\nChoosing the Right Solution: When evaluating SAP archiving solutions, focus on compatibility, scalability and compliance. Ensure that the middleware solution supports SAP standards like ArchiveLink and ILM while offering seamless connectivity with Azure Blob Storage. Look for scalability options that align with your organization\u2019s growth trajectory, leveraging Azure\u2019s flexible storage tiers for cost efficiency. Compliance features, including WORM storage and legal hold policies, are non-negotiable for audit readiness. Additionally, prioritize vendors that offer hybrid architecture support, enabling smooth transitions between on-premises and cloud environments. A clear understanding of your organization\u2019s specific needs and future goals will guide you in selecting the right SAP archiving solution on Azure.",

But anybody who makes maple syrup, they know it's not a calendar thing. It's all a temperature thing. That's what we've got, and that's what we're going with. So like it or not, maple syrup season is happening. Get your trees tapped, because they're dripping like crazy right now,\" said Petrella.\n\n\n\nBarkhausen tapped their trees on Feb. 2. Normally they don't do it until March.\n\nPetrella's only concern at this point is the sap run coming to an end before most schools are scheduled to come check out the process.\n\nThe month of March, we're gonna have school kids out here four days a week for the whole month. We're gonna have school programs going on. We're gonna teach kids the whole steps and processes to make maple syrup. It's a really cool natural history lesson, a lot of history with it, just like how the trees work and everything else with it. It's a really great learning experience for the kids, and a tradition here in Northeast Wisconsin.\n\nTo the south, in De Pere, at full boil as well.

And then we got that heavy snow and it insulated the ground. With no frost in the ground, we knew as soon as the temperatures were gonna come up, the trees were gonna run,\" said Baroun. \"I told my wife, be ready by the end of January. We weren't quite, but we were close to it.\"\n\n\n\nAnd if you have trees of your own that you like to tap but haven't yet, Baroun said you haven't missed out.\n\nBoth he and Petrella said as long as overnight temperatures aren't staying above freezing for more than a couple days in a row, that sap will keep running until the trees bud out.\n\nA bit of a sweet treat to go along with this warm winter.",

Speaking at LEAP 2025, recently appointed Chief Revenue Officer for SAP in Asia Pacific (APAC); Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); and Middle Eastern Europe (MEE), Manos Raptopoulos, emphasized the urgent need for businesses to move beyond AI hype and unlock its real business value.\n\nAt a special event held on the main stage at LEAP this week, Raptopoulos shared insights on how the accelerating pace of technological innovation can help businesses worldwide tackle what seems to be a \u201cnormality\u201d of continuous disruption. He outlined how SAP is taking a concrete view on AI, providing benchmarks on improvements customers can expect per board area and function.\n\n\u201cWe see conviction with regards to the benefits. Business leaders we speak to everyday are past the \u201cwhy\u201d \u2013 they already want to connect AI to concrete business value. Our unique advantage is that we can provide AI immersed in the customers\u2019 business context, going beyond just the technology,\u201d said Raptopoulos. \u201cSAP is at the forefront of helping organizations harness AI for business transformation, ensuring they can run their most critical processes with greater efficiency, agility, and visibility.\u201d\n\nRaptopoulos added, \u201cSAP is firmly committed to Saudi Arabia and has over the past years invested more than 1 billion USD. As part of the long-term investment strategy, SAP established an SAP data center, launched an innovation center and invested continuously in talent. Building on this foundation, the focus of the past years, and in the future, will be to unlock the value of business AI for our customers.\u201d\n\nRaptopoulos\u2019 participation at LEAP follows his recent appointment to SAP\u2019s Extended Board, where he co-leads the global Customer Success board area alongside Jan Gilg. With his expanded role, he is set to drive SAP\u2019s vision for AI-powered business transformation across key global markets.\n\n-ENDS-",

This platform provides a reliable data foundation to improve decision-making and enhance artificial intelligence (AI) applications. By integrating data from critical business applications with advanced analytics and data engineering capabilities, SAP aims to unlock new levels of innovation and insight.\n\nThe launch marks a significant collaboration between SAP and Databricks, two major players in enterprise software and data management. The partnership ensures seamless integration of Databricks\u2019 data engineering, machine learning, and AI capabilities into SAP\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n\u201cSAP Business Data Cloud unleashes the full value of enterprise data for Business AI,\u201d said SAP CEO Christian Klein. \u201cIt combines SAP\u2019s unique expertise in mission-critical, end-to-end processes and semantically rich data with Databricks\u2019 world-class data engineering capabilities to create a ground-breaking solution that helps organisations do more with their data than ever before.\u201d\n\nAli Ghodsi, Co-founder and CEO of Databricks, emphasised the benefits of this collaboration. \u201cEvery company on the planet wants to get more value out of their data and greater returns on their AI investments. By joining forces with SAP, we\u2019re helping organisations bring together all their data\u2014regardless of format or where it lives\u2014to govern, analyse, and build domain-specific AI applications on the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform.\u201d\n\nExpanding the data product economy\n\nSAP Business Data Cloud introduces a shift towards a data product economy by offering fully managed SAP data products across various business functions. These include finance, supply chain, procurement, and human resources data from SAP platforms such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Ariba, and SAP SuccessFactors. The platform ensures that data maintains its original business context and semantics, allowing organisations to access high-quality insights without the need for complex extraction processes.\n\nFor instance, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) looking to assess the impact of inflation on profitability can leverage SAP Business Data Cloud to integrate real-time external data, such as consumer price indices, with financial data products like general ledger accounts and cost centres. This provides a more comprehensive and timely financial overview.\n\nThe solution also introduces \u201cinsight apps,\u201d which utilise data products and AI models connected to real-time data. These apps will enhance analytics and planning across various business units, including enterprise analytics, finance, and human resources.\n\nMarkus Hartmann, Corporate Vice President and Head of Business Technology at Henkel, a global chemical and consumer goods company, praised the new platform. \u201cSAP Business Data Cloud will help us unlock the value of our data and drive innovation across our business. Its semantically rich data products and deep Databricks integration will enhance our existing data products and empower us to model scenarios and leverage AI insights, building a sustainable future for our data ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAdvancing AI-driven automation with Joule agents\n\nSAP Business Data Cloud is set to enhance Joule, SAP\u2019s generative AI copilot, by streamlining cross-functional workflows and improving decision-making through AI-powered automation. The platform benefits from SAP\u2019s extensive enterprise datasets and the SAP Knowledge Graph, which structures data in a business-friendly format.\n\nIn line with this, SAP introduced a range of pre-built Joule AI agents tailored for finance, customer service, and sales. These agents aim to optimise operations, such as processing claims more efficiently in finance or handling customer inquiries more swiftly in sales.\n\nAdditionally, SAP announced a new agent builder feature, allowing businesses to create and deploy their own AI agents. By leveraging SAP\u2019s deep expertise in business processes, this tool enables organisations to customise AI-driven workflows to suit their specific needs.\n\nWith this launch, SAP is positioning itself at the forefront of enterprise AI and data integration, enabling businesses to maximise the potential of their data while improving efficiency and decision-making.",

From starting as a functional administrator at ABB to becoming a thought leader in SAP Project Systems (PS) and Commercial Project Management (CPM), Pavan has successfully integrated technical proficiency with business acumen.\n\nJourney into SAP and Specialization in PS & CPM\n\nPavan's career began with a strong passion for supply chain and project execution. At ABB, he managed procurements for multi-million-dollar projects, gaining firsthand experience in project lifecycle management. This exposure led him to explore SAP Project Systems, where he merged his functional expertise with SAP\u2019s capabilities to streamline project execution and financial tracking. His interest in SAP PS and CPM stems from their potential to optimize project management, enhance resource planning, and ensure profitability.\n\nApproach to Large-Scale SAP Implementations\n\nHaving led global SAP implementations across various industries, Pavan emphasizes creating a standardized framework while addressing country-specific needs. His approach involves a thorough requirements-gathering process, collaboration with stakeholders, and the development of a scalable global template. One of his notable projects involved implementing a unified SAP system across 12 countries, balancing standardization with localization. His strategy ensures seamless adoption through structured change management and extensive training programs.\n\nChallenges and Memorable Projects\n\nPavan recalls a particularly challenging project in the construction industry, where he was responsible for integrating multiple legacy systems into SAP S/4HANA. The client lacked standardized processes, which required a complete workflow redesign. The project spanned two company codes under a single controlling area, demanding meticulous financial consolidation. Resistance to change was another major hurdle, which he overcame through strategic change management and cross-departmental collaboration. Ultimately, his efforts streamlined operations and improved efficiency.\n\nUnderstanding Industry Nuances Across Sectors\n\nWith expertise spanning Public Sector, Medical Devices, Construction, Hi-Tech, Media, and Robotics, Pavan has a structured approach to understanding diverse industries. He conducts in-depth research, engages stakeholders, and maps business processes to SAP functionalities. His experience in compliance-heavy industries like Molecular Diagnostics helps him ensure adherence to regulatory standards, while in sectors like Robotics and Construction, he focuses on project lifecycle management.\n\nLeadership in SAP Implementations\n\nAs a leader managing teams of up to 20 professionals, Pavan believes in hands-on involvement, empowering his team, and fostering a collaborative work culture. He prioritizes delegation based on individual strengths, continuous feedback, and adaptability to evolving challenges. His leadership style focuses on achieving business goals while ensuring professional growth for his team.\n\nInnovations and Customizations in SAP\n\nPavan has pioneered several SAP innovations, including utility tools for material demand planning, custom Fiori applications for project approvals, and tailored solutions for procurement planning. These innovations have enhanced business efficiency and provided organizations with real-time decision-making capabilities.\n\nEnsuring Smooth SAP Integrations\n\nWith extensive experience integrating SAP with systems like Primavera, OpenText, and Concur, Pavan follows a structured approach. He emphasizes thorough system analysis, leveraging SAP PI/PO for seamless connections, and rigorous testing in controlled environments. His work in a robotics automation firm involved integrating SAP with AI-driven software, enhancing business intelligence.\n\nMethodologies for SAP Implementations and Upgrades\n\nFor SAP implementations, Pavan follows the SAP Activate methodology, a framework incorporating best practices and Agile principles. This phased approach\u2014Discover, Prepare, Explore, Realize, Deploy, and Run\u2014ensures a structured and efficient transition to SAP S/4HANA. By integrating iterative sprints and continuous stakeholder engagement, he ensures flexibility while maintaining high-quality deliverables.\n\nWith his extensive experience, strategic approach, and commitment to innovation, Pavan Kanchi continues to be a key influencer in the world of SAP implementations, driving efficiency and transformation for global enterprises.",

            "content": "(Christian Klein - SAP CEO)\n\nOn Thursday, February 13, SAP made a slew of AI and data announcements, including the launch of the SAP Business Data Cloud, and a \"landmark\" new partnership with Databricks. SAP unveiled this news during the SAP Unleashed virtual event (replay available).\n\nThe buildup indicated that SAP considered this one of the biggest news announcements in the company's history, e.g. \"a bold new era for data and AI\" - does that hold up?\n\nThis announcement is not just about the evolution of Datasphere, and the incorporation of Datasphere tools into the SAP Business Data Cloud. Nor is it limited to the Joule agents SAP also announced. The official branding of the new SAP Business Suite is part of this news package also. How do we unravel this?\n\nIs the fanfare around this news justified by the customer impact?\n\nWhy does SAP need Databricks?\n\nWhat happens to Datasphere? Is this just a rebranding exercise?\n\nWhat is the initial response from customers and user groups?\n\nAs I see it, SAP used these announcements to officially reframe their entire value proposition in light of the impact of AI. But these announcements are also about the need for enterprises to effectively compete via actual data insights, outcomes, and whatever results you want to call them. Elaborate data plumbing and sophisticated bots that don't connect to business results won't cut it. When it comes to generative AI, the old 'garbage in, garbage out' saw takes on new meaning.\n\nIn pursuit of answers, I attended a pre-launch press conference, as well as the Unleashed event. I don't have definitive answers to everything readers will want to know - that will come later - but we have enough for a first pass.\n\nWhy SAP Business Data Cloud? Customers are struggling to realize the value of AI\n\nStart with this: what is the problem? Enterprise leaders are wary of shiny solutions that don't solve problems (see: blockchain, Metaverse). So let's start with this challenge to SAP: what is the problem here? During the initial press conference, Muhammad Alam, who leads the SAP Product Engineering Executive Board area, singled out the core problem of enterprise AI: you're not getting quality output without quality data. Alam laid out the value proposition we are all chasing:\n\nIt's no surprise that AI has the potential to create exponential value for organizations around the world, whether that's in the form of automating tasks that require significant amount of human engagement today, or in some cases, doing tasks that just couldn't be done or weren't practical to be done by any amount of human engagement in the past - or also to provide insights with predictive capabilities, with next best action recommendations, to allow for better, more efficient decision-making.\n\nBut as we've learned, there is a monster catch. This value isn't achieved by off-the-shelf LLMs, and, let's face it: home grown AI pilots are hard - and might even be a flawed approach for this tech. Alam continued:\n\nBut what our customers are telling us is that they're struggling to implement and realize the value of AI in their organizations. It's hard to get reliable data, high quality data sets across the enterprise to power this. Many have done hundreds of POCs, but have not been able to get them to production effectively. And the ones that have been able to get to production haven't really seen the adoption that they're looking for, to be able to realize the value. And it's not just the adoption, but the reliability of the answers and the recommendations have been a challenge as well.\n\nWhich raises the next question: why SAP? During the Unleashed event, SAP CEO Christian Klein gave his take on this, via the challenges faced by enterprise leaders. He started with the CFO, and those dreaded data silos:\n\nAs a CFO, financial steering in a volatile and uncertain market is more important than ever today. However, the CFO's data, whether it is financial data, non-financial data, or external data like GDP, inflation and market sentiment data, lies in silos, and when your CFO can't run real time financial simulations with all these variables, it's impossible to navigate your company through challenging times.\n\nBreaking down data silos is obviously core to any \"intelligent\" enterprise aspiration, from analytics to AI - including data beyond enterprise walls. But didn't Datasphere already do some of these things? Yes, but the Business Data Cloud is intended to deliver more packaged AI/data benefits, including what SAP calls Insight Apps. Klein added:\n\nWith SAP Business Data Cloud, we are offering data products that bring together financial data like general ledger or cash flow data, with external data such as inflation rates, allowing finance to run simulations, for example, of the impact of inflation on the company's financial performance. This, in itself, is a huge breakthrough, but we are now taking it to the next level by unlocking Joule's powerful AI capabilities with Joule simulation capabilities. You can adjust variables so that you can visualize the impact on profitability and cash flow, and Joule agents can execute actions on price or other profitability levels to offset financial risks instantly.\n\nWhy SAP Databricks?\n\nSo, we can think of SAP Business Data Cloud as SAP raising its own bar, with the intent of pushing up the data stack to deliver more insights/outcomes - as a managed data service. Yes, the Datasphere components are part of this (an \"evolution\" of Datasphere, as SAP put it), as well as SAP Analytics Cloud and Business Warehouse (SAP Business Data Cloud itself is part of SAP BTP). So how does the Databricks partnership fit in?\n\nTo answer that, we return to the drawbacks of out-of-box LLMs for the enterprise. Like other leading vendors, SAP has invested heavily in LLM output relevance and accuracy, via customized architectures that includes different model sizes, and heavy use of RAG - to influence LLM output via customer-specific data in the context window (I've published a number of deep dives on how SAP approaches this). Where SAP has arguably pushed further is its pursuit of knowledge graphs, to better incorporate structured (tabular) data into the LLM output (most RAG architectures are based on vector database embeddings, not knowledge graphs).\n\nDespite the limitations of probablistic LLMs, the enterprise has latched onto LLMs for a couple reasons: first, the ease of interaction is clearly a welcome change in the enterprise use experience, with the potential to train, advise, action, and perhaps even democratize data access. Second, LLMs are remarkably good at working with so-called unstructured data - a historical bugaboo to enterprise process analysis/improvement. But to make gen AI truly valuable to enterprise users, we need the combination of structured and unstructured data, along with proper governance around role-based data access, security etc. The governance/security part of this is right in SAP's wheelhouse. However:\n\nWhen users interact with LLMs via Joule or other interfaces, they will not put up with incomplete results. Missing info that lives in other databases or software systems won't be acceptable (I believe this need for data across product boundaries will be disruptive to conventional software licensing, but that's for another time). As SAP explains, Databricks gives SAP a greater ability to pull unstructured data into SAP Business AI scenarios:\n\nSAP Databricks empowers every data professional to accelerate AI models and generative AI apps on their business data. Native capabilities like Delta Sharing harmonize SAP data products with existing lakehouses bi-directionally. By integrating all your data with a zero-copy approach, you can apply advanced AI and machine learning models to finance use cases, like predicting the payment date on open receivables.\n\nHow is this new product, SAP Databricks, faring in the field? During SAP Unleashed, Databricks CEO and Co-founder Ali Ghadsi said:\n\nThe SAP data is already readily available there, with all of its semantics. You can combine it with all the other data sets that you need. And then when you combine this with the governance that you can get out of things like Unity Catalog, then you can actually really lock down the security and the privacy of your platform. You can accomplish things that you couldn't do before. One of my favorite examples is that we have a joint oil and gas company [customer]. It's actually one of the largest in the world, and they want to really be able to optimize their inventory levels. This used to take them 48 hours, but together with SAP Databricks, the data that they have on inventory levels is already readily available with the business semantics available right there, and it can now actually cut that down. And they can do it in 45 minutes, almost real time. And the way they do it is in SAP Databricks. They combine the SAP data with data that they bring in from 3,000 other parts of data that they need, and now they can, almost in real-time, adjust their inventory level.\n\nInitial reactions - from user groups and analysts\n\nIn its official reaction, DSAG, the German Speaking User Group, seemed to like the news (and if they didn't, they would not hold back):\n\nFrom DSAG\u2019s point of view, the numerous SAP company acquisitions in the past, technological changes and the software manufacturer\u2019s strategic orientation towards the cloud and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) have led to the portfolio becoming increasingly fragmented. Examples include customer relationship management (CRM) and individual financial solutions. 'The complexity of contract design has increased massively and, as a result, so has cost management. There were also challenges in terms of integration,' summarizes [Thomas] Henzler. Overall, customers had to weigh up whether they wanted to pursue a best-of-breed approach or a best-of-suite approach. With the innovations that have now been announced, SAP is strengthening its integrated system approach.\n\nDSAG emphasized the modular nature of the \"Suite\":\n\n'It is important to know that the new SAP Business Suite is not a product that the customer buys. Rather, it is a target status,' says Henzler. This includes a modular ERP system whose solution scope is based on the customer\u2019s process-related requirements. The public cloud edition of S/4HANA should preferably be at the heart of the whole. This is supplemented by other SAP solutions that are integrated into the ERP core without the customer having to do anything.'\n\nBottom line: DSAG likes the emphasis on apps/data integration in these announcements, even as it continues to document challenges with AI across the SAP customer base (more on that shortly). As for the Business Data Cloud, DSAG likes the access to this data via BDC:\n\nFrom DSAG\u2019s perspective, SAP is aiming to harmonize SAP data management across systems with this offering. This new solution in turn accesses various partial solutions, such as SAP Analytics Cloud (SAP SAC), SAP Datasphere, SAP Business Warehouse and SAP BW/4HANA in the S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition. 'The business data fabric is at the heart of SAP BDC. This is where the data is processed semantically and made available in a standardized way. The data used can come from the connected ecosystem \u2013 either directly from all SAP applications or already prepared via existing business warehouse systems,' explains Sebastian Westphal, DSAG Chief Technology Officer. The data available in the BDC can then be used with AI from SAP or 3rd party providers.\n\nWhen I asked analyst Josh Greenbaum for his first reactions, he brought up the insight apps:\n\nThe idea of a catalog of 'insight applications' is a good one, and the fact that they are aligned to specific business user personas helps customers understand the business value of the Business Data Cloud. The Business Data Cloud itself appears to be the nth iteration of SAP\u2019s continued attempts to provide a single unified source of data to drive analytics and processes, and by itself presents little that hasn\u2019t been offered before. The rationales behind taking the concept to market are increasingly important ones, but SAP will have a lot of competition, and it will need to push hard to make its version of the unified data source rise to the top of its large enterprise customers\u2019 strategies.\n\nMy take\n\nI've told SAP I believe customers don't want \"suites\": I believe they want application/data platforms, where they can easily plug in third party components alongside their main vendor. But DSAG likes the suite language, as a sign of SAP's commitment to integration and a commonality of user experience - so it looks like I am wrong on this one. SAP does emphasize the \"modular\" and \"composable\" aspects of its take on suites; that's important.\n\nSAP triggered me a tad with words like \"understanding\" attached to LLMs. LLMs are stunning at predicting language, but what appears to be understanding is really about helping LLMs to detect semantic relationships between data. It's a remarkable feat of engineering, but I will save the word \"understanding\" for the day when truly cognitive systems arrive.\n\nI'm also wary of \"autonomous agent\" talk. Without proper AI design, you can easily run into compounding errors between agents (even a 95 percent output accuracy rate doesn't compound well from agent to specialized agent). But then again, my talks with SAP's AI leadership have illustrated the thought they put into use case design, including accuracy control via task-specialized agents.\n\nSAP has been more open about the pros and cons of this tech than most enterprise vendors. Ultimately, customers will judge how autonomous they want probabilistic agents to be, so that will get settled soon enough. Semantic arguments are mostly for late nights at event hotels, I'll concede that - but if precision of language doesn't matter, then I probably need to put down my laptop and start busking.\n\nThe access to SAP innovation issue is something I've pushed enough; I'm not going to rehash that here. I don't believe it's in SAP's best interest to require RISE or GROW contracts to get going with SAP Business AI - not with so many AI competitors that will get any customer going quickly. At times, there are ways around this - in some cases through BTP - but will SAP make strides on this topic this year? There is one potential way forward I will float in a future article. For now, time will tell.\n\nFinally, there is plenty of education ahead - and we're not getting to successful AI projects without it. I've already touched on the joint customer survey on AI from ASUG, DSAG, and UKISUG. There are some striking stats in that survey, including: only 7 percent of DSAG members surveyed (ASUG: 6 percent | UKISUG: 6 percent) consider themselves experts in AI and 8 percent (ASUG: 2 percent | UKISUG: 5 percent) in generative AI. In an ASUG Talks podcast reviewing the survey results, we heard many of the same points that came up from the Unleashed news, including the need for \"seamless\" integration between AI and business processes, and why \"input quality determines output accuracy.\" (Though I'd say that input quality determines output relevance; getting to the highest accuracy levels involves many architectural nuances, including proper \"chunking\" and input data \"re-ranking.\") During the podcast, ASUG CEO Geoff Scott hit on exactly this issue:\n\nThe modern day AI is a pattern-based scenario, which means you can get very different responses from it depending on what the inputs are. And so I did ask a testing vendor supplier last week. I said, 'How might your testing tools change over time, if more and more of our systems become AI enabled, and the answers that it gives back are not highly predictable, highly consistent, if/then/else answers?' And you know that individual didn't have a great answer for me, which I thought, you know, again, I think we're on the forefront of this.'\n\nSAP is clearly trying to address this kind of uncertainty with these announcements. But as Scott points out, the challenge will be that companies will need to cultivate a culture of experimentation, while proving that the investments made in such experiments add up to something. Here, SAP can also help, by delivering embedded AI that gets a result, or generates 'next best actions' that make sense.\n\nGreenbaum isn't wrong: SAP still has a lot to prove in the data platform/insights arena. But this is the right ambition for SAP to have. The product branding is not a concern - it's all in the follow through. The initial review is done; further customer reactions will have to wait.\n\nUpdated, February 15, 2025, with a few minor tweaks for reading clarity and a quote from ASUG's AI podcast.",

            "content": "SAP users have asked for transparent discounting and commercial arrangements following the business app giant's relaunch of Business Suite and extended alliance with Databricks.\n\nUnder the strategy Business Unleashed, SAP this week announced the relaunch of Business Suite as a \"truly modular, composable\" set of cloud applications. Through its agreement with Databricks, the analytics and machine learning platform provider, SAP is also launching a managed set of analytics products across all business processes including finance, procurement, and HR, integrating data from SAP applications.\n\nGerman-speaking user group DSAG \u2013 which represents SAP customers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland \u2013 welcomed the move to relaunch Business Suite but called for transparent discount scales based on the number of modules a customer chooses to buy.\n\nThe name will be familiar to longstanding SAP customers and partners. SAP Business Suite 7, for example, was launched in 2006 and includes the ERP application ECC6. The vendor is set to end mainstream support after 2027 and extended support after 2030.\n\nSpeaking to journalists this week, Jan Gilg, chief revenue officer for the Americas, said: \"You might remember we had an SAP Business Suite 20 years ago in our on-prem world. Now we are launching the SAP Business Suite as a truly modular, composable cloud suite.\n\n\"Over the last couple of years, we've brought together our various applications \u2013 some through acquisition \u2013 that came with different technology stacks. We have spent significant effort not only to integrate business processes but also to harmonize the data model. Now the cost center in [ERP system] S/4HANA, for instance, is the same as the cost center in [expense management software] Concur. Those solutions can talk with each other seamlessly, but also from a UX integration, technical properties like joint provisioning, and so on.\"\n\nThomas Henzler, DSAG board member for sales, production, and logistics, said customers could previously not always benefit from buying everything from SAP as a single source, describing this as a major disadvantage.\n\n\"This often meant that solutions from other manufacturers were also purchased in tenders. The customer always had to negotiate individual deals with SAP, for example, for customer experience or procurement solutions.\n\n\"There was a lack of transparency as to what commercial advantage the customer actually gained from purchasing everything from SAP. In addition, purchases from the past were generally not taken into account for discounts in new deals.\"\n\nHe welcomed the move to integrate products, but said SAP should also address the problem of commercial transparency.\n\n\"Like an insurance policy, the customer should benefit from buying several SAP products. There should be a corresponding discount scale that makes transparent the number of SAP solutions purchased for which discount,\" Henzler said.\n\nIn its data platform with Databricks \u2013 formally the SAP Business Data Cloud \u2013 SAP aims to offer \"insight apps\" that use analytics tools and AI models connected to real-time data from applications to provide insights and planning capabilities across a range of business activities.\n\nSebastian Westphal, DSAG chief technology officer, said: \"The implementation will now depend on which insight apps SAP will offer, when and under what conditions, for example, with what added value, at what cost, and with what requirements. The contractual and operational complexity is not yet foreseeable. We expect that extensive information will be provided and system access will have to be clarified \u2013 especially in the event that SAP takes on operational responsibility here.\"\n\nThe suite will support bi-directional data sharing between SAP Business Data Cloud and third-party data platforms, but only with Databricks' Delta Lake open table format \"as the initial delivery.\"\n\nOther vendors including AWS, Google, Snowflake, and Cloudera \u2013 all of whom have broad data and analytics portfolios \u2013 favor the rival table format Iceberg, which originated at Netflix.\n\n\"Over time, we plan to support additional data platforms and table formats,\" SAP said in a statement. \u00ae",

At their flanks, oblivious to the mood, jackdaws jink and swoop, playful against a ruddy sky. They sense the change; the stirring which is easier felt than observed. The subtle signs of spring are here though: the mauve alder catkins, the swelling pink buds of hawthorn, a single primrose, and something different in the air. Winter has no scent, but a warm day today has conjured the smell of burgeoning life.\n\nMy reverie is broken by a stick poking my backside. My youngest daughter is bored and requests we resume our purpose: to visit the Lady of the Woods. The Lady isn\u2019t hard to find; she\u2019s a splendid birch tree, a towering pale column in the gathering gloom, and, of the many gifts she offers, we are hoping to collect some sap. Her intrinsic elegance \u2013 alluded to by the colloquial name we have for her \u2013 belies a tenacious nature, that of a pioneer, and a hardy interloper among established forestry. My accompanying daughter\u2019s middle name is Betula, Latin for birch. We knew that, born last, she would grow fast and jostle for space alongside her brother and sister.\n\nView image in fullscreen Birch sap dripping out of a spile. Photograph: Michael White\n\nBirch sap is usually in season around mid-February, and, sure enough, after the rising of the sycamore sap that precedes it, I noticed the telltale sign of swollen birch buds. And so yesterday I bored a shallow hole in the trunk and knocked in a sap spile (a type of metal spout with a hook from which a container can be suspended). Now, 24 hours later, the two-litre bottle is full and, when I remove it for emptying, the clear sap trickles in a steady stream from the spout. My own little sapling doesn\u2019t waste a drop. Her young palate can detect the 1%-2% sugar content, but the appeal of drinking sap isn\u2019t just in the fructose and glucose, you are engaging in an almost mythical act, imbibing the rising energy of spring.\n\nThe season is short and once it has passed, the birch will heal quickly, allowing for a sustainable annual harvest. So, while the sap runs, we will collect daily and reduce the essence of early spring to a thick sweet syrup over a wood-burning stove, and give thanks to our Lady for the sensational pancakes to come.",

The company\u2019s strategic buyouts, branch openings and decent loan demand should aid the company. With interest rates likely to remain high for longer, its net interest income (NII) will get support. The Zacks analyst expects expect NII (managed) to show a CAGR of 3.4% by 2027. Yet the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will hurt fee income growth. Our estimate for non-interest income indicates an 11.6% fall in 2025. As it invests heavily in technology and marketing, expenses are expected to remain elevated. Our estimates for non-interest expenses reflect a CAGR of 2.5% by 2025. Weak asset quality is worrisome. However, a resurgence in deal-making activities and a solid pipeline will drive the investment banking (IB) business. We expect IB fees to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% by 2027.\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

JPM, Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, SAP SE SAP and Gencor Industries, Inc. GENC.\n\nStory Continues\n\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan here >>>)\n\nShares of Costco have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+48.7% vs. +26.1%). The company, being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.\n\n\n\nA favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Costco here >>>)\n\nSAP\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+65.6% vs. +6.4%). The company\u2019s fourth-quarter performance gained from robust cloud demand, especially solid uptake of its Rise with SAP and Grow with SAP solutions. Its cloud revenues rose 27% year over year to \u20ac4.71 billion, powered by 35% growth in the Cloud ERP Suite sales.\n\n\n\nCloud backlog was up 40% to \u20ac63 billion at the end of 2024. A strong focus on Business AI and Joule development is poised to boost sales through 2027. The company\u2019s healthy profit and cash flow statements position it for long-term growth.\n\n\n\nSAP\u2019s revised 2025 outlook succeeds the previous Ambition 2025 strategy. It now expects cloud and software sales in the \u20ac33.1-\u20ac33.6 billion band, up from the prior view of \u20ac29.83 billion at cc. However, continued softness in the Software license and support business poses a headwind. Rising restructuring costs affect its margins.\n\n(You can read the full research report on SAP here >>>)\n\nShares of Gencor have underperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Thermal Products industry over the past year (-13.9% vs. +39.5%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $201.40 million is facing challenges which include an 8.3% third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenue decline due to shipment delays, decreasing gross margins and rising operating expenses.\n\n\n\nWhile Gencor's robust backlog is a positive indicator, over-reliance could expose the company to risks if order fulfillment delays persist. Additionally, increased reliance on non-operating income and marketable securities introduces volatility, posing risks in uncertain economic conditions.\n\n\n\nGencor\u2019s strong backlog grew 67% to $46.6 million as of Jun 30, 2024, signaling strong demand and future revenue potential despite a recent revenue decline. The company's solid financial position, with $116.6 million in cash and no debt, enhances its strategic flexibility.

            "content": "SAP threatened by its own legacy software\n\nCustomers show shocking preference for perpetual licence over subscription\n\nEnterprise software giant SAP is facing a major hurdle that could seriously dent its revenue stream: support for its own legacy software.\n\nSpecifically, the danger comes from other vendors supporting SAP\u2019s old ECC system long after the German firm marks it as end of life.\n\nSAP is pushing hard for its customers to migrate to its newer S/4HANA platform, launched back in 2015.\n\nHowever, Gartner points out that if SAP sticks to its plan to pull the plug on legacy support for ECC by 2027, and extended support by 2030, it risks losing a huge portion of its highly profitable support revenue.\n\nThe research firm estimates that nearly a quarter of SAP's ERP customer base will still be running ECC by 2030.\n\nCost and pressure are holding customers back\n\nGartner suggests that customers are hesitant to switch to the new system due to the hefty investment and pressure involved. Bluntly, they don't see enough return to justify the move.\n\nSpeaking about the large SAP customer base still running ECC, Gartner principal analyst Calum McDonald told The Register: \"A lot of them feel like they're being forced almost that way due to the pressure of the end of support, and they just can't justify that extremely large investment for what they see, as of yet, as a limited return.\"\n\nSAP has spent almost a decade pleading with its customers to move to S4/HANA. It\u2019s waxed lyrical about a better UI, real-time reporting and advanced analytics, and has even promised to support the tool until 2040.\n\nDespite those efforts, a significant proportion of SAP\u2019s ERP users \u2013 60%, according to Gartner \u2013 are still running ECC. It expects that to fall to 40% in five years\u2019 time, or 24% of SAP\u2019s total customer base.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many of those users prefer ECC's perpetual licence model, compared to S4/HANA\u2019s ongoing subscription.\n\n\"It is a step too far for most,\" said McDonald. \"For most customers, they don't see it as a compelling reason to sacrifice all the investments that they made thus far.\"\n\nMcDonald warned that hefty costs to migrate to S4/HANA could push users toward third-party support providers as a more cost-effective alternative to sticking with SAP\u2019s relatively expensive support business.\n\nThat could leave SAP in a tight spot, which might give customers the leverage to demand a perpetual license for S4/HANA.\n\nGartner VP Bill Ryan said it would be a hard battle, but \u201cSAP will grudgingly come to the table\u201d if customers can make their case well.\n\n\n\nIn addition to its system switch drive, SAP has doubled down on a company-wide restructuring effort that would see it shut about 8,000 jobs. And just like we saw with Amazon and Meta, AI is said to be playing a key role in this new restructuring arrangement.",

As the world\u2019s leading provider of end-to-end enterprise applications, SAP has unmatched insights into how businesses in every industry run, how their processes connect, and how the data coursing out of those processes and interactions can be used to drive optimal business outcomes.\n\nSo while business applications used to sit at the top of the software stack because they power processes across an enterprise and generate that high-value data, here in the AI Revolution that data is no longer the end in itself but instead has become the raw material of the new IT powerhouse: AI overall and agents in particular.\n\nAs I see it, this transformation will make enterprise applications even more strategic and valuable than ever before \u2014 after all, without their primary source of nutrition (the data generated by the apps), AI initiatives are doomed to fail regardless of how much money is thrown at them.\n\nI believe SAP\u2019s new Business Data Cloud should be thought of as its Fourth Horseman of Business Transformation, making good on the long-promised \u201cintelligent enterprise\u201d in a new approach centered on data, powered by AI, and enriched by applications.\n\nSAP\u2019s Four Horsemen of Business Transformation\n\nIn short form, here\u2019s how I see the new Business Data Cloud fitting into the unique value proposition SAP offers for the AI Era:\n\nBusiness Suite: SAP\u2019s core applications that manage end-to-end processes via a single data model yielding data fully optimized for AI\n\nBusiness Technology Platform: unifies data and analytics, AI, app dev, automation, integration\n\nBusiness AI: SAP\u2019s complete portfolio of AI solutions and technologies, from agents to machine learning. SAP is releasing a new fleet of agents orchestrated by Joule, and also an \u201cagent builder\u201d that offers full semantic context to enable these customer- or partner-built agents to instantly fit in with existing end-to-end processes.\n\nBusiness Data Cloud: a more modern and more capable evolutionary step upward from Datasphere that accelerates time to value by harmonizing *all* enterprise data, whether inside or outside SAP systems\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nAm I Saying Enterprise Apps Are Becoming Extinct?\n\nNo way! That is absolutely, positively *not* my point; instead, I\u2019m strongly urging business customers to evaluate what we used to call \u201capps vendors\u201d in an entirely different way with applications being only one element in the required table stakes. For business customers, the \u201capps vendors\u201d must now be looked at and scrutinized and selected on the basis of being able to deliver a spectrum of services and technologies and capabilities that are no longer limited to apps plus some platform stuff and some head-nodding toward AI and agents.\n\nRather, the new model has to be centered on the vendor\u2019s ability to power world-class business outcomes with AI: from the apps that generate the data to the platform that holds everything together to the data cloud that unifies and harmonizes the data that powers AI solutions and innovations.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nSo what do we call these new-fangled thingies that we\u2019ve hereunto called \u201capplication vendors\u201d? Well, I suppose that old name will endure for a while \u2014 and the name itself is not as important as a clear understanding of the value they need to be able to deliver.\n\nI suspect we\u2019ll see customers think about them more and more as \u201cAI vendors\u201d and/or \u201cAI data vendors,\u201d with the ultimate moniker perhaps being something more along the lines of \u201cinnovation engines.\u201d\n\nWhatever the new handle turns out to be, the key is this: Applications are still incredibly necessary but are no longer close to being sufficient. And the apps are no longer the end game \u2014 rather, they\u2019re part of the food chain for the AI-powered innovation engine of AI.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

            "content": "SAP Sets Databricks Alliance, Launches Business Data Cloud\n\nThe new data management system incorporating Databricks data engineering and AI capabilities is targeted at improving business access to data for analytical, digital transformation and AI initiatives.\n\nSAP today unveiled SAP Business Data Cloud, the latest generation of the software giant\u2019s data management platform for unifying data, both from SAP applications and third-party systems, for analytical and AI tasks.\n\nIn addition to incorporating \u2013 and building on \u2013 current SAP products including Business Warehouse, Datasphere and Analytics Cloud, Business Data Cloud offers natively embedded data engineering, AI and machine learning technology through a new OEM deal with Databricks.\n\nBusiness Data Cloud includes new capabilities and pre-built content including packaged data products derived from SAP applications and what the company calls \u201cinsight applications\u201d that use that data and AI models connected to real-time data for advanced analytics and planning across lines of business such as finance and human resource management.\n\n[Related: SAP \u2018Supercharging\u2019 Joule AI Copilot With New Agent Capabilities]\n\nThe new data platform also boosts the operation of Joule, SAP\u2019s AI copilot that launched in September 2023, for cross-functional workflows and business decision-making.\n\nSAP also debuted a series of ready-to-use Joule agents that work with SAP finance, service and sales applications, and new AI agent builder capabilities that allow customers to extend Joule agents and build and deploy their own AI agents. A key component of SAP\u2019s agent infrastructure is the company\u2019s Knowledge Graph data modeling technology, which SAP debuted one year ago, that semantically understands relationships across data sets and makes it possible to discover insights and patterns across applications and systems.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to create exponential value for organizations around the world, whether that's in the form of automating tasks that require a significant amount of human engagement today or, in some cases, doing tasks that just couldn't be done or weren't practical to be done by any amount of human engagement in the past. Or also to provide the insights with predictive capabilities with next best action recommendations to allow for better, more efficient decision making,\u201d said Muhammad Alam, SAP head of product engineering, during an online press briefing Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBut what our customers are telling us is that they're struggling to implement and realize the value of AI in their organizations,\u201d Alam said. \u201cIt's hard to get reliable data, high-quality data sets across the enterprise, to power this AI. Many have done hundreds of [proof of concepts] but have not been able to get them to production effectively. And the ones that have been able to get to production haven't really seen the adoption that they're looking for to be able to realize the value.\u201d\n\nSAP is uniquely positioned to provide these capabilities, Alam said, because of the company\u2019s business applications that create data used for data analytics and AI models, which in turn support business processes and workflows that benefit from AI and analytical results.\n\nSAP, like many IT companies, earlier integrated its software with the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. But Alam escribed the new alliance as a \u201ctruly one-of-kind partnership in the tech space.\u201d During the online press conference Irfan Khan, chief product officer for SAP data and analytics, noted that many SAP and Databricks customers already use both companies\u2019 products.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all this investment in AI, but ultimately AI is only as good as the data,\u201d said Shanku Niyogi, Databricks vice president of product management, in an interview with CRN. \u201cEveryone wants to get more value out of their data and SAP platforms have some of the most valuable enterprise data.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost companies today already have a data strategy in place,\u201d said Daniel Yu, chief marketing officer for SAP data and analytics, also in an interview with CRN. They have assembled data warehouses and data lakes surrounded by data governance policies, he said, and now they are trying to leverage those systems for digital transformation and AI initiatives.\n\nBut Yu said these efforts have created \u201cwhat we call the data divide, the disconnect between the large investment that [organizations] have made in data platforms and the data that companies need to be able to run their business\u2026this is between IT and the business users.\u201d\n\nYu said that the SAP Business Data Cloud is designed to bridge this divide with its pre-built data content, embedded Databricks capabilities, and SAP\u2019s existing Datasphere, Analytics Cloud and Business Warehouse systems. He emphasized Business Data Cloud\u2019s ability to incorporate data from SAP and non-SAP systems from both cloud and on-premises sources.\n\nThrough the relationship with Databricks, every Business Data Cloud user can easily move SAP data into the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform and have immediate access to its capabilities, Niyogi said, pointing to AI-assisted data science and SQL data warehousing as examples. They also will have access to the entire stack of Mosaic generative AI capabilities that Databricks acquired when it bought startup MosaicML in 2023.\n\nSAP Business Data Cloud actually works by providing access to the serverless Databricks platform using integrated permissions and relies on the Delta Sharing open protocol developed by Databricks that allows organizations to securely share data across different cloud platforms without replicating or copying the data. While Databricks has data integration relations with many other IT vendors, Niyogi said the SAP alliance integrates the two companies\u2019 technology at the business model layer.\n\n\u201cSo from an SAP perspective, it almost feels like a native application even though we're hosting that [Databricks] service ourselves,\u201d Niyogi said. \u201cSo this is a new level of integration for us, probably one that we will explore with others. But we're excited about the opportunity that this creates for SAP given just the sheer size of the important, mission-critical data that SAP has.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery company on the planet wants to get more value out of their data and greater returns on their AI investments,\u201d said Ali Ghodsi, Databricks co-founder and CEO, in a statement announcing SAP Business Data Cloud. \u201cBy joining forces with SAP, we\u2019re helping organizations bring together all their data \u2013 regardless of format or where it lives \u2013 to govern, analyze and build domain-specific AI applications on the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform.\u201d\n\nFor partners, Yu said Business Data Cloud will make it easier for systems integrators and solution providers to build and deliver data solutions to their customers and develop data-centric applications that run on the new system.\n\nDatasphere is SAP\u2019s platform-as-a-service data fabric offering for building data pipelines. When asked during the online press conference about Datasphere\u2019s future, SAP executives acknowledged that Datasphere is \u201cevolving\u201d into Business Data Cloud.\n\nBusiness Data Cloud will initially be available on the Amazon Web Services platform followed closely by availability on Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.\n\nThis story was updated with additional information from Databricks at 8:20 pm ET Feb. 13, 2024.",

            "content": "In the sizeable global ERP market, SAP's biggest threat is not some other software giant like Oracle. It is its own legacy software supported by other vendors.\n\nSo daunting is the prospect of switching providers for the largest customers, if SAP sticks to its plan to end legacy system support in 2030, it could lose a huge chunk of high-margin revenue to that competition unless it opts to delay the deadline again.\n\nGartner makes the case that despite SAP, the world's largest ERP vendor, trying to convince customers to move off its legacy ECC system onto the current S/4HANA software \u2013 launched in February 2015 \u2013 around 24 per cent of SAP's ERP user base will still be running the old software in 2030 when extended support ends. Mainstream support, which includes product updates as well as patches, ends in 2027.\n\nAround 60 percent of SAP ERP customers are on ECC6 (ECC). By 2030, Gartner estimates that more than 40 percent of those customers will still use ECC for key business areas. That's nearly a quarter of SAP's ERP user base going out of support in five years.\n\nSAP spent nearly a decade trying to get users to move to its latest ERP platform, saying it has a better UI, improved agility, real-time reporting, and advanced analytics, among other things. But it's also a shift to a completely new platform and business processes, which is a daunting task for users who have spent years and millions of dollars implementing and embedding the system into their commercial operations.\n\nDespite SAP's efforts and some progress, a significant number of users remain unconvinced of the need to jump.\n\nCalum McDonald, principal analyst in Gartner's Sourcing, Procurement and Vendor Management organization, told The Register: \"A lot of customers are stable on ECC, and have been for years now. Many of them struggle to come to terms with the idea of making a multimillion-dollar \u2013 often larger when you take into account everything that comes into it rather than just the licensing \u2013 investment when the only time pressure they feel is from SAP and the cutting off of support. It is not necessarily an intentional decision. A lot of them feel like they're being forced almost that way due to the pressure of the end of support, and they just can't justify that extremely large investment for what they see, as of yet, as a limited return.\"\n\nBill Ryan, Gartner vice president and leader in Sourcing, Procurement and Vendor Management, pointed out that if users want to take advantage of an in-memory database, they can migrate their instance of ECC applications to HANA, without having to go through the business process upheaval to get to S/4HANA.\n\n\"The lack of a business case has been an issue from day one, and it remains an issue,\" he told us.\n\nFor both SAP and its customers, the implications of a large chunk of ECC users staying on the platform after 2030 will be serious. For users, it means weighing up the options. Before they get to the 2030 deadline, they must first decide whether to go for SAP's offer of extended support after mainstream support ends in 2027. Although customers won't get product updates, they will get the same SLAs, bug fixes, and patches as before 2027.\n\n\"It is similar to mainstream maintenance; it's after 2030 where things really change,\" said Ryan.\n\nStaying with SAP means the prospect of customer-specific support. \"It's a premium paid, but there are no guarantees or SLAs. . Support is mainly limited to providing existing solutions to fix known bugs. It's not really a place where most customers are going to want to end up,\" said McDonald.\n\nThe alternative is third-party support from independent providers such as Rimini Street, Spinnaker Support, or Support Revolution. McDonald said a growing number of customers were beginning to explore the possibility of third-party support, not least because it was cheaper than the alternative.\n\n\"That's purely due to SAP's limitation of the end of support date, which is forcing them to evaluate all options ahead of them,\" said McDonald. \"There are some technical limitations to what can be done with third-party support as compared to SAP support. However, the costs involved and the cost of changing or upgrading to S/4HANA often make that case a lot stronger for customers who are exploring third-party support now.\"\n\nWhen a quarter of ERP customers are determined to stay with its legacy product after extended support ends, it creates a serious dilemma for the vendor, and customers should be aware.\n\nRyan points out that SAP's support revenue is extremely profitable, especially since the vendor is not enhancing the ECC product. \"Are they going to walk away from very high-margin revenue, or put it at risk for thousands of ECC customers in 2030? Can they?\"\n\nGartner doesn't have the answer, but it does think it is enough of a problem to lead \"SAP to reconsider its maintenance end date and cloud migration strategy,\" according to a recent research note.\n\nSAP has remained steadfast in its determination to stick to its 2027 and 2030 deadlines. However, it has indicated that there may be some concession to the services allowing cloud migration beyond 2030 so long as users sign up to a \"cloud subscription transition option.\" SAP CEO Christian Klein told investors: \"It's not about the extension of on-premises maintenance.\"\n\nThe problem is that many users are happy with perpetual licenses and are not all that keen on moving to subscription licenses. Whether users have moved from ECC to S/4HANA or not, subscription licenses can be akin to being asked to sell their house and rent it back from SAP.\n\n\"It is a step too far for most,\" said McDonald. \"For most customers, they don't see it as a compelling reason to sacrifice all the investments that they made thus far.\"\n\nRyan said: \"It's probably an uphill battle from a commercial perspective because SAP has pulled back discounts and that sort of thing, but it does remain a choice. SAP does continue to offer a contract conversion program from ECC to S/4HANA and so it shouldn't just be this following the vendor to where they want you to go.\"\n\nHe said that customers wanting to remain on perpetual licenses would need to \"go through a process of convincing SAP that the only way they're going to get some S/4HANA revenue\" is by allowing them to continue with a perpetual license. If they can make the case, \"SAP will grudgingly come to the table,\" he said.\n\nThe leverage they can use to remain on perpetual licensing is the threat of staying on ECC and using third-party support. \"It's easier than changing vendor for the whole software. At the moment, ECC is the biggest competitor to S/4HANA at this time, and the third-party option allows it to be a competitor for longer than SAP has taken the commercial decision to limit,\" McDonald said.\n\nThe message from SAP is clear. It won't extend support beyond 2027 and 2030. But when it looks at the revenue numbers come 2030, it will have to see if the position still adds up.\n\nSAP declined to comment. \u00ae",

            "content": "Today, SAP announced the new Business Data Cloud product at the Business Unleashed event. This data platform lays the foundation for AI-driven decision-making. By bringing operational and external data together in an intelligent layer, the platform opens the door to faster analytics, smarter automation, and closer integration between IT and day-to-day operations. We spoke about the Business Data Cloud with CRO Americas and SAP Business Suite Jan Gilg shortly before the launch.\n\nFor those who use SAP\u2019s data products, it is often clear that operational data hides many insights. Gilg points out that this is partly because most global trade touches an SAP system in one way or another. However, plenty of valuable information resides in other systems as well. Companies appear to struggle precisely with combining the operational data from SAP systems with data from other sources. There is still a huge mountain of business data that could be better utilized despite all the steps within the tech industry that have been taken to address it.\n\nAs far as SAP is concerned, the wheel needs to change toward a broader vision of the future of enterprise AI. The days when data was simply stored and later analyzed are behind us, and so SAP\u2019s data portfolio is also shifting. After all, modern companies need an environment in which data actively contributes to optimizing processes, predicting market trends, and supporting real-time decisions.\n\nThe Business Data Cloud should become the missing link for any business. This is a platform where data is not only managed but also enriched and instantly deployable within AI-driven workflows. The right insights should emerge from this new environment.\n\nFinding the perfect match\n\nThis accurate and reliable data can be useful in gaining insights and building AI apps. However, many AI models currently struggle with inconsistent or unstructured input. SAP can hopefully make progress by training AI on high-quality, semantically enriched data directly from core systems. After all, that translates into more reliable and context-aware AI that recognizes patterns and understands how they relate to business operations.\n\nTo achieve that in the right way, you\u2019ll also have to look at how to set up the data foundation and infrastructure properly. SAP has built options for that itself, but there are absolute preferred products available on the market from companies. SAP thus ended up with an OEM partnership with Databricks. This creates a hybrid model in which companies can bring together, analyze and deploy data from different sources for AI-driven insights without friction or duplication. According to Gilg, Databricks makes additional sense because customers often already use SAP and Databricks products. \u201cThe customer reality shows that a lot run Databricks. We don\u2019t want to go for rip-and-replace, but fit into a customer\u2019s landscape,\u201d Gilg said. The Business Data Cloud is thus natively integrated with Databricks\u2019 lakehouse, allowing companies to combine SAP data and non-SAP data effortlessly.\n\nComprehensive data engineering options\n\nSAP, through its partnership with Databricks, is also opening the door for users to embrace more data engineering. This platform streamlines how businesses process, transform and prepare data for AI and BI. Through native support for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data engineers can structure and optimize raw data within a single integrated system. This reduces reliance on separate data warehouses and data warehouses, allowing companies to generate insights faster and spend less time on complex data processing.\n\nWe referred to this concept above as the lakehouse, something Databricks has been building and quickly becoming popular with recently. In the meantime, Databricks is talking more about the Data Intelligence Platform, which offers some additional options over the lakehouse but works similarly. It is what SAP is now using through an OEM partnership at the Business Data Cloud. Databricks can further accelerate data engineering processes through automation and optimization. With techniques like Delta Live Tables, data engineers can quickly build pipelines that automatically stay up-to-date and minimize errors. As a result, operational SAP and external data are available for analysis faster and remain more reliable and consistent across departments and applications.\n\nThe Data Intelligence Platform should make data engineering more powerful and accessible to a wider audience. Low-code and no-code functionalities allow data engineers, analysts, and business users with limited programming knowledge to model and transform data streams.\n\nTip: Databricks moves from lakehouse to data intelligence\n\nIs the end of data silos near?\n\nGilg explains that in the past, enterprise data management was often a fragmented process, with silos of information spread across different departments and systems. SAP Business Data Cloud promises to break this barrier by creating a unified semantic layer where all relevant data comes together. Operational data remains in SAP, while other data resides in Databricks. In addition to better analysis, this should also form the basis for AI applications beyond static dashboards and reports. \u201cIt breaks down silos,\u201d Gilg foresees. \u201cThe Business Data Cloud becomes the starting point where you build analytics and reports.\u201d\n\nOne example is the Insight apps SAP plans to enable through the Business Data Cloud. These applications promise to help companies generate real-time insights and take immediate action. This is done by connecting data products and AI models with real-time data, giving users more accurate analysis and better planning. With the launch of Business Data Cloud, a finance Insight app will become available. By processing financial data in real-time and enriching it with AI models, companies can optimize cash flow, assess risks, and simulate the impact of decisions. Whereas traditional financial reporting often provides a look back at the past, AI allows for more forward looking and proactive action.\n\nUltimately, Gilg foresees much being possible on the Insight front. Because the Business Data Cloud has finance, spend and supply chain data from SAP S/4HANA and SAP Ariba, different scenarios are possible. Some things are also possible from the HR data from SAP SuccessFactors. The data from these SAP systems all keep their original business context and semantics without the need for data extraction first. The Insight apps run on top of the Business Data Cloud; users can take them from a central location. \u201cCustomers can subscribe to it and then build their own dashboards, plus through partners they have,\u201d Gilg explains.\n\nWith this, SAP aims further to grow AI into an integrated part of business operations. This combined with the emergence of AI agents, automated assistants that can take over repetitive tasks in SAP and speed up processes. In this, the co-pilot Joule should have a coordinating role, as SAP promised during the Business Data Cloud presentation. The co-pilot directs these AI agents based on real-time business data, which should become further insightful via the Business Data Cloud. The agents can access the right data to perform tasks and make recommendations.\n\nFrom data to strategy\n\nWith the introduction of SAP Business Data Cloud, SAP is taking a fundamental step toward a future in which AI, data and business processes form one integrated whole. That may sound like a familiar ambition to some SAP users. Indeed, the ERP giant launched Datasphere two years ago, expressing similar ambitions. When asked, Gilg indicated that the Business Data Cloud is an evolution of Datasphere and other SAP data products. As far as SAP is concerned, the Business Data Cloud will soon be the most logical and comprehensive option, to which customers will also naturally switch automatically. \u201cSome concepts are very valid,\u201d Gilg refers to previous data products. \u201cWhat is new is to really offer it as a service and really offer users data products.\u201d\n\nAll in all, the German software company still sees too many organizations struggling to combine operational data from SAP systems with data from other sources. That deserves a new approach for which SAP and Databricks are moving closer together. We are curious how this will play out further in the coming months.\n\nTip: SAP continues to build out AI capabilities S/4HANA, first steps with AI agents",

            "content": "Thursday, February 13, 2025\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) and SAP SE (SAP), as well as a micro-cap stock Gencor Industries, Inc. (GENC). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company\u2019s strategic buyouts, branch openings and decent loan demand should aid the company. With interest rates likely to remain high for longer, its net interest income (NII) will get support. The Zacks analyst expects expect NII (managed) to show a CAGR of 3.4% by 2027.\n\n\n\nYet the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will hurt fee income growth. Our estimate for non-interest income indicates an 11.6% fall in 2025. As it invests heavily in technology and marketing, expenses are expected to remain elevated. Our estimates for non-interest expenses reflect a CAGR of 2.5% by 2025. Weak asset quality is worrisome.\n\n\n\nHowever, a resurgence in deal-making activities and a solid pipeline will drive the investment banking (IB) business. We expect IB fees to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% by 2027.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Costco have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+48.7% vs. +26.1%). The company, being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.\n\n\n\nA favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Costco here >>>)\n\n\n\nSAP\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+65.6% vs. +6.4%). The company\u2019s fourth-quarter performance gained from robust cloud demand, especially solid uptake of its Rise with SAP and Grow with SAP solutions. Its cloud revenues rose 27% year over year to \u20ac4.71 billion, powered by 35% growth in the Cloud ERP Suite sales.\n\n\n\nCloud backlog was up 40% to \u20ac63 billion at the end of 2024. A strong focus on Business AI and Joule development is poised to boost sales through 2027. The company\u2019s healthy profit and cash flow statements position it for long-term growth.\n\n\n\nSAP\u2019s revised 2025 outlook succeeds the previous Ambition 2025 strategy. It now expects cloud and software sales in the \u20ac33.1-\u20ac33.6 billion band, up from the prior view of \u20ac29.83 billion at cc. However, continued softness in the Software license and support business poses a headwind. Rising restructuring costs affect its margins.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on SAP here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Gencor have underperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Thermal Products industry over the past year (-13.9% vs. +39.5%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $201.40 million is facing challenges which include an 8.3% third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenue decline due to shipment delays, decreasing gross margins and rising operating expenses.\n\n\n\nWhile Gencor's robust backlog is a positive indicator, over-reliance could expose the company to risks if order fulfillment delays persist. Additionally, increased reliance on non-operating income and marketable securities introduces volatility, posing risks in uncertain economic conditions.\n\n\n\nGencor\u2019s strong backlog grew 67% to $46.6 million as of Jun 30, 2024, signaling strong demand and future revenue potential despite a recent revenue decline. The company's solid financial position, with $116.6 million in cash and no debt, enhances its strategic flexibility. Benefits from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) further support Gencor's market position.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Gencor here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shell plc (SHEL), Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

            "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on SAP SE (SAP) on Substack by Northwest Frontier Capital. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on SAP. SAP SE (SAP)'s share was trading at $288.87 as of Feb 11th. SAP\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 105.82 and 44.25 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nA business professional in a room with multiple screens reviewing analytics of digital inventory.\n\nSAP's recent results may have prompted muted reactions due to concerns over a slight deceleration in cloud backlog growth for 2025, but this narrow perspective misses the bigger picture. SAP is executing at an exceptional level, positioning itself for sustained revenue acceleration, margin expansion, and a significant AI-driven opportunity. The company has now delivered 11 consecutive quarters of stable or accelerating cloud backlog growth, expanding from \u20ac8 billion to \u20ac18 billion, defying early skepticism about its ability to transition customers to the cloud. This success stems from SAP\u2019s commitment to transforming its core ERP product into a cloud-native solution through S/4 and guiding customers through complex cloud migrations with its RISE program. The result has been a formula that continues to drive growth and enhance customer retention, a trend SAP\u2019s leadership expects to strengthen further.\n\nCEO Christian Klein underscored this momentum by highlighting that retention rates are improving, cloud revenue growth remains strong, and adoption rates continue to rise. While some peers, such as Microsoft and ServiceNow, have faced challenges selling AI-driven products to enterprises, SAP benefits from its ability to sell full-scale cloud transformation, a trend reinforced by recent strong results from Atlassian. This confidence is also reflected in SAP\u2019s long-term revenue opportunity. The company estimates a 3x cloud conversion multiple, meaning that converting the remaining \u20ac11 billion in maintenance revenue could yield an additional \u20ac33 billion in cloud revenue over time. This presents a substantial growth runway, with SAP well-positioned to capitalize on it.\n\nBeyond revenue expansion, SAP\u2019s margin story is an equally compelling yet underappreciated aspect of its transformation. The company\u2019s cloud gross margin rose 1.4 percentage points to 73.3% in 2024, driven by infrastructure optimization, scale benefits from its centralized HANA database, and increased adoption of multi-tenant architectures. As a result, operating profit surged 25% to \u20ac8.15 billion, underscoring the efficiency gains from SAP\u2019s transition. These trends align with past cloud transformation success stories. When comparing SAP\u2019s operating margin trajectory to those of Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk\u2014companies that underwent similar transitions\u2014SAP\u2019s current margin expansion of four percentage points is still in its early stages. Historically, cloud transitions have led to margin expansions of around 15 percentage points over time. Given SAP\u2019s execution and ongoing cost efficiencies, margins have significant room for further growth, a factor not yet fully reflected in investor sentiment.",

            "content": "By 2030, 40 percent of SAP customers currently using its legacy ERP systems will still not have migrated to the latest software, prompting the business apps giant to rethink its support deadline.\n\nOr so says business consultancy Gartner. In 2020, SAP put back the mainstream support deadline for customers using its Business Suite 7 (BS7) applications \u2013 including the ERP software SAP ECC 6.0 \u2013 from 2025 until 2027, with extended support available until 2030 at a 2 percent premium. Since then, Europe's largest software vendor has stuck to the deadline, and few commentators have suggested it would budge.\n\nLast month, SAP suggested its largest customers might be given some room to maneuver. It is expected to announce a cloud subscription transition option designed for ERP customers with large and very complex IT landscapes who need more time to make the switch via RISE with SAP, the vendor's lift-shift-and-transform cloud migration plan offered by a group of cloud and SI partners.\n\nThe new deal is expected for customers using services designed to help the transition to RISE with SAP and maintain customers' business continuity. \"The option will be offered for the period from 2031 until the end of 2033,\" SAP's spokesperson said in January.\n\nHowever, in a paper detailing SAP customer options in moving from ECC on-prem to S/4HANA, either in the cloud or on-prem, Gartner outlines some of its assumptions.\n\n\"It has been over nine years since SAP S/4HANA was released, yet Gartner estimates that over 60 percent of SAP customers remain on ECC6 on-premises with no decision yet to move.\"\n\nBy 2030, four in ten SAP ECC customers today will still use ECC in key business areas, Gartner estimates. The prospect of such a large number of the customer base going out of support \u2013 and perhaps relying on third-party support \u2013 would lead \"SAP to reconsider its maintenance end date and cloud migration strategy.\"\n\nHowever, following last month's news of its concession to the services allowing cloud migration beyond 2030, SAP CEO Christian Klein told investors: \"It's not about the extension of on-premises maintenance.\"\n\nNonetheless, Gartner has reasons to believe the position may shift once the commercial reality starts to bite.\n\n\"While Gartner has no indications from SAP that the ECC support deadline will be extended beyond 2030, the slower pace of S/4HANA adoption by existing ECC customers does draw SAP's claim into question,\" the paper states.\n\n\"Annual support is an extremely profitable part of SAP's business, and the limited uptake of its newer offerings may necessitate it to reconsider its current approach. As a result, some customers opt to delay a decision and wait to see if SAP reconsiders its position and extends the deadline,\" Gartner predicts.\n\nThird-party support is a viable option for organizations considering keeping their ECC systems after the mainstream support deadline and after 2030, it adds.\n\n\"Gartner speaks with many SAP customers who are unable to create a compelling business case for moving to S/4HANA. The primary driver for many is SAP's claim that ECC will no longer be supported beyond 2030,\" the paper continues.\n\n\"However, with approximately two-thirds of SAP ECC customers yet to take any action toward moving to S/4HANA, customers who struggle to quantify S/4HANA business value should evaluate whether staying on ECC for the near term is a viable option. Part of that evaluation includes considering support options, whether they are from SAP or a third party, such as Rimini Street, Spinnaker Support, or Support Revolution.\"\n\nSAP has long argued that a strong business case exists to migrate from ECC to S/4HANA, especially in the cloud. Greater speed and agility in financial and operational control are among the benefits, it claims. \u00ae",

            "content": "Maple syrup season: OSU-Mansfield's sugarbush teaches sustainability through sugaring\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Producing maple syrup from sap collected at OSU-Mansfield sugarbush A grove of 1,200 maple trees at OSU-Mansfield produces sap for maple syrup production each spring.\n\nMaple syrup season has returned to North Central Ohio.\n\nSap should soon be flowing in most Ohio trees this week, said Gabe Karns, an assistant professor with the School of Environment and Natural Resources at Ohio State University.\n\nPrime syrup-making season runs from mid-February until early April when the trees start budding.\n\n\"In your ideal world, you would get down into the low-to-mid 20s at night,\" Karns said. \"During the daytime, you want it to get up around 40-45 degrees, plus sunshine.\"\n\nFaculty, students and volunteers have been busy this month preparing the sugarbush at OSU-Mansfield for this year's syrup production.\n\nTheir efforts will be on display 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. March 8 during \"Maple Madness,\" a free public event that will feature syrup-making demonstrations, tours of the woods and a meal of pancakes with fresh maple syrup.\n\nMaple syrup collection at OSU-Mansfield is for education\n\nSeveral species of maple trees are native throughout the Buckeye State.\n\nThe woods at the OSU-Mansfield campus contain a luscious 19-acre patch of maples known as the sugarbush, according to Kathy Smith, director of forestry for the School of Environment and Natural Resources at OSU.\n\nThis is the seventh season that sap is collected from the 1,200 maples in the sugarbush and made into maple syrup.\n\nThe location was developed for sap collection and maple syrup production thanks to state funding.\n\nThe sap drains through several miles of tubing in the sugarbush that gets pumped into a massive storage tank.\n\nThe site also contains a smaller wood-fired evaporator that's good for cooking a few hundred gallons of sap each day.\n\nThe evaporator at OSU-Mansfield is designed strictly for educational purposes. Most of the sap collected from the university's sugarbush is taken by a maple syrup producer from Ashland County who remotely monitors the sap tank's level.\n\n\"He's got a thousand-gallon tank on a trailer,\" Smith said. \"He comes and takes it 1,000 gallons at a time.\"\n\nDuring the height of the sap flow, the tank has to be emptied two or three times daily.\n\nSap from the Mansfield sugarbush processed in Ashland is returned to campus and available for purchase.\n\n'Sustainability through the practice of sugaring'\n\nThe project was created to teach Ohioans about maple syrup production, from landowners to students and even consumers.\n\nA shocking discovery for educators was how many people had become disconnected from what true syrup really is.\n\n\"Most syrup today, if you look at those on the shelf, they don't have any maple in them,\" Smith said.\n\nSome visitors learn that maple syrup is created from condensed tree sap. A few realize that sap from trees other than maples \u2014 like birch, hickory and sycamore \u2014 can also be made into sweet syrup. Everyone is taught that some trees can provide up to three gallons of sap each day and it takes about 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of syrup.\n\nThe system at the OSU-Mansfield sugarbush is used year-round to demonstrate to landowners and professionals the intricacies of successful sap collection. Several seminars are available for those who want to create their own sap-to-syrup operation.\n\nThe university also plans to build classes for students who would like to study Ohio's maple syrup industry.\n\n\"It will be taught through the lens of sustainability,\" Karns said. \"Local food is actually better than faraway food for a number of reasons.\"\n\nHe said the goal is to teach people that sustainability and making syrup from native Ohio trees go hand-in-hand.\n\n\"Weaving sustainability through the practice of sugaring is the furthest thing from a new thing that you can possibly imagine,\" Karns said. \"But in some ways, with some segments of society, it is sort of like an epiphany.\"\n\nztuggle@gannett.com\n\n419-564-3508",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against the other international dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years.\n\nAfter slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan\u2019s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nRegionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco\u2019s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%.\n\nWhen it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks that were most popular among hedge funds. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 11.",

After months of sticking to the basics\u2014cleanser, moisturizer, vitamin C, tretinoin, sunscreen\u2014I added an intermediate step back to my routine: Orveda\u2019s appropriately named The Vital Sap. I\u2019ve had such a good experience with it over the past six weeks that I wonder why I ever stopped using it in the first place.\n\nThe Vital Sap, which was once called The Healing Sap, isn\u2019t quite a serum, and it\u2019s not really a moisturizer. It\u2019s more like an essence: a hyper-hydrating intermezzo course designed to enhance the efficacy of whatever you apply after it. It\u2019s rich in glycerin, which dermatologists love for its humectant properties, as well as two forms of hyaluronic acid, castor oil, and amur cork tree extract. This last ingredient may be why my oily, acne-prone skin seems to be responding so well to it: research indicates the East Asian botanical has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects. Orveda says the formula also includes brightening papaya extract and an \u201cenergizing\u201d seaweed extract.\n\nHere\u2019s how I use it: After cleansing and patting my face dry, I shake three or four drops from the generous bottle into my hand, then sweep it across my cheeks, neck, and forehead, and allow it to dry before moving on to the next step. (Orveda includes a kabuki-like brush to aid in application, but I\u2019ve found that my hands are the better tool.) It\u2019s certainly helped me stave off the dry, flaky skin I tend to experience this time of year. But I\u2019ve also noticed that thicker serums slide onto my face and absorb much more easily than they did previously.\n\nWATCH\n\nBut the proof in the pudding is the shock I experienced looking in the mirror late last week. I have always struggled with the texture of my skin, and suddenly my face has started looking \u2026 smoother, softer, more refined. All this from an additional step that takes perhaps 30 seconds? Consider me a convert for life.",

What to know about the sweet season in Michigan\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Maple syrup produced at Hillegas Sugar Camp in Fairhope Sugar water is boiled down into maple syrup through a process shown at Hillegas Sugar Camp at the Somerset County Maple Producers tree tapping event.\n\nMaple sugaring \u2014 or syrup \u2014 season is approaching, and soon enough you'll notice buckets clinging to maple trees as hobbyists and commercial operators begin collecting the sweet sap to make maple syrup.\n\nCollecting sap from maple trees to make maple sugar and syrup originated with Indigenous people.\n\n\"The first people known to have manufactured maple syrup are the Native Americans living in the northeast part of North America, a long time before the arrival of the first Europeans,\" the website Maple Syrup History says. \"Using an early method of tapping the sweet sap of the maple trees, these early tribes rendered the juice into a source of high-calorie winter food. The Native Americans were generous with their technology, showing the first European colonies how to extract the syrup from the trees.\"\n\nThe European settlers took up the practice of tapping trees and refined it over the years, leading to the maple syrup industry.\n\nHere is what to know about the sweet(est) season:\n\nWhat does maple sugaring mean?\n\nMaple sugaring is a term to describe the process of making maple syrup.\n\n\"...Boiling maple sap, which evaporates the water molecules leaving one with a more concentrated sugar-rich liquid: syrup,\" Pure Michigan said.\n\nWhen does the maple sugaring season start in Michigan?\n\nMaple sugaring season starts in late February or early March, when the temperature allows for sap to run down maple trees.\n\nWhat temperature is needed for sap to run?\n\nSap harvesting relies on temperature fluctuations for the sap to move up and down the tree trunk, or into the collection equipment.\n\nA pattern of below freezing temperatures at night, combined with 40- to 45-degree days will build up pressure in maple trees and allow sap to flow, Vermont's Pure Maple website said.\n\nHow much sap does it take to make syrup?\n\nIt takes approximately 40 gallons of sap to produce just 1 gallon of maple syrup, New York's Pure Maple website said.\n\nHow long does maple sugaring season last?\n\nTypically, the season lasts four to six weeks, the Michigan State University's Extension said.\n\nHow is sap collected from maple trees?\n\nCollecting sap require several tools and items: a drill (with bit attached), hammer, spiles which channel the sap, hooks, buckets and lids.\n\nThe first step is locating a maple tree to tap \u2014 common maple species are sugar, back, red or silver. The best trees are at least 12 inches in diameter with good sunlight exposure.\n\nThe basic steps to tapping a tree, according to tapmytrees.com, include:\n\nDrill a hole : Drive a hole 3 feet above the ground above a large root or below a large branch of the tree.\n\n: Drive a hole 3 feet above the ground above a large root or below a large branch of the tree. Insert spile : tap the spile with a hammer, with the hook facing out, you'll secure the spile into the tree. If the sap is flowing, sap should flow from the spile.\n\n: tap the spile with a hammer, with the hook facing out, you'll secure the spile into the tree. If the sap is flowing, sap should flow from the spile. Hang the bucket and lid: Insert the hook into the hole on the rim of the bucket then attach the lid to the spile by inserting the metal wire into the double holes on the spile.\n\nWhere can I see the process in Michigan?\n\nDemonstrations hosted at these popular tree-tapping parks, according to Pure Michigan.\n\nWhat Michigan companies harvest and produce maple syrup?\n\nMaple sugaring can be a hobby or a business. In Michigan there are an \"estimated 500 commercial maple syrup producers and approximately 2,000 additional hobby or home-use producers,\" followthepiper.com said.\n\nMaple syrup companies flourishing in the state include:\n\nMichigan Maple Farms, a family-owned company has been producing maple syrup for more than 30 years, and is located in Rudyard, 11866 W. Thompson Road.\n\nFar Hills Maple Syrup, in Chelsea, 4800 M-52, started in 2008 as a hobby, but now has thousands of taps on trees.\n\nDoodle's Sugarbush, in Blanchard, 10566 S. Johnson Road, has been operating since 1998 when the owners purchased an Amish farm and decided to make maple syrup. Now their products are sold in Kroger, Whole Foods Market and Busch's Fresh Food Market.\n\nWhere does the most maple syrup come from?\n\nIn the U.S., Vermont is leading. \"In 2024, there were 17,121,000 taps used in the U.S. and 8,400,000 taps were used in Vermont,\" the University of Vermont said. \"Vermont taps represent 49% of the national total.\"\n\nMichigan ranked 5th in maple syrup production in 2024, with 650,000 trees tapped and 200,000 gallons of sap collected, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.\n\nWhat is artificial maple syrup made with?\n\n\"Breakfast syrup\" or \"pancake syrup\" is \"fake maple syrup,\" according to Indiana Sugars, made from high fructose corn syrup, cane sugar, artificial flavors, and several other ingredients.\n\nIndiana Sugars notes real maple syrup can vary in color while artificial syrup is more uniform, and often is thicker.\n\nSarah Moore @ smoore@lsj.com",

            "content": "Happy Sappy requires a lot of hard work, but for Conrad, its link to family makes the results worth it. \u201cI have a deep connection with the farm,\u201d he says. \u201cI can almost feel my ancestors out there when we go out to gather the sap.\u201d\n\nAndy and his wife, Amanda, are the founders of Sandy Springs Brewing Company, a small brewpub that serves as a gathering place for their charming small town. Every year they\u2019re able, the Conrads tap the family sugar bush for sap they use to brew a beer called Happy Sappy. And while brewing craft beer with a bit of maple syrup is more common than you might think, it\u2019s rare to find a brewery replacing water 100 percent with sap as the Conrads do.\n\nBut here\u2019s a twist: The sap no longer gets boiled down to maple syrup. It\u2019s instead brewed into beer.\n\nAndy Conrad\u2019s family started making maple syrup from their sugar maple grove near Minerva, Ohio, over a century ago. Andy got involved when his father revived the operation in the 1990s, and today, his young daughter is the sixth generation of the family to walk the grove and harvest the sweet sap that flows from its trees each spring.\n\nHow do you get maple flavor in beer? Beers made from tree sap offer foraged flavors to the diligent home brewer.\n\nBrewing with sap doesn\u2019t need to be confined to commercial operations. Sap-brewing is a fantastic way for homebrewers to make unique beers using ingredients that reflect their growing location. Here\u2019s a bit of inspiration to get you started.\n\nThe Essence of Beers Made with Tree Sap\n\nTree sap is mostly water, forming a solution that\u2019s made to carry nutrients all the way up the tree. Yet, sap\u2019s makeup includes far more than water \u2013 and a lot more complexity.\n\nSugar\n\nSap\u2019s most notable ingredient for the homebrewer is sugar; however, we\u2019re not talking amounts that preclude a ton of fermentable potential here. Sap contains about 2 percent sugar by volume, which equates to an original gravity of about 1.008 \u2013 only slightly denser than water \u2013 but still enough to boost the strength of your beer by as much as 1 percent alcohol by volume (ABV). That sugar is mostly in the form of sucrose, which brewing yeast will enzymatically convert into glucose and fructose before it breaches the cell membrane to metabolize.\n\nConrad recommends adding plenty of yeast nutrient to make sure your yeast is fully healthy and oxygenating a bit more than normal.\n\nMinerals\n\nSap carries nutrients to a tree\u2019s extremities, including lots of minerals. Studies show calcium and potassium are the most common minerals in maple sap, with trace amounts of copper, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, and manganese also present. The exact mineral composition of the sap will vary based on location, local climate, soil type, and other factors \u2013 the very essence of terror\u2013 so understanding the flavor contribution of your local sap might take a bit of trial and error.\n\nAcidity\n\nTree sap\u2019s pH will also vary by location and can exhibit a wide range, anywhere from 3.9 to 7.9. At Sandy Springs, Conrad says his mash pH when brewing with maple sap comes out to a \u201cperfect\u201d 5.2.\n\nGet Maple Flavor in Beer\n\nTravel 580 miles west of the Conrads and you can visit another small brewery serving sappy sips in the southern Illinois town of Ava. Marika Josephson and Aaron Kleidon own Scratch Brewing Company, tucked into the woods outside of Shawnee National Forest. They use ingredients foraged from forests and fields to build flavor profiles into their beers centered around a connection to the land and seasons. The pair branches out from using maple alone by using sap from river birch and walnut.\n\nThe flavor contributions of sap can be relatively subtle. Syrup is concentrated 20 to 40 times from the original sap, after all. And so while brewers using straight sap do report a flavor note of each particular species, it\u2019s easily overwhelmed by other flavors in the beer. Josephson and Kleidon complement subtle sappiness with foraged flavors. Scratch often introduces drinkers to ingredients many have never heard of, let alone have thought to imbibe: fig leaves, sweet clover, and elecampane. The beer called \u201c49,\u201d for instance, is brewed with 49 different leaves, roots, barks, fruits, and fungi.\n\nJosephson likes to add other parts of the tree to tell the entire story of that particular species. She includes toasted maple bark in a maple-based brew. Birch is tannic, adding a bit of bitterness, so she plays off that. But walnut is her favorite flavor to work with. \u201cThe walnut beer really did remind me of nocino,\u201d she says, referring to the dark-brown Italian liqueur made from unripe walnuts. \u201cIt smells like freshly sliced green walnuts cooked down into a liquor. It\u2019s not that pungent, but you get that essence.\u201d\n\nNo matter the source, the most notable flavor to come from sap is typically minerality. Because of this, Josephson recommends brewing beer styles with darker malts better able to wrestle with the earthiness of sap.\n\n\u201cBecause the sugar ferments out, you\u2019re left with those minerals, and you can end up with the metallic flavor you sometimes get if you add too much sugar to a homebrewed beer,\u201d she explains. In a pale beer, these flavors have nowhere to hide and can overpower the pale malt flavors. Darker beer styles will instead impart richer flavors, ranging from toasty bread to roasty chocolate and coffee that can work harmoniously with minerality. \u201cIt\u2019s like what you might get from a minerally or granitic wine.\u201d\n\nThe Harvest Window\n\nKnowing when to harvest tree sap requires paying attention to the weather. The first run of the sap will vary based on latitude and regional weather patterns. In the Midwest, the first run generally begins in February.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking for a deep freeze-and-thaw cycle,\u201d says Andy Conrad. \u201cYou want it below 30 degrees at night, but then 40 to 50 degrees during the day.\u201d\n\nAfter you\u2019ve tapped a tree and affixed a bucket for the sap to run into, be diligent about checking on it. Josephson has seen a 5-gallon bucket overflow in just 24 hours. Don\u2019t tap the same tree for more than three years, and never use any sap that has an off odor or has turned brown. Both Josephson and Andy Conrad say to use the sap as quickly as possible, the same day it\u2019s harvested or within no more than 24 hours. Otherwise, it can begin to spontaneously ferment and potentially spoil.\n\nThe exact character of the sap will likely change across the window of the run (which can last into April), and you might find it interesting to brew beers with sap from opposite ends of this window to get a sense for seasonal shifts. There\u2019s plenty to learn about brewing with tree sap. Experiment, have fun, and be open to what the trees \u2013 and the beers \u2013 have to teach you.\n\n\u201cFor us, because we brew with the seasons, it\u2019s something we look forward to, to have this relationship with the trees in different ways in winter than in summer,\u201d says Josephson. \u201cThis is one of those special winter things the Earth is still giving us during the deadest part of the year.\u201d\n\nDavid Nilsen is an award-winning member of the North American Guild of Beer Writers who covers food and travel, with particular emphases on craft beer and chocolate.

            "content": "E3: Mr. Weaver, how is the demand for SAP specialists currently developing in the DACH region? Carl Weaver, Core Tech:\u200e The demand for SAP specialists in the DACH region is set to keep growing, thanks to ongoing digital transformation across many industries. As SAP focuses more on cloud solutions like S/4 Hana and Business Technology Platform (BTP), companies are keen to use these technologies to streamline their operations. In Germany, known for its strong automotive, manufacturing, and engineering sectors, the push towards smart factories and Industry 4.0 is driving up demand for specialised SAP experts. Plus, with more focus on sustainability, SAP\u2019s tools for environmental and supply chain transparency are becoming essential, creating more opportunities for niche SAP roles.\n\nCarl Weaver, Founder and CEO, Core Tech Recruitment\n\nE3: What trends are currently shaping the SAP recruitment landscape? Weaver:\u200e There\u2019s a few big trends shaping SAP recruitment at the moment. Cloud migration and cybersecurity are huge, with companies moving to SAP S/4 Hana and into the cloud, so there\u2019s a growing need for consultants who understand these technical challenges. We\u2019re staying ahead by focusing more on finding consultants with BTP and cybersecurity expertise. Another factor in Germany is the aging population. Companies need to attract young talent, but they also have to keep older workers on beyond the usual retirement age. This way, younger recruits can learn from the experienced pros who\u2019ve been around the block, especially in complex SAP projects. Language is another key challenge. Many end users in-house or onsite don\u2019t speak fluent English, so having C1-level German is often a must. We\u2019re careful to check for language skills to make sure candidates can handle those client interactions smoothly. On top of that, we\u2019re using advanced AI tools to comb through LinkedIn profiles and find the right candidates. We\u2019re not just looking at job titles but also technical skills, certifications, and experience. This keeps our talent pool relevant and aligned with what clients need.\n\n\n\nE3: What strategies do you use to attract top SAP talent? Weaver:\u200e We use a few different approaches to bring in top talent. First, we\u2019ve built strong relationships with candidates by understanding their career goals and matching them with companies where they can grow. We also connect with talent through key SAP events like DSAG and the upcoming SAP Connect Partner Summit. Another strategy is using AI-driven assessments to evaluate a candidate\u2019s expertise in specific SAP modules. This helps make sure they\u2019re not just a good technical fit but also align with the client\u2019s culture. We work closely with our clients to communicate their vision and values, so we can attract talent that fits in well with their teams.\n\nE3: What challenges do your customers face when filling SAP positions? Weaver:\u200e A big challenge for our clients is the shortage of specialised SAP consultants, especially in areas like SAP BTP and advanced analytics. Also, it can be tough to find candidates with the right language skills and regional experience, particularly for roles based in Germany. We tackle these challenges by categorising SAP talent into 22 clear categories, which helps us match consultants more accurately with client needs. We also partner with training institutions to tap into newly certified talent and bring emerging consultants to the forefront. On top of that, we actively source candidates on platforms like Xing to build a strong talent pipeline.\n\nE3: What do you think about diversity in recruiting? Weaver:\u200e Diversity is really important to us, and we\u2019re working hard to create an inclusive recruitment environment. We\u2019ve partnered with women-led SAP communities and we join regional events that promote diversity in tech. We\u2019ve also broadened our outreach, using unbiased AI tools that focus on skills rather than just ticking boxes, so we give everyone a fair shot. We\u2019re piloting an internal mentorship programme too, where experienced SAP consultants mentor early-career professionals from underrepresented backgrounds. This helps us build a stronger, more diverse talent pool in the long run.\n\nE3: How do you plan to expand or develop your services in response to changes in the industry? Weaver:\u200e We\u2019ve got a two-fold strategy: deepening our expertise and embracing new technologies. As AI becomes more integral in the SAP world, we\u2019re planning to offer specialised recruitment services for roles in AI and machine learning within SAP environments.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against other best annual dividend stocks to buy now.\n\nIn 2025, dividends in MSCI Europe are expected to reach a record high. According to Allianz Global Investors, these firms are likely to increase dividend payouts by 4% year-over-year to \u20ac459 billion, up from \u20ac440 billion in 2024. In 2026, MSCI Europe dividends could catapult even higher to \u20ac496 billion. In Germany alone, payouts are projected to rise from \u20ac57 billion in 2024 to \u20ac63 billion in 2025, and possibly hit \u20ac70 billion in 2026. Allianz Global expects the Tech and Healthcare sectors to offer the highest dividend increases in 2025, while the Energy sector could likely create some weakness. The Financials sector will remain the biggest dividend contributor in Europe. Dividend yields are staying ahead of long-term German government bond yields as well, with the MSCI Europe dividend yield expected to be 3.5% this year.\n\nOver the last 40 years, about 39% of MSCI Europe\u2019s total annualized return resulted from dividends. Comparatively, dividend payouts made up 22% of total returns in MSCI North America and just over 41% in MSCI Pacific.\n\nJenny Harrington, CNBC Halftime Report\u2019s go-to expert on dividends, observed that the broader market\u2019s dividends have grown about 5.7% in the last 50-60 years, which means that dividend income is outpacing inflation. She also noted that dividends are a tax-advantaged income stream, which is a huge plus. Harrington also commented that dividend investors are more likely to hold their portfolios rather than selling in a panic when markets go down. They are reluctant to give up their income streams and risk wasting years of effort, which helps keep dividend portfolios steady and resilient, even during market selloffs.\n\nHarrington also told investors that some companies may not have strong growth potential but generate high free cash flow, allowing them to pay dividends. However, those seeking high-growth stocks should carefully balance their portfolios. Harrington advised investors to explore opportunities beyond the broader market, as the index is heavily dominated by its top 10 stocks. She suggested that looking at other companies, including dividend stocks, could offer better value and growth potential. Given this, we will now take a look at some of the best annual dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we manually researched annual reports and company websites to see which stocks pay dividends annually. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of dividend yield as of February 6.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here)\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\n\nDividend Yield as of February 6: 0.87%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 36\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a provider of applications and technology for enterprise resource planning, HR management, and spend management solutions. Founded in 1972, the company is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany. For 2025, it raised the operating profit guidance from \u20ac10.2 billion to \u20ac10.3-\u20ac10.6 billion. SAP CEO Dominik Asam believes that the company remains on track to outperform in 2025 too, given that it already over-delivered in 2024, achieving the targets set for 2025 too. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged nearly 65%.\n\nIn Q4 2024, SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) total cloud backlog increased 40% year-over-year, equalling \u20ac63 billion. The company\u2019s cloud revenue grew 27%, resulting in a double-digit revenue increase for three straight quarters. The company went the extra mile on its commitments to customers this year, providing 130 use cases for generative AI in 2024. Free cash flow in 2024 exceeded the prior guidance of \u20ac3.5 billion to \u20ac4 billion, increasing 19% year-over-year to \u20ac4.1 billion. SAP absorbed \u20ac2.5 billion in restructuring payouts and \u20ac0.2 billion in compliance-related settlements. However, the company also received a few hundred million in receivables due in 2025, and combined with robust profitability, it led to strong free cash flow for the year.\n\nOn May 15, 2024, SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) announced an annual dividend of $2.385 per share dividend. The dividend was paid on May 28, 2024. It is one of the best dividend stocks to monitor.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter data, 36 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), up from 31 funds in the prior quarter. Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 4.7 million shares worth over $1 billion.\n\nOverall, SAP ranks 10th on our list of best annual dividend stocks to buy now. Overall, SAP ranks first on our list of the best annual dividend stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of SAP to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MBG.DE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Published 02-10-25 Submitted by SAP\n\nThe 2025 World Economic Forum\u2019s Annual Meeting, held under the theme \u201cCollaboration for the Intelligent Age,\u201d brought together approximately 3,000 attendees from over 130 countries. Among the participants were more than 50 heads of state and government, alongside hundreds of top governmental leaders, private sector voices, and civil society experts.\n\nAs the world faces pressing challenges \u2014 ranging from geopolitical tensions and climate change to a global skilling crisis \u2013 the meeting in Davos provided a vital platform to foster dialogue and catalyze lasting solutions to shared problems. It also highlighted the importance of corporate responsibility, with social innovation taking center stage as an essential driver of progress.\n\nSocial Innovation Takes Center Stage\n\nSocial innovation is emerging as a foundation for addressing global inequalities and driving systemic change. This year, discussions around social innovation took on greater prominence, with Catalyst Now hosting the first-ever dedicated house for the topic. This space became a hub for thought leaders, practitioners, and policymakers to exchange ideas and spark action.\n\nSocial innovation and collaboration go hand in hand, and the synergy between global initiatives and localized action is pivotal in creating meaningful impact. As a key partner, SAP supports Catalyst Now and its Africa Forward initiative, which empowers social enterprises through digital skills training, pro-bono consulting, and policy advocacy. With more than 1,000 members across 28 African countries, Africa Forward continues to foster job creation, sustainable funding, and advocacy efforts.\n\nThe Annual Meeting also served as a bridge between African social entrepreneurs and decision-makers, including South Africa\u2019s Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation Professor Blade Nzimande, opening pathways for new partnerships and support.\n\nThe panel featured two 2025 Schwab Foundation Awardees: Christina Mawuse Gyisun, co-founder of Sommalife, who shared her work empowering women shea nut farmers in West Africa, and Muzalema Mwanza, founder of Safe Motherhood Alliance, who highlighted her mission to ensure safe childbirth for millions of women in sub-Saharan Africa. This dialogue underscored the critical role of social entrepreneurship and what role Africa Froward can play in driving sustainable development across the continent. This is essential, as over 60 percent of Africa\u2019s population is under 25 years old and projected to account for 42 percent of the global youth demographic by 2030.\n\nWhile tech investment remains concentrated in Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa, the continent\u2019s potential in emerging green and digital economies is immense.\n\nGlobal Partnerships to Scale Innovation\n\nAddressing challenges at scale requires collaboration across sectors and geographies. The Global Alliance for Social Entrepreneurship, the largest coalition of its kind, exemplifies this collective effort. Hosted by the Schwab Foundation in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, the alliance brings together more than 110 organizations, including corporations, investors, philanthropists, and governments, to amplify the impact of social innovation.\n\nDuring the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024, the Global Alliance launched the Rise Ahead Pledge. Twenty-five companies have signed the pledge since and committed themselves to increasing investments in social innovation. In 2025, they are reporting on their spending for the first time mobilized $277 million to drive meaningful change. These resources were channeled into key areas:\n\n$95 million to support social enterprises through social procurement\n\nto support social enterprises through social procurement $86 million in non-financial resources like pro-bono services and technology access\n\nin non-financial resources like pro-bono services and technology access $47 million to provide direct financial support to social innovators\n\nto provide direct financial support to social innovators $29 million for internal innovation, focusing on developing impact-driven products\n\nfor internal innovation, focusing on developing impact-driven products $21 million to strengthen the social innovation ecosystem\n\nWe are an active partner in these efforts, demonstrating a commitment to creating sustainable pathways for social enterprises to thrive.\n\nSupporting Research to Shape the Future\n\nResearch and data are critical to driving informed decisions and shaping the social innovation agenda. Several pivotal publications were launched during the meeting to provide actionable insights:\n\nUnlocking the Social Economy: Towards Equity in the Green and Digital Transitions: This report highlights the pivotal role of the social economy, including social enterprises and cooperatives, in advancing equity during transitions. Supporting 200 million jobs and generating over $2 trillion in global turnover, the social economy drives inclusive innovation by enhancing affordability, accessibility, job creation, and empowerment for marginalized communities.\n\nThis report highlights the pivotal role of the social economy, including social enterprises and cooperatives, in advancing equity during transitions. Supporting 200 million jobs and generating over $2 trillion in global turnover, the social economy drives inclusive innovation by enhancing affordability, accessibility, job creation, and empowerment for marginalized communities. State of Social Procurement 2025: This report leverages the expertise of numerous organizations to uncover new insights, present fresh data, and highlight diverse country profiles on social procurement.\n\nThis report leverages the expertise of numerous organizations to uncover new insights, present fresh data, and highlight diverse country profiles on social procurement. Beyond Compliance: Embedding Impact through Innovative Finance: The report reveals how this emerging practice is already driving $185 billion by tying financial incentives to measurable social outcomes. It provides businesses with a powerful avenue to tackle societal challenges while staying competitive.\n\nA New Model for Procurement\n\nProcurement is increasingly recognized as a lever for social equity and sustainability. To accelerate this shift, SAP Executive Board Member Thomas Saueressig and Deloitte Global Chair Anna Marks announced the launch of the Social Procurement Innovation Accelerator, a joint initiative designed to reshape procurement practices and amplify social impact.\n\nThis program combines cutting-edge supply chain technology with deep expertise in sustainability and transformation to provide organizations with a practical road map for impactful procurement strategies. It focuses on inclusive sourcing, ethical labor practices, and robust social impact measurement, enabling businesses to align procurement with broader equity and sustainability goals.\n\nBy transforming procurement into a driver of systemic change, organizations can deliver lasting value for people, communities, and the planet.\n\nEmpowering Tomorrow\u2019s Changemakers\n\nIt is essential to maintain this momentum now and into the future by empowering young social innovators, fostering connections, and encouraging intergenerational understanding. This is particularly important because major decisions made at conferences often concern youth, yet they rarely have a seat at the decision-making table.\n\nTo address this, we supported the youth delegations of We Are Family Foundation, ChangemakerXchange, and the WEF Global Shapers, supporting them to participate in hundreds of meaningful interactions such as panel discussions, 1:1 meetings or roundtables.\n\nGina Vargiu-Breuer, chief people officer, labor director, and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, hosted a roundtable on empowering young changemakers. The session brought together corporate leaders, young social entrepreneurs, and partners like UNICEF Generation Unlimited and Junior Achievement to engage directly with youth. It focused on the unique needs of the next generation, identifying key areas for collaboration and showcasing the transformative power of youth-led solutions to tackle global challenges.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe 2025 World Economic Forum\u2019s Annual Meeting demonstrated the transformative potential of collaboration in accelerating social innovation. By bringing together diverse voices and perspectives, it reinforced the importance of partnerships in addressing the world\u2019s most pressing challenges.\n\nFor the SAP Corporate Social Responsibility team, it also served as a valuable opportunity to strengthen relationships within its ecosystem, fostering new collaborations that will help drive long-term impact. As global challenges persist, platforms like Davos provide the momentum needed to create a more equitable, sustainable future for all.\n\nAlexandra van der Ploeg is head of Corporate Social Responsibility at SAP.",

            "content": "By SNP Group\n\nThis press release was published in English using an automatic translation system\n\n\n\nBuenos Aires, February 10, 2025 \u2013 YPF obtained key business benefits thanks to the migration of its SAP management system from on-premise servers to the AWS cloud, a project carried out in collaboration with SNP Group.\n\nArgentina's leading energy company, which generates a wide range of products including oil, natural gas, electricity, fuels, petrochemical inputs, lubricants and agricultural products, and which has more than 1,600 service stations that allow it to supply all points in the country, had the objective of migrating 70% of its application platform to the cloud.\n\nThe objectives included the ability to make operating costs transparent and, at the same time, eliminate the obstacles that the company's own infrastructure posed to growth. The project included the migration of the SAP system, which had 33 instances, 170 servers and more than 300 information terminals in the organization. Despite the complex technological panorama, an ambitious horizon was decided: to be productive in one year, with no impact on the business and with minimal downtime.\n\n\u201cUsing SNP Group\u2019s CrystalBridge\u2122 tool in this regard was crucial: it was key not only to migrate without interrupting the business, but also to take care of all the integrations of our application map, which has around 500 applications in addition to the SAP instances,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Fraga, SAP Solutions Manager at YPF. \u201cAmong the benefits we achieved are greater speed and better performance\u201d in various administrative tasks, the energy company highlights.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the cloud allows us to scale based on demand,\u201d adds Anal\u00eda Ben\u00edtez, Infrastructure and Communications Manager at YPF. \u201cFor example, the time needed to close the financial year-end, which requires a lot of processing, was reduced by 50%, payroll settlement is done between 30% and 40% faster, and our lives were simplified in the two annual contingency functional tests required by the Sarbanex-Oxley (SOX) framework, which affects our company,\u201d she explains.\n\nThe success of the project can be summed up in an anecdote. \u201cOn Monday, when the first wave of migration went into production, we received a call asking why we had not finally moved forward with the migration: everything went so smoothly that the user had not realized that he was already working in the cloud,\u201d says Fraga.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to support companies in their migration processes to the cloud, not only to replace old systems, but fundamentally, as was the case with YPF, to achieve new competitive advantages,\u201d explains Guillermo Borio, country manager for Argentina and Uruguay at SNP Group. \u201cWe have the tools to speed up the process and make it practically transparent for users,\u201d he concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout SNP\n\nSNP (stock ticker: SHF.DE) is the global technology platform leader and trusted partner for enterprises seeking unprecedented data transformation capabilities and business agility. SNP\u2019s Kyano platform integrates all the necessary capabilities and partner offerings to deliver a comprehensive software-based data migration and management experience. Combined with the BLUEFIELD approach, Kyano sets a comprehensive industry standard for re-engineering and modernizing SAP-centric IT environments faster and more securely while leveraging data-driven innovations.\n\nThe company serves more than 3,000 customers of all sizes and industries in 80 countries, including 20 in the DAX 40 and more than 100 in the Fortune 500. SNP Group has more than 1,500 employees spread across more than 35 locations in 20 countries.

            "content": "Unlike generic models, custom AI refers to AI solutions tailored to specific business needs. It enhances decision-making and automation and is designed to align with an organization\u2019s unique data and processes. In an interview with Fortune India, Sindhu Gangadharan, MD, SAP Labs India, and Head of Customer Innovation Services, SAP, explains the role of data in Custom AI\u2019s success. From tackling supply chain bottlenecks to enabling personalized customer experiences, Custom AI leverages proprietary data and tailored algorithms to turn complexities into competitive advantages.\n\nEdited Excerpts:\n\nQ: What are the primary use cases for Custom AI and how does it differ from off-the-shelf AI solutions?\n\nSG: The power of Custom AI lies in its ability to deeply align with a business\u2019s unique DNA. Unlike off-the-shelf AI solutions, which are pre-designed for general applications, Custom AI goes beyond standardization to meet the specific goals and objectives of the business. Imagine an organization grappling with highly nuanced supply chain bottlenecks or seeking to create deeply personalized customer experiences\u2014 these are the challenges that generic AI cannot fully address. Custom AI, built on proprietary data and tailored algorithms, transforms these complexities into competitive advantages. Its use cases span industries, from enabling predictive maintenance in manufacturing plants to revolutionizing retail operations with hyper-personalized recommendations. It\u2019s not just about solving problems\u2014 it\u2019s about reimagining what\u2019s possible.\n\nWe collaborate with leading customers globally to address their unique business challenges through Custom AI solutions. In the manufacturing sector, our AI-driven innovations provide competitive advantages by streamlining procurement processes and enabling Generative AI-assisted maintenance for industrial assets. In the finance sector, we address critical use cases such as automated dispute resolution, asset retirement obligation management, intelligent invoice processing, and AI-powered billing cycle automation. In the automotive industry, we leverage Generative AI to transform after-sales experiences, fostering innovation and operational excellence. Furthermore, in the healthcare sector, we are partnering with customers to revolutionize vaccine manufacturing through cutting-edge AI tools.\n\nQ: What factors should businesses consider before investing in a custom AI solution?\n\nSG: To ensure a successful investment in Custom AI and maximize its benefits, organizations should consider the following critical factors:\n\n\u2022 Clearly Defined Objectives: Organizations must begin by identifying the specific business challenges that require a custom AI solution. It's crucial to ensure that the AI solution provides a competitive advantage and supports long-term growth. Custom AI goals should align with broader business strategies, and success criteria should be clearly established and measurable to track the impact over time.\n\n\u2022 Data Readiness: The success of a custom AI solution is heavily dependent on high-quality, relevant data. Organizations must assess the availability of the data required for training the model, including its quality and completeness. It\u2019s also important to account for additional efforts such as data cleaning, annotation, and integration with existing systems to ensure smooth implementation.\n\nBy focusing on these factors, businesses can effectively leverage Custom AI to create a competitive edge and unlock innovative solutions specific to their needs.\n\nQ: How does Custom AI enhance scalability and competitiveness for businesses?\n\nSG: In today\u2019s fast-evolving markets, scalability is not just about size\u2014it\u2019s about agility, precision, and speed. Custom AI is uniquely positioned to deliver this. While out-of-the-box AI solutions are capable of handling every-day, standardized tasks efficiently, Custom AI drives deeper innovation and addresses the unique, high-value challenges businesses face. Custom AI contributes to a comprehensive AI strategy that provides both quick value and long-term transformation.\n\nCustomer AI helps businesses gain a competitive edge by\n\n\u2022 Addressing unique business challenges arise that cannot be fully addressed with out-of-the-box solutions (e.g., specialized supply chain bottlenecks or advanced predictive analytics).\n\n\u2022 Offering personalization at scale, such as creating hyper-personalized experiences for customers in industries like automotive or healthcare.\n\n\u2022 Enabling complex integrations such as combining data from multiple systems to drive insights and outcomes.\n\nQ: How can organizations successfully implement Custom AI?\n\nSG: Implementing Custom AI presents valuable opportunities to enhance business processes, with a few considerations to ensure success:\n\n\u2022 Data Integration and Quality: Integrating SAP and non-SAP data offers the potential for deeper insights. Ensuring the data is high-quality, accurate, and consistent across systems maximizes the AI\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n\u2022 Skilled Workforce and Initial Investment: Investing in skilled talent sets the foundation for long-term innovation. While the initial investment is necessary, it opens the door for AI-driven transformations across the business.\n\n\u2022 Scalability and Long-Term Value: Custom AI is designed to grow with the business. Focus on scalability to ensure the AI solution continues to deliver value as your organization evolves and its needs expand.\n\n\u2022 Data Governance and Compliance: Proper data governance is key, especially when dealing with confidential and sensitive business data. Compliance with relevant regulations is vital to ensure data is handled responsibly and ethically.\n\n\u2022 Future-Proofing: Custom AI solutions should be flexible to adapt to emerging technologies, helping organizations stay ahead of industry trends and continue to innovate.\n\nBy addressing these key areas, businesses can implement Custom AI in a way that maximizes value while ensuring ethical, compliant, and sustainable growth.\n\nQ: What role does data play in the success of Custom AI, and how can companies ensure its quality and security?\n\nSG: Data is the backbone of Custom AI. The success of AI models is deeply tied to the quality, quantity, and relevance of the data used to train them. Without accurate and clean data, even the most sophisticated AI models will fail to provide valuable insights.\n\nTo ensure data quality, businesses should focus on establishing processes that clean, standardize, and validate their data. This involves removing errors, ensuring consistency, and integrating data from various systems to create a unified, reliable data source.",

The data does tell us to set a stop loss 269.27 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 270.05 is the first level of support below 279.64, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 270.05 is being tested, a buy signal would exist. NONE . Details NONE .\n\nThere are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.\n\nSwing Trading Plans for SAP\n\nBuy SAP slightly over 283.7, target n/a, Stop Loss @ 282.88 Details\n\nIf 283.7 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy SAP just slightly over 283.7, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 282.88 in case the stock turns against the trade. 283.7 is the first level of resistance above 279.64, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 283.7, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan. Short SAP slightly near 283.7, target 277.33, Stop Loss @ 284.52. Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of SAP if it tests 283.7 with a downside target of 277.33. We should have a stop loss in place at 284.52 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 283.7, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.\n\nDay Trading Plans for SAP\n\nBuy SAP slightly over 280.06, target 283.7, Stop Loss @ 279.41 Details\n\nIf 280.06 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy SAP just slightly over 280.06, with an upside target of 283.7. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 279.41 in case the stock turns against the trade. 280.06 is the first level of resistance above 279.64, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal.

            "content": "Comment (updated) Tesla reportedly decided not to upgrade its SAP's enterprise software a decade ago, opting to build its own system instead. Now, with Elon Musk heading up the Trump-blessed US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), his cost-cutting mindset could have major implications for federal IT spending - and the big tech vendors cashing in on government contracts.\n\nIf he thought SAP was too bloated and overpriced, what does that mean for big-spending government departments?\n\nFirst in the line of fire has been USAID, which Musk said he had put through a \u201cwood chipper\u201d last Sunday.\n\nWhile the whole federal agency dedicated to distributing billions of dollars in aid around the world may not totally disappear, it may well be massively cut and merge with the State Department, though reports conflict on the details.\n\nLegal challenges have added further uncertainty. On Friday, a federal judge put at least part of those plans on hold, temporarily pausing the Trump administration from placing thousands of USAID workers on administrative leave.\n\nNonetheless, this raises questions about USAID's tech contracts, how they will be dealt with, and what the fallout will be during any dismantlement and after. Its major partner is NTT Data, the Japanese tech services giant, which runs a contract worth up to $469.7 million for custom computer programming services.\n\nTech consultancy Accenture and CRM software vendor Salesforce are among the tech suppliers cashing in on USAID's IT budget, too.\n\nNTT Data declined to comment on how changes at USAID may affect its work with them, wood chipper or no wood chipper.\n\nRegardless of political stance, USAID is a relatively small federal department. If DOGE really wants to get a hold of US government tech spending, it needs to think bigger \u2013 which means, apart from the potentially daunting technical aspect of cutting down services, the team will run into certain powerful forces that presumably would rather keep millions of dollars in IT deals rolling in.\n\nAccording to President Trump, the administration has the final say on whether to proceed with cuts recommended by DOGE, though so far the commander-in-chief has backed Musk, whose companies continue to hold contracts and other dealings and interactions with the very government the SpaceX billionaire is now rifling through.\n\nThe largest federal government department is Health and Human Services, with a total budget of $1.7 trillion proposed for 2025 - most of it allocated to Medicare and Medicaid, which DOGE has been poking around this week already.\n\nMeanwhile, General Dynamics has a $879.1 million deal for custom computer programming services, and Accenture has an up to $805 million contract for systems design services.\n\nAnother famously big spender in the federal government is the Department of Defense, with a total budget of $850 billion for fiscal year 2025 \u2013 another part of Uncle Sam DOGE has started investigating along with the Dept of Education.\n\nThe Pentagon relies heavily on Oracle for its ERP and finance systems, and has a string of contracts with Big Red, including this one for $338 million.\n\nOracle resellers and systems integration partners also feature prominently on the DoD\u2019s tech spending list, including Mythics LLC, with a $307.5 million deal, and DLT Solutions (part of TD Synnex) with deals worth $279.3 million, $238 million and $132 million.\n\nNonetheless, it remains to be seen how much of DOGE\u2019s plan is to create a barrage of noise and attacks on Trump and Musk\u2019s political and commercial opponents, and how much is really planned to reel in government spending. After all, the systems and relationships are very entrenched and creating alternatives may be more challenging than a migration at a relatively small automaker. Yes, despite Tesla\u2019s market valuation, it doesn\u2019t rank in the top 10 automotive manufacturers in terms of production.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the IT suppliers have friends in high places. Oracle co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison, a proud Republican, stood alongside Trump during the launch of the proposed $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure.\n\nAnother Oracle project at the Department of Veterans Affairs just rebooted a $330 million project, despite concerns over the rollout cost and safety of its Cerner patient record system under the original $9.99 billion deal. We cannot imagine Oracle standing by and letting these contracts be whittled down without some say in it.\n\nTrump's pick for Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said during a Senate nomination hearing that the program had gone on for \u201ctoo many years and cost too many billions of dollars without finding a solution.\" He said it would be \"one of the very first priorities, if confirmed, is to get in and figure out why and put this on a bigger timeframe to get this medical health records issue solved.\"\n\nGoing after federal government tech spending might be more difficult than it seems, therefore, but there is also more to Tesla\u2019s ERP system.\n\nDespite claims that a team of 250 Tesla staffers built a new ERP system in four months, other reports suggest it built some manufacturing software that was bolted on the side of a Microsoft Dynamics finance system.\n\nLike many tech legends, the truth is far less exciting than the myth. The same may be true of DOGE\u2019s efforts to take on federal agency\u2019s big tech spending. \u00ae\n\nSpeaking of DOGE... The team was this week blocked from accessing the US Dept of Labor's data in a win for unions. A 19-year-old member of DOGE was reportedly fired from an internship after he was accused of sharing information with a competitor. And it's not just inexperienced engineers in the squad; it also has lawyers with elite establishment credentials. There are various reports of the crew, with the White House's blessing, accessing highly sensitive systems, some involving personal data and classified materials, at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the General Services Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Dept of Education, at least. This has included, it's said, analyzing sensitive Dept of Education data with AI tools in Microsoft's Azure cloud. All with the stated intention of rooting out inefficiencies and things to cut, aka stuff Musk doesn't find appropriate.\n\nUpdated to add on February 11\n\nAn earlier version of this story said Peraton was one of the big-ticket tech suppliers that would come under DOGE scrutiny. We have since learned its contract ended in 2021 and we are happy to make this clear.",

            "content": "Using Apple Vision Pro, a new SAP Sports One prototype offers a unique 3D view on football matches from any player\u2019s perspective to help gain deeper insights into game situations and boost player development.\n\nInnovation from the Bottom-Up\n\nIt started with a hackathon for SAP engineers with the goal to create a prototype combining the power of immersive technology and SAP solutions. The SAP Sports One team won with a prototype unlocking the potential of spatial computing in football match preparation.\n\nSAP Sports One is a comprehensive solution that helps sports organizations optimize performance on and off the field and is trusted by football clubs like TSG Hoffenheim and FC Bayern as well as the German Football Association.\n\nTaking SAP Sports One to the Third Dimension\n\nCopyright: Olivia Lehmann\n\nImagine being able to dive into a match, not just as a spectator, but through the eyes of a player on the field. The prototype SAP Sports One Immersive allows exactly that.\n\nUsing Apple Vision Pro, analysts and players can replay and analyze match scenes in 3D from any player\u2019s perspective. A user can switch between the perspectives of various players to better understand a specific situation during a match. This immersive experience enables a new kind of match analysis and can make it easier to identify situations where another behavior of a player would have potentially been better.\n\nThrough an app on Apple Vision Pro, this prototype aims to empower teams to optimize their performance\u2014whether it\u2019s preparing for the next big match or analyzing past performances. Timo Gross, head of Match Analysis for football club TSG Hoffenheim, believes there\u2019s a huge potential in the simulation of game scenarios in immersive 3D. \u201cThis enhances player training and tactical understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I believe that this has the potential to pave the way for a new approach in player development, especially in the youth space.\u201d\n\nProfessional Feedback: TSG Hoffenheim Thinks Immersive\n\n\u201cTSG Hoffenheim is an innovative club, always looking for new technologies to improve match preparation and talent development,\u201d Gross said. \u201cImmersive match analysis could be a next big step.\u201d\n\nUsing immersive technology, users can feel as if they are standing on the field. They can observe players, move around, and gain a comprehensive perspective of a game situation. \u201cThis immersive prototype shows a match analyst the exact perspective of a player in a specific moment,\u201d Gross explained. \u201cFor the player, it makes the transition from viewing a theoretical situation on a tactic board to the real-life moment on the pitch much easier.\u201d\n\nFor Gross, another powerful feature of the prototype is the 3D visualization of classical 2D tactics scenes. Using the SAP Challenger Insights mobile app, coaches and players can sketch game situations on a tablet. These 2D sketches can be transferred into the 3D immersive view.\n\nFrom Hackathon onto the Stage\n\nWinning the SAP hackathon on spatial experience was just the first step. On February 5, 2025, the prototype was presented at the SPOBIS Conference in Hamburg, Germany, Europe\u2019s largest sports business event. In a live, on-stage presentation, Gross was joined by experts including Dr. Dietmar Blicker, deputy managing director at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Sports and Sports Science; Michael Oenning, UEFA-Pro licensed coach; and Fadi Naoum, senior vice president SAP Sports and Entertainment; to discuss the potential of immersive technologies in sports.\n\nOn stage at SPOBIS, from left to right: Naoum, Oenning, Blicker, Gross, moderator Achim Ittner (SAP). Copyright: Olivia Lehmann\n\nOenning, who was head coach for German national division clubs Hamburger SV and 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg, is passionate about developing and promoting talents. \u201cTraining young people using technologies they encounter in their daily lives is something I would definitely use in my work as a coach,\u201d he said. \u201cOffering different perspectives of a game situation is an experience young players can benefit from tremendously.\u201d\n\nBlicker agreed that \u201c3D experiences like these enhance the cognitive perception of a player.\u201d Technology savvy by the nature of his role, he isn\u2019t only involved in sports from an academic perspective, but also coaches the U23 team of the German second division team Karlsruher SC. \u201cAs a coach, I often sketch a tactical situation. But such a 2D drawing doesn\u2019t easily translate to a real situation. The body height of a close opponent might cause a risk to an intended pass, or the distances on the field don\u2019t match up in the end. Practicing situations in an immersive setting can help players to internalize certain behaviors,\u201d he said.\n\nSAP\u2019s Naoum noted the importance of applying new technologies. \u201cThis prototype is a result of our continuous collaboration with partners like TSG Hoffenheim where we constantly test innovative technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cFor SAP, sports serve as a front-runner to demonstrate new technologies that can potentially be applied in other industries as well.\u201d",

            "content": "Maple syrup is one of those foods that conjures up particular imagery \u2013 the trees, the color red, the forests, the sap dripping into metal buckets. And there is the conviviality of the sugar house pouring out into the snowy environment. The Sugar Rush: A Memoir of Wild Dream, Budding Bromance, and Making Maple Syrup by Peter Gregg tells the crazy adventures of two men who decide at a certain age to create their own sweet amber magic.\n\nEvan Kleiman: What exactly is the process of sugaring?\n\nPeter Gregg: In the transition time between winter and spring, trees send sap up their trunks loaded with sugar, and our job is to collect all that sap and evaporate the water that's in the sap and condense it down into syrup. It's this magical time of year, and it's about a six week window in between, winter and spring, from late February through March into early April. It's something that we've been doing for 300 years or so. We learned it through the indigenous peoples way back, and we have been doing it ever since in the northeast and in New England. The Upper Midwest is another big region. It's a special thing that takes place every year and we just love doing it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much sap do you get from a single tap?\n\nThe ratio, the conversion math, is about 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of syrup but that can vary. The trees have a mind of their own. Some days you get a lot of sugar in the sap, and some days not as much. But on average, over a season, it's about a 40 to 1 ratio. So we have to collect a lot of sap. On our farm, [we get] probably 50,000 gallons of sap over the course of the season, enough to fill a couple Olympic sized swimming pools.\n\nAnd you have more than one tap on each tree.\n\nWell, yes, that varies. It depends on the size of the tree. And there's some unwritten rules about that. A lot of sugar makers have just one tap per tree, and that's it. No more than that. Others, if the tree is big enough, let's say a 30 or 40-inch encumbrance of a tree, sometimes they'll put two in. On our farm, we have a few trees there. It's that size. I actually have one that's gotta be 150 to 200 years old. It is humongous. I've put three taps in that tree before and the tree is fine.\n\nDoes collecting the sap like this hurt the trees at all?\n\nThat's a great question. I get asked that one a lot, and I know you're asking it from a good place, you want to make sure that we're not doing anything that harms the tree. And we're not. The sugar maple is this remarkable species that has the ability to compartmentalize any wound and separate itself off from the rest of the tree. It just grows over the tap hole that we make so the tap holes that we're drilling into the trees to begin with are very small, like a pencil in diameter and about an inch and a half, two inches into the tree. By the time the next season rolls, we only put the taps in for those six weeks when we're making this collecting sap. But then after the season, and during the growing period, through the summer, the tree closes those holes up. It's this remarkable thing. It heals itself.\n\nSo in the mind's eye of many people, we imagine a tap on a tree with a galvanized metal bucket hanging from the tap with this ping. Then we imagine people collecting these buckets and pouring the sap from the bucket into a larger tank. I imagine that's not the way it's done anymore. Can you describe what goes on?\n\nYeah, that's certainly the romantic version. A lot of people start off that way. There's a lot of backyard sugar-makers that are still using buckets, not the galvanized ones as much. Those are really old school and a little bit out of fashion but they look great. If you've seen pictures of them, they just look great in the woods. They're cool to look at, but people don't use them as much anymore.\n\nNow, they switch to plastic if you're going to collect in buckets, which is using gravity to get the sap out of the tree. But most sugar makers, including myself, use a pipeline, a plastic tubing system that runs all through the woods, connected from tree to tree, and then we hook it up to a vacuum pump and basically suck the sap down the hill. Maybe not quite as romantic but it's what we do now in modern sugar-making.\n\nDid you grow up sugaring?\n\nI didn't. That's the funny part about all this, and it's the theme of the book. I grew up in the suburbs of Minneapolis. I have no business doing any of this stuff. I'm not mechanically inclined, really at all. I had to change a flat tire once, that's about the extent of my mechanical knowledge up till now. I've just been learning all this on the fly from my sugar-maker neighbors. That's the great thing about this industry, we all help each other out.\n\nBecause I come from Minnesota, a \"flatlander,\" they call people like me, I'm the one that needs the most amount of help by a lot. But I'm learning. That's the cool thing about it, I am learning. I've learned a ton about plumbing. I've learned a ton about how equipment works. I've learned how to fix things, which is really a nice skill to have. You can just figure things out and how to repair them when they break. That's a big part of farming and a big part of what we do, just trying to figure this all out and measure up with all the big sugar makers in Vermont.\n\nThis book of yours, The Sugar Rush, is like a buddy movie. That's what it reminded me of. Tell me a little bit about your partner in sugaring mayhem and what each of you bring to the process.\n\nHis name is Bert, and he's my best friend. We've been making syrup together for a while. He's a lot like me but with a little more skills. He's a lot handier. He has a ton of tools but we're both office worker types trying to make it in this industry. Bert helps me out a lot.\n\nThe story of The Sugar Rush is me trying to hit this benchmark that all the big Vermont maple producers hit year after year. To hit that benchmark, we have to make basically twice as much syrup as we ever had before, so I have to convince Bert to help me out.\n\nIt's going to be this very labor-intensive, strenuous season. But he rallies to the cause and it turns out, it's a buddy movie, for sure. I love that analogy, and that's how I wrote the book. It's a lot of humor, there's a lot of conversations, and we analyze our lives in the stage of our lives right now as we're approaching late middle age and how sugaring factors into the satisfaction of our lives and what we hope for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat strikes me after reading The Sugar Rush is how DIY it all is. You have to love tinkering with tanks, lines, evaporators, and chainsaws, all in the forest, often slipping in snow or ice. What's the emotional payoff?\n\nOne of the great things about making maple syrup is that you're making something that delights people. That is probably one of the most satisfying things about making syrup. It's a sweetener. We're making something that brings joy to people's lives.",

            "content": "In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Saputo Inc. ( ), since the last five years saw the share price fall 43%. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 11% in the last three months.\n\nAfter losing 3.2% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the five years over which the share price declined, Saputo's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 22% each year. The share price decline of 10% per year isn't as bad as the EPS decline. The relatively muted share price reaction might be because the market expects the business to turn around.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Saputo's .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Saputo the TSR over the last 5 years was -36%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market gained around 22% in the last year, Saputo shareholders lost 13% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 6% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Saputo better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

            "content": "Lucknow: Signs of uncertainty loomed large over revision of cane State Advisory Price (SAP) in the ongoing crushing season, a day after the state cabinet deferred its decision on the issue.The issue, sources said, came up before the cabinet on Wednesday only to be put off for being taken up \"in future\" after further discussion.Sources said that the state govt sought to tread cautiously on SAP revision which had the potential economic bearing on the farmers as well as the sugar industry. Cane price happens to be at the core of political positioning by various parties, especially in the west UP region.Sources said that the state govt was not in favour of increasing the SAP in an apparent bid to ward off potential chances of compensation arrears getting piled up in the ongoing season. The sugar millers have also approached the state govt citing a drop in sugar recovery eventually pushing the cost of production further up.The UP Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA) has also stressed that the prices of sugar did not increase in the ongoing fiscal despite the increase in SAP in 2024.The development, interestingly, comes amid indications that the Centre may revise the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for the cane for 2025-26.Sources said that this year the FRP was expected to rise by another Rs 15 to Rs 355 per quintal. Last year, the Centre increased the FRP by 8% to Rs 340 per quintal.A senior BJP leader told TOI that a host of BJP MLAs from west UP, too, have been mounting pressure on the state govt to revise the SAP.BJP ally Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) too has been pitching for an increased compensation for the farmers. RLD spokesperson Rohit Agarwal said that the party has been consistent with its demand for a compensation mounting to Rs 400 per quintal.Sources said that the state govt is expected to call a high-level meeting soon to decide on the issue, which impacts the interests of around 45 lakh cane growers in UP .Significantly, it was only in Jan 2024 \u2014 just before the high-stakes Lok Sabha elections\u2014when the state govt raised the SAP by Rs 20 per quintal. As a result, SAP for early maturing varieties increased from Rs 350 to Rs 370 per quintal. For common varieties, it increased from Rs 340 to Rs 360, while for late maturing varieties, SAP rose from Rs 335 to Rs 355 per quintal.In 2023 the state govt kept the SAP unchanged, allowing the industries to cover up their pending arrears due towards the cane farmers.UP happens to be the largest producer of sugarcane in India, accounting for around 40% of the total production. In fact, the state has the largest area under cane cultivation, covering almost 50% of the country's cane area.",

However, success relies heavily on careful planning, strong partnerships, and future-ready skills.\n\nTo help customers remain agile, respond quickly to innovations, and continuously evolve their operations, SAP and its partners are committed to maintaining certified skills. New requirements, including annual certification renewals, ensure that experts stay current. By July of this year, all partner resources in key roles\u2014such as enterprise architects, developers, business transformation management consultants, and project managers involved in RISE with SAP projects\u2014must hold a valid SAP Certification. Furthermore, by the end of 2025, 50% of relevant partner practitioners are expected to possess at least one valid certification across the SAP solution portfolio.\n\nSince its launch in 2021, SAP partners have been integral to RISE with SAP transformation projects, leveraging their expertise to tailor solutions to customer needs. From designing cloud transition road maps to implementing process automation and optimizing costs, partners can enable businesses to maximize the value of SAP solutions. They help ensure organizations adopt intelligent enterprise practices efficiently while addressing unique challenges and goals.\n\n\u201cThis mutual commitment underscores SAP and its partners\u2019 dedication to delivering exceptional value, staying ahead of evolving industry standards, and driving customer success in an ever-evolving landscape,\u201d says Karl Fahrbach, chief partner officer at SAP. \u201cWorking with certified innovators skilled in the latest SAP technologies enables customers to achieve significant benefits\u2014from reducing errors and risks to fostering innovation and accelerating deployment times.\u201d\n\nBy collaborating with certified partner experts, customers can expect to adapt more readily to change and maintain competitiveness in a dynamic market. SAP and its partners\u2019 commitment to innovative SAP skills highlights the importance of continuous learning and upskilling, working to ensure exceptional value delivery. With the latest competencies in high-demand SAP solutions, SAP\u2019s ecosystem of partners strives to achieve our shared goal: delivering innovation excellence to customers.\n\n*McKinsey, The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value, 2024\n\nAndre Bechtold is SVP and head of Solution & Innovation Experience at SAP.",

            "content": "Data management with SAP NetWeaver\n\nThe first holistic attempt to develop an orchestrated platform for an SAP ERP system was made by former SAP Chief Technology Officer Shai Agassi with NetWeaver and the Exchange Infrastructure component. The experiment was partially successful because CSV files were still being used to exchange data in some areas.\n\nHowever, SAP NetWeaver was a promising approach to creating a stable and comprehensive middleware for current and future ERP systems. The SAP Business Technology Platform is the successor to SAP NetWeaver. Of course, BTP is now much more comprehensive and powerful. the SAP community can find out what SAP BTP for ECC 6.0 and S/4 can do at the second Steampunk and BTP Summit on March 5 and 6 in Heidelberg, Germany. Register now for this two-day knowledge event and expand your own IT platform knowledge!\n\nSAP Data Hub and Datasphere\n\nSAP recognized early on that even in a 3-tier client/server model (whether on-prem or in the cloud), there are always heterogeneous data silos. The existence of disparate data sources and the need for orchestration drove the development of SAP Data Hub. The concept was good, but the performance was subterranean!\n\nThe principle of Data Hub can be explained in very simple terms: rather than importing all the data from a source, a requesting party creates a precise wish list. This wish list is transmitted to the data source (server), which then begins to process the data and prepare it for delivery. Only the relevant and requested data is then sent through the service. What seems very efficient at first glance was a disaster in real ERP life. Many servers (data sources) collapsed under the load of many requests and the necessary data preparation.\n\nSAP Datasphere is a direct successor to Data Hub and tries to better orchestrate the workload between the data source and the data sink. However, the use of Datasphere in the SAP community seems to be low at the moment, so there are no reliable statements about its success or failure.\n\nSAP BTP can do almost anything\n\nSAP BTP is the opposite of specialized data platforms like Boomi, Data Hub, or Datasphere. There is hardly any ERP middleware topic that the Business Technology Platform does not master. You can get an overview of its capabilities at the Steampunk and BTP Summit on March 5 and 6 in Heidelberg, Germany.Organized by E3 Magazine, the two-day event will provide SAP customers with the platform knowledge they need: register now!\n\nBTP is the right basis for ERP Abap modifications (Steampunk) as well as for AI applications and ERP Clean Core. However, because the licensing model is still complex and orchestrating the many BTP functions such as AI, Joule, Steampunk, etc. still presents a challenge, E3 Magazine has organized the Steampunk and BTP Summit 2025 to better inform SAP partners and users.\n\nSAP versus steampunk\n\nSteampunk stands for transparency, agility, and the future. Typical images of this genre show gears, magnifying glasses, steam boilers, and mechanical machines as they are\u2014no hiding, disguising, or obfuscating! SAP technology is often hidden behind buzzwords, licenses, and clouds. We shed light on the Abap, BTP and Clean Core scene. Steampunk was an internal Abap development project at SAP and is now an E3 education and transparency initiative. Register now for the Steampunk and BTP Summit 2025 on March 5 and 6 in Heidelberg, Germany. This is the meeting place of the SAP community!",

            "content": "SAP \u2013 Jump Start for Volkswagen Battery Startup PowerCo\n\nVolkswagen, one of the leading car makers, is driving forward the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). To be successful, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company believes that it\u2019s crucial to vertically integrate the battery value chain. Consequently, Volkswagen took matters into its own hands and founded the battery company PowerCo in 2022.\n\nAndreas Eckle, CIO of PowerCo SE, told the audience during a live session at Hannover Messe trade fair,\n\nPowerCo will develop and produce battery cells for the VW Group in best quality, in large numbers,\n\n\u201cThe gigafactories are set up to a standard factory design.\u201d This ensures the same processes, the same equipment, and the same workflows at all its locations, he explained.\n\nThree Gigafactories from Scratch\n\nEckle said,\n\nConstruction is in full swing at the first standard factory in Salzgitter, Germany, only about 70 kilometers from Hannover. It serves as a blueprint for all PowerCo\u2019s gigafactories,\n\nCell production in Germany will start in 2025; Valencia, Spain, and St. Thomas, Canada, will follow soon. In future, the Salzgitter plant is to reach an annual capacity of up to 40 GWh\u2014enough for about 500,000 electric vehicles. The three gigafactories in Europe and North America will have a total volume of up to 200 GWh.\n\nEckle pointed out that producing battery cells is a completely new business for Volkswagen.\n\nHe said,\n\nIt is not manufacturing cars anymore; it is chemistry. We go all the way from mining to the complete cell and recycling,\n\nAt the same time, cell production is a very relevant topic for sustainability, so PowerCo has to make sure that the complete supply chain is committed to Volkswagen\u2019s sustainability standards. The company\u2019s scope will include new business models based around reusing discarded car batteries and recycling the valuable raw materials they contain.\n\nPrepare for the future of mobility while running profitable and sustainable operations today\n\nThe battery cell manufacturer started from scratch: 24 months ago, not only the factory had to be built but the staff for the startup company had to be recruited, too. Now there are about 1,500 employees in different areas, from research and development to operations, and they are the basis for building the company. The same applied to the IT landscape: it first had to be set up.\n\nStandards Accelerate Implementation\n\nEckle said:\n\nWe have a very high demand that we need to satisfy for electric vehicles, and from our understanding this will only work if we have the right standards in place.\n\nStephan Fester, Global Battery Best Practice lead at SAP, who was on stage with Eckle, agreed:\n\nWithout standards you will never have the performance you need to set up a factory at this scale in no time.\n\nFester described how SAP and PowerCo connected in 2022 and defined a project scope for the first phase in only two days.\n\nIn 2023, the project team set up an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system and realized three go-lives. They began with the processes that a startup typically needs at once:\n\nFester said,\n\nThe first initiative was to manage and spend money and recruit, employ, and manage people,\n\nHe told the audience that it was around March or April when the project partners heard of the big opening ceremony that was planned for the go-live of PowerCo.\n\nWith that hard deadline in mind, they started with the accelerated deployment service for recruiting, onboarding, and workforce management with SAP SuccessFactors solutions.\n\nFester recalled,\n\nNormally this takes 12 weeks,\n\n\u201cThe SAP team said it normally takes at least eight weeks, but PowerCo challenged us with a time frame of only five weeks!\u2019\u201d\n\nThis was a good example, he explained, of how a standard can accelerate implementation. They also set up material accounting, financial closing, and vendor invoice management.\n\nFester explained.\n\nAnother very important factor for success was that we as SAP wrote the concept according to our understanding of the requirements. PowerCo carried out a review and confirmed it,\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask PowerCo what it wanted, because it couldn\u2019t specify that at the time. We understood the business and designed and implemented it based on our experience.\u201d\n\nSynchronize Business and IT Planning\n\nIn June 2023, the project team delivered the first version of logistics management. Fester explained the concept:\n\nWe synchronized the setup plan of the factory with the IT plan. If we know the first truck will arrive at the factory at a certain day, that means the capabilities to manage the truck and the material handling need to be available prior to that.\n\nEnhanced logistics were implemented in November, like in-warehouse processes, batch management, and returnable packaging management. At the beginning of 2024, integrated business planning went live, and more logistics processes were implemented. The next phase is already planned and set-up with product lifecycle management and other systems.\n\nFully Operational in Six Months\n\nFester said,\n\nWe set up a cloud ERP system in less than six months, fully operational,\n\nPowerCo CIO Eckle added that this timeline only worked out because critical defects were resolved quickly and effectively in task force mode. The success of the SAP S/4HANA implementation project is also shown by the SAP Quality Award PowerCo received in 2024.\n\nEckle concluded,\n\nWe are proud of what we have achieved,\n\n\u201cbut we still have a long way to go. The Salzgitter factory opening is the first major milestone, with two other openings following.\u201d\n\nPowerCo is now well positioned for future business development. The current cloud ERP system serves as the central foundation for cell production. It will also support future business models like recycling of battery cells and the energy storage system business.\n\nREAD the latest Batteries News shaping the battery market\n\nSAP \u2013 Jump Start for Volkswagen Battery Startup PowerCo, source",

            "content": "This post was jointly authored by AWS and SAP. We thank Fadi Naoum (Senior VP, Head of Sports & Entertainment), Christian Walter (COO, Sports & Entertainment), Michael Kettenmann (Product Manager for SAP Sports One), and Baris Altuz (Product Manager for team management, scouting & match analysis), for their contributions to our successful partnership and this blog post. Abraham Arellano, Antonia Wiebeler, Brittany Anderson, Dustin Hughes, Kim Robins, Philipp Kaindl, and Tonia Schneider from AWS contributed in this initiative.\n\nIn professional football, success often depends on how quickly teams can analyze and adapt their tactics. At TSG Hoffenheim, match analysts traditionally spent hours manually reviewing game footage, tagging plays, and preparing video clips for team reviews. This process was not just time-consuming\u2014it was limiting the team\u2019s ability to leverage their vast archive of match footage for strategic insights.\n\nAWS, in collaboration with SAP Sports One and TSG Hoffenheim, developed a groundbreaking football match analysis system that leverages generative AI to provide coaches and analysts with unprecedented tactical insights. By working backwards from the specific needs of TSG Hoffenheim, we demonstrated a proof of concept that showcases the potential of AI in sports analytics at SPOBIS 2025\n\nTransforming Sports Management with Real-Time Analytics:\n\nSAP Sports One streamlines team organization and optimizes sports performance through a comprehensive sports management platform. Built on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), it integrates team management, training, scouting, match analysis, player fitness monitoring, and analytics into one solution. The platform runs its video processing component exclusively on AWS, delivering reliable and scalable performance for teams worldwide.\n\nMost professional football clubs in Germany\u2019s top leagues trust SAP Sports One to drive their digital transformation, making data-driven decisions that improve performance both on and off the field. By consolidating all essential sports operations in one platform, teams can access the insights they need to maximize their potential and achieve greater success.\n\nAnalytics capabilities built with AWS generative AI services in Match Analysis\n\nAWS worked backwards with SAP Sports One and TSG Hoffenheim to reimagine match analysis leveraging AWS\u2019s Working Backwards Mechanism and Amazon\u2019s Day 1 Culture of customer obsession and swift decision-making. We started by understanding how analysts interact with video archives, focusing on their experience rather than technical constraints. Our goal was to make complex tactical analysis as simple as asking a natural language question. Together, we developed a Proof of Concept Match Analysis in SAP Sports One.\n\nLet\u2019s see how this AI-powered solution transforms the way match analysts work, bringing unprecedented efficiency and insight to football analysis:\n\nThe intuitive dashboard provides a comprehensive view of recent matches, with instant access to scores, statistics, and key moments. Match analysts can quickly navigate through different competitions and review team performance at a glance.\n\nSimply type questions like \u201cShow me all scenes where TSG shot at the goal from a counter-attack\u201d and get instant results. The AI understands football terminology and tactical concepts, making complex video searches as easy as having a conversation.\n\nCompare live match footage with tactical visualizations side by side. The split-screen view combines actual game footage with player positioning data, offering deeper insights into team formations and individual player movements.\n\nShare curated match moments and analysis directly with coaches and players. The integrated sharing capabilities streamline communication and help teams prepare more effectively for upcoming matches.\n\nImpact of generative AI in sports analytics:\n\nWith Amazon Bedrock, an AWS fully managed service that provides foundation models through an API, sports analytics is being transformed in ways never before possible. By leveraging Bedrock\u2019s advanced AI capabilities, Match Analyst helps you understand team tactics, interpret game situations, and retrieve precise video clips using simple language queries. Now, you spend less time searching through footage and more time developing winning strategies.\n\nMatch Analysis Proof of Concept demonstrates how generative AI can enhance rather than replace human expertise in sports analysis, setting a new standard for how professional football clubs can leverage their vast video archives and future streaming footage for strategic advantage. As teams continue to seek competitive edges in professional football, solutions like Match Analysis point the way toward a future where advanced AI technology and deep sports domain knowledge combine to revolutionize game analysis.\n\nTo learn more about the technology powering these innovations, visit SAP Sports One or AWS for SAP.",

            "content": "Volkswagen, one of the leading car makers, is driving forward the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). To be successful, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company believes that it\u2019s crucial to vertically integrate the battery value chain. Consequently, Volkswagen took matters into its own hands and founded the battery company PowerCo in 2022.\n\n\u201cPowerCo will develop and produce battery cells for the VW Group in best quality, in large numbers,\u201d Andreas Eckle, CIO of PowerCo SE, told the audience during a live session at Hannover Messe trade fair. \u201cThe gigafactories are set up to a standard factory design.\u201d This ensures the same processes, the same equipment, and the same workflows at all its locations, he explained.\n\nThree Gigafactories from Scratch\n\n\u201cConstruction is in full swing at the first standard factory in Salzgitter, Germany, only about 70 kilometers from Hannover. It serves as a blueprint for all PowerCo\u2019s gigafactories,\u201d Eckle said. Cell production in Germany will start in 2025; Valencia, Spain, and St. Thomas, Canada, will follow soon. In future, the Salzgitter plant is to reach an annual capacity of up to 40 GWh\u2014enough for about 500,000 electric vehicles. The three gigafactories in Europe and North America will have a total volume of up to 200 GWh.\n\nEckle pointed out that producing battery cells is a completely new business for Volkswagen. \u201cIt is not manufacturing cars anymore; it is chemistry. We go all the way from mining to the complete cell and recycling,\u201d he said. At the same time, cell production is a very relevant topic for sustainability, so PowerCo has to make sure that the complete supply chain is committed to Volkswagen\u2019s sustainability standards. The company\u2019s scope will include new business models based around reusing discarded car batteries and recycling the valuable raw materials they contain.\n\nPrepare for the future of mobility while running profitable and sustainable operations today Learn more\n\nThe battery cell manufacturer started from scratch: 24 months ago, not only the factory had to be built but the staff for the startup company had to be recruited, too. Now there are about 1,500 employees in different areas, from research and development to operations, and they are the basis for building the company. The same applied to the IT landscape: it first had to be set up.\n\nStandards Accelerate Implementation\n\nEckle said: \u201cWe have a very high demand that we need to satisfy for electric vehicles, and from our understanding this will only work if we have the right standards in place.\u201d Stephan Fester, Global Battery Best Practice lead at SAP, who was on stage with Eckle, agreed: \u201cWithout standards you will never have the performance you need to set up a factory at this scale in no time.\u201d Fester described how SAP and PowerCo connected in 2022 and defined a project scope for the first phase in only two days.\n\nIn 2023, the project team set up an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system and realized three go-lives. They began with the processes that a startup typically needs at once: \u201cThe first initiative was to manage and spend money and recruit, employ, and manage people,\u201d Fester said. He told the audience that it was around March or April when the project partners heard of the big opening ceremony that was planned for the go-live of PowerCo.\n\nWith that hard deadline in mind, they started with the accelerated deployment service for recruiting, onboarding, and workforce management with SAP SuccessFactors solutions. \u201cNormally this takes 12 weeks,\u201d Fester recalled. \u201cThe SAP team said it normally takes at least eight weeks, but PowerCo challenged us with a time frame of only five weeks!\u2019\u201d This was a good example, he explained, of how a standard can accelerate implementation. They also set up material accounting, financial closing, and vendor invoice management.\n\n\u201cAnother very important factor for success was that we as SAP wrote the concept according to our understanding of the requirements. PowerCo carried out a review and confirmed it,\u201d Fester explained. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask PowerCo what it wanted, because it couldn\u2019t specify that at the time. We understood the business and designed and implemented it based on our experience.\u201d\n\nSynchronize Business and IT Planning\n\nIn June 2023, the project team delivered the first version of logistics management. Fester explained the concept: \u201cWe synchronized the setup plan of the factory with the IT plan. If we know the first truck will arrive at the factory at a certain day, that means the capabilities to manage the truck and the material handling need to be available prior to that.\u201d\n\nEnhanced logistics were implemented in November, like in-warehouse processes, batch management, and returnable packaging management. At the beginning of 2024, integrated business planning went live, and more logistics processes were implemented. The next phase is already planned and set-up with product lifecycle management and other systems.\n\nFully Operational in Six Months\n\n\u201cWe set up a cloud ERP system in less than six months, fully operational,\u201d Fester said. PowerCo CIO Eckle added that this timeline only worked out because critical defects were resolved quickly and effectively in task force mode. The success of the SAP S/4HANA implementation project is also shown by the SAP Quality Award PowerCo received in 2024. \u201cWe are proud of what we have achieved,\u201d Eckle concluded, \u201cbut we still have a long way to go. The Salzgitter factory opening is the first major milestone, with two other openings following.\u201d\n\nPowerCo is now well positioned for future business development. The current cloud ERP system serves as the central foundation for cell production. It will also support future business models like recycling of battery cells and the energy storage system business.",

            "content": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has had a significant impact on SAP-powered financial teams, making 2024 a year marked by technical innovation. On the other hand, they encountered a skills shortage that restricted their ability to keep up with the rapid advancement of technology. Rapid technological innovation was identified as the primary source of the skills shortages of 91%, according to the most current Finance Team Trends Report from Research\u2019s SAP edition.\n\nSAP ERPs frequently have limitations, including complicated data management, integration issues, and a high learning curve that causes the pain of a skills shortage. This article discusses SAP\u2019s development plans and their implications for consultants who want to thrive in this changing environment.\n\nSAP S/4HANA Migration\n\nIn 2025, we expect a rise in the use of S/4HANA. This is necessary since SAP intends to phase down SAP ECC in favor of S/4HANA by December 2027. Although SAP S/4HANA offers increased flexibility, cost savings, and scalability due to its cloud-based operation, SAP finance teams find the transition difficult. Just 26% of SAP-driven finance teams have completely shifted to a cloud environment, according to our most recent Finance Team Trends Report. 51% of those who haven\u2019t migrated say they intend to do so within the next two years, and 42% say they will prepare for the SAP S/4HANA migration in the coming year.\n\nThe process of moving to the cloud isn\u2019t simple. The alignment of IT, business, and project teams is identified by nearly two-thirds (66%) of CIOs as the largest obstacle to S/4HANA deployment. 12% of the teams surveyed by the CIO said they intended to transform with S/4HANA but postponed the start of their transition. Purchasing easy-to-use technologies with data warehousing capabilities can help close this gap by facilitating smooth access to cloud and legacy data, speeding up decision-making, and increasing productivity.\n\nAddressing Challenges in Data Integration\n\nAs 2025 approaches, the data environment for SAP financial teams is only going to get more complicated. As SAP finance teams manage SAP and other systems, this becomes more complex. For an in-depth understanding of their finances, 99% of SAP-based finance teams employ both SAP and non-ERP data sources. This includes non-ERP software such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Asset Management (EAM), and Human Resources Information System (HRIS).\n\nAccording to our survey of SAP customers, 82% of them agree that the primary challenge to financial reporting, forecasting, and compliance is poor data management and integration.\n\nAccuracy and efficiency can be greatly increased by using logical software solutions to address these data integration issues.\n\nGrowing Requirement for Self-Service\n\nWith the rapid pace at which technology is developing, companies using SAP can no longer afford to wait for important insights from their data. Teams can run normal financial reports using the native reporting tools that SAP ERPs come with, but this doesn\u2019t address leadership inquiries that an unusual report couldn\u2019t address.\n\nWhen SAP teams encounter these requirements, they seek the assistance of IT teams or technical consultants to provide customized reports. As a result, financial teams become excessively reliant on IT. Maintaining and integrating financial data is falling more and more on the IT department. This is evident from our 2024 survey, which found that 76% of finance teams using SAP felt overly dependent on IT.\n\nBy 2025, you won\u2019t need to leave your important records to IT. With the help of SAP solutions, stay updated on the latest developments and give your company a competitive advantage in the coming year.\n\nBoost Your SAP Finance Team: Simplify S/4HANA Migration\n\nEliminate the frustration of inefficient reporting and manual procedures. With automated transaction postings and real-time SAP data access, Financial Optimization for SAP enables finance and accounting professionals to concentrate on insightful analysis rather than time-consuming tasks.\n\nOur Excel-based solution streamlines your workflows with pre-built reports, automated data uploads, and integrated error management, whether you are using it for monthly reporting or on-demand inquiry. The best part is that it reduces your dependency on IT, allowing your team to handle business challenges with more independence and agility.\n\nConclusion\n\nSAP\u2019s 2025 strategy is defined by its strategic emphasis on cloud-first solutions, advanced analytics, and industry-specific products. For consultants who are prepared to adjust to this changing environment, these priorities open up new opportunities.\n\nWe at Accely are familiar with these challenges and address them individually. By providing SAP ERP users with user-friendly tools and processes, we enable them to accomplish more with less.",

            "content": "\n\nAI and Functional SAP Roles\n\nAre you concerned that your consulting role is changing?\n\nWith AI-driven automation, predictive analytics, and machine learning becoming integral to SAP environments, functional consultants must adapt their SAP AI skills.\n\nBut while AI accelerates repetitive tasks, it doesn\u2019t replace the need for expert oversight: it shifts the focus of the role. Consultants must refine their skill sets, rethink problem-solving methods, and consider how AI integration influences their career paths.\n\nThis article explores how AI enhances decision-making, speeds up implementations, and focuses SAP consulting work on higher-value activities.\n\nThough methods used in SAP consulting are changing, the business goals and associated core skills remain the same. Business knowledge, strategic thinking, and human judgment remain essential.\n\n\n\nThe Changing Role of Functional SAP Consultants\n\nPreviously, functional SAP consultants were responsible for configuring systems to realise business requirements, optimizing workflows, and acting as intermediaries between business users and technical teams. This work has often been process-driven, needing support with extensive customization, testing, and troubleshooting.\n\nNow machine learning algorithms embedded in SAP applications can already identify inefficiencies, suggest best practices, and execute certain optimizations autonomously. For users, AI-powered assistants, such as SAP Joule, enable users to interact with systems through natural language, reducing manual navigation and data retrieval. Predictive analytics highlight trends in financial data, procurement, and workforce planning, allowing businesses to make informed decisions with less reliance on consultants for data extraction.\n\nAll these capabilities don\u2019t make functional expertise obsolete. Consultants are now needed for directing AI: interpreting AI-generated insights, validating recommendations, and refining business processes to maximize efficiency while maintaining governance and compliance.\n\nData alone is meaningless without context. Raw information is just noise until it is structured, analyzed, and turned into actionable insights. AI can process vast amounts of data, but it lacks the business awareness to translate those outputs into meaningful decisions.\n\nMost organizations struggle not with a lack of data but with making sense of it: identifying patterns, prioritizing insights, and ensuring AI-driven recommendations align with strategic objectives.\n\nConsultants can help organizations move from information overload to informed action, ensuring that AI-driven automation enhances decision-making rather than complicating it: using AI to turn raw data into a clear, strategic narrative that drives business success.\n\n\n\nAI Technologies Reshaping SAP Consulting\n\nSeveral AI-driven innovation areas are transforming SAP environments:\n\nSAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation (iRPA) handles repetitive tasks like invoice matching and data reconciliation. These systems learn from historical patterns, improving over time. Consultants must understand where automation is beneficial, where oversight is needed, and how to integrate these tools with SAP modules.\n\nWhile conversational AI tools enable users to interact with complex systems through simple commands. Consultants must ensure that AI-driven interactions produce accurate and meaningful results while also addressing governance concerns such as data integrity and security.\n\nAI-powered analytics within SAP S/4HANA can improve forecasting in supply chain management, finance, and workforce planning. Here too, consultants must validate predictions, align them with business goals, and refine underlying data models to improve accuracy.\n\nSo, as these technologies become standard, consultants must develop expertise in available AI-powered tools, but also in AI integration and governance to remain effective advisors.\n\n\n\nAI\u2019s Expansion Beyond Core ERP\n\nAlong with transforming core ERP processes AI is also reshaping adjacent enterprise functions within SAP:\n\nAI-driven sentiment analysis, sales forecasting, and personalized marketing are enhancing SAP CX solutions. Consultants must understand how AI influences customer engagement and integrates with broader business systems.\n\nAI in SAP Ariba optimizes purchasing, assesses supplier risks, and detects fraud. Consultants must interpret AI-generated insights, adjust procurement strategies accordingly, and ensure alignment with supply chain objectives.\n\nAI-enhanced SAP SuccessFactors tools optimize recruitment, predict workforce trends, and improve HR processes. However, AI-driven hiring and workforce planning introduce ethical concerns, requiring consultants to monitor for bias and fairness.\n\nThe increasing role of AI across SAP solutions means that consultants must broaden their knowledge beyond individual modules. Those who develop cross-functional expertise will be in a stronger position to provide strategic guidance.\n\n\n\nGovernance, Compliance, and AI Risk Management\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into SAP environments, governance and compliance are becoming more important.\n\nAI-driven decision-making introduces new risks, including potential for biased hiring recommendations, incorrect financial forecasts, or compliance violations if not properly managed.\n\nOne of the key roles of employees is to be accountable for their decisions, and in ideal circumstances this distribution of responsibility for decisions has the effect of reducing risk. When AI is adopted but not carefully implemented it can cause a sudden drop in accountability for decision-making.\n\nThis is one of the main reasons for ensuring that AI models remain transparent and explainable. Unlike traditional rule-based configurations, machine learning operates on pattern recognition, raising questions about accountability when AI-driven processes produce unexpected outcomes.\n\nRegulatory frameworks such as GDPR and the EU AI Act impose strict guidelines on AI\u2019s use in financial reporting, workforce analytics, and customer data management. During implementation processes, and also through monitoring once AI processes are in place, consultants must ensure SAP systems comply with these laws, while maintaining security and mitigating risks associated with AI automation.\n\nThe evolving nature of AI governance presents an opportunity for consultants to shape best practices. Those who establish AI monitoring mechanisms, define ethical guidelines, and implement safeguards will have a leading role in AI deployment.\n\n\n\nThe Human-AI Collaboration Model in SAP Consulting\n\nSAP consulting is about collaboration. Between consulting team members, with client-side teams, and also now with AI.\n\nAI systems can analyze vast enterprise datasets, detect inefficiencies, and generate forecasts. However, these outputs are only as reliable as the data they rely on. Functional consultants act as the bridge between AI insights and business realities, validating recommendations, addressing data quality issues, and ensuring AI-driven decisions align with strategic objectives.\n\nWithout proper oversight, AI-driven recommendations can become outdated, biased, or misaligned with organizational goals. This means SAP consultants must take an active role, working closely with data engineers, in monitoring model performance, identifying when retraining is necessary, and ensuring that AI adapts to shifting business environments.\n\nSAP consultants will also play a role in customizing AI models to meet industry-specific needs. Off-the-shelf AI solutions may not fully align with unique business challenges, requiring consultants to fine-tune models based on sector-specific priorities, regulatory requirements, and enterprise workflows. For example, an AI model used for demand forecasting in retail will need different training parameters than one used for financial risk assessment in banking.\n\n\n\nEvolving Skillsets for SAP Functional Consultants\n\nAs AI takes over repetitive tasks, SAP consultants must develop new competencies that emphasize judgment, creativity, and strategic thinking, along with the following associated skills:\n\nAI & Machine Learning Fundamentals: Consultants don\u2019t need to become data scientists, but understanding AI models, how they generate insights, and their limitations will be critical. This knowledge will help consultants validate AI outputs and guide businesses on responsible AI adoption.\n\nData Literacy: Ensuring data quality, eliminating inconsistencies, and structuring data properly within SAP systems will be key to maintaining reliable AI-generated outputs.\n\nProcess Automation Expertise: As SAP iRPA and AI-driven workflows become more common, consultants must know how to design, implement, and monitor automated processes. This includes determining where automation adds value, where human oversight is necessary, and how to optimize AI-human collaboration.\n\nAI-Enhanced Interfaces & Prompt Engineering: AI tools like SAP Joule are changing how users interact with SAP systems. Consultants must learn how to help users to craft effective AI queries and refine AI interactions to yield the most meaningful business insights.\n\nAI Governance & Compliance: AI-driven systems must be transparent, explainable, and aligned with regulatory requirements. Consultants will be responsible for ensuring AI-powered workflows adhere to frameworks like GDPR, the EU AI Act, and industry-specific regulations.\n\n\u201cAgentic\u201d AI: Understanding SAP\u2019s latest innovation in AI agents, \u201cagentic AI\u201d, will be increasingly relevant in an AI-driven SAP services market. These autonomous AI-driven agents are designed to execute complex business processes, make contextual decisions, and optimize SAP workflows with minimal human intervention. Consultants must adapt by learning how to configure, govern, and integrate these intelligent agents to ensure they align with business objectives, compliance requirements, and enterprise AI strategies.\n\nTo stay ahead, consultants should pursue AI-related SAP training, including SAP AI Core and SAP BTP AI certifications.\n\n\n\nThe Business Case for AI-Augmented SAP Functional Consulting\n\nFor organizations, implementing AI in SAP environments is about achieving desired business outcomes. Functional consultants who can make sure AI capabilities meet enterprise goals will become indispensable, but making the business case for these investments is an important skill for consultants looking to specialize in AI.\n\nDuring early interactions they will need to convey the specific financial and procedural benefits of AI for each customer, and define key performance indicators to monitor the effectiveness of these.\n\nConsultants will need to explain how AI-driven automation eliminates inefficiencies, accelerates workflows, and reduces manual errors, as well as how automation must be strategically implemented to avoid disruptions. Another benefit that consultants must convey is how AI shifts businesses from reactive decision-making to proactive strategy execution.\n\nThey will have to show how AI-powered assistants simplify SAP interactions, reducing the learning curve for business users and improving adoption rates. Consultants will need to demonstrate how AI-enhanced workflows ensure that users benefit from AI-driven efficiencies without losing control over business processes.\n\nEssentially, SAP consultants will need to be skilled at educating their clients about AI as part of sales and project planning processes, aside from user training.\n\n\n\nThe Future of SAP Functional Consulting Careers\n\nThe introduction of AI in SAP environments raises an important question: will AI reduce the demand for SAP functional consultants? The answer is complex. While AI automates certain tasks, it creates new opportunities for those who evolve with the technology. To put it another way: consultants who are not at least functionally competent at integrating AI features into SAP systems they work on will be overlooking a distinct competitive advantage in the SAP job market.\n\nNew roles are emerging that require a blend of functional expertise, AI knowledge, and strategic insight. Hybrid roles that combine business process management with AI-driven automation are also becoming more common.\n\nThose who embrace AI as a tool to enhance their consulting capabilities will continue to thrive. By acquiring new skills, staying ahead of technological advancements, and understanding how AI can enhance business outcomes, consultants can ensure their continued relevance.\n\nIf you are an SAP professional looking for a new role in the SAP ecosystem our team of dedicated recruitment consultants can match you with your ideal employer and negotiate a competitive compensation package for your extremely valuable skills, so join our exclusive community at IgniteSAP.",

We see our customers unlocking new innovations through modernization of their business processes and embracing a cloud operating model. For most SAP customers, it is not a matter of whether they are going to move from their legacy systems, but a question of how quickly they can do this in the overall context of their business and IT transformation.\n\nAs we approach 2030 and the end of extended maintenance for on-premise SAP ERP systems, this transformation becomes even more important. Continuing to use these systems beyond 2030 will become increasingly challenging and risk prone, as, for example, third-party products like older Java versions will no longer be supported from the respective vendors.\n\nOn the other hand, we know that SAP customers with very large and complex on-premise IT landscapes \u2014 including a large number of SAP ERP systems, some in the hundreds \u2014 require flexibility to move each part of their landscape to the cloud with the pace and agility needed to support evolving business requirements.\n\nTo help customers in this situation better prepare for the future, we will introduce a new cloud subscription offering, SAP ERP, private edition, transition option, designed to help our largest and most complex customers plan, execute and succeed in their cloud transformation.\n\nThis new offering will be an SAP ERP cloud subscription centered around SAP ECC, along with a set of dedicated services to help with the transformation to SAP cloud ERP. It will also support business continuity with patches for security, legal and software issues. It will be available for purchase starting in 2028 and will be active for usage from 2031-2033. SAP is pre-disclosing this offering because we understand that customers with complex landscapes need advance notice, hence we want to give sufficient time for planning purposes.\n\nIt is an additional and non-mandatory offering. Customers who are planning to complete their transformation journey by the end of 2030 will not need it. SAP ERP, private edition, transition option, is intended for customers who require additional time and support.\n\nThe offering will have a set of conditions, including:\n\nThe scope of products will be centered around SAP ECC; it will not include the full scope of SAP Business Suite 7 that is only available for subscription until end of 2030. SAP will make the eligible scope of products transparent starting later this year.\n\nSystems relevant for the SAP ERP, private edition, transition option, need to be moved to SAP ERP, private edition prior to the end of 2030.\n\nIn order to be able to subscribe to the new offering from 2031 to latest end of 2033, a set of preparations are required: SAP HANA is the only supported database for the new subscription offering; there will be a set of further adjustments needed, e.g. as third-party technology, such as older versions of Java, are no longer supported.\n\nMore details will be announced closer to availability-to-purchase in 2028.\n\nThe natural next step and target after utilizing the new offering would then be a transition to SAP cloud ERP.\n\nTo clarify, we would like to emphasize that this is not a maintenance prolongation of SAP ERP. There are no changes for customers running on-premise SAP ERP systems after 2030.\n\nThe new offering, SAP ERP, private edition, transition option, will come at an expanded fee in 2031-2033 compared to a comparable ERP cloud subscription before 2031. Naturally, due to the complexity in offering such a service, this is targeted to larger and complex systems. More details will be shared with the broader launch in Q2 2025 and once we move closer to the contractual availability of the offering in 2028.\n\nFeel encouraged to contact your SAP account executive or SAP partner to learn more and get started planning.\n\nWe are very encouraged by the positive recognition and interest in this future offering. Based on customer response, we would like to provide the following additional information: The RISE with SAP journey remains the best way to move to the cloud and consume latest innovations an AI.\n\nWhere in complex setups the journey might not be finalized by 2030, customers should not wait, but move their existing on-premise SAP ERP to SAP ERP, private edition now, as the first step on their RISE with SAP journey to the cloud.\n\nSAP and the customer will jointly prepare the system for the later transition option.\n\nSAP has announced plans to make SAP ERP, private edition, transition option available for active usage from 2031 to 2033; customers should craft their transformation plans on this basis. Please reach out to your sales representative for further information and to start planning.\n\nStefan Steinle is executive vice president and head of Customer Support & Cloud Lifecycle Management at SAP.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against the other AI stocks that are making headlines.\n\nNowadays, barely a day goes by without a huge headline touching artificial intelligence (AI). Three main factors are driving the rising interest in AI. First, it is now easier to train new machine learning (ML) models because training data is easily available. The DeepSeek R1 breakthrough is evidence of this. Second, smaller companies can access computing power with relative ease. AI models use this power to organize and process information. Third, there are enough AI solutions to bridge the gap between AI and organizations. Although organizations still need to hire skilled professionals like Data Scientists, the overall cost to design AI solutions is significantly lower because of the existence of free open-source AI platforms.\n\nHowever, if you look at it from another angle, the rising interest in AI arises from increased adoption. A recent McKinsey report found that 65% of organizations are now using generative AI. The high demand for AI models and related services is reflected in the AI market as ever-higher growth numbers. For instance, a Markets and Markets analysis valued the global AI market at $214.6 billion in 2024 and projects that it will reach $1.3 trillion in 2030.\n\nWhat is happening in the AI market is only one side of the coin; the other side is what the AI revolution is doing to human life. Great things are happening. According to a PwC analysis, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. This will happen in the form of increased GDP for local economies resulting from increased productivity and consumption of AI-related products and services.\n\nInterestingly, this impact doesn\u2019t come from traditional AI companies\u2014those at the forefront of training AI models\u2014alone. Instead, the global economy will experience an income boost from AI through partnerships between core technology developers and other businesses. What this means is that AI is no longer just a chatbot. Rather, it has changed how companies create value.",

Since then, he has also taken on the role of CTO.\n\nHighlights\n\nInterplay Between Agents and Apps in AI (01:01)\n\nCurrent AI experiences are narrow and explicit, says Herzig, and have less agency but will become more autonomous over time with advancements like reasoning models and deep learning. New enterprise apps will exist for a long time, \u201cbut the architecture and how they are designed . . . with each new step will fundamentally change.\u201d Agents play a significant role in various business processes like claims management and financial closing and need to integrate with applications for data and functionality.\n\nThe Role of Knowledge Graphs and Neuro-Symbolic AI (03:11)\n\nHerzig explains the role of Knowledge Graphs in guiding agents by providing business process lineage and descriptions. He compares the current state of AI agents to a team of experts working on a task, emphasizing the need for structured guidance. When large language models are combined with deterministic approaches like symbolic AI systems, better results are achieved. He draws a parallel between the evolution of AI agents and the transition from on-prem software to cloud-based SaaS applications.\n\nCustomer Concerns and the Future of SAP Applications (07:02)\n\nAI agent innovation is a natural continuation of SAP\u2019s applications. Herzig says that building agents outside of SAP\u2019s applications can lead to a loss of context and integration, which is crucial for business processes. Ultimately, SAP\u2019s focus is on end-to-end business processes: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of standard business processes like accounts payable or order management and a bunch of other things where you can get higher degrees of efficiency and productivity through ever more agentic workflows or agentic experiences in a standardized way . . . that resonates very well with our customers.\u201d\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nIndustry-Specific Applications and Partners Ecosystem (10:14)\n\nSAP focuses on horizontal AI platforms for enterprise functions like finance and HR, but also builds verticalized solutions for specific industries. A strong partners ecosystem helps develop industry-specific applications that run on SAP\u2019s platform. Herzig mentions that while SAP will focus on standard business processes, there will still be room for custom agents in specific industries.\n\nPricing Structure and Commercial Models (12:00)\n\nSAP has introduced a commercial model with AI units that customers can purchase and use across various SAP products. Herzig mentions that the value of AI units is divided between SAP and the customer, with 80% of the value going to the customer. He discusses the transition to a new pricing model as AI agents become more integrated and replace traditional seat-based licenses. \u201cWhat will happen? . . . Step by step, certain things, where in the past, you required a traditional seat-based license will either stay flat or will go down. Hence you need a new mechanism to. . . monetize the value that is being created through these agents and this kind of business model transformation that is going to happen.\u201d\n\nEvolution of SAP\u2019s Business Model (14:58)\n\nSAP has evolved from a classic application company to one that integrates AI, data, and platforms. SAP\u2019s goal is to make technology disappear and focus on customer outcomes, ensuring a return on investment. Herzig concludes that higher adoption of AI in the enterprise will be achieved by making these technologies easy to consume and integrate.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

            "content": "\n\nSAP Systems and Cloud Infrastructure\n\nThe emergence of cloud infrastructure, and SAP\u2019s own cloud offerings have introduced new ways of operating and optimizing business processes.\n\nThis has implications for how organizations structure IT environments, manage costs, and address compliance requirements, making it essential for consultants to stay ahead of evolving methodologies and technological frameworks.\n\nThis article from IgniteSAP explores the technical and financial relationship between SAP systems and cloud infrastructure.\n\n\n\nSAP\u2019s Cloud Strategy and the Role of Hyperscalers\n\nSAP\u2019s cloud computing has progressed significantly in response to changing enterprise demands. Initially, companies running SAP relied on physical data centers, requiring dedicated hardware investments and in-house maintenance. This provided direct control over security and customization but introduced challenges in scalability, cost efficiency, and system upgrades. The introduction of cloud-based solutions has altered this landscape, so organizations have access to more adaptable infrastructure while reducing the burden of hardware management.\n\nCloud hyperscalers are facilitating SAP\u2019s move away from on-premise models.\n\nAWS pioneered SAP-certified cloud infrastructure, providing high-performance computing instances optimized for SAP HANA. Microsoft Azure has positioned itself as an enterprise-focused cloud provider, integrating closely with SAP applications and business intelligence tools. Google Cloud now provides AI-powered analytics for SAP workloads, allowing businesses to harness machine learning alongside transactional data. These hyperscalers provide hosting environments but also contribute security, automation, and performance-enhancing technologies specifically for SAP systems.\n\nRISE with SAP represents a departure from traditional licensing, combining infrastructure, software, and managed services under a subscription model. This differs from previous offerings by embedding business process transformation within cloud migration, rather than treating it solely as a technical shift.\n\nWhile RISE with SAP simplifies cloud adoption for customers by consolidating various components into a single contract, it also reshapes the role of service providers, as some functions previously handled by consulting firms are now included within SAP\u2019s managed services.\n\n\n\nMigration Considerations\n\nWhen moving SAP systems to the cloud organizations must determine the best approach based on existing infrastructure, business needs, and long-term scalability.\n\nThe greenfield method is well-suited to enterprises looking for operational modernization but requires significant process redesign and organizational adaptation.\n\nThe brownfield approach avoids the disruption of a full reimplementation, but requires technical adjustments to meet cloud-optimized performance standards and may involve adapting legacy workflows to newer cloud functionalities.\n\nA hybrid or bluefield method, allows selective migration, enabling businesses to maintain certain legacy elements while introducing cloud-native features where beneficial. This strategy is often chosen when companies want to optimize specific operational areas.\n\nA well-planned migration must account for connectivity between cloud-based SAP instances and external applications, as many organizations operate within hybrid IT environments. Cloud networking configurations, data replication mechanisms, and latency become key considerations in maintaining system performance post-migration.\n\n\n\nTechnical and Operational Challenges\n\nDeploying SAP in a cloud environment presents challenges beyond infrastructure provisioning.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is system performance, as cloud-hosted SAP HANA databases require optimized memory allocation and computing resources. Cloud environments offer dynamic resource scaling, making careful workload distribution essential to prevent cost overruns or performance bottlenecks.\n\nIntegration complexity also arises when SAP is connected with third-party applications or on-premise data sources. Cloud-hosted SAP systems must interact with enterprise resource planning modules, customer relationship management platforms, supply chain systems, and business intelligence tools, usually requiring API-driven connectivity. SAP Integration Suite enables many of these scenarios, allowing easier communication between SAP and non-SAP applications within a distributed cloud ecosystem.\n\nSecurity considerations differ significantly between cloud and on-premise SAP deployments. Organizations must configure identity and access management policies that align with cloud security frameworks while ensuring compliance with industry regulations. Cloud-native security tools provided by hyperscalers offer additional layers of protection, including encryption management, threat detection, and automated compliance monitoring. These tools must be configured to work alongside SAP\u2019s internal security architecture, requiring careful planning to avoid potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nCost Management and Licensing\n\nFinancial factors are an important aspect of determining how organizations structure SAP cloud deployments, as many cloud pricing models introduce variable expenses based on resource consumption. This requires businesses to actively monitor and adjust cloud usage to prevent unnecessary expenditure.\n\nOne of the key decisions in SAP cost management is whether to adopt a RISE with SAP subscription model or use a \u201cBring Your Own License\u201d (BYOL) approach. RISE with SAP consolidates infrastructure and software costs into a predictable pricing structure, reducing procurement complexity. However, this may not provide the same level of control over infrastructure choices as a direct deployment on a hyperscaler, where businesses can optimize cloud resources independently.\n\nAs well as licensing, other costs include data storage, network traffic, and computing resource allocation. Data transfer between cloud regions or back to on-premise environments can incur fees that organizations must include in financial planning. Selecting appropriate storage tiers, such as high-performance storage for active SAP HANA databases versus lower-cost options for archival data, affects both cost and performance.\n\nTo manage expenses, businesses employ cloud cost governance strategies, utilizing monitoring tools from hyperscalers to track SAP workloads in real time. This allows organizations to identify unused resources, adjust capacity based on demand, and automate workload scheduling to align with business activity.\n\n\n\nSecurity and Compliance\n\nMoving SAP systems to the cloud introduces security challenges. One major shift is the adoption of role-based access controls that extend beyond SAP\u2019s internal user management, integrating with hyperscaler identity frameworks to maintain unified access governance. Multi-factor authentication and encryption mechanisms can also safeguard cloud-hosted SAP environments, to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data exposure.\n\nCompliance with industry regulations is another necessity, as SAP systems handle sensitive business data that must adhere to governance requirements. Organizations deploying SAP in the cloud must configure data residency policies that meet regional compliance standards, ensuring that information remains within designated jurisdictions. Cloud providers offer compliance enforcement tools that automate monitoring and reporting, reducing the burden of manual audits.\n\nReal-time threat detection has become increasingly relevant in SAP cloud security. Organizations employ security information and event management (SIEM) systems that analyze access patterns, detect anomalies, and respond to potential breaches before they escalate. Machine learning models within security frameworks help identify irregular system behavior, providing an added layer of protection.\n\nAs SAP cloud adoption continues, organizations must adopt security strategies that reflect the distributed nature of cloud computing. Rather than relying on perimeter defenses alone, businesses must integrate security at every layer of their SAP landscape: incorporating encryption, automated access policies, and cloud-native monitoring tools.\n\n\n\nTrends in SAP Cloud Adoption\n\nAmong the most significant trends affecting cloud deployments is the increasing integration of AI and automation into cloud-based SAP environments. These technologies are being applied to finance, supply chain management, and customer relationship functions, introducing predictive analytics and real-time decision-making capabilities. Organizations are using AI-driven automation to accelerate financial reconciliation, detect anomalies in procurement data, and optimize inventory levels.\n\nAnother change is the movement toward industry-specific cloud solutions. Rather than deploying general-purpose ERP systems with extensive customization, companies are adopting pre-configured SAP applications designed for their sector. These incorporate regulatory requirements, sector-specific analytics, and best practices directly into cloud-hosted SAP environments, reducing implementation complexity and ensuring compliance with industry standards.\n\nEdge computing is also playing a growing role in SAP cloud strategies. Manufacturers with IoT-connected production lines, for example, are deploying SAP workloads at the network edge to conduct localized data processing before synchronizing information with cloud-based ERP systems. This reduces latency and optimizes bandwidth consumption while allowing businesses to maintain control over enterprise data.\n\nSustainability considerations are influencing cloud adoption as well. Enterprises are incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals into IT strategies, to reduce energy consumption associated with data processing and storage. Cloud providers are responding by offering renewable-energy-powered data centers and tools for tracking the environmental impact of IT workloads. This is prompting organizations to reevaluate workload placement, choosing data centers based not only on cost and performance but also on carbon footprint and regulatory compliance.\n\n\n\nLessons from SAP Cloud Implementations\n\nCloud migration is not just a matter of transferring existing systems to a new hosting environment, but requires a reexamination of business processes. Companies that use the transition as an opportunity to modernize workflows see greater operational improvements.\n\nA phased migration approach has proven to be more reliable than attempting a large-scale transition in one step. By moving non-essential systems first, organizations can establish best practices, identify potential risks, and refine security measures before shifting core ERP functions. This also minimizes downtime and reduces the risk of unexpected disruptions.\n\nAs enterprises continue to shift SAP workloads to the cloud, consultants play an increasingly strategic role in guiding clients through planning, execution, and long-term system management.\n\nA foundational best practice is conducting a comprehensive assessment of the client\u2019s IT landscape before making recommendations on cloud strategy. This includes evaluating whether an organization is best suited for a greenfield, brownfield, or selective migration model, as well as determining the appropriate mix of public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.\n\nAdvising clients on resource provisioning, pricing models, and workload scheduling helps avoid inefficiencies that can drive up operational expenses. Many businesses benefit from adopting reserved instances for predictable workloads, while dynamic scaling strategies are more suitable for applications with fluctuating demand.\n\nSecurity and compliance must be addressed early in the cloud migration process. Consultants should assist clients in defining identity and access management policies, configuring encryption mechanisms, and establishing security monitoring protocols. A well-structured governance model ensures that SAP workloads remain protected while meeting regulatory requirements specific to the organization\u2019s industry and geographic operations.\n\nConsultants can introduce process automation solutions that reduce manual intervention in system administration, monitoring, and compliance reporting. Automated security audits, self-healing infrastructure capabilities, and machine learning-driven operational insights, can all improve the efficiency and reliability of SAP environments.\n\n\n\nSAP Consulting in a Cloud-First Landscape\n\nCloud-based SAP solutions are redefining the expectations placed on consultants. Consultants must now expand their expertise to include cloud infrastructure, data security, automation, and cost optimization. This requires continuous professional development, as cloud-based SAP deployments demand skills that extend beyond standard ERP implementation.\n\nSAP Business Technology Platform is becoming an essential component, acting as a central hub for integration, workflow automation, and application development. Consultants who specialize in this platform will be more able to help clients build modular, extensible SAP environments that connect with both SAP and non-SAP applications.\n\nOrganizations migrating SAP workloads to the cloud need expert guidance on configuring security controls that align with industry regulations and organizational policies. Consultants with expertise in cloud security frameworks, compliance automation, and threat detection technologies will play a key role in securing SAP deployments.\n\nCloud certifications are increasingly relevant for SAP consultants seeking to validate their expertise. Certifications such as AWS Certified: SAP on AWS, Microsoft Azure: SAP on Azure, and Google Cloud Professional SAP Architect provide formal recognition of consultants\u2019 ability to design and optimize SAP workloads on hyperscaler platforms.\n\nBeyond technical skills, SAP consultants must develop financial knowledge related to cloud economics. The shift from capital expenditure to operational expenditure requires organizations to rethink how SAP deployments are budgeted and optimized. Consultants who understand cloud pricing models, workload rightsizing, and cost-reduction strategies will be valuable advisors for clients.\n\nFor SAP consultants, the ability to guide clients through cloud migration, cost governance, and security implementation is now as important as traditional ERP configuration skills.\n\nCloud adoption in the SAP ecosystem is now the foundation of modern enterprise IT strategy. The consultants who succeed will be those who develop expertise in cloud-native SAP architectures, AI-driven automation, financial modeling for cloud deployments, and regulatory compliance for distributed IT environments.\n\nAs businesses continue to refine their SAP strategies, consultants will remain at the center of transformation efforts, contributing to a new era of enterprise technology.\n\nIf you are an SAP professional looking for a new role in the SAP ecosystem our team of dedicated recruitment consultants can match you with your ideal employer and negotiate a competitive compensation package for your extremely valuable skills, so join our exclusive community at IgniteSAP.",

We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\n\nThe Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit\n\nFor anyone who wants to understand SAP's profit beyond the statutory numbers, it's important to note that during the last twelve months statutory profit was reduced by \u20ac3.5b due to unusual items. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. SAP took a rather significant hit from unusual items in the year to December 2024. All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit look worse than its underlying earnings power.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On SAP's Profit Performance\n\nAs we discussed above, we think the significant unusual expense will make SAP's statutory profit lower than it would otherwise have been. Because of this, we think SAP's underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. For example, we've discovered that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of SAP.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of SAP's profit.

            "content": "At Tadano, the sky is often the limit in the proverbial sense: for around 75 years, the lifting machines and cranes from the Japan-based group of companies have played an important role in the construction of high-rise office buildings, highways and wind turbines around the world. The company is proud of its hoists, which are designed to work reliably even under the toughest operating conditions. With sites in Zweibr\u00fccken and Lauf an der Pegnitz, and around 1800 employees, Tadano is also represented in Germany. The sites are regarded as competence centers for the development and production of Tadano all-terrain, city and crawler cranes. This presence is the result of the earlier acquisition of two crane manufacturers - Faun and Demag.\n\nAs part of the integration of Demag into the Tadano Group, the \"One ERP\" project was launched in October 2020 to harmonize the ERP systems of the two locations into a consistent whole and make them fit for future requirements. The harmonization project not only put the ERP and SAP systems of the two locations to the test, but also the corresponding processes. The overarching goal: seamless coordination and collaboration between all upstream and downstream processes and functions.\n\nIn focus: parts list management\n\nBOM management emerged as one of the focal points: in view of the data complexity at Tadano, efficient handling of this was crucial for ensuring quality, costs and efficiency. Until then, the German sites had operated on the basis of the single BOM approach: design and production managed all BOM data and information in one BOM. One challenge for everyone was the fact that both sides had different process-related requirements in terms of the structure, scope and type of information that the BOMs should contain. Complex coordination processes and conflicts were inevitable.\n\nGuided structure synchronization\n\nThe envisaged solution: a change from a single BOM approach in BOM management to an eBOM (engineering BOM) and mBOM (manufacturing BOM) approach, i.e. the creation of design and manufacturing BOMs. This was intended to take optimum account of the function-oriented design and process-oriented manufacturing view of the products. SAP GSS was chosen as the technological solution to support this scenario: with \"Guided Structure Synchronization\" (GSS), source structures from one application area, such as design, can be transferred to target structures in another application area, such as manufacturing.\n\nGSS supports a continuous synchronization process, takes the change of structures into account with each synchronization and updates the target structure. This means that not only the BOM separation, but also the handover to manufacturing should be optimally addressed. The eBOM and mBOM approach at Tadano was not only linked to purely operational requirements. The change was also intended to support overarching, strategic goals: greater process efficiency through better process flow in design and production; improved time to market through faster and better quality results in both areas; and improved collaboration through greater autonomy of the teams in design and production. This should also minimize process costs in the company as a whole.\n\n\n\n\"We knew our challenges and had a clear objective in terms of technology and results. But it was also clear that we needed a strong partner to guide us through the implementation and migration process,\" explains Thorsten Hemmer, IT Project Manager. \"We were familiar with the expertise of Coristo (a subsidiary of Cenit) in the field of SAP GSS, and so we came together directly,\" adds Thorsten Hemmer.\n\n\"It was important to us that our colleagues accepted the tool. After all, with the dissolution of the single BOM approach and the introduction of eBOM and mBOM lists, a rethink was necessary.\"\n\nThorsten HemmerIT Project Manager, Tadano\n\n\n\nDespite the leap of faith, Coristo carried out a feasibility study to prove the viability of specific aspects. Hemmer explains: \"Before the start of the project, three main challenges emerged for us: the creation of different lists, i.e. mBOM and eBOM, from a single BOM and the migration of the data to the new architecture. In addition, we were working with parameter-valid valuations in the BOM. However, this functionality is not standard in SAP GSS. From a technological point of view, it was therefore necessary to prove that this aspect could also be implemented.\"\n\nFour waves to the result\n\nIn order to implement the planned introduction and migration project in the best possible way in terms of technology and processes, the process was divided into four project phases, or \"four waves\" as the project participants called them. Each wave included goals and milestones to be achieved. The main focus of the first wave was on the conceptual aspect: \"It was essentially about preparing the introduction of SAP GSS and the precise definition of the corresponding tool functionalities,\" recalls Thorsten Hemmer.\n\nDuring this phase, the eBOM-mBOM process was also examined in detail - in particular the process definition and the identification of critical use cases at Tadano. An important process stage for all those involved was the migration of the BOMs, which was the subject of the second process wave: this was the actual introduction of an eBOM-mBOM separation at Tadano. Among other things, it was important to consider the specific constellations between eBOM and mBOM when creating the mapping, the software and process-related support of the migration concept and the consolidation of the eBOMs and mBOMs in the target system. \"The migration was an intensive topic for six months,\" explains Christian Markus, Senior PLM Consultant at Coristo. This phase was crucial to the success of the overall project.\n\nThe subsequent testing, a detailed examination of the use cases in the overall process, marked the third phase of the project. Here, the experts from Tadano and Coristo focused on the definition of specific test cases, the testing itself and the subsequent documentation. The declared aim of this phase was to optimize defined processes and tools. Central use cases, such as mass changes, corresponding applications, scenarios for split positions and their conflict handling, came under increased scrutiny.\n\nDuring testing, further requirements and specifications gradually emerged, which also had to be incorporated into the software solution. \"In this case, too, we relied heavily on Coristo's expertise and advice. Implementing the GSS is not enough. The software had to be enabled separately for specific requirements and use cases,\" says Thorsten Hemmer. \"We actually did a lot of development work on the GSS solution. We intervened in the functions of the solution at relevant points and flanked them with corresponding reports.\n\nThis was in order to optimally record the processes relating to the parts lists and their monitoring at Tadano. 70 to 80 percent of the adjustments related to users and processes,\" summarizes Christian Markus. As people as users play a decisive role in the success of the project, the project team paid particular attention to training and \"taking along\" the future users of SAP GSS. It was not just about introducing a new BOM type, but also about the fact that the maintenance of production BOMs was historically anchored in the design department. With the migration to the eBOM-mBOM scenario, this activity was transferred to the work preparation department. Not only did processes change, but also the distribution of tasks in the processes.\n\nFocus on the user\n\n\"It was important to us that our colleagues accept the tool. After all, with the dissolution of the single BOM approach and the introduction of eBOM and mBOM lists, a rethink was necessary. At the same time, this new way of thinking also had to be implemented in a new tool. In this change process, topics such as acceptance and usability were extremely important for us,\" confirms Thorsten Hemmer.\n\nThe go-live of SAP GSS and the eBOM-mBOM concept followed around a year after the start of the collaboration between Tadano and Coristo. Thanks to the detailed project preparation and implementation carried out in advance, the project team achieved a first-time-right result. \"We then supported Tadano in hypercare mode for around two months and are still active in an advisory capacity in day-to-day business. We continue to work together on process and tool improvements, albeit without the pressure of a go-live,\" summarizes Christian Markus.\n\nParts list separation and SAP GSS\n\nAround 15 months after the introduction, we are interested in the current status of the GSS and bill of materials: Have the expectations of the project been met, have the goals been achieved? \"The benefits of introducing SAP GSS and BOM separation extend far beyond the technological innovation: as a BOM is the linchpin of our products, the introduction of eBOM and mBOM has been central to future-proof production and is now an important component. Everything that comes from the design department has to go through SAP GSS,\" is Hemmer's initial summary.\n\nHowever, he emphasizes that change management naturally also affected the processes after the go-live. \"In addition to the software and process expertise, the active involvement of all affected departments from the outset was important for the success of the project, especially work preparation,\" continues Thorsten Hemmer. The introduction of SAP GSS meant an enormous change for the design, production and work preparation departments. Today, however, SAP GSS is indispensable and is one of the core pillars of production.\n\nOne of the other results: In regular operation, the teams benefit from a significant reduction in technological and process-related interfaces. On the one hand, this clearly benefits the overarching \"One ERP\" principle, the one ERP system used company-wide. On the other hand, the teams involved recognize that it is not only the separation of structures that brings degrees of freedom and qualitative improvements, but also the fact that clear role assignments now exist in accordance with the structures.\n\nOne example: \"By separating eBOM and mBOM, releases from the design department can be separated from the run-in time of a change in production. Both departments can now work more efficiently with less coordination effort,\" says Thorsten Hemmer. However, around a year and a half after the go-live, the company has actually reached the point where it can practically experience the benefits of the project. It is only now that processes are right, improvements can take effect and advantages can be expanded.",

            "content": "Just moments after highlighting the greatest quarterly financial results in SAP\u2019s legendary 53-year history, CEO Christian Klein teased what might be the company\u2019s most-ambitious product launch ever as SAP plans to jump into the red-hot data-cloud category to fuel a sharply expanding portfolio of Joule AI agents.\n\nAs I described last week in \u201cSAP Crushes Q4 as Total Cloud Backlog Soars 43% to $65.8 Billion,\u201d SAP is dramatically outperforming all of the other major enterprise-apps vendors. And with the announcements it intends to make at its Feb. 13 \u201cBusiness Unleashed\u201d event, Klein is looking to unveil a slate of data and AI products and services that will make it simpler and faster for customers to harness the full power of their data and drive tangible ROI and business outcomes with agentic AI.\n\nOn SAP\u2019s Oct. 28 Q4 earnings call, Klein teased the new innovations in a narrative that connected thorny data and tech challenges that have bedeviled businesses for decades with the bracing possibilities and opportunities that AI agents seem fully capable of handling.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I can\u2019t wait to launch a game-changing innovation very soon that will give us a great boost in the data and AI space,\u201d Klein said at the end of his opening remarks on the earnings call.\n\n\u201cToday, many companies spend up to 50% of their IT budget on data and analytics. But despite all that investment, many companies still fall short of realizing the potential of their data. All too often, data is locked in silos or stuck in so-called data swarms without any business context,\u201d Klein said, resulting in fragmented \u2014 and frustrating \u2014 views of what\u2019s happening across their organizations.\n\nAnd while those data limitations and shortcomings have always been a drag on businesses and the IT organizations charged with overcoming them, those challenges are taking on even greater significance today because their continued presence will sharply limit the contributions that AI agents can make.\n\n\u201cCompanies have no complete view of their business that way and without access to high-quality data, AI agents stay far below their potential as well,\u201d Klein said, tossing in the old truism about \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will address these challenges in the data and AI space with one of the biggest innovations SAP has ever delivered,\u201d Klein said.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\n\u201cWe will harmonize structured and unstructured data, as well as SAP and non-SAP data \u2014 always with the relevant semantics,\u201d which will in turn \u201cmake AI agents much more powerful.\u201d\n\nAt the top of the stack for SAP\u2019s new vision is Joule, originally launched 15 months ago as an AI assistant but subsequently overhauled by SAP to become an autonomous agent.\n\n\u201cJoule will become the super-orchestrator of these agents, carrying out complete tasks autonomously on an end-to-end basis while also taking over significant workloads from humans,\u201d Klein said.\n\nSAP\u2019s primary data offering is currently Datasphere, which the company has described as a business-data fabric. I expect SAP will position the new offering to be unveiled at the Feb. 13 right up against Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud, which Marc Benioff has described as not only the fastest-growing product in the company\u2019s history but also an absolutely indispensable ingredient powering the company\u2019s Agentforce services that Benioff says represent the future of how business will operate in the near future.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

This will only accelerate in 2025, as we target a total of 400 embedded AI use cases which will boost productivity by up to 30% for the top personas in our applications. This level of adoption underlines the value organisations across Asia are realising from Business AI right now.\u201d\n\nValue from Business AI\n\nNTT DATA Inc, one of the world\u2019s leading technology and business services companies, chose RISE with SAP alongside SAP Business AI, SAP Business Technology Platform, and SAP Signavio to transform its business.\n\nCommenting on the news, the company stated: \u201cNTT DATA Inc., a global leader in digital business and IT services, has selected RISE with SAP to replace its existing ERP landscape legacy which includes SAP and non-SAP ERP systems. RISE with SAP will provide NTT Data Inc. a unified, consolidated approach that will help streamline operations, enhance efficiency across business processes and embrace innovation.\u201d\n\nIn India, automotive parts manufacturer Premium Transmission Limited chose GROW with SAP and SAP Business AI. Ashok Leyland India, one of the biggest manufacturers of commercial vehicles in India, chose SAP Business AI, SAP Datasphere, and SAP Analytics Cloud as part of its RISE with SAP journey.\n\nITC Limited, a leading Indian conglomerate with focuses in FMCG, paper, packaging, and IT, complemented SAP S/4HANA with SAP Business AI, SAP Business Technology Platform, and SAP SuccessFactors. And in Australia, SA Power Networks chose RISE with SAP with SAP Business AI and SAP SuccessFactors.\n\nBusiness across APJ go-live with cloud transformation\n\nQ4 also saw continued evidence of cloud momentum across Asia Pacific and Japan, with a range of go-lives and new customers.\n\nOne of Australia\u2019s leading retailers with more than 120,000 staff, Coles went lives with RISE with SAP in Q4. The company said, \u201cWe are happy to announce Coles Supermarkets went live on RISE with SAP, setting the foundation for an enhanced digital transformation agenda in 2025.\n\nTrent Limited, one of India\u2019s leading retail businesses operating six fashion brands, noted, \u201cThe migration to SAP RISE is just the beginning. We are excited about the future possibilities that this platform offers. By leveraging the advanced analytics and automation capabilities, we can further optimise our business operations and drive growth. SAP Cloud Success Services further helps in seamless migration and adoption from first use to full use.\u201d\n\nAdditional RISE with SAP wins and go-lives included Hyundai Glovis, Roy Hill, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Limited, Hokkaido Electric Power Co., Sterlite Power Transmission, NTPC Limited, Ventia, and Daewoong Pharmaceuticals Co.\n\nSAP also announced Japan\u2019s Tosoh Corporation and the Korean social ecosystem, Underdogs, chose SAP S/4HANA Cloud in Q4.\n\nSustainable innovation\n\nSAP has also seen ongoing growth for its sustainability solutions.\n\nIn India, Vedanta Limited chose SAP Sustainability Footprint Management and SAP Business Technology Platform to drive sustainability goals.\n\nAnd in Thailand, one of the world\u2019s leading food and agro-industrial businesses, Charoen Pokphand Foods Ltd (CPF), has gone-live with SAP sustainability solutions. The company said, \u201cIn October 2024, CPF successfully went live with SAP Environment Management, SAP Sustainability Footprint Management, SAP Sustainability Control Tower, and SAP Analytics Cloud. This platform enables all CPF operations to trace, track, and report materials from its source to the factory. The platform also transparently collects data and calculates Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions under the SBTi standard, ensuring compliance with future audits.\u201d\n\nRemarking on a successful year, Marriott concluded, \u201cFrom AI to cloud to sustainability, it\u2019s clear that companies across Asia Pacific continue to choose SAP to drive true business value. As we enter 2025, SAP will continue to put our customers at the centre by focusing on an AI-first, suite-first strategy to empower resilience, innovation, and new revenues.\u201d",

Hollywood's larger-than-life portrayals of AI catastrophe, while cinematically compelling, obscure a more nuanced reality: the genuine risk lies not in AI itself, but in failing to harness its potential.\n\nThis parallel extends to climate change. Though we're unlikely to witness the theatrical extremes of some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest blockbusters, dismissing climate risks would be equally misguided. While neither AI nor climate change has manifested in Hollywood's extreme scenarios, climate reality is encroaching on cinema's doorstep \u2013 as evidenced by the recent devastating wildfires that swept through Sunset Boulevard, leaving much of Hollywood and northern Los Angeles in ruins.\n\nContinue reading here.",

The main objective will be organizing data in a way that truly powers these agents.\n\n01:08 \u2014 On the earnings call, while discussing this major announcement, CEO Christian Klein stated that currently, 50% of IT budgets go to the vast field of data and analytics. Yet the outcomes are not what they should be. Klein emphasized that this initiative will integrate structured and unstructured data, both SAP and non-SAP data, enabling AI agents to leverage it effectively.\n\n02:16 \u2014 Klein stated that Joule will serve as the orchestrator of these agents. Looking at a major competitor, Salesforce, its Data Cloud is, according to CEO Marc Benioff, the fastest-growing product its ever had. The new Agentforce AI agents tie directly into this Data Cloud, allowing data to be connected from multiple sources.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\n03:12 \u2014 SAP\u2019s move could be a huge breakthrough for customers, allowing them to tap into data that has, until now, been hard to get at. We are seeing a hyper-evolution among the major companies traditionally called enterprise applications companies. Of course, they are still apps companies, but they are also data companies, AI companies, agent companies, orchestrators, and platform companies.\n\n04:04 \u2014 We may need to start looking at this landscape in a new way. We\u2019ll see what comes up here in about 10 days on February 13 when SAP makes its announcement. This should be very interesting, and it continues to raise the bar in the ferocious competition of the Cloud Wars Top 10.",

SAP\u2019s CFO, Dominik Asam, stated that the need for reliable sustainability data and analysis tools will remain strong, especially with growing investor focus on the issue. This comes as the US formally announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, a decision set to take effect in January 2026.\n\nDespite the shifting political landscape, Asam remains optimistic about the future of sustainability initiatives. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, he spoke with many investors who continue to show strong interest in sustainability efforts. SAP is focusing on its Green Ledger software, which aims to make sustainability reporting as verifiable as financial reporting. This will become a requirement under the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in 2028.\n\nWhile currently used mainly by SAP and chemical company Covestro, the software is expected to see broader adoption.

But leadership isn\u2019t about avoiding challenges\u2014it\u2019s about responding to them with reflection, collaboration, and decisive action.\n\nSetbacks can be turned into success by using three strategies to respond to roadblocks. Image: Getty\n\nThe first month of the year can be brutal. Just as plans are set in motion, challenges strike. A key client unexpectedly terminates a partnership. A top-performing team member resigns just as you launch a critical project. A new initiative fails to gain traction. Add economic instability, geopolitical tensions, and natural disasters and even the most seasoned leaders can feel their confidence shaken.\n\nSetbacks can sap the energy and optimism of a new year. But leadership isn\u2019t about avoiding challenges\u2014it\u2019s about responding to them with reflection, collaboration, and decisive action. These early roadblocks don\u2019t have to define your 2025. Instead, they can be catalysts for growth, equipping you with the insights needed to navigate uncertainty with greater clarity and confidence.\n\nHere are three proven strategies to turn setbacks into stepping stones for success.\n\n1. Reflect and Learn: See the Lesson, Not Just the Loss\n\nWhen a setback hits, the instinct is to react fast\u2014fix the problem, reassure stakeholders, and move on. But rushing past reflection leads to missed insights and repeated mistakes. Strong leadership starts with pausing to ask the hard questions and extracting meaningful takeaways from adversity.\n\nLeadership expert May Samali advises success is about seeing the lesson, not just the loss. Image: Human Leadership Lab\n\nKeep a failure journal to document key setbacks. After each challenge, capture what happened, why it happened, and what needs to change. Use these five prompts to extract valuable lessons:\n\nCheck in with yourself. Ask, \u201cHow do I feel about this setback?\u201d Naming emotions\u2014frustration, guilt, uncertainty\u2014helps you process the situation with self-awareness and empathy. Understanding your emotional response also prevents knee-jerk decisions driven by stress.\n\nAsk, \u201cHow do I feel about this setback?\u201d Naming emotions\u2014frustration, guilt, uncertainty\u2014helps you process the situation with self-awareness and empathy. Understanding your emotional response also prevents knee-jerk decisions driven by stress. Map the chain of events. Document the sequence that led to the setback. What decisions or actions contributed? Were there warning signs you missed? Did you make any wrong assumptions? Identifying patterns helps prevent future missteps.\n\nDocument the sequence that led to the setback. What decisions or actions contributed? Were there warning signs you missed? Did you make any wrong assumptions? Identifying patterns helps prevent future missteps. Identify controllable factors. Was the setback due to execution errors or external forces? If internal, what can you adjust immediately? If external, how can you better prepare next time? This analysis enables proactive problem-solving rather than reactive firefighting.\n\nWas the setback due to execution errors or external forces? If internal, what can you adjust immediately? If external, how can you better prepare next time? This analysis enables proactive problem-solving rather than reactive firefighting. Categorise the failure. Dr. Amy Edmondson, an expert on organisational learning, identifies three types of failure. Intelligent failures stem from thoughtful risks that provide valuable insights, such as testing a new strategy that doesn\u2019t pan out but reveals useful customer feedback. Execution failures result from preventable mistakes, like miscommunication leading to project delays. Systemic failures indicate broader organisational issues, such as unclear goals or flawed decision-making structures.\n\nDr. Amy Edmondson, an expert on organisational learning, identifies three types of failure.

Execution failures result from preventable mistakes, like miscommunication leading to project delays. Systemic failures indicate broader organisational issues, such as unclear goals or flawed decision-making structures. Extract actionable lessons. Translate your insights into tangible actions. For example: \u201cOur product launch failed because we skipped focus group testing. Next time, we\u2019ll validate messaging earlier.\u201d This ensures setbacks become learning opportunities rather than repeated mistakes.\n\n2. Connect and Collaborate: Don\u2019t Solve in Isolation\n\nLeadership isn\u2019t about having all the answers. Tackling setbacks alone can amplify blind spots and delay solutions. Instead, engage your network\u2014both internal and external\u2014to gain fresh perspectives and share ownership of solutions. Strong networks foster innovation, resilience, and support during difficult times.\n\nConnection and collaboration can help turn problems into successful solutions. Image: Getty\n\nHere\u2019s how to turn collaboration into a problem-solving superpower:\n\nSeek support from peers and mentors. Reach out to peers who have faced similar challenges. Be specific: \u201cI\u2019m navigating [specific challenge]. I remember you dealt with something similar\u2014how did you approach it?\u201d Trusted advisors can offer insights and emotional support. Even informal conversations with a mentor can yield valuable strategies.\n\nReach out to peers who have faced similar challenges. Be specific: \u201cI\u2019m navigating [specific challenge]. I remember you dealt with something similar\u2014how did you approach it?\u201d Trusted advisors can offer insights and emotional support. Even informal conversations with a mentor can yield valuable strategies. Hold a team post-mortem. Create a safe space to review setbacks. Start by sharing what you, as a leader, could have done differently. This fosters trust and shifts the focus from blame to solutions. Ask your team, \u201cWhat worked well that we should continue? What didn\u2019t go as planned? What\u2019s one change we can implement immediately?\u201d\n\nCreate a safe space to review setbacks. Start by sharing what you, as a leader, could have done differently. This fosters trust and shifts the focus from blame to solutions. Ask your team, \u201cWhat worked well that we should continue? What didn\u2019t go as planned? What\u2019s one change we can implement immediately?\u201d Get outside your echo chamber. Seek feedback from unexpected sources\u2014a junior team member, a client, or even friends outside your industry. Fresh perspectives can reveal overlooked solutions and reframe your thinking. A simple question like, \u201cWhat do you see that I might be missing?\u201d can uncover transformative insights.\n\n3. Reignite Momentum: Focus on Small Wins\n\nSetbacks can feel paralysing. The key to regaining control isn\u2019t sweeping changes but small, deliberate actions that rebuild confidence and re-energise your team. Taking intentional, manageable steps restores a sense of agency and direction.\n\nHere\u2019s how to restart momentum after a setback:\n\nIdentify one immediate action. Instead of overhauling everything at once, pick a single step forward. If sales are down, don\u2019t rewrite the entire strategy overnight. Start by reconnecting with one key client or refining one aspect of your sales pitch. If a project is stuck, clear a bottleneck\u2014revise timelines or reassign tasks. Tackling one issue at a time builds traction and prevents overwhelm.\n\nReinforcing a learning mindset is key to reigniting momentum and achieving success. Image: Getty\n\nTrack and celebrate progress. Use visible tools\u2014checklists, Kanban boards, whiteboards\u2014to showcase incremental wins. Publicly acknowledge progress in team meetings. Highlighting success keeps morale high and reinforces that setbacks are temporary. Recognising effort strengthens team cohesion and motivation.\n\nUse visible tools\u2014checklists, Kanban boards, whiteboards\u2014to showcase incremental wins. Publicly acknowledge progress in team meetings. Highlighting success keeps morale high and reinforces that setbacks are temporary. Recognising effort strengthens team cohesion and motivation. Reinforce a learning mindset. Encourage a culture where setbacks are seen as learning opportunities rather than failures. Share stories of past challenges that led to major breakthroughs. This shift in perspective fosters innovation and prevents risk aversion.\n\nLeadership Is Defined by Your Response\n\nSetbacks are inevitable. But they don\u2019t have to derail your goals. The way you respond defines your leadership. Developing a structured approach to overcoming obstacles ensures long-term success.\n\nLeadership Reset Checklist:\n\nReflect and Learn: Identify emotions, map events, categorise failures, and extract lessons.\n\nConnect and Collaborate: Engage your team and external allies to gain fresh insights and share solutions.\n\nReignite Momentum: Take small, targeted actions to restore confidence and drive progress.\n\nAs I often remind the leaders I work with: Being a leader isn\u2019t about being superhuman\u2014it\u2019s about embracing your humanity. It\u2019s not the setback that defines you, but how you pick yourself up, adapt, and lead forward.\n\nSo, what\u2019s one step you\u2019ll take today to turn things around?\n\nMay Samali is the Founder and CEO of Human Leadership Lab, a global leadership development company.

            "content": "As reported by several media outlets and confirmed by SAP CEO Christian Klein during its Q4 2024 earnings call, SAP will offer an additional three years of support for some on-premises ERP (enterprise resource planning) customers beyond the existing extended maintenance support of 2030. This news came as a surprise for many ERP customers globally who have been struggling to plan and complete their ECC to S/4HANA migrations under the RISE with SAP offering before the end of 2027, which is the current mainstream maintenance end date. Many of these customers potentially would not have completed the move even by the end of 2030, the extended maintenance end date.\n\nWhile there has been steady adoption of S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition under RISE with SAP, there were no strong indicators that this adoption was accelerating at a higher rate. Two core reasons contributing to this:\n\nThere\u2019s significant costs and time associated with the sheer amount of massive transformation and systems migration undertaking. Some customers, struggling with budget issues while running a business under the current tough macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical instability, had reservations about the extended time that it would take them to realize the ROI on the migration investment.\n\nThe other aspect hampering a higher rate of adoption of S/4HANA is the complex technical and third-party applications landscape that is closely tied with the customers\u2019 ERP systems \u2014 each with their own end-of-support deadlines, migration costs, licensing complexity, and technical interdependency with different version of the ERP systems\u2019 underlying tech stack. This makes the case for easy and fast S/4HANA migration severely constrained for customers, even when they engage highly mature systems integrators to assist with multiyear migration programs.\n\nSAP has recognized these challenges by what appears to be a selective extension of support \u2014 with conditions. Details of the new support announcement are as follows:\n\nIn the first half of 2025, SAP will announce a cloud subscription transition option designed for ERP customers with large and very complex IT landscapes who need more time to transform on their RISE with SAP journey and move to S/4HANA.\n\nThis option, the SAP ERP private-edition transition option, will consist of an SAP ERP cloud subscription, complemented with services designed to facilitate the transition to RISE with SAP and maintain customers\u2019 business continuity.\n\nThe option will be offered for the period from 2031 until the end of 2033.\n\nThe SAP CEO confirmed that this is not a prolongation of the mainstream maintenance for beyond the 2020-communicated deadlines of the end of 2027 and is also not a prolongation of the extended maintenance end-of-2030 deadline.\n\nSAP is to release more information to the market in the first half of 2025, with additional details on the offering.\n\nWhile some media outlets have reported that any customers who sign a RISE with SAP contract are the ones who receive the above offer, Forrester has been unable to confirm these statements, as the official details are still forthcoming. As for now, based on Klein\u2019s answers to investor questions during the earnings call, it is certainly not a blanket offer to all customers who sign up and commit to a RISE with SAP contract but is rather very dependent on certain large-scale customers with highly complex application landscapes and third-party application technical stack footprint dependency that prevents them from effectively moving to S/4HANA faster. SAP appears to be offering the customers an easier pathway to transition these third-party applications to the SAP solutions/product stack. Forrester is looking forward to analyzing this aspect further with the official release of more information from SAP in the coming months.\n\nFor more insights on SAP, S/4HANA cloud transformations, on-premises ERP support, RISE, GROW, or this specific announcement, clients can book time with me (via an inquiry or guidance session).",

It requires synthesizing vast amounts of information \u2014 including customer business needs, industry specifics, technology, and governance \u2014 into actionable insights.\n\nSee how you can benefit from AI built into your core business processes Learn more\n\nAt SAP, we\u2019ve harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and other data-driven technologies to revolutionize customer support, turning it into a seamless, efficient, and value-added experience.\n\nThe Evolution of the Knowledge Economy\n\nBeyond resolving everyday challenges, we continue to serve our customers as true business partners, collaborating with them to help them achieve their broader business goals. While we live in a knowledge economy, where economic value is derived from that knowledge and how we apply it, this paradigm is changing. As humans, our role in the economy is evolving as AI systems increasingly replicate human cognitive skills \u2014 retrieving and using the right knowledge at the right time.\n\nIn this new paradigm, success will be determined not by how much you know, but by how effectively you can allocate and manage resources to get work done. In customer support, this means moving from simply resolving issues to orchestrating AI tools and human expertise to deliver optimal outcomes.\n\nAI, including generative AI, becomes a collaborative partner, enabling support teams to allocate resources efficiently and focus on higher-value tasks. Recognizing this paradigm shift, we go beyond resolving everyday challenges and serve our customers as true business partners, collaborating with them to help them achieve their broader business goals \u2014 as the world changes.\n\nAI Is the Perfect Partner for Customer Support Transformation\n\nAt SAP, AI is built into core business processes of customers, connecting finance, supply chain, procurement, sales, marketing, human resources, and IT. Data-driven technologies such as AI, robotic process automation (RPA), and process mining elevate support experiences for our customers. They do it by simplifying support access, addressing complex scenarios using AI agents, and enhancing automation to increase efficiency while delivering personalized solutions, as well as taking advantage of system metrics and process insights.\n\nThe Customer Support & Cloud Lifecycle Management organization at SAP also drives AI innovation to analyze process metrics collected from the customer\u2019s systems to evaluate efficiency, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement; improve processes using domain-specific machine learning models; and build AI solutions that can be integrated into applications used in a business process or scenario.\n\nGenerative AI: Elevating Customer Support\n\nGenerative AI has been a game-changer for customer support. It empowers our support teams by enhancing the quality and speed of outcomes and enabling more personalized recommendations for customers. It also opens new possibilities for orchestrating AI services in combination with AI agents.\n\nAI agents streamline support processes by automating time-consuming tasks, such as retrieving and assessing information, while enabling human-machine collaboration. This allows support professionals to focus on improving both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.\n\nReal-World Impact: AI Use Cases in Customer Support\n\nSAP has developed more than 50 AI-driven use cases, showcasing the transformative power of AI in customer support.

Process insights guide ongoing refinements and enhancements.\n\nAnd the numbers speak for themselves: SAP\u2019s AI support scenarios are called up more than 1 million times by our customers on an average day. More than 35,000 end users use our AI capabilities per month.\n\nThe Road Ahead: Human-Machine Collaboration in Support\n\nThe future of customer support lies in human-machine collaboration. By combining the analytical power of AI with human expertise, we can deliver unparalleled support experiences. AI agents will play a pivotal role in this transformation, assisting with things like ticket triage, data analysis, and troubleshooting, thereby enabling support teams to focus on strategic activities. As AI continues to evolve, these agents will become even more capable of providing real-time insights and proactive solutions to anticipate customer needs before they arise.\n\nSAP\u2019s commitment to AI-driven innovation ensures that we remain at the forefront of customer support transformation. By continuously evolving our AI capabilities, we are setting the stage for a new era of value-driven, scalable, and efficient customer support.\n\nBut there is one thing that AI will never replace: the empathy, care, and passion of our support teams, ensuring every customer feels supported as we solve their challenges together.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against Morgan Stanley's other European AI stocks.\n\nIn August last year, investment bank Morgan Stanley released an investor note highlighting that even though the chaos around prominent AI firms had somewhat subsided, an AI rumbling in Europe was just about to begin. Analysts at the investment firm compared the AI buzz to historical similarities in the mid-1990s, just before the internet craze. According to Morgan Stanley analysts, European semi stocks were experiencing a tactical correction and would hit new highs in the coming months. The note further detailed that a basket of these equities, handpicked by these experts, and nicknamed AI winners, had returned close to 45% on average since January 2023, the beginning of the AI revolution. These firms had outperformed the 14% jump recorded by the MSCI Europe benchmark, per the research.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn the months since, European AI stocks have experienced significant volatility, most recently influenced by global developments and investor sentiment. A notable event was the introduction of a low-cost AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which raised concerns about the profitability of existing AI companies that rely on expensive chips and infrastructure. This led to a sharp decline in European tech stocks, with the European tech index dropping 5.8%, marking the worst decline since October 2024. However, the market showed resilience shortly after. European shares reached a record high, driven by gains in retail and utilities stocks as tensions in the tech sector subsided. European stock pickers are exploring established sectors such as utilities, professional data providers, and even copper miners to tap into the next wave of AI advancements. This approach reflects a strategic shift towards industries that can support and benefit from AI infrastructure and applications.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected companies based in Europe that have been benefiting from the AI boom.

            "content": "By Bill Brady\n\nChurches across St. Anthony Park and Como have joined an initiative to serve the overflow of asylum-seeking families in the metro who have yet to find stable housing.\n\nLaunched last spring by Interfaith Action of Greater St. Paul, \u201cFaithful Hospitality\u201d works with congregations to offer overnight shelter inside their buildings and provide volunteers to stay with the families. The houses of worship commit to hosting up to 20 adults and children for a month at a time.\n\nThough funded by the state through Hennepin County, close to two dozen Ramsey County sites have participated so far by offering space or providing volunteers. Those include at least five churches in the Park Bugle coverage area: St. Anthony Park Lutheran, St. Anthony Park United Church of Christ, St. Matthews Episcopal, St. Cecelia\u2019s Catholic and St. Timothy Lutheran of Como Park.\n\nSt. Anthony Park Lutheran may be among the most active of the participants, having hosted guest families during four separate months\u2014August, September, November and December. Congregation member Lisa Sackreiter was among the 50-plus volunteers who helped welcome the guests.\n\n\u201cSome nights were very quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cThe guests arrived around 7 p.m. and headed straight to their private rooms (converted classrooms). Other nights were much more social with guests, especially the kids, and volunteers hanging out doing craft projects, playing games, chatting in Spanish or using Google Translate to communicate until bedtime at 9.\n\n\u201cOn weekday mornings families were up and out before 7 a.m. On weekends they stayed until 8.\u201d\n\nDuring the day, family members who aren\u2019t working or going to school are taken to a full-service day center located at Central Presbyterian Church in downtown St. Paul. There, trained social workers from Interfaith Action provide the families with \u201cwraparound\u201d services, including workforce training, legal assistance, language skills, financial classes, family reunification support, a dining room and a day care for preschoolers.\n\nCareful screening of families\n\nAll asylum-seeking families are screened and referred by Hennepin County to ensure they are eligible for the program, with priority given to families with young children who demonstrate a commitment to achieving self-sufficiency.\n\n\u201cFaithful Hospitality is a powerful example of how faith communities can combine compassion and practicality to create lasting change,\u201d said Liliana Letran-Garcia, Interfaith Action\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about providing shelter. It\u2019s about offering a holistic path to self-sufficiency, dignity and hope.\u201d\n\nTrepidation, then exhilaration\n\nWhen the opportunity to host overnight guests was first presented, the St. Timothy congregation had what its pastor, Hans Jorgensen, called \u201cA vibrant mix of responses\u2014excitement, anxiety and of course, lots of questions, ranging from big ones about immigration to nitty-gritty ones about cleaning bathrooms.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the congregation decided to \u201cLean into this thing that made us a little uncomfortable, as a way of listening for God\u2019s living voice.\u201d\n\nThen they met the families.\n\n\u201cOh, my goodness!\u201d Jorgensen recalled with a smile. \u201cThe children stole the hearts of our overnight volunteers, whether blowing bubbles or playing with balls or coloring or crafts. We didn\u2019t know much Spanish, so we learned to be beautifully awkward together. The Google translation app got quite a workout.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he continued, \u201cWe also witnessed the incredibly hard work of the parents, who had come through treacherous miles from Ecuador and Venezuela to make a better life in Minnesota. They worked hard to learn English, to learn how to bank and save and get around on public transportation. We saw the glory of God in these human beings.\u201d\n\nHopeful future\n\nState funding for Faithful Hospitality is set to end in March 2025. Beyond that, the program\u2019s future will depend on securing additional resources. Letran-Garcia says Interfaith Action is \u201chopeful and committed\u201d to finding ways of continuing the program.\n\n\u201cThe need remains significant,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies seeking asylum face unique challenges, making programs like Faithful Hospitality essential to helping them transition to stability and self-sufficiency.\u201d\n\nBill Brady, copy editor for the Park Bugle, also serves on the board of directors for Interfaith Action of Greater St. Paul.\n\nPhoto cutline: St. Anthony Park Lutheran volunteers Breanna Mueller (seated with glasses on left), Molly Breen (standing at back) and Kristin Shardlow (seated in rear at right) mingle with Faithful Hospitality guests on a recent evening at the church.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against other key AI news updates you need to see.\n\nA very adaptable tool, generative artificial intelligence has been used in various fields. As a result, it could develop into a general-purpose technology that can evolve into a machine capable of carrying out any task that a human can. Given that the generative AI market is growing at a compound annual growth rate of 34.20%, according to Research and Markets, it has sparked an arms race between companies and, most recently, between countries.\n\nA week into office, President Donald Trump rolled back Biden-era artificial intelligence safety and security measures. The rollback is part of the new administration\u2019s bid to speed and accelerate generative AI development as the US seeks to win the AI race against China.\n\nTo maintain global leadership in AI technology, \u201cwe must develop AI systems that are free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas,\u201d Trump\u2019s order says.\n\nTrump\u2019s Executive Order overturned President Joe Biden\u2019s 2023 policy, which required AI developers to perform safety testing and report findings to the government prior to releasing systems that could endanger public health, national security, or the economy.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration, the Biden policy \u201cestablished unnecessarily burdensome requirements for companies developing and deploying AI that would stifle private sector innovation and threaten American technological leadership.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Biden executive order demanded that deepfakes be watermarked, that government agencies establish AI testing standards that consider national security threats, and that federal law enforcement and intellectual property regulators change how copyrighted works are used in AI training. The previous administration \u201champered the private sector\u2019s ability to innovate in AI by imposing government control over AI development and deployment,\u201d according to Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nThe removal of the safety and security measures is being portrayed as a floodgate, opening for AI development, which could hasten advancements in the still-emerging field but also present risks. Nevertheless, the Consumer Federation of America and Mozilla have written a letter urging the White House to maintain \u201ckey rules\u201d for transparency and testing in artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWithout guardrails like testing and transparency on an AI system before it\u2019s used \u2014 guardrails so basic that any engineer should be ashamed to release a product without them \u2014 seniors, veterans, and consumers will have their benefits improperly altered and their health endangered,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe call on you to keep key rules about testing and transparency for safety- and rights-impacting AI in place.\u201d\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 36\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP) and its subsidiaries provide applications, technology, and services worldwide. It offers SAP S/4HANA, which includes finance, risk, and project management software capabilities. On January 30th, analysts at JMP Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock while hiking the price target to $330 from $300. The upgrade came on the company delivering stellar financial results driven by strong demand for its artificial intelligence-powered solutions.\n\nThe price hike also comes days after CEO Christina Klein reiterated that DeepSeek AI technology has affirmed the tremendous opportunity for SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) and other enterprise software companies to provide AI-powered solutions. \u201cWhen you are selling software as a service and looking at our strategy, it\u2019s actually good news,\u201d Klein said.\n\nAccording to the executive, the fact that it is possible to come up with AI innovators at a fraction of the cost should eventually benefit enterprise software companies. The CEO also confirmed that they have been testing AI technology and are considering adding DeepSeek to SAP\u2019s AI Hub. Additionally, the company is focused on its growth strategy through the RISE program and is on course to triple support revenue from \u20ac11 billion.\n\nOverall, SAP ranks 6th on our list of key AI news updates you need to see. As we acknowledge the growth potential of SAP, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

This allows partners to effectively communicate the value of SAP solutions, helping customers understand how these tools can address their specific challenges and enhance their businesses.\n\nProduct demos play a crucial role in helping customers visualize the core features and capabilities of SAP solutions. Customers want to see tangible proof of how SAP solutions can solve their pain points and improve their success. However, creating tailored demos that reflect customer needs can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. The new SAP Demo Environment is designed to provide clarity and confidence, simplifying this process and enabling partners to deliver high-quality, relevant demos that resonate with customers.\n\nUsing Live Data to Showcase Real-World Scenarios\n\nThrough the Content Discovery tool, partners can gain free and unlimited access for up to 10 users to an integrated, pre-scripted demo landscape with a continuously updated library of, as of the start of 2025, more than 240 demos to 100 SAP solutions across various landscapes. These turnkey, scripted demos utilize live data to showcase real-world scenarios and processes, allowing to effectively address customer challenges and demonstrate the full potential of SAP solutions. With access to interactive demo scripts, professionals can build their own knowledge and leverage interactive value journeys to explore demos in a click-through format without needing a live system.\n\nDriving Meaningful Business Outcomes in Delivering Value to the Customers\n\nAs many organizations are undergoing digital transformation, the new demo environment is a game-changer. It empowers users to enhance their skills and leverage future-ready demos that can directly address customer\u2019s needs, ultimately helping to drive meaningful business outcomes and foster long-term partnerships.\n\n\u201cThe new SAP Demo Environment 2.0 is a significant leap forward in equipping SAP partners to effectively convey the value of SAP solutions,\u201d says Karl Fahrbach, chief partner officer at SAP. \u201cBy streamlining the demo process with a comprehensive library of cutting-edge demos and interactive demo scripts, partners can double-down on their commitment to innovation excellence, drive customer success, and unlock new opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAndre Bechtold is SVP and head of Solution and Innovation Experience at SAP.",

            "content": "Imagine being in the online queue for a concert you\u2019ve been anxious to get a ticket for. As the countdown progresses, it\u2019s finally your turn. Just when the purchase is about to be completed, the page refreshes endlessly, goes blank, and displays a message that an error has occurred, forcing you to start over. This seems like a minor issue, but when the realization of going back to the end of the queue hits, frustration can quickly overshadow the initial excitement.\n\nFrom the customer\u2019s side, this experience could affect the reliability of future purchases. It could make them think twice before shopping there again, especially if they already had concerns about the difficulties in completing transactions. From the company\u2019s perspective, a website outage implies significant losses, such as direct revenue loss due to a main sales channel being shut down, and a loss of organizational trust, potentially driving customers to competitors.\n\nIn retail and e-commerce business, customer experience is paramount. A company whose e-commerce frequently experiences downtime could receive a negative market reaction from investors.\n\nThese experiences highlight the importance of robust support readiness programs, especially during holiday seasons when businesses strive for more sales and revenue through their digital platforms. With customer expectations at an all-time high, businesses need reliable, scalable, and innovative solutions to deliver exceptional shopping experiences. Proactive support measures can considerably reduce system failures during peak times, which not only reinforces customer satisfaction but also protects organizational trust and revenue. SAP\u2019s holiday support readiness program is designed to address these needs. It offers a strategic, data-driven approach to help businesses thrive during peak periods.\n\nThe holiday support readiness program is a customer experience program by SAP to help safeguard and establish strong support for digital commerce and retail customers during high shopping times. Key features of the program include:\n\n\u200b Comprehensive coverage : It can cover events ranging from Singles Day in China and El Buen Fin in Mexico to Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, and New Year\u2019s.\u200b\n\n: It can cover events ranging from Singles Day in China and El Buen Fin in Mexico to Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, and New Year\u2019s.\u200b Extensive participation : Last year, 143 customers with 200 tenants used SAP\u2019s holiday support readiness program to navigate the holiday rush successfully.\u200b\n\n: Last year, 143 customers with 200 tenants used SAP\u2019s holiday support readiness program to navigate the holiday rush successfully.\u200b Early preparation: Preparation begins 4\u20136 months in advance, involving collaboration among customer support, cloud operations, and product engineering teams.\u200b\n\nDiscover services and support that provide a holistic experience across your organization\u2019s unique digital journey Learn more\n\nThe focus on customer experience has increased due to the expansion of interfaces through which customers interact with companies. In a survey conducted in the European Union in 2023, 70% of respondents bought products or ordered services electronically in the preceding 12 months. For corporations, this online influx depicts a figure of more than US$300 billion in the last quarter of 2024 alone for U.S. retail e-commerce sales. To approach these complexities, companies have steadily turned to advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to strengthen their support systems.\n\nIn 2024, SAP introduced a preventative care model under the transformation blueprint, aimed at delivering predictive, proactive, bi-directional support integrated with AI-driven insights and automation, allowing teams to predict potential problems and address them before they impact customers\u2014and potentially millions of users. SAP\u2019s proprietary AI tools are deployed to help streamline support processes, enhance operational insights, and enable predictive and proactive engagement.\n\nThis represents a pioneering shift in the industry, positioning SAP as a front-runner in AI-driven, predictive, and proactive support solutions. The model provides a comprehensive, 360-degree customer support profile, helping to accelerate issue detection and anticipate potential problems, with AI-integrated features like a virtual support assistant, resource and web traffic predictions, a recommendation engine, case history analysis, issue correlation, and pattern recognition.\n\nTo operationalize this model, SAP leverages collaboration approaches among product engineering teams, cloud operations\u2014database administrators and technical operations managers\u2014technical support, and mission-critical teams to convey comprehensive case analysis reports and detailed recommendations and action plans for each customer. This can allow SAP to identify and resolve future issues before customers are affected, helping to reinforce system stability during peak sales periods. For example, the proactive support process for the 2024 Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales events involved holistic health checks for over 143 customers and 200 production environments, setting a new standard in holiday readiness.\n\nWhen aligned with the organizational strategy, a support program can foster a more positive customer journey, resulting in improved customer loyalty. \u201cThe holiday support readiness program isn\u2019t just about managing the current peak; it\u2019s about preparing for the next one. Our focus on preventative, AI-driven support means that our customers can focus on their business, not on system stability,\u201d says Stefan Steinle, executive vice president and head of Customer Support & CLM at SAP.\n\nFor enterprises, joining the holiday support readiness program can also offer the following advantages:\n\nMinimize downtime : It helps ensure e-commerce platforms are ready when it matters most.\u200b\n\n: It helps ensure e-commerce platforms are ready when it matters most.\u200b Optimize performance : It uses AI and automation to help maintain peak system health and customer satisfaction.\u200b\n\n: It uses AI and automation to help maintain peak system health and customer satisfaction.\u200b Stay ahead: Proactive monitoring and predictive support help keep organizations one step ahead of potential outcomes.\u200b\n\nLooking forward, preparing for upcoming retail peak seasons cannot be overstated. SAP Sapphire in 2025 will hold dedicated sessions to help ensure customers are well-equipped for these challenging periods. From live demos to expert interactions, attendees will be able to witness firsthand how SAP\u2019s tools help keep businesses running smoothly and engage directly with solution experts.\n\nOur commitment at SAP Sapphire in 2025 is to equip customers with the knowledge and tools needed for uninterrupted success during every peak period. The holiday support readiness program is about turning challenges into opportunities for growth. With these resources, businesses will be better prepared to face uncertainties and use favorable circumstances in demanding times, ensuring sustained development and customer satisfaction.\n\nDon\u2019t wait until the next holiday season to find last-minute solutions. Be a part of the holiday support readiness program now and secure your business\u2019s performance for future peak sales periods.",

Each episode provides insights and perspectives around the \u201creimagination machine\u201d that is the cloud.\n\nIn today\u2019s Cloud Wars Minute, I discuss SAP\u2019s impressive Q4 performance, with strong growth in its Cloud ERP suite and a promising outlook for 2025, positioning the company as a cloud leader.\n\nHighlights\n\n00:24 \u2014 SAP released its numbers yesterday for Q4 and the full year. SAP crushed those numbers. The Cloud ERP Suite for Q4 was up 35% to more than $4 billion. This is three straight years, 12 straight quarters, where the Cloud ERP suite has grown at 30% or more and a remarkable achievement on the other side.\n\n01:12 \u2014 Longer term, the total cloud backlog for SAP was up 43% to almost $66 billion. So not only is SAP performing well in the short term for Q4 throughout the year, with strong guidance for 2025, but tied up within that guidance, and perhaps beyond that, is this backlog, which is extraordinary.\n\n01:57 \u2014 Total cloud revenue for Q4 was up 27% to $4.9 billion. For the full year, it was up 25% to $17.8 billion. So this number right here, $17.8 billion, shows the total of all of SAP\u2019s cloud business, which includes a little bit of platform and a very, very tiny bit of infrastructure that it uses for some private cloud applications.\n\n02:41 \u2014 Now, for looking ahead to the full year 2025, SAP said its cloud revenue will grow somewhere between 26% to 28% in 2025, coming out somewhere between $22.5 billion and $22.8 billion for the full year 2025. And no doubt, with the aggressive growth in the cloud that SAP is projecting for 2025, it could be that the cloud revenue in 2025 is more like 55% to 60% of their total revenue.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\n03:37 \u2014 So any lingering impressions that SAP is an on-prem company with a fast-growing cloud business, those are gone. The other point I want to mention here, it\u2019s that SAP\u2019s performance, and broadly we\u2019ll call it the enterprise application spaces\u2014SAP is growing much, much more rapidly than anybody else.\n\n04:48 \u2014 SAP is bullish about the future. It had a great Q4, a great full year. It\u2019s coming into 2025 with a lot of ambition for what\u2019s coming up ahead and a lot of big product evolutions that tie agents in, led by Joule. It will have agents at a high level, orchestrating things, agents running particular tasks. It should be a fun year for SAP and for its customers.",

This includes Workday. Many SMEs have an SAP system in their finance or accounting department. The move to cloud computing has enabled and created new ways of organizing. As a cloud-only provider, Workday has become an important partner to the SAP community.\n\nIn this interview, the focus is on SMEs. In other words, not the very large SAP customers using Workday for HR. Are there any special features? Does Workday differentiate between large industry, DAX companies, and SMEs in the DACH region? Are there differences in the mindset of SMEs and large customers?\n\n\"The answer is yes and no. Both,\" says Alexandra Hartung. \"Because if we look at the size of the company, it is the range of services that we offer via the HR suite mentioned above, but also the financial solutions. We offer the full range of solutions to our midsize customers as well as to our large customers. And that is something that our SME customers really appreciate. Compared to pure SME solution providers, they often say: \"We participate in innovation, maybe in artificial intelligence, digitalization\u2014offerings in this area that the big players can drive much more than a smaller SME can. And we can participate in that across the entire Workday platform.\"\n\nIn the interview with E3, Alexandra Hartung also highlights the differences in how Workday delivers this overall HR solution to midmarket customers. \"In the midmarket team, we also work on a package basis to make it more digestible,\" the Workday manager explains. Companies of this size may not need the entire suite to begin with, but it is important to build a foundation first - an entry-level package that can then grow and scale as the company's needs evolve.\n\nIndustries and solutions\n\nAre there industry-specific differences? For example, Workday has a Professional Services Automation solution specifically for the professional services industry. One element that is used in these companies is project organization and management. The HR department benefits in the long run if the skills of the employees are used in a targeted and efficient way. Project times should be automatically recorded and transferred to the finance department: how are projects billed? \"And this is a solution module that we offer especially in the service sector,\" explains Alexandra Hartung. Especially in medium-sized companies. This is a top-down approach. If Workday takes the experience from the large industry at DAX companies, where these implementations have been in place for many years, then a little bit of experience and know-how also flows into the midmarket.\n\nWorkday is an enterprise platform that helps companies manage their most important assets\u2014their people and their finances. The Workday platform is powered by artificial intelligence to help customers empower people, optimize work, and drive business. Workday is used by more than 10,500 companies around the world and across industries\u2014from the midmarket to more than 60 percent of the Fortune 500. Workday's business model is built on a strong and successful partner community. One of these partners is Kainos.\n\nSebastian R\u00fcting, Territory Vice President Continental at Kainos, joins the E3 discussion. \"You may not know Kainos as a big brand. That's because we are an IT consultancy from beautiful Northern Ireland with 3000 employees, now global. We are a specialist Workday partner. That means we have really focused on it. With over 1,000 consultants, all certified, we can handle implementations of this scale. And accordingly, we also use the launch approach for SMEs,\" explains Sebastian R\u00fcting in the E3 round.\n\nWhat are the learning curves or lessons learned from the big Workday projects? This is exactly the point that Kainos always brings up. \"We are not starting from a greenfield site, but rather with preconfigured systems,\" says Sebastian R\u00fcting. \"This means that business processes are already in place, and we have a role concept. And we bring these approaches for SMEs with us, which makes it easier to implement them accordingly.\n\nIntegration and interfaces\n\nThe ease of access to the system is appealing to future Workday users, as Sebastian R\u00fcting describes: \"The nice thing is that we don't need so much support. The advantage on the Workday side is that we don't need any integration within Workday. All functional areas can talk to each other seamlessly. Now we just have to figure out how to get the right data connections to the outside world\u2014out of Workday, but also back into Workday. And this is where we are not starting from scratch. Workday has already done a lot of the groundwork. So we start with a lot of connectors that we can use as a basis for connecting systems.\u201d\n\nOf course, SAP integration is a bit more difficult, as Sebastian R\u00fcting knows from his professional experience, but there is a connector on the Workday side that takes up to 80 percent of the manual work out of mapping and reconciling fields. This means that incoming and outgoing systems can be connected directly. Whether it is a simple connector to an Active Directory or a single sign-on, it works seamlessly.\n\nAna Mislitchi, Head of Value Management EMEA at Workday, adds to the statement regarding the target audience and the partnership for easy installation: \"At Workday, we define SMEs based on the number of employees: companies with up to 3,500 employees are included. Turnover does not play a role here, unlike with some other providers. We work very closely with partners like Kainos. Even before the contract is signed, we work closely together to understand the company's challenges and find the best solution.\u201d\n\nWorkday partner community\n\nKainos typically provides onsite implementation services. Workday ensures that the teams remain engaged throughout the implementation phase. After go-live, the Workday customer success team continues to support customers for the long term. \"It is important to us that organizations see the value of our solutions and not just own the software,\" said Ana Mislitchi, Head of Value Management EMEA at Workday.\n\nWorkday manager Alexandra Hartung adds: \"This is a critical point. Workday helps companies better align their people strategy with their business goals. For example, we can recruit specialists faster or support strategic decisions such as relocation more efficiently. Workday's central, cloud-based data foundation makes it possible to make informed decisions in real time and make processes more agile overall. \"It is not just a question of technology, but also of how we strategically position HR as a value driver,\" says Alexandra Hartung, who has worked on the project.\n\nAnother key focus of the Workday roundtable was AI, which plays an important role for Workday in both HR and finance. AI is an integral part of every Workday solution, and the cloud provider regularly conducts international studies on the topic. AI is completely reshaping the world of ERP and HR. 81 percent of executives currently surveyed by Workday recognize that it is impacting the skill profile of their jobs. The top three application areas for AI are data analytics, fraud detection and security monitoring, and HR and talent acquisition. In fact, the data reveals a clear trend: as the use of AI grows, skills that only humans possess will become even more important. In 2025, AI will play an important role in unlocking efficiencies in the way HR teams work, but it will not replace essential human aspects such as empathy, communication, and relationship building, explains Ana Mislitchi in the interview with E3.\n\nThe very skills that AI will not have in the foreseeable future are the ones that will be most valuable in the workplace: ethical decision-making, networking and relationship building, emotional intelligence and empathy, and the ability to resolve conflict. It is striking how differently employees and managers view the need for interpersonal relationships in the workplace. While 82 percent of employees believe the need for human interaction will increase, only 65 percent of managers agree, according to Workday's latest research. For managers, this presents an important opportunity to encourage interpersonal interaction and build strong relationships with their team.\n\nWorkday released a global study, \"Elevating Human Potential: The AI Skills Revolution,\" which examines the impact of AI on the job market. The findings contradict the oft-repeated fear that artificial intelligence will replace humans. Rather, AI will act as a catalyst for a re-evaluation of personal skills, making human qualities such as empathy and ethical decision-making the most important assets in the workplace. This tectonic shift is not just about embracing innovative technologies, but about empowering human potential, promoting skills that only humans possess, and redefining what that means in the age of artificial intelligence. The study also surveyed people in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nAI and people management\n\nThe results of the current study underscore the importance of fostering human qualities such as creativity, leadership, learning, trust and collaboration, especially in an AI-driven world. The ERP market is at a tipping point, collectively realizing how much AI will define the future of work and how important human qualities will be in that future\u2014a tipping point towards an AI-driven skills revolution that has the potential to impact everyone in some way, from factory workers to data analysts. This is not just about efficiency and problem solving, but about unleashing the potential to shape a future that prioritizes skills like empathy, ingenuity, and shared humanity. Nearly all active AI users say that the use of artificial intelligence helps them focus on higher-level tasks such as strategy development and problem solving.\n\nworkday.com",

It will, however, add a private cloud subscription transition option for enterprises that need more time to complete their RISE with SAP migration.\n\nIt will, however, add a private cloud subscription transition option for enterprises that need more time to complete their RISE with SAP migration. Transition services are not an extension of on-prem support, but the option will be available to all customers who commit to a RISE with SAP migration beginning in 2031. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave the customers behind,\u201d SAP CEO Christian Klein said. \u201cWe see acceleration in the cloud, but it\u2019s really reaching with a helping hand to a very few large customers who need this offering to fully transform and migrate to the cloud.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSAP is engaged in a delicate dance as it tries to induce customer migrations without pushing them away. The company doubled down on public cloud last year, adding financial incentives and technical support services to the RISE with SAP and GROW with SAP ERP migration programs and spending billions on an organization restructure.\n\nThe ongoing efforts moved the needle as the company\u2019s cloud revenues increased 25% year over year to 17.1 billion euros ($17.8 billion), helping to drive double-digit total revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. \u201cWe more than doubled cloud revenue since 2020 and raised it to half of SAP\u2019s total revenue,\u201d Klein said.\n\nSAP\u2019s cloud ERP suite was a core driver of growth, increasing 34% in 2024 and accounting for 84% of total cloud revenue, according to CFO Dominik Asam, who also spoke during the call.\n\nIn addition to the transition services, SAP plans to expand its RISE with SAP offering this year, adding the LeanIX IT management solution, Signavio business process software suite and WalkMe digital adoption platform to the migration package.\n\nThe company will also introduce licensing options that let customers upgrade cloud solutions \u201cacross the whole SAP business suite, all without additional negotiations,\u201d Klein said.\n\nAs part of SAP\u2019s transformation, the company created a migration division last year helmed by board member Thomas Saueressig, who served as CIO and global head of IT services prior to joining the board in 2019.\n\nSAP also extended Saueressig\u2019s contract by three years and added global CTO to Chief AI Officer Philipp Herzig\u2019s title, the company said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are once again doubling down on AI in 2025,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWe will significantly increase our AI investments with all of our more than 30,000 developers working to enhance our AI foundation and build new use cases.\u201d",

The AI tool was developed by the Chinese startup without using the cutting edge and expensive AI processors demanded by U.S. companies.\n\nDeepSeek Buzz Triggered Tech Sell-off\n\nThe sell-off wiped out roughly half a trillion dollars in Nvidia's market cap, introducing the possibility that companies may not need to spend a fortune on sophisticated Nvidia chips to build AI systems.\n\nThe DeepSeek disruption touched off a debate in a critical and highly-lucrative segment of the tech market, enterprise software.\n\nThe success of the start-up's technology \u2014 and the claim that they did it for a fraction of the cost of other AI innovators \u2014 suggest that it is possible to dramatically reduce the hardware costs in building an AI infrastructure. That could eventually benefit enterprise software companies, SAP's Klein said. The software giant has been testing the technology as it considers adding DeepSeek to SAP's AI hub, he added.\n\nDeepSeek underscores how tech has historically evolved, he argued.\n\n\"History repeats,\" SAP's Klein said. \"Oftentimes, innovation starts at the infrastructure on the hardware side, but then it moves up the stack. The hardware becomes more like a commodity. Of course, (it's) very important.\"\n\nMore Players Entering AI Battle\n\n\"But more players are entering,\" he added. \"You see the progress also with regard to the performance of these large language models or the chips. So it becomes cheaper. And this is where we are benefiting from, because we are sitting at the top, infusing AI, creating high-value use cases for businesses.\"\n\nHowever, a debate rages on DeepSeek's impact on enterprise software and tech in general.\n\nIn a note, BNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinski said Oracle investors \"may be concerned\" that the Stargate deal \"may be scaled back.\" Oracle is one of the tech giants leading the creation of Project Stargate. The DeepSeek story broke just days after the Trump Administration launched its Stargate AI infrastructure initiative.\n\nBut BNP Paribas Exane also said that \"while DeepSeek will likely remain a near-term overhang until investors regain confidence in demand trends for GPU compute, the recent pullback already discounts many of the potential risks, in our view.\"\n\n\"We believe demand for GPU compute is more durable than many expect, and Oracle's infrastructure can be repurposed for inference workloads should enterprise adoption accelerate,\" BNP Paribas Exane said.\n\nOn Adobe, the analysts told clients in a note: \"If DeepSeek brings new efficiency to multimodal content generation, it may become even more difficult for Adobe to monetize its GenAI offerings.\"\n\nDeepSeek Doubts\n\nStill, major questions remain about DeepSeek's technology.\n\nDeepSeek's AI model \"has raised the prospect that the hundreds of billions of dollars currently committed to building out AI infrastructure and spurring strong demand underlying data center credit quality may be significantly overestimated,\" Morningstar analyst Victor Leung said in a Tuesday note.\n\nHowever, the technology's \"actual capabilities remain unclear,\" he added.\n\n\"If its capabilities do not prove to be as robust or its applications more limited, the market would likely conclude that significant processing power would continue to be required to support AI development, affirming AI infrastructure demand projections including that for data centers.\"\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhat's Next For Nvidia, AI Chip Stocks After DeepSeek 'Wake-Up Call'?\n\nWhy China Startup DeepSeek Could Spell Trouble For Nvidia, AI Stocks\n\nQuantum Computing May Not Have ChatGPT Moment.

Since then, Europe's largest software vendor has stuck to the deadline, and few commentators have suggested it would budge.\n\nHowever, it conceded this week that there might be some leeway for customers in special circumstances, provided they sign up for a cloud migration deal.\n\n\u201cIn the first half of 2025 SAP will announce a cloud subscription transition option designed for ERP customers with large and very complex IT landscapes who need more time to transform on their RISE with SAP journey,\u201d a vendor spokesperson said.\n\nThe new option would be named SAP ERP, private edition, transition option. It is expected to consist of an SAP ERP cloud subscription, complemented by services designed to facilitate the transition to RISE with SAP and maintain customers' business continuity. \u201cThe option will be offered for the period from 2031 until the end of 2033,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, the German software giant insisted it was not extending the 2027 deadline set out five years ago. \u201cThis is not a prolongation of the mainstream maintenance deadlines communicated in 2020, namely the end of 2027 for SAP Business Suite 7 and the end of 2030 for extended maintenance.

The analysis firm noted there was little evidence that migrations to SAP S/4HANA were taking place at the rate needed to meet SAP's target of terminating mainstream maintenance support for ECC in 2027.\n\nSpeaking to investment analysts on a recent call, SAP CEO Christian Klein said the end of maintenance by 2027 would not be changed. \u201cWe will stick to that. But you also have to consider, in some parts of the stack, there are third-party components included and they are running out of maintenance as well. We don't want to leave the customers behind.\u201d\n\nKlein said the offer would be designed for \u201cvery few large customers [which would] not making the [deadline] because, to transform and consolidate ERP and business processes in over 100 countries is sometimes not that easy. It's not about the extension of on-premise maintenance\u201d.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter results, SAP broadly beat analysts\u2019 expectations. Total revenue grew 11 percent to reach \u20ac9.38 billion. Operating profit grew by 6 percent to reach \u20ac2.02 billion compared to the same period last year. Full-year revenue was up 11 percent to \u20ac34.18 billion. \u00ae",

            "content": "SAP\u2019s FY2024 earnings call, while highlighting the company\u2019s strong performance, was also used to announce multiple leadership changes.\n\nMonths after the departures of Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Julia White, Chief Revenue Officer Scott Russell, and Chief Technology Officer Juergen Mueller, SAP has announced a new leadership structure in its FY2024 earnings call. Amid the departure of three SAP Executive Board members last year, it is surprising that only one new position has been created. This is for a new Strategy and Operations board area which will be led by Sebastian Steinhaeuser. Steinhaeuser, who will become SAP\u2019s Chief Operating Officer on February 1, joined the company in 2020 as the Chief of Staff to CEO Christian Klein, and became Chief Strategy Officer in 2021. Prior to joining SAP, Steinhaeuser worked in multiple roles at The Boston Consulting Group.\n\nWhile Steinhaeuser is the only new member of the Executive Board, SAP announced multiple other leadership changes. This included appointing Philipp Herzig as global CTO in addition to his existing role as Chief AI Officer, as well as Jan Gilg and Emmanuel (Manos) Raptopoulos who will jointly lead SAP\u2019s Customer Success organization as co-Chief Revenue Officers. Raptopoulos, currently the regional president of SAP EMEA, will manage the SAP EMEA, MEE, and APAC regions. Gilg, currently president and chief product officer for Cloud ERP, will oversee SAP Americas and the Global SAP Business Suite. Both Gilg and Raptopoulos are long-time SAP employees with nearly twenty years of experience with the company. Gilg, Raptopoulos, and Herzig will all report to Klein.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nAlthough no additional new leadership positions were announced today, SAP did confirm that Ada Agrait will continue as Chief Marketing Officer, a role she has been filling on an interim basis since White\u2019s departure. Agrait, along with Herzig, Raptopoulos, and Gilg will all be part of a new Extended Board which will act as a strategic advisory body for the company. Other members of the Extended Board will include Michael Ameling, General Manager for SAP BTP, Sebastian Behrendt, Head of Global Finance, Thomas Pfiester, Head of Global Customer Engagement, and Monika Schaller, Chief Communications Officer. The General Manager for Business Suite will also be part of the Extended Board once that position is filled.\n\nThe goal of the Extended Board is to create a diverse team that can scale the reach of the Executive Board, discuss a broad range of portfolio topics, and act as a strategic advisory body that will assist in driving the company\u2019s AI-first, Suite-first strategy. In speaking about the Extended Board\u2019s role during the earnings call, Klein emphasized that the Executive Board has been in discussion with the Supervisory Board and has looked at the way other technology companies run.\n\nFinancial performance\n\nSAP also had a very strong fourth quarter resulting in an exceptional FY 2024. The headline was that the company met or exceeded all their financial outlook parameters for the year. This included a 32% increase in current cloud backlog to \u20ac18.1 billion, a 43% increase in total cloud backlog to \u20ac63.3 billion, a 25% increase in cloud revenue to \u20ac17.1 billion, and a 10% increase in total revenue to \u20ac34.2 billion. In alignment with this performance, SAP also saw a 28% increase in non-IFRS cloud gross profit to \u20ac12.6 billion, gross profit by 11% to \u20ac25 billion, and operating profit by 25% to \u20ac8.2 billion. Based on these performances SAP have raised their 2025 outlook.\n\nSAP highlighted a particularly strong cloud performance in APJ and EMEA. While some of this is because these regions have lagged in cloud adoption compared to Americas, they are now catching up. But this highlights SAP\u2019s success in accelerating cloud adoption in every region with cloud revenue in APJ and EMEA increased by 37% and 31% respectively compared to 19% in the Americas.\n\nImpact of AI\n\nSAP does not separate AI performance metrics as it is embedded in every solution the company offers. However, Klein highlighted that AI use cases are now embedded in 50% of deals and that 34,000 customers are now actively using AI. SAP also sees agentic AI at the nexus of business and technology and a continued investment area that will be a major factor total revenue acceleration.\n\nPart of SAP\u2019s confidence stems from the strategic approach SAP is taking toward AI. Klein stated that SAP is committed to building the strongest foundation for businesses which require access to both unstructured data and business data. This is achievable by embedding and delivering AI out-of-the-box, a capability that, Klein emphasized, cannot be achieved with on-premise solutions. This is because SAP recognizes that no single LLM fits all use cases. By maintaining an agnostic approach, SAP identifies and integrates the most suitable AI technology for each specific scenario. This flexibility allows them to prioritize customer needs, leveraging the best AI solutions to deliver optimal outcomes.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nSAP withheld announcing these changes to ensure a strong 2024-year end. With this achieved, SAP is now moving forward with multiple leadership changes, including a return to having two Customer Success leaders who report to the Klein. SAP previously had a similar organization structure when Jennifer Morgan and Adaire Fox-Martin both reported to Bill McDermott. The difference is that both Morgan and Fox-Martin had a strong history in sales. While that is true of Raptopoulos, that does not seem to be the case with Gilg. Although Gilg has been very successful leading Cloud ERP, it remains to be seen whether that success can be emulated in his new role.\n\nHowever, SAP has not commented on some of the existing regional sales leadership. While some will retain their roles, changes at the top often trigger a ripple effect as new leadership brings in familiar and trusted team members. It is also possible that SAP is reshaping its sales leadership to align with SAP\u2019s \u201cAI-first, Suite-first\u201d strategy, departing from a more traditional sales model. Given that SAP needs continued cloud growth to be successful, this will be a priority for the new sales organization.\n\nWhile some disruption in sales is expected as the leadership transition occurs, there will be minimal impact on deals already in progress. A stronger emphasis on the Global SAP Business Suite and the AI-first approach is the most definite approach that SAP will take. While the exact components of the Global SAP Business Suite remain unclear, SAP\u2019s decision to appoint the new General Manager for Business Suite to the SAP Extended Board shows that this is a priority for the company. This development could tie into SAP\u2019s planned announcement for February 13th, which CEO Christian Klein described as \u201cthe next breakthrough innovation.\u201d With 2025 being heralded as \u201cthe year of data,\u201d it\u2019s likely this announcement will shape SAP\u2019s strategic direction in the years ahead.\n\nOne area that may be of concern to both employees and customers in the Americas is the lack of regional representation in new leadership positions. Since Klein became sole CEO there has been a swing towards a greater German representation on SAP\u2019s Executive Board, something that is now also reflected in the Extended Board. SAP has always had a back and forth between Walldorf and the US, with McDermott\u2019s period as CEO perhaps being the furthest the company has seemed from its German roots. How this will play out remains to be seen, but Gilg will have significant work to do to build strong relationships in the region.\n\nGiven these changes, and SAP\u2019s strong performance and ongoing focus on AI and the Global SAP Business Suite, what should SAPinsiders keep in mind?",

(NASDAQ: ZS), the leader in cloud security and an SAP partner, is now offering customers its Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service, natively integrated within RISE with SAP. Zscaler Private Access\u2122 (ZPA\u2122) for SAP, delivered through the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange\u2122 platform, helps enable SAP customers with on-prem ERP workloads to simplify and de-risk their cloud migration, without the complexity and risk associated with traditional VPNs.\n\nAs per Zscaler\u2019s 2024 VPN Risk report , 56% of organizations have been targets of cyberattacks exploiting VPN security vulnerabilities in the last year. These incidents underscore the growing imperative to move away from traditional perimeter-based defenses towards a more robust Zero Trust architecture to enable secure access to an organization\u2019s most critical ERP infrastructure.\n\nBy running ZPA within customers' containerized RISE with SAP cloud environments, Zscaler can deliver native zero trust connectivity to SAP S/4HANA Cloud applications across deployment models, including multi-cloud or hybrid cloud. With this foundation, Zscaler also empowers customers with Zscaler Data Protection for compliance and Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) with Zscaler Digital Experience\u2122 (ZDX\u2122) for an improved user experience.\n\nBusinesses that use RISE with SAP can leverage ZPA to benefit from:\n\nSecure, Agile Cloud Access: RISE with SAP combines all the components that businesses need to pursue their business transformation strategies securely.

Cloud revenue was up 27% to \u20ac4.71 billion and up 27% at constant currencies, fueled by Cloud ERP Suite revenue, which was up 35% to \u20ac3.95 billion and up 35% at constant currencies.\n\nSoftware licenses revenue decreased by 18% to \u20ac0.68 billion and was down 19% at constant currencies. Cloud and software revenue was up 12% to \u20ac8.27 billion and up 11% at constant currencies. Services revenue was up 2% to \u20ac1.11 billion and up 2% at constant currencies. Total revenue was up 11% to \u20ac9.38 billion and up 10% at constant currencies.\n\nThe share of more predictable revenue increased by 4 percentage points to 81% in the fourth quarter.\n\nIFRS cloud gross profit was up 29% to \u20ac3.43 billion. Non-IFRS cloud gross profit was up 30% to \u20ac3.46 billion and was up 29% at constant currencies. IFRS Cloud gross margin was up 1.0 percentage points to 72.8%, non-IFRS cloud gross margin up 1.3 percentage points to 73.5% and up 1.4 percentage points at constant currencies.\n\nIFRS operating profit was up 6% to \u20ac2.02 billion and IFRS operating margin decreased by 1.0 percentage points to 21.5%. Non-IFRS operating profit was up 24% to \u20ac2.44 billion and was up 24% at constant currencies, non-IFRS operating margin increased by 2.7 percentage points to 26.0% and was up 2.9 percentage points to 26.1% at constant currencies. IFRS and non-IFRS operating profit was mainly driven by a strong performance in SAP's software licenses and support business as well as disciplined execution of the 2024 transformation program. In addition, IFRS operating profit was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses associated with the 2024 transformation program.\n\nIFRS earnings per share (basic) increased 31% to \u20ac1.37. Non-IFRS earnings per share (basic) increased 24% to \u20ac1.40. IFRS effective tax rate was 26.8% (Q4/2023: 33.6%) and non-IFRS effective tax rate was 30.0% (Q4/2023: 32.5%). For IFRS, the year-over-year decrease mainly resulted from changes in tax-exempt income and prior-year taxes. For non-IFRS, the year-over-year decrease mainly resulted from prior-year taxes.\n\nFree cash flow in the fourth quarter came in at \u2013\u20ac0.92 billion (Q4 2023: \u20ac1.67 billion). The year over year decline was mainly attributable to a \u20ac1.7 billion payout under the 2024 transformation program.\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nSAP performed against its financial outlook as follows:\n\n\n\nActual 2023 2024 Outlook\n\n(as of January 23) Revised 2024 Outlook\n\n(as of October 21) Actual 2024 Cloud revenue (at constant currencies) \u20ac13.66 billion \u20ac17.0 \u2013 17.3 billion \u20ac17.0 \u2013 17.3 billion \u20ac17.21 billion Cloud and software revenue (at constant currencies) \u20ac26.92 billion \u20ac29.0 \u2013 29.5 billion \u20ac29.5 \u2013 29.8 billion \u20ac29.96 billion Operating profit (non-IFRS, at constant currencies) \u20ac6.51 billion \u20ac7.6 \u2013 7.9 billion \u20ac7.8 \u2013 8.0 billion \u20ac8.23 billion Free cash flow \u20ac5.09 billion approx. \u20ac3.5 billion \u20ac3.5 \u2013 4.0 billion \u20ac4.11 billion Effective tax rate (non-IFRS) 30.3 % approx. 32% approx. 32% 32.3 %\n\nAs of December 31, total cloud backlog was up 43% to \u20ac63.29 billion and up 40% at constant currencies.\n\nFor the full year, cloud revenue was up 25% to \u20ac17.14 billion and up 26% at constant currencies. Software licenses revenue was down 21% to \u20ac1.40 billion and down 21% at constant currencies. Cloud and software revenue was up 11% to \u20ac29.83 billion and up 11% at constant currencies. Services revenue was up 1% to \u20ac4.35 billion and up 2% at constant currencies. Total revenue was up 10% to \u20ac34.18 billion and up 10% at constant currencies.\n\nThe share of more predictable revenue increased by 3 percentage points year over year to 83% for the full year 2024.\n\nIFRS cloud gross profit was up 28% to \u20ac12.48 billion. Non-IFRS cloud gross profit was up 28% to \u20ac12.56 billion and was up 28% at constant currencies. IFRS cloud gross margin was up 1.2 percentage points to 72.8%, non-IFRS cloud gross margin up 1.4 percentage points to 73.3% and up 1.4 percentage points at constant currencies.\n\nIFRS operating profit was down 20% to \u20ac4.66 billion and IFRS operating margin decreased by 4.9 percentage points to 13.6%. The decline in IFRS operating profit was due to restructuring expenses of approximately \u20ac3.1 billion associated with the 2024 transformation program. Non-IFRS operating profit increased 25% to \u20ac8.15 billion and increased 26% at constant currencies, non-IFRS operating margin increased by 3.0 percentage points to 23.9% and was up 3.1 percentage points to 24.0% at constant currencies.\n\nIFRS earnings per share (basic) decreased 14% to \u20ac2.68 and non-IFRS earnings per share (basic) increased 22% to \u20ac4.53. IFRS effective tax rate was 33.9% (FY/2023: 32.6%) and non-IFRS effective tax rate was 32.3% (FY/2023: 30.3%). For IFRS, the year-over-year increase mainly resulted from a temporary inability to offset withholding taxes in Germany due to tax losses in 2024 resulting from restructuring, which was partly compensated by changes in tax-exempt income. For non-IFRS, the year-over-year increase mainly resulted from a temporary inability to offset withholding taxes in Germany due to tax losses in 2024 resulting from restructuring.\n\nFree cash flow for the full year was down 19% to \u20ac4.11 billion. While higher payouts for restructuring of \u20ac2.5 billion and share-based compensation of \u20ac1.3 billion weighed on free cash flow, the performance was supported by SAP's increased profitability and improvements in working capital. At year end, net liquidity was \u20ac1.70 billion.\n\nNon-Financial Performance 2024\n\nCustomer Net Promoter Score (NPS) increased 3 points year over year to 12 in 2024, at the upper end of the outlook range.\n\nAfter dropping to 72% in the first half of the year, the employee engagement index recovered to 76% in the second half of 2024. As a result, the employee engagement index for the full-year 2024 decreased 6 percentage points year-over-year to 74%, at the upper end of the revised outlook range.\n\nThe proportion of women in executive roles increased 0.3 percentage points to 22.5%, in line with the outlook.\n\nTotal carbon emissions were flat at 6.9 Mt in 2024, while we initially guided for a steady decrease.\n\nShare Repurchase Program\n\nIn May 2023, SAP announced a share repurchase program with an aggregate volume of up to \u20ac5 billion and a term until December 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, SAP had repurchased 18,429,480 shares at an average price of \u20ac162.46 resulting in a purchased volume of approximately \u20ac3.0 billion under the program.\n\n2024 Transformation Program: Focus on scalability of operations and key strategic growth areas\n\nIn January 2024, SAP announced a company-wide restructuring program which is anticipated to conclude in early 2025. Overall expenses associated with the program are estimated to be approximately \u20ac3.2 billion. Restructuring payouts amounted to \u20ac1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and \u20ac2.5 billion for the full-year 2024. In 2025, approximately \u20ac0.7bn are expected to be paid out.\n\nBusiness Highlights\n\nIn the fourth quarter, customers around the globe continued to choose \"RISE with SAP\" to drive their end-to-end business transformations.

The three-time All-Star (2004, 2009, 2010) was the first player to have his number retired by the Sharks, his number 12 enshrined on Feb. 25, 2023.\n\nJoe Pavelski (2006-2019): Drafted in the late seventh round of the 2003 NHL Draft (205th overall), Joe Pavelski spent 13 seasons (963 GP) with San Jose and captained the team from 2015-19. He helped San Jose earn their first Clarence S. Campbell Bowl after defeating the St. Louis Blues in the 2016 Western Conference Finals at home. Nicknamed \u201cCaptain America\u201d, he leads the league for most playoff goals by an American-born skater with 74 markers. Additionally, among American-born skaters in Sharks history, he leads the franchise in games played (963) and across all scoring categories (points, 761; goals, 355; assists, 406). Pavelski was named an All-Star four times (2016, 2017, 2019, 2022).\n\nJoe Thornton (2005-2020): Before Marleau went second overall in the 1997 NHL Draft, the skater that went first overall was no other than St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada native Joe Thornton. After Thornton was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Boston Bruins on Nov. 30, 2005, he won the Art Ross and Hart Memorial Trophy, becoming the only skater in league history to win the Hart Trophy while playing for two different teams in the same season. He holds the record for the most assists as a Shark (804) and ranks fifth all-time in the league among forwards with 1,109 helpers, splitting his career with Boston, San Jose, Toronto, and Florida. Thornton ranks second in points (1,055) among Teal skaters, behind only Marleau, and was a four-time NHL season All-Star selection as well as a six-time All-Star Game participant. Thornton and Marleau are the only skaters in franchise history to reach the 1,000-point mark and \u2018Jumbo\u2019 became the second player in franchise history to have his number retired on Nov. 23, 2024.\n\nFirst Team Defensemen (in alphabetical order)\n\nBrent Burns (2011-2022): Barrie, Ontario native Brent Burns was acquired from the Minnesota Wild, along with a second-round pick in the 2012 NHL Draft, in exchange for Devin Setoguchi, Charlie Coyle, and San Jose\u2019s first-round pick in the 2011 NHL Draft on June 24, 2011. The versatile defenseman clicked for 60 or more points in five consecutive seasons from 2014-19. He leads all Sharks blueliners across all scoring categories who have dawned the Teal uniform with 594 points, 172 goals, and 422 assists. Burns won the James Norris Memorial Trophy during his 2016-17 season, becoming the first defenseman in franchise history to do so. During his accolade campaign, he led NHL defensemen, in points (76) and goals (29). He was chosen as a First All-Star Team member in 2017 and 2019 and earned a Second Team nod in 2016.\n\nMarc-\u00c9douard Vlasic (2006-Current): Now in his 19th season with San Jose, defenseman Marc-\u00c9douard Vlasic has been the reliable blueliner. Vlasic has touched the ice more than any blueliner for the Sharks, recently eclipsing the 1,300 games played mark, and sits behind only Marleau (1,607 GP) for the most games played in a Sharks uniform. He was drafted by San Jose 35th overall in the 2005 NHL Draft. Vlasic was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team after posting three goals and 23 assists in his rookie season (81 GP). Throughout his career with San Jose, Vlasic has logged twenty-plus point seasons nine times, including twenty-plus assist campaigns in four consecutive seasons from 2015-19. He skated in his 1,000th game on Dec. 14, 2019, becoming the 17th skater in NHL history to skate in his first 1,000 games with one team. Has reached the playoffs twelve times out of his 19 seasons with San Jose and moved into the top 20 in the NHL\u2019s all-time games played list for defensemen with his 1,302nd contest, Jan. 25, 2025.\n\nFirst Team Goaltender\n\nEvgeni Nabokov (1999-2004, 2005-2010): Russian-born goaltender Evgeni Nabokov was a reliable everyday netminder between the pipes for many seasons for the San Jose Sharks. Drafted in the ninth round (219th overall) in the 1994 Entry Draft, Nabokov broke into the league in 1999 after spending two seasons with the Kentucky Thoroughblades from 1997-99. Nabokov leads San Jose netminders in games played (563), games started (553), wins (293), time on ice (32490:44), and shutouts (50). Nabokov won the Calder Memorial Trophy after appearing in 66 games and logged a record of 32 wins and 21 losses during his rookie campaign (2000-01), the lone Calder Trophy winner thus far in club history. On Mar. 10, 2002, at Vancouver, Nabokov became the first and only netminder in Sharks franchise history to record a goal in a contest, an empty net goal on the power play. To this date, only 16 netminders have logged a goal in the history of the NHL. In his career as a Shark, he posted a .900 save percentage or better in nine of his 10 seasons and in 12 of his 14 seasons in the league (San Jose, New York Islanders, Tampa Bay Lightning).",

            "content": "By Ludwig Burger and Hakan Ersen\n\nWALLDORF, Germany (Reuters) -SAP, Europe's largest software maker, said on Tuesday it was more optimistic about its financial results this year due to faster growth in cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe group said it expects operating profit in 2025, on a constant currency basis, to be between 10.3 billion euros and 10.6 billion euros ($10.75 billion-$11.06 billion).\n\nSAP previously said its 2025 ambition was for operating profit of about 10.2 billion euros, total revenue of more than 37.5 billion euros and more than 21.5 billion euros in cloud revenue.\n\n\"Our strong position in data and Business AI gives us additional confidence that we will accelerate revenue growth through 2027.\" CEO Christian Klein said.\n\nThe group added that half of its fourth-quarter cloud order entry incorporated AI. In the previous quarter, it had seen a \"significant\" part of cloud deals including AI use cases.\n\nIts AI product includes a virtual copilot named Joule, which helps users to manage business tasks such as overseeing purchase orders.\n\n\"About 20,000 SAP developers are already using Joule for developers. What we are seeing is they can produce code faster \u2013 by 20%,\" Klein told journalists on a call.\n\nThe shares were little changed at 1040 GMT after initially gaining as much as 3.1%. Analysts at brokerage Stifel said SAP delivered \"another set of strong results this Q4 amidst a volatile macro environment\".The company said it now expects cloud revenues to be slightly higher in a range of 21.6 billion euros to 21.9 billion euros for the year.\n\nFourth-quarter cloud revenue grew 27%, adjusted for currency effects, to 4.71 billion euros, beating an analyst consensus of 4.67 billion euros posted on the company's website.\n\nThe cloud and software revenue in the quarter grew 11% adjusted for currency effects, to 8.27 billion euros, beating an analyst consensus of 8 billion euros.\n\nQuarterly operating income, adjusted for special items, gained 24% to 2.44 billion euros in the fourth quarter, above an analyst consensus of 2.25 billion euros.\n\nThe software maker has previously said up to 10,000 jobs out of its 100,000 total headcount were under review as it prepares for the era of AI, projecting restructuring costs of around 3 billion euros.\n\nOn Monday, SAP shares dropped alongside other European technology stocks after the popularity of Chinese discount artificial-intelligence model DeepSeek upset investors' faith in the profitability of AI and related investments.\n\nSponsored Bank Accounts\n\nCEO Klein said on Tuesday that the prospect of cheaper and more energy-efficient AI models, such as DeepSeek's agent, would encourage AI uptake and drive demand for SAP's AI services.\n\nWhen asked whether DeepSeek, which has sparked data security concerns, would be incorporated into SAP products, Klein said that the group would continue to offer China-made technology to its customers in China.\n\n($1 = 0.9585 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Hakan Ersen in Walldorf and Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt; additional reporting by Harshita Meenaktshi; editing by Savio D'Souza, Mrigank Dhaniwala and Louise Heavens)",

            "content": "Listen to article\n\nThe coalition government has accelerated the process of discretionary spending on parliamentarians' schemes and nearly tripled fund releases to Rs48.3 billion this month in relaxation of the Ministry of Finance's instructions.\n\nThe total release of Rs48.3 billion is Rs19 billion above the ceiling set by the Ministry of Finance for the July-March period of the current fiscal year.\n\nPlanning minister authorised the \"upfront one-liner\" release of nearly Rs19 billion for parliamentarians' schemes \u2013 over and above the prescribed quarterly ceilings, showed documents.\n\nThe Ministry of Planning has authorised the release of a total of Rs48.3 billion under the Sustainable Development Goals Achievement Programme (SAP) on the demand of the Cabinet Division that manages these funds, according to the official documents.\n\nDespite repeated attempts for the past two days to take official versions, neither the spokesman for the Ministry of Planning nor the cabinet secretary gave answers to questions.\n\nThe money is also given as \"single line\" budget to the Cabinet Division without allocating to specific projects. However, the Cabinet Division then further allocates funds to specific schemes.\n\nDocuments showed that the Ministry of Planning and Development authorised the release of Rs30.9 billion more between January 13 and 17 under SAP. SAP is a term used for parliamentarians' schemes.\n\nThis increased total releases for parliamentarians' schemes to Rs48.3 billion by January 17. An amount of Rs17.5 billion had been sanctioned till December 2024, according to the documents.\n\nSources in the Ministry of Planning told The Express Tribune that the release of funds nearly tripled within no time due to competing demands from allied parties for more funds to carry out development activities in their constituencies.\n\nUnder the Budget Release Strategy of the Ministry of Finance, a maximum 60% of the total allocated budget can be released during the first three quarters (July-March) of this fiscal year. The 60% funds are equal to Rs29 billion of the annual allocation of Rs50 billion for parliamentarians' schemes.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has placed these ceilings to control spending and in light of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme targets to ensure primary budget surpluses.\n\nSources said that the planning ministry authorised the release of Rs12.5 billion on January 13, which took total releases to Rs30 billion, slightly above the maximum ceiling.\n\nHowever, the Cabinet Division sought \"additional funds\" and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal authorised the release of another Rs18.4 billion on January 17, showed the official documents.\n\n\"The minister of planning and development has accorded with the request of the Cabinet Division for release of additional funds as upfront one-liner authorisation amounting to Rs18.4 billion for SAP schemes from the third quarter authorisation,\" said the documents.\n\nThe overall authorisation to the Cabinet Division for the SDGs programme will accumulate to Rs48.4 billion during the current fiscal year, according to the planning ministry's documents.\n\nThe authorisation is being made in line with the simplified release procedure approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) and the release strategy 2024-25 of the Finance Division. The authorised funds may be released and utilised as per requirement of the budgeted approved projects while remaining within the authorised ceiling.\n\nThese release orders have been conveyed to the Cabinet Division secretary. Despite repeated requests, the Cabinet Division secretary did not comment on whether his division asked the planning ministry to release SDGs' funds upfront in relaxation of the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) release strategy.\n\nThe planning ministry stated that all codal formalities, pre-requisites and instructions issued from time to time by this ministry and the Finance Division such as the General Financial Rules, Public Finance Management Act 2019, Financial Management and Powers of PAOs Regulations 2021, Assan Assignment Account Procedure 2020 and strategy for the release of funds for development budget 2024-25 may be adhered to strictly before release and sanction of development funds.\n\nPlanning ministry spokesman Asim Khan Niazi did not respond to questions regarding the original and revised allocation for SAP in fiscal year 2024-25. He also did not reply to a question about breaching the Ministry of Finance's office memorandum of July 2024, according to which 60% of the allocated budget can be released during the first three quarters of this fiscal year.\n\nInterestingly, on January 13, the planning ministry communicated to the cabinet secretary about releasing Rs12.5 billion to meet the three quarters' maximum ceiling of 60%. Four days later, it breached the ceiling.\n\nThe planning ministry said that the authorisation was being made in line with the simplified release procedure approved by Ecnec and the release strategy 2024-25 of the Finance Division.\n\nHowever, the release of Rs18.5 billion is in violation of the Finance Division's instructions.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the government had proposed Rs1.4 trillion for the federal development budget and to fund the budget, it put an additional burden on the salaried class, homes, children's milk, packaged milk and enhanced the cost of doing business.\n\nSubsequently, the budget was reduced to Rs1.1 trillion to fill a hole in the budget and fund electricity subsidy by diverting Rs50 billion.\n\nTill December, the actual development spending remained at Rs148 billion, or 13.5% of the annual budget. The planning ministry had authorised the total release of Rs376 billion for all PSDP projects till December.",

The increasing adoption of this solution also offers tremendous cross-sell opportunities, thereby generating revenues across the portfolio.\n\n\n\nMomentum in other cloud offerings like Grow with SAP and SAP Datasphere, as well as strategic acquisitions and collaborations, bodes well for its cloud business.\n\n\n\nFor 2024, SAP expects cloud revenues to be in the range of \u20ac17-\u20ac17.3 billion, indicating an increase of 24-27% at constant currency (cc) on a year-over-year basis. Management anticipates cloud and software revenues to be in the range of \u20ac29.5-\u20ac29.8 billion, implying an increase of 10-11% at cc on a year-over-year basis.\n\n\n\nSAP has been focusing on expanding its reach into the mid-market with a stronger emphasis on partner ecosystems. By empowering partners to target mid-market businesses, SAP has been working to tap into a highly profitable sales channel that has previously been underutilized.\n\n\n\nSAP has been also focusing on integrating AI across its product suite as the company expects business AI to play a key role in driving cloud ERP suite revenues. In the third quarter, SAP highlighted that around 30% of the cloud order entries included AI use cases.\n\nSAP SE Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSAP SE Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSAP SE price-eps-surprise | SAP SE Quote\n\nIn the last earnings call, management highlighted that it incorporated more than 500 skills into the company\u2019s AI co-pilot Joule and was progressing to cover 80% of the business and analytical transactions by the end of 2024. In September 2024, SAP concluded the buyout of Israel-based WalkMe for $1.5 billion. Embedding WalkMe\u2019s adoption capabilities with SAP\u2019s copilot Joule will strengthen AI assistance and productivity for its customers.\n\n\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s performance is affected by continued softness in the Software license and support business segment coupled with global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability. Also, increasing research & development costs and stiff competition in the cloud space are concerns.",

            "content": "Maintenance ends in 2027 and 2030 for Suite with AnyDB\n\nSAP board member Thomas Saueressig was correct in his keynote at the DSAG Annual Congress 2024 in Leipzig when he stated that under the current circumstances, there will be no maintenance extension for SAP Business Suite 7. Regular maintenance for ERP / ECC 6.0 (SAP Business Suite 7) is still available until 2027. After that, until 2030, there will be a chargeable, so-called extended maintenance.\n\nIn 2030, the database contracts between SAP and Oracle, IBM and Microsoft will expire, which means that ECC with AnyDB will no longer be possible. A similar situation exists with the Java stack from NetWeaver, as Oracle has its hand on the Java licenses and SAP is unable to reach an agreement with Oracle for its customers. At the DSAG Annual Congress in Leipzig, Thomas Saueressig argued that the end of the SAP Business Suite 7 is inevitable, logical, and justified in terms of licensing.\n\nSAP has stated repeatedly that the end of ERP/ECC 6.0 is unavoidable for many years. However, the validity of this assertion remains uncertain. Do SAP customers require AnyDB (Oracle, IBM, or Microsoft) and the Java stack for ECC? In his DSAG keynote in Leipzig, Germany, SAP Board Member Thomas Saueressig made several key points, but did not mention that there are alternatives.\n\nExit strategy SoH, Suite on Hana\n\nSAP Business Suite 7 requires a database, which can be Hana. Making a database release upgrade from AnyDB to Hana ensures compliance with both technical and legal requirements.The Suite on Hana (SoH) is a SAP innovation that combines ECC 6.0 with the SAP database, ensuring supportability through certification and release.\n\nThe SAP community is still debating the necessity of a Java stack in addition to the mandatory Abap stack, but most experts agree that it is possible to do without Java. This invalidates the two main arguments put forward by SAP Executive Board member Thomas Saueressig against an extension of maintenance. If SAP provides support, an SoH system can remain productive until 2040, so there is no need to migrate to S/4.\n\nBusiness Technology Platform is the SAP lifeline\n\nSAP currently has a number of customers with Business Suite 7 and BTP (Business Technology Platform). The BTP is not exclusively tied to an S/4 system, and the combination of ERP/ECC 6.0, SAP Hana, and the BTP proves to be a clever and efficient architecture.\n\nBTP allows businesses to leverage modern concepts from data management, artificial intelligence, and automation in a Suite 7 environment. SAP customers can discover the capabilities of BTP at the Steampunk and BTP Summit 2025 on March 5 and 6 in Heidelberg, Germany. The SAP community summit will cover all aspects of BTP, including the SAP clean core concept. Register here now.\n\nS/4 alternatives are ECC, Hana and BTP\n\nSAP plans to offer a maintenance extension beyond 2030 only to SAP customers who have signed a RISE with SAP contract. This is likely to be a reinsurance policy to ensure that satisfied SoH users will customize the S/4, which has been met with unpopularity.\n\nThe 2033 maintenance offering is called \"SAP ERP, Private Edition, Transition Option\"; \"SoH Private Edition\" might have been a more appropriate name. However, in the SAP community, nomenclature holds little significance. History is repeating itself at SAP: after the successful R/3, the even more successful R/3 Enterprise was developed at the urging of the DSAG user group. A similar scenario is unfolding with the release of SAP Business Suite 7 with AnyDB, which may be followed by an even more successful SoH with BTP.\n\nIs S/4 Hana dying before its time?\n\nGiven the technical, organizational, and licensing advantages of a combined suite, Hana, and BTP, the relevance of S/4 and the future of this ERP solution are being questioned. The S/4 product has been in existence for over ten years, and a successor should be on the horizon for ERP. However, SAP has not yet provided any official statements regarding this matter. The company has announced that S/4 will be maintained until 2040, but it has not provided any details about its successor.\n\nFrom a current standpoint, S/4 might be seen as a strategic decision by SAP that could potentially impact its long-term viability. A compelling solution could be a composable ERP with BTP as the foundation, leveraging the strengths of ERP/ECC 6.0 and S/4. However, the boldness of this approach, which involves opening up the ERP universe, remains a point of contention. SAP BTP is already a strategic component of every future SAP ERP system, and S/4 is only an interim solution.",

Alex Grimm | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's recently announced Stargate Project \u2014 a $500 billion investment in American AI infrastructure \u2014 should be a \"wake-up call\" for Europe, according to the CEO of one of the region's biggest tech firms. Asked on Thursday about the project, which is backed by OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle and led by the Trump administration, SAP CEO Christian Klein said it should set an example for Europe. \"It's the right move, and it's also about making the government more productive,\" he said. \"Look at Europe, we always complain about regulations about too many AI acts \u2026 It's a great role model for Europe.\" Klein added that he would \"absolutely support\" a Stargate Project for Europe. \"We do business with all public sectors across the world, of course we would welcome that in Europe,\" he told CNBC's Karen Tso and Steve Sedgwick. \"Europe needs it the most, from my perspective.\" Klein, who has been in the chief executive role at German software developer SAP since 2019, argued that the major barrier to starting a Stargate-type project in Europe is not a question of access to capital in the region being more restricted than in the United States.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"It's not even the lack of financing \u2014 in Europe, it's a question of who owns it,\" he argued. \"Who actually gives the order to say we digitize Europe, we digitize our agencies, and we are not doing it in silos, we are doing it as a union.\" He said countries are focusing on domestic AI development rather than looking at how markets could collaborate to develop the technology. \"Think about startups \u2014 we are a big multinational tech company, we can do it. But the small startups, they need a market to scale in and it's by far not a union.\" \"My hope is that ... everything that's happened in the United States is certainly a wake up call. We need to see proof but I hope now Europe comes together and form a union in digitization, it's super important,\" Klein added. \"When you look at our industries, we have manufacturing, autos, chemicals \u2014 we need to apply AI to make [them] more competitive. We need more boldness, more willingness, more courage.\" He said the responsibility falls on both politicians and businesses, and that lawmakers need to build the right frameworks so that companies can drive the AI transformation and implement the technology. Roland Busch, CEO of Siemens , also told CNBC on Thursday that Europe needs to catch up with the United States. \"This is an engine which is moving very, very fast, so this is the point we have to [do] our homework,\" he told CNBC at the WEF. \"Just count the amount of data centers sitting in United States and being built in United States versus Europe.\" Busch said Europe needs more data centers built closer to home so local companies can develop and operate powerful AI tools.\n\nwatch now",

            "content": "When Christian Klein became sole CEO of SAP almost five years ago, the top customer priority was for SAP to help them integrate their mismatched technology.\n\nToday, customers\u2019 top expectation is that SAP will help them transform.\n\n\u201cFour years back, integration was the key because without it you cannot offer end-to-end solutions and you cannot offer, in my eyes, a great customer experience,\u201d Klein said in our recent interview for this CEO Outlook 2025 series.\n\n\u201cBut now it\u2019s about, how can the customer transform?\u201d\n\nThat shift toward an extreme focus on change and adaptation for emerging needs rather than on feature superiority is one of the major forces driving enormous change among all of the Cloud Wars Top 10 enterprise-apps vendors \u2014 SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, Workday, Microsoft, and to a lesser extent ServiceNow and Google Cloud.\n\nAnd from my conversation with Klein, I would say he believes two market dynamics are behind all that disruption:\n\nthe explosive emergence of AI as a business imperative, and\n\nthe existential need for companies to engineer end-to-end processes and end-to-end visibility.\n\n(You can view my full interview with Klein here.)\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nThe AI Era\n\n\u201cToday, there is no C-level discussion without AI,\u201d said Klein, the Cloud Wars CEO of the Year for 2023.\n\nAnd Klein says customers are particularly excited by how easy it has become for businesses to deploy AI and for their employees to quickly master it.\n\n\u201cToday, you can work with SAP software via human language, which means you can feel the productivity which is now embedded in the solutions. You feel how you get your job done easier,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd those big wins at the level of individuals will quickly accelerate to an enterprise-wide scale.\n\n\u201cThe topics around AI are now emerging towards how can now SAP help me solve the tough, challenging business questions I have, and how I can steer my company better, and how to orchestrate my end-to-end business processes with SAP Business AI.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what is really at the top of the agenda of every C-level discussion.\u201d\n\nThe End-to-End Imperative\n\nBut, Klein warned, these remarkable new capabilities will be squandered if they\u2019re applied to existing siloed functions and processes rather than across the entire organization, with optimized processes and outcomes as the essential goal.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about a typical process, what many customers want with SAP is a complete quote-to-cash solution,\u201d Klein said, \u201cand that means a certain offering.\n\n\u201cBut then they need to know which offerings to combine to win more deals in the future and at what price? Then you need to also of course have the fulfillment there for the quote in the order management, and you need to bill, and you need to book the revenue in your accounts,\u201d Klein said.\n\n\u201cBut now we can prove, hey, we not only help you now to run this end-to-end process, but we can also help you with generative AI and embedded AI. We really make sure that you can quote more intelligently, that you can sell more, that you can price more effectively, and that you can run all the fulfillment processes in the back end and be way more productive.\n\n\u201cIf we can deliver that, then the customers are saying, \u2018I\u2019m all in for buying more AI units from SAP because we see this end-to-end process is not only transforming my company, it\u2019s also helping me to be way more productive than before.\u201d\n\n\u2018Super-Agent\u2019 Joule\n\nAs those transformative capabilities take hold, the role of agents\u2013plus what Klein called SAP\u2019s \u201csuper agent\u201d Joule \u2014 will help to drive superb business outcomes.\n\n\u201cLet me give you one concrete example: in 2025, we will ship Demand Supply Chain Planning, which is obviously a set of very strategic capabilities for many companies when it comes to better predicting demand, but also having a resilient supply chain which can deliver on time,\u201d Klein said.\n\n\u201cToday with Business AI, we\u2019re helping with generative AI but also with machine learning and others to better predict demand. And of course, we have an AI embedded so when you do your inventory management in the future, with Joule becoming a so-to-say \u2018super agent,\u2019 then you have an agent who helps you to predict your demand but this agent is actually also collaborating with your supply chain agent and saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m predicting real-time demand based on billions of data points and unstructured content, and here, dear supply chain agent, is my output.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen the supply chain agent takes that output from the sales agent and says, \u2018Okay, where\u2019s my inventory? How do I now need to manage inventory, to first deliver on time, but then also to optimize my inventory?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then the supply-chain agent takes this input and gives it to the procurement agent and says, \u2018Hey, we need to be able to deliver next day\u2019.\u201d\n\nThat, Klein said, is the model to which business leaders across many industries are aspiring: end-to-end data flows and decision-making handled by agents and orchestrated by SAP Joule.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll be shipping: Agentic AI capabilities with Joule coming on top, orchestrating the various sub-agents and making sure the customer gets an extremely valuable output end to end and not only talking about sales, not only talking about supply chain, not only talking about procurement, but how all these agents work with each other and collaborate and contextualize data,\u201d Klein said.\n\nFor customers, he added, that end-to-end agent-powered model will prove to be \u201can extremely significant output for our customers.\u201d\n\nFinal Thought\n\nAs I noted throughout 2024, SAP was by far the fastest-growing enterprise-apps vendor in the Cloud Wars Top 10, and the hard-charging Klein is clearly not simply hoping that SAP will be able to meet the challenging new requirements and demands from customers.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s pushing as hard as he can to ensure that SAP\u2019s customers will be able to transform on an end-to-end basis using a broad set of AI solutions powered in large part by SAP\u2019s own 007, known as Joule.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

It helps companies navigate the complex global landscape of sustainability regulations, such as EU CSRD*, while establishing a scalable foundation over time, to adapt to evolving regulations such as EU ETS** and EU CBAM\u2020, as well as to international standards such as ISSB\u2020\u2020. The launch of the solution marks the beginning of a new era in carbon accounting systems, which are expected to significantly impact businesses worldwide as decarbonization becomes a legal and market imperative.\n\n\"Enormous investments are required to abate CO 2 in order to curb global warming. Besides smart, reliable regulation also accurate data on emissions along the supply chain is paramount to trigger the necessary investment,\" said Dominik Asam, CFO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. \"Only by moving from averages to actuals - audited at reasonable assurance - can freeriding and greenwashing be avoided, thereby protecting such valuable investment and our planet. SAP Green Ledger delivers precisely that.\"\n\nSAP Green Ledger builds on existing financial and ERP solutions from SAP that are established in thousands of companies worldwide. By extending these solutions to integrate emissions data, businesses can make more informed, sustainable decisions that link environmental impact with financial performance, enhancing compliance, efficiency and transparency.\n\nPart of SAP Sustainability solutions, SAP Green Ledger allocates carbon emissions to specific economic activities and transactions captured by ERP solutions from SAP. This innovation empowers organizations to accurately account for, analyze and report carbon footprints across products, services, and organizational units.\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP) announced the general availability of the SAP Green Ledger solution, the most comprehensive carbon accounting system globally that integrates directly with customers' financial data.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSAP Green Ledger was developed with support from companies such as Accenture, Deloitte, EY, PwC and TCS (Tata Consulting Services) as well as with pilot customers such as Covestro. Covestro is currently evaluating SAP Green Ledger in an early pilot phase and testing the linking of carbon dioxide values to SAP Green Ledger, as they are generated during the manufacture of specific products in the supply chain.\n\nAccenture is helping organizations achieve their net-zero and sustainability targets in a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. \"As organizations seek to gain visibility into both the financial and environmental performance of their businesses, SAP Green Ledger can provide the sustainability metrics and insights needed to enhance decision-making that reduces emissions, drives efficiencies and optimizes performance,\" said Stephanie Jamison, global resources industry practice chair and global sustainability services lead at Accenture. \"As a strategic co-innovation partner, Accenture helped shape the development of SAP Green Ledger and can apply our understanding of the technology and its capabilities to help our clients get the most for their organization.\"\n\nThrough its Strategic Advisory Group for Green Ledger, SAP was able to gain insights from Deloitte's breadth and depth of knowledge in sustainability measurement and reporting. \"SAP Green Ledger offers new levels of precision in carbon accounting for organizations as they track, manage and report their greenhouse gas emissions, and provides leaders with a holistic view of the costs and benefits of sustainability initiatives, enabling them to make data-driven decisions that can build business resilience,\" said Jennifer Steinmann, Deloitte Global Sustainability Business leader.\n\nDeloitte is working with companies as they adopt sustainability disclosure standards and get ready for assurance. \"Technology solutions can help generate traceable, bottom-up emissions data,\" said Veronica Poole, Deloitte Global IFRS and Corporate Reporting leader. \"Leveraging the robust governance and controls of enterprise systems is needed to help organizations achieve the rigor that enhances corporate accountability and enables a move to reasonable assurance.\"\n\nNorman Emmenlauer, partner for CFO-Led Sustainability at EY Business Consulting, said about SAP Green Ledger: \"This is a solution that integrates carbon accounting into the core financial processes, making sustainability a tangible part of business operations.\"\n\nCarina Schoellmann, partner for ESG Data & Tech at EY Technology Consulting, added: \"This solution will help our EY clients by seamlessly integrating carbon accounting into their financial systems, enabling more informed and sustainable decision-making.\"\n\nAmy Brachio, EY global vice chair for Sustainability, pointed to the strategic nature of the topic: \"Sustainability is at the heart of everything organizations do; business operations such as procurement, manufacturing and logistics are great examples. SAP Green Ledger will enable granular and auditable data capture across the value chain, supporting organizations to transform ESG from compliance exercise to value-creation strategy.\"\n\nSameer Shah, partner at EY Technology Consulting, added: \"SAP Green Ledger is a game changer for sustainability practitioners, providing the tools needed to measure, manage and report on carbon emissions with the same rigor as financial data.\"\n\n\"Having participated in the pilot program, we're excited to see the launch of SAP Green Ledger, an essential digital approach for integrating carbon accounting and management into strategic business operations,\" explained Will Jackson-Moore, global sustainability leader, PwC UK. \"With SAP Green Ledger, businesses can seamlessly align financial performance with sustainability goals, while achieving the transparency and precision needed for real-time emissions reporting and resource management. Building on this foundation, PwC is developing CSRD-ready content to enable end-to-end reporting and steering, helping organisations meet regulatory requirements, prioritise sustainability at the C-level, and drive meaningful change in environmental accountability. We're proud to support our clients in leveraging SAP Green Ledger to navigate complex sustainability challenges, achieve measurable decarbonisation and progress toward net-zero commitments at speed.\"\n\nSAP partner TCS has also cooperated on SAP Green Ledger, with a focus on accelerating action to achieve carbon neutrality. TCS Enterprise Solutions Global Head Vikram Karakoti said, \"With our participation in the pilot program for SAP Green Ledger, TCS is embracing innovative sustainability solutions to build a better future. This will enable organizations to move beyond regulatory compliance and make sustainability a growth engine. By embedding carbon data into the enterprise planning process, organizations can unlock previously unexplored areas for growth, transformation and environmental renewal.\"\n\nVisit the SAP News Center.

            "content": "(Walter Sun, Global Head of AI, SAP)\n\nDear reader: I held out on you again. I released a Hashing out SAP in 2025 podcast with Josh Greenbaum and Brian Dennett, but we didn't really hit on AI much - and we heard about it on LinkedIn. (Though you could argue the modernization themes in that podcast are exactly what customers need to bring AI to fruition).\n\nSAP on LLMs, output accuracy, and expert agents\n\nThat's because I had something in my back pocket - part two of my latest talk with Dr. Walter Sun, SAP's Global Head of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nLast time I caught up with Sun, we were back from ASUG Tech Connect in West Palm Beach (see: ASUG Tech Connect brings clarity to LLM accuracy - and shows how SAP's GenAI Hub can bring AI to all customers). In the meantime, ASUG, DSAG and UKISUG published a revealing survey about SAP customers' attitudes to AI (see ASUG podcast on this topic as well).\n\nI've also published more on the inherent tensions between context window data and the internal data structure of LLM. This isn't a minor tech glitch; it's a big/unresolved issue. It even made my list of the top five AI mistakes vendors make:\n\nOnly one vendor I met with all of last year acknowledged the problem with LLMs and the context window. If you could compel an LLM to always take the context via RAG, you would have a high degree of control over output accuracy, depending mostly on the quality of your incoming data retrieval (the 'R' in RAG). But that's not the case - and it underscores why RAG is an industrial strength band-aid on powerful-but-imperfect/probabilistic LLM technology. Finally, at an ASUG user event in November, I heard some straight talk on this - [from SAP].\n\nDuring my talk with Sun, he echoed what I've seen so far: smaller language models with single-purpose agents tend to be closest to reliable in this regard. These \"expert agents,\" as SAP calls them, have been a notable news item at both Sapphire and SAP TechEd. As Sun told me:\n\nIf you think about AI expert agents, that's the whole idea. You can actually have an expert agent, a hotel travel agent, car rental agent - you can train and tune these models to be much smaller, and they're really focused on, say, the best hotels around the world. It doesn't need to know about dinosaurs. It doesn't need to know about technology. So if you ask it something that's not about a hotel, it's just going to say, 'My job is to book hotels.'\n\nThe higher the accuracy levels, the more use cases are on the table - and the more chances to pull humans out of AI supervision roles that put a drag on ROI. Humans need better activities than reviewing agentic transactions. Whether this gets us to the level of auditable gen AI systems remains to be seen. But SAP's pursuits here are, in my view, a key part of what \"responsible AI\" really means. Ethics? Yes. But a supposedly 'ethical' AI process that regularly serves up inaccurate info isn't very responsible, is it?\n\nIn my last piece, Sun shared some of SAP's pursuits to maximize the accuracy of gen AI output beyond RAG, including prompt instructions (not visible to the typical user), and: reducing the so-called \"temperature\" settings on LLMs (a higher temperature is perhaps useful for more creative output, but not for most enterprise use cases).\n\nOne aspect I didn't touch one was provenance. Roughly speaking, this is the potential to cross-check LLM output via other agents, designed for that purpose. Sun explains:\n\nWe can we can do provenance checks [on the output] to make sure it aligns with what's in the input. If I tell you, 'Hey, meet me at 11:30am outside of this location' - facts like locations, numbers, statistics, which are given to you can be verified. For non-factual information, like 'the weather is cloudy,' maybe you don't want to double-check, because there could be synonyms to those. But when it's a time like 11:30am, that can be absolute. 'Meet me on the 20th of November,' that's also absolute... So numerical values are a good example of things you can actually double check.\n\nBehind SAP's agentic news - what's next for knowledge graphs and foundation models?\n\nBut SAP's AI news doesn't end with expert agents: in the run-up to press time, SAP issued a slew of Business AI highlights for Q4 2024, via a blog post by Chief AI Officer Philipp Herzig. As Herzig wrote, the planned integration of Joule is on track:\n\nLooking again to our customers, we infused our generative AI copilot Joule into over 80 percent of the most-used tasks across the SAP portfolio. This way, customers can use natural language to get the most important things done. As an example, with Joule\u2019s 1,300 new skills, customers can open a mobile phone chat to get the latest numbers or finalize an approval. We also partnered with more top-tier generative AI models this year, including AWS, Meta, NVIDIA, Mistral, and others, in order to provide flexibility to customers when building AI-powered extensions and use cases with the generative AI hub in SAP AI Core.\n\nI've debunked my share of enterprise AI hype, but it's not all hot air. Enterprise vendors have a real chance to distance themselves from the sensationalism of consumer LLMs run amok, via superior/responsible AI architectures that are grounded in the customer's industry, data, and role - with proper security/authorizations in place (at the time of our interview, Gemini just made more sensational headlines for scary output to a teen doing homework). Sun responded:\n\nI totally agree with you. I think the enterprise scenarios are much more structured or constrained, meaning that, if you have a consumer model, you can ask any questions, and you can go into a three hour exposition. Whereas, if you're trying to create a job description, or if you're trying to predict your supply chain delays, the question is very specific, and the answers are specific. As you mentioned, with Retrieval Augmented Generation and other context settings, understanding a person's company, a person's profile, with their opt-in permission, we can say, 'Look, I know that Jon Reed works at diginomica; we know your location, we know your flight preferences,' if you opted in. And then we can take all that information and give you a more curated response.\n\nEnter SAP's foundation model:\n\nWe have a foundation model which is a business foundation model. It differs from language models, in the sense that we're learning about tabular transactions and tabular data versus language. For tabular transactions like purchases or incoming deliveries, what we've added is our knowledge graph.\n\nKnowledge graphs alone don't solve the 'LLMs versus accurate retrieval at inference' problem. Graphs do, however, offer a better way to serve up validated, structured data into the prompt context - something that vector-based retrieval is not ideal for (In some cases, the LLM can actually output knowledge graph based information as well, but that's a different story). SAP has been pushing to get tabular data into knowledge graphs for LLM consumption - understandably so, given all the relevant data tied to SAP ERP transactions. Sun explains:\n\nBasically, it looks at tabular data. It also relates different businesses together. The interesting thing about this is that different industries use different terminology. I've used a simple example of how people in the capital markets talk about tranches, which are just basically payments or installments. When you hear about that, you think, 'Okay, you have the capital markets feature in business apps'... And then, somewhere else, you have payments, and you think: 'Oh, these are two different columns or two different fields' - and a knowledge graph helps connect the dots. Or, if you had a column that was tracking your company's investments in Artificial Intelligence, you might have two different columns, or in two different languages, not realizing it's the same column. And so the knowledge graph brings together this disparate data, and helps when you understand the foundation model of: how do you predict purchases, transactions - how do you make sure we're properly conflating the right things and not failing to conflate these different things.\n\nAnother key ingredient here is aggregated customer data. Sun:\n\nThe last part of your question about aggregate, anonymized data; I think it's really important. Customer activities in aggregate fashion can bring better experiences for everybody. The example I tell people is search engines. You know how people typically search for different products. And so you have a initial model, but this model learns actively in terms of what people are doing. And so if we have this opt-in, aggregated, anonymized data, we can actually provide a better experience for all of our customers. We're not trying to target one small customer's idiosyncrasies or technical know-how, and train the model from there. Actually, we take everybody's activity and aggregate it - if they opted in, and the combination of information provides value to everybody.\n\nSo how does that play out in an industry setting? Sun cited a supply chain example, using aggregated shipping data to go beyond obvious trends like Black Friday, and anticipate other supply chain issues:\n\nLooking at aggregated data trends over time can be used to help train the model and understand and help bring value to users, saying, 'Hey, this foundation model understands supply chain patterns throughout the calendar year. They understand the retail patterns in the US and other countries - certain dates that are more or less busy, and then people can plan around it that way.'\n\nBut the use of data, aggregated or not, customer-specific or not, brings forward the topic of risk. SAP has put considerable effort into its AI ethics and risk assessment. When I asked Herzig to provide an example of when SAP's AI ethics review flagged a problematic feature, he was able to provide one, on the record. We need more of that - and from more vendors.\n\nBut surely SAP customers face similar questions in their own AI rollouts? So I asked Sun: \"I'm wondering if it makes sense for SAP to help customers with some type of use case assessment that includes the kinds of things you're describing, but also factors in the risk component as well?\" Sun responded:\n\nInternally within SAP, we have a team that actually looks at this - the AI ethics team. You have this risk advisory flow chart where we actually look at different levels of risks, we ask specific questions, right? [Editor's note: you can see that chart below, which is part of SAP's AI Ethics Handbook]. You know, other risks and harms - such as the red flag level, which is like, 'Okay, we're definitely not going to do this.' There are many different scenarios where we obviously start from one minute, and you stop the conversation: We're not going to the high risk. Medium risk questions are like, 'Okay, is this a regulated industry? Are people's liberties impacted? And through these scenarios, we have to make sure we ship features to our lines of businesses that are approved, right? And so we can actually potentially share that externally too,and give people the same guidance. Like: these are different risk scales you can look at. Every company has a different level of appetite for risk; we could have them tune or adjust according to their needs.\n\n(SAP Risk Assessment - from SAP's AI Ethics Handbook)\n\nMy take\n\nIndustry models will be crucial for better enterprise AI. Aggregated/anonymized data is surely a part of how these models get built. Privacy concerns, however, must be tackled head-on. Perhaps the biggest message to vendors in my AI mistakes post was: drop the AI hard-sell, and start educating instead. Take customers under the hood. The ASUG/DSAG/UKISUG AI survey hit on the same point. From the DSAG release:\n\n52 percent (ASUG: 49 percent | UKISUG: 44 percent) of respondents are currently in the process of learning about AI, and 46 percent (ASUG: 44 percent | UKISUG: 41 percent) are expanding their knowledge of Generative AI. The results make it clear that the development of know-how is in full swing. There is a great need for information and there is still a lot to be done \u2013 by users, partners and software manufacturers alike.\n\nOverall, despite my concerns on SAP's often-confusing AI pricing strategy, I'd give a much higher grade to SAP on topics of AI transparency and education than most vendors. Also, SAP has achieved quite a bit of data trust with customers. Stringent European data regulations, including GDPR, have given SAP a leg up on these topics also.\n\nI don't think SAP customers have the types of concerns about data privacy that I do when I see Google Gemini invite itself into my email inbox. I believe it's possible to aggregate data as Sun describes, in ways that benefit opt-in customers. That said, I have yet to talk to an SAP customer that understands exactly how SAP's AI opt-ins (or opt-outs) work. SAP would do well to collaborate with user groups on this communication.\n\nI also see a tension between SAP's AI investments and its stronger-than-typical commitment to ESG. There are ways of reducing those tensions, including an emphasis on smaller models, or rightsizing models so to speak. But generative actions are more energy-consuming by nature. Some of the aspects that make SAP Business AI more responsible, including models auditing other models - along with more sophisticated uses of knowledge graphs and context windows - also consume energy. I think this is an area where SAP can show leadership; I'll look for a more detailed view of ESG and AI at SAP Sapphire 2025.\n\nFor now, SAP has its hands full. As I finish this piece, early news is coming out from folks like ASUG CEO Geoff Scott regarding an SAP cloud transition offering for ECC customers with large/complex landscapes that commit to RISE (a story for another time; SAP has not officially shared details, only confirmed the news). And on the AI front, SAP must figure out how to meet the AI expectations of customers that have very different views on AI. The ASUG/DSAG/UKISUG report indicated a disparate range of attitudes:\n\nWhile half of respondents feel that the potential of AI is currently overrated, more than a third of respondents expect AI to revolutionize entire industries.\n\nThat's not an easy data point to parse. But to get AI right, SAP will need to find a way to do it - and so will we.",

            "content": "Reading Time: 4 minutes\n\nThe world of enterprise software is evolving at an unmatched pace as we prepare for the year 2025. As a prominent player in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) market, SAP is at the forefront of these developments, assisting businesses of all kinds in adapting to the quickly changing technological environment. SAP is improving its solutions to satisfy the needs of organizations seeking to remain competitive in a data-driven environment, ranging from cloud transformation to automation and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIn 2024, the global AI-enabled testing market was estimated to be worth USD 856.7 million. The market is expected to increase from USD 1,010.9 million in 2025 to USD 3,824.0 million in 2032, with a CAGR of 20.9% over the forecast period. This transformation is projected to completely transform SAP implementation testing procedures, with AI playing a vital role in simplifying and accelerating processes. This year offers numerous intriguing technologies that will change how businesses operate, make choices, and increase efficiency. This piece will discuss SAP automation trends and processes for 2025, including digital transformation, S/4HANA Cloud, AI in ERP, predictive analytics, IoT integration, and machine learning in SAP.\n\n1. Digital transformation\n\nBusinesses have seen major changes in recent years, and working with SAP has become necessary in order to not only remain relevant in the market but also to expand with the constant developments across multiple industries. By 2025, we can expect SAP to play a larger role in overall transformation. SAP Business Technology Platform and the S/4HANA Cloud enhance this incremental ecosystem. These platforms will allow businesses to democratize their processes, applications, and data, resulting in a single integrated system. As a result, customers will be able to get insights quickly, make more assertive decisions, and respond in situations where market conditions are constantly changing. Furthermore, SAP places a high value on sustainability, particularly given the tools available; it is clear that there is a genuine desire to enable organizations to be considerably more sustainable while increasing revenues. Businesses that embrace digital transformation with SAP can benefit from increased customer satisfaction, improved supply chains, and innovative business strategies.\n\n2. SAP S/4HANA Cloud\n\nSAP S/4HANA Cloud accelerates the shift to cloud-based ERP. By 2025, businesses will prioritize growth, phase of deployment, and cost-effectiveness over purchase and implementation costs. SAP S/4HANA system integrates ERP processes into a new structure, allowing for customizable implementation by business units. They help the company to operate without delay and make quick, informed decision-making based on real-time availability and analysis.\n\nFurthermore, SAP\u2019s RISE with SAP initiative continues to help businesses shift from their on-premises registered systems to the cloud environment. SAP\u2019s cloud network allows ongoing upgrades and innovations for S/4HANA Cloud, ensuring the future security of operations.\n\n3. Predictive analytics\n\nPredictive analytics is transforming the way businesses perceive data and decide what actions to take rather than waiting until the data has been analyzed. In the case of SAP Trends in 2025, this projection might be an important aspect of the organization\u2019s strategic approach. SAP Analytics Cloud is an innovative technology that integrates corporate intelligence, planning, and predictive analytics into a single platform. This tool allows enterprises to collect data from several sources, analyze trends, and develop effective strategies in real-time. We believe that this technology will become an even more essential part of SAP\u2019s services, assisting businesses in remaining agile and competitive.\n\n4. Artificial Intelligence in ERP\n\nArtificial intelligence has already crossed the threshold, becoming an essential component of modern ERP systems. In 2025, SAP aims to integrate AI into its solutions and sub-components to automate, optimize, and intelligently manage various business processes. SAP utilizes Artificial Intelligence in ERP to enhance customer services, including financial budgeting, supply chain management, and client support. One of the primary reasons for the increased use of AI in SAP is the existence of AI capabilities in the S/4HANA integrated system. Outlier detection, equipment maintenance, and future demand increases are all factors influencing how businesses operate. SAP users will benefit from increased productivity and innovation as AI functionalities progress.\n\n5. Unique solutions for various industries\n\nThe rise of industry-specific solutions is one of the most major trends in the SAP ecosystem for 2025. SAP is pushing toward verticalization, offering specialized solutions that meet the specific demands of diverse industries like manufacturing, retail, healthcare, finance, and others. SAP\u2019s business Cloud provides cloud-based, modular solutions that are tailored to the unique demands of each business. This strategy enables firms to deploy only the features they require, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. Industry Cloud solutions will continue to expand, providing organizations with innovative tools tailored to their industry.\n\n6. Machine Learning in SAP\n\nSAP\u2019s artificial intelligence provides a solution for corporate clients who need to maximize enterprise productivity. SAP utilizes machine learning for fraud analysis, client segmentation, and monitoring logistical systems. For example, in procurement activities, items supplied by several contractors can be examined using vendor history and industry microeconomics, allowing ML to identify areas for cost savings. In HR, ML will improve hiring procedures by assisting with recruitment through skill matching. The integration of machine learning and SAP S/4HANA, as well as other systems, ensures that businesses will be able to delegate tedious and complex tasks, reduce errors during completion, and divert attention toward improvement. With the introduction of new ML technologies, we anticipate that SAP solutions will become more valuable, helping the organization to be even more effective and efficient.\n\nLooking forward\n\nSAP continues to evolve and innovate, providing businesses with the tools they need to compete in today\u2019s fast-paced, technology-driven world. SAP\u2019s trends and breakthroughs, whether through cloud transformation, AI-powered automation, industry-specific solutions, or a focus on sustainability, will be central to corporate operations in the upcoming years. Businesses that stay ahead of these trends can unlock new growth opportunities, increase efficiency, and remain resilient in an ever-changing market.\n\nThe impact of S/4HANA Cloud along with other innovations such as AI and ML, will ensure that providers are prepared and fully functioning for any busy marketplace. By merging IoT and analytics, SAP prepares organizations to address challenges and seize opportunities that arise.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nWith President Donald Trump having returned to power, one of the first things he has done is revoke a 2023 executive order signed by Joe Biden seeking to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence posed to consumers, workers, and national security. The revoke marks a significant shift in federal oversight of artificial intelligence technology.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nAccording to Biden\u2019s orders, developers of AI systems posing risks in any way to the US government, the economy, or even public health or safety, needed to share the results of safety tests with the government, which was in line with the Defense Production Act.\n\nThe order also required agencies to create orders for testing and address related chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks. As of now, all key safety and transparency requirements for AI developers have been revoked.\n\nWhile it is currently unclear how the Trump administration will handle rules and regulations regarding AI, it is likely to be more of a \u201chands-off\u201d approach. Regardless of how it is handled, the one clear thing is that this technology will continue to be extremely transformative.\n\nAs quoted by CEO of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the world has yet to completely recognize the extent of change AI will bring to every aspect of human life.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the risks \u2026 this is a technology that no one today really appreciates, truly the level of disruption that it\u2019s going to create, affecting everything from our lives, our businesses, human capital, employment, and every sector is going to be disrupted. And I think that while there\u2019s a lot of opportunity, it also presents significant amount of risk, which is today unclear, because the technology is moving so fast and we\u2019re all trying to catch up as much as possible\u201d.\n\nAl Mubarak is also optimistic about the future of AI and the UAE\u2019s ability to leverage its investment strategy.",

            "content": "In summary Some schools destroyed years ago in the Sonoma and Butte fires are just now reopening. The long, expensive process of rebuilding in LA may eat up much of the money voters approved in November for school repairs statewide.\n\nLea esta historia en Espa\u00f1ol\n\nIt\u2019ll be a while before Los Angeles can fully assess the damage to its schools from this recent spate of fires, but a few things already seem certain: rebuilding will take a long time, it will be expensive, and it may sap the statewide fund for school repairs.\n\nAt least a dozen schools in the Los Angeles area have been damaged in the fires, including at least five that were destroyed completely. Thousands of students and school staff have lost their homes, and countless families are grappling with major disruptions to their day-to-day lives.\n\n\u201cThe pain of being evacuated, losing your home, or having family and friends who have been impacted. \u2026 it\u2019s just so devastating,\u201d said Debra Duardo, Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools. \u201cAt so many districts in our county, the superintendent themselves has been evacuated, or 50% of the staff has been evacuated. And meanwhile they\u2019re all trying to help their students.\u201d\n\nIn Pacific Palisades, fires destroyed two elementary schools and extensively damaged Palisades Charter High School. Fires in Pasadena and Altadena destroyed three elementary schools. Several others in greater Los Angeles remain closed because they\u2019re in evacuation zones or have been damaged.\n\nStudents at those schools have been reassigned to other campuses, are learning online or are waiting for conditions to improve so they can return to class.\n\nFor many students, it will be a long wait. Even with loosened regulations, rebuilding a school could take years as officials piece together a hodgepodge of funding sources: insurance money, private grants and donations, local bonds, lawsuit settlement money and state and federal funds. Some districts will have plenty of funding options, while others will struggle to find enough revenue.\n\nIn the meantime, some will have immediate expenses such as procuring portable classrooms and hiring mental health counselors to help students, staff and families cope with trauma. Large districts such as Los Angeles Unified can reallocate resources quickly, but smaller districts and charter and private schools face more obstacles.\n\nBig demand for Prop. 2 funds\n\nProposition 2, the $10 billion school construction bond approved by voters in November, will be a big help for schools that need to rebuild or make costly repairs, or even buy portables.\n\nThe state allocates the money to schools with the highest need, and then on a first-come, first-served basis. There\u2019s already a big backlog of schools that have applied for money, and it\u2019s likely that schools gutted by fire will get priority over those with less urgent needs, said Rebekah Kalleen, a legislative advocate for the Coalition for Adequate School Housing.\n\nThat means some schools will miss out. Because California\u2019s fund for school repairs had been empty for a while, there\u2019s a long list of schools with critical repair needs. Throughout the state, students are attending schools with leaky roofs, lead pipes, unsafe electrical systems and broken air conditioning. Schools in low-income and rural areas are most affected, because they have less ability to raise money through local bonds.\n\nHelio Brasil, superintendent of Keyes Union School District south of Modesto, said he has empathy for those dealing with buildings destroyed or damaged by the fires in Los Angeles, but he worries about his own district\u2019s needs. The 1,000-student district, which primarily serves low-income students whose parents work in the nearby agricultural fields, desperately needs money to replace the 40-year-old roof, upgrade the electric wiring and make other safety improvements.\n\n\u201cWe understand the moral imperative to support the devastated districts first, but the reality is that districts like ours cannot be left behind in the process.\u201d\n\nHelio Brasil, superintendent of Keyes Union School District\n\n\u201cThere is a growing concern that Prop. 2 funds will be quickly depleted, leaving smaller districts like Keyes struggling to address our own long-term facility needs,\u201d Brasil wrote in an email. \u201cWe understand the moral imperative to support the devastated districts first, but the reality is that districts like ours cannot be left behind in the process.\u201d\n\nBrasil and other superintendents are asking for the state to balance the needs of schools affected by fires with those that aren\u2019t, and provide extra money if possible. Gov. Gavin Newsom last week promised to chip in an extra $1 million from the state\u2019s general fund for schools damaged by fire.\n\n\u2018Like a bomb had gone off\u2019\n\nThe post-fire experience in Sonoma and Butte counties provides a preview of what lies ahead in Los Angeles. Thousands of homes and numerous schools were destroyed in a spate of fires from 2017-20, leaving residents to resurrect entire communities.\n\n\u201cThose first few weeks were surreal, almost primordial. It was like a bomb had gone off,\u201d said Andrew Bailey, head of Anova Center for Education, a private school in Sonoma County that serves special education students enrolled in public schools. Anova was destroyed in the 2017 Tubbs Fire, leaving its 125 students without a campus.\n\nThere was no school at all for three weeks while staff hunted for classroom space at other locations. Eventually they brought in portables and launched an ambitious fundraising campaign to pay for a new school. Last week, the new school finally opened \u2014 more than seven years after the fire.\n\n\u201cIt was miraculous that we were able to do this,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cIt was incredibly hard work, but now the headwinds have dissipated and our kids now have a great new school.\u201d\n\nAttending school at a hardware store\n\nIn Paradise, a Butte County town which was nearly entirely destroyed in the 2018 Camp Fire, the school district is still recovering. Four school sites were destroyed and nine were extensively damaged. A big obstacle in rebuilding, school officials said, was not knowing how many students to expect. More than 80% of the town burned down, and it was unclear how many residents planned to move back. Enrollment in Paradise Unified dropped from 3,500 before the fire to 1,500 in 2019. It\u2019s now up to 1,700.\n\nAlthough the state was helpful, the paperwork and funding process took time, Superintendent Tom Taylor said. Meanwhile, students attended school any place officials could find space: other school districts, some 20 miles away; warehouses; even a hardware store. (The store was cleared of merchandise. Students ate lunch at the check-out counter.)\n\nThe district has so far spent $155 million to rebuild campuses, but needs $150 million more to fix everything that needs fixing, Taylor said. The district is hoping to break ground on Paradise Elementary School, one of the schools that was completely destroyed.\n\n\u201cThere were a few years where all staff worked harder than we ever have. Long days, seven days a week, no time off,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019re still not done. \u2026 But our staff understands that schools are the center of a community, and we want our schools to help lead the return of the town.\u201d\n\nPrioritizing mental health\n\nIn some ways, Los Angeles schools will have it a bit easier than those in Sonoma and Butte. The state now has well-established disaster relief protocols, and there are plenty of experts who can advise. Because of COVID-19, most schools already have distance learning systems in place and robust social-emotional support for students.\n\nSupport for mental health \u2013 for staff as well as students \u2013 is a crucial piece of recovery, school officials in Sonoma and Butte said.\n\nIn Sonoma County, schools learned early on how to screen students for anxiety. They also created partnerships with local nonprofits and health clinics, and the County Office of Education trained teachers to lead class discussions and otherwise support students who felt traumatized by the fires.\n\n\u201cIn situations like this, you\u2019re never going to have enough money for one-to-one counseling for everyone who needs it,\u201d said Mary Champion, a school psychologist with the Sonoma County Office of Education. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to train educators, to take some of the pressure off clinicians.\u201d\n\nTyson Dickinson, director of the office\u2019s Department of Behavioral Health and Well-Being, said districts in Los Angeles should expect the recovery process \u2014 beyond the replacement of buildings \u2014 to take a long time. Sonoma County\u2019s last major fire was in 2020, and it\u2019s still never far from residents\u2019 minds.\n\n\u201cAny time it\u2019s windy, warm and dry, any time there\u2019s smoke, you can see the stress building,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cFrom August through January everyone is on edge. It\u2019s just a different world now.\u201d",

            "content": "In my view, it\u2019s critical that we stop thinking only about how companies will use the technology and instead ask ourselves how the supply chain, finance, or any other business functions will look and how they will define their roles in the future.\n\nThat said, AI is not yet mainstream. We know from the innovation adoption curve that usually only a few companies step ahead as innovators and early adopters. Those companies taking the first steps now, starting with exploring and testing AI features, are building up their competitive advantage.\n\nWe at SAP believe that three guiding principles will enable enterprises to get the most out of their generative AI implementations, both in the core and across business applications. First, AI must be relevant to businesses, so that it can drive immediate impact. Second, it must be reliable, so organizations can make confident AI-based decisions, grounded in business data. Third, AI must be responsible, based on the highest ethical, security, and privacy standards so that users can trust its output.\n\nWith those guiding principles in mind, companies should develop a clear strategy anchored in business goals. AI shouldn\u2019t be considered a stand-alone functionality, but rather an integral, embedded capability in all business processes to support a company\u2019s digital transformation.\n\nA good place to start is by asking these two questions: Where do we need additional decision-making support in our core business processes? And how can we use AI to make our employees more productive (do more with less), improve the quality of their work (do what they\u2019re doing even better), and even drive top-line growth?\n\nCustomers should prioritize their AI investments according to business value, which is why all of our use cases at SAP are reviewed and evaluated based on business value during the development process.\n\nOrganizations will measure the success of their AI investments in different ways, but a good place to start is, again, to see if AI is making your employees more productive, improving the quality of their work, or driving greater top-line growth.\n\nAI, and particularly generative AI, can increase employee productivity and efficiency. Especially in times of increasing pressure, a productivity tool like this can enable companies to stay competitive.\n\nWhat will likely distinguish success among those who adopt AI is not just how many AI features they start using but also the extent to which their AI, and specifically their digital assistant, understands their full business context. For instance, it\u2019s one thing to have an AI assistant tell you which location has the highest emissions. It\u2019s another for the tool to explain the factors that are contributing to those emissions\u2014and this is what will give a business a leading edge over competitors. The second agent understands that emissions are driven by supplier networks, transportation routes, transportation methods, vehicles, types of energy in your factories, materials procured, and much more.\n\nAnd by the way, much of that data sits in your enterprise resource planning system, which is why it\u2019s essential to have AI at the core of your business acting as a copilot that understands the full context of your business. That\u2019s what will differentiate companies from their competition.",

The rally that started in late 2022 has shown no signs of slowing down, with shares gaining 230% since then, including a 75% surge last year alone. This momentum repeatedly propelled SAP to fresh all-time highs throughout 2024, and there are plenty of reasons to think the story isn't over.\n\nThe German-headquartered SAP specializes in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and can boast of a 53-year history that has seen it acquire a market cap north of $300 billion. With just three weeks gone of the new year, 2025 is already shaping up to be another banner year for the company. Let's jump in and take a look.\n\nGet SAP alerts: Sign Up\n\nSAP's Fundamental Performance\n\nStarting with fundamentals, it has to be said that SAP's performance throughout 2024 was a mixed bag. Surprisingly, given the stock's stellar gains, its quarterly earnings weren't the consistent blowouts one might expect. For example, in October, SAP missed revenue expectations, while April's report fell short on both revenue and earnings. However, those misses didn't deter investors.\n\nHeading into SAP's first report of 2025 next week, expectations are high. Investors will be watching closely for another record revenue print and, ideally, beats on both headline numbers. The company can say that its revenue growth hit record highs during the year, and management's bullish stance, supported by multiple increases to forward guidance, suggests that the rally should continue gaining momentum from this.\n\nIs SAP Still a Buy? Analysts See Upside as 2025 Begins\n\nSAP Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$248.83\n\n-5.76% Downside Buy\n\nBased on 9 Analyst Ratings Current Price $264.05 High Forecast $330.00 Average Forecast $248.83 Low Forecast $38.00 SAP Stock Forecast Details\n\nOn the analyst's side, updates on SAP have been surprisingly sparse for a stock that has delivered such consistent gains, though still overwhelmingly bullish. The last notable updates came in October 2024, when a flurry of Overweight and Outperform reiterations followed the company's earnings. Since then, it's been quiet - until last week.\n\nSAP just received two fresh upgrades, with the teams over at Kepler Capital Markets and TD Cowen both upgrading their ratings from Hold to Buy. The results from a recent survey were singled out, as they suggested increasing demand for cloud-based ERP solutions, with AI advancements accelerating enterprise migrations.\n\nTD Cowen's new price target of $305 is well worth considering; from where the stock closed last night, that's a targeted upside of some 20%.\n\nAll-Time Highs: Should Investors Be Cautious About SAP Stock?\n\nIt can be scary, though, to buy into a stock that's trading at an all-time high. Despite its stellar performance, the company has struggled to consistently beat analyst expectations in its earnings report, a factor that would normally weigh heavily on a stock with such a strong rally behind it.\n\nIn another company, this inconsistency might have triggered a pullback. For SAP, though, bullish momentum and investor confidence have helped it dodge these pitfalls so far. That said, with shares trading at highs, new investors face the risk of being exposed to a potential earnings miss next week. At the same time, however, the increasing demand for ERP solutions and the recent upgrades suggest SAP is well-positioned for continued growth, and any pullback could be considered a solid entry opportunity.\n\nSAP\u2019s Technical Setup Suggests More Room to Run\n\nFrom a technical perspective, SAP's setup provides yet another reason for optimism. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 66, a bullish signal suggesting there's strong momentum with plenty of room for it to run before hitting overbought levels.\n\nAll in all, SAP is in a good spot heading into 2025. Wall Street was able to look past the inconsistent beats last year and focus instead on management's optimistic outlook, a trend that will be hard to change. The stock is also continuing to enjoy bullish ratings and updates from the analysts, with the fact that last week saw two teams remove their Hold ratings especially pertinent.\n\nInvestors should look for SAP shares to continue rallying into next week's report, with a beat likely to fuel further gains and a miss potentially setting up an attractive entry opportunity for those who are happy to buy into the company's longer-term potential.\n\nBefore you consider SAP, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and SAP wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile SAP currently has a Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

            "content": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at SAP ( ) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on SAP is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.15 = \u20ac7.8b \u00f7 (\u20ac70b - \u20ac19b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nTherefore, SAP has an ROCE of 15%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 15%.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for SAP compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nThings have been pretty stable at SAP, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So unless we see a substantial change at SAP in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why SAP is paying out 37% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWe can conclude that in regards to SAP's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 128% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.\n\nOn a separate note, we've found you'll probably want to know about.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free\n\nIf you're looking to trade SAP , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

            "content": "For legacy software, AI will drive several distinct trends, but not all of them center on AI. As a co-founder of a business specializing in legacy platform modernization, here are four key themes to watch over the course of 2025.\n\n4 Ways AI Will Affect Legacy Software Platforms Businesses will use Clean Core to migrate their custom code out of SAP. AIOps will continue to merge with IT operations. Organizations will finally catch their breath and adapt for AI. We\u2019ll see the second wave of data modernization.\n\nAI: An OverviewWhat Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\n\n1. Organizations Will Fully Embrace SAP Clean Core\n\nOne of the most significant trends in legacy software in recent years has been Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing\u2019s Clean Core initiative. The goal of Clean Core is to migrate custom code that businesses write themselves out of the SAP platform.\n\nEmbracing Clean Core is important for many reasons, but chief among them will be the ability of SAP customers to take full advantage of AI. SAP has indicated that it will steadily roll out new AI features and capabilities in the coming years, and each time they appear, users will need to upgrade to the latest SAP version to use the new AI offerings. When custom code is embedded in SAP, however, it complicates upgrades.\n\nClean Core ensures that organizations can access SAP\u2019s latest AI capabilities without their custom code preventing or slowing down successful upgrades.\n\nThe Clean Core initiative has been underway for several years, but to date, many of the businesses I work with have struggled to migrate their custom code out of SAP. This is understandable, because it\u2019s a complex process with each business facing a unique set of challenges.\n\nBut I foresee 2025 as the year when organizations finally start to address the big Clean Core migration hurdles they\u2019ve been facing. In short order, Clean Core will become the norm of the SAP world.\n\n2. IT Operations Will Keep Implementing AI Solutions\n\nEven before widespread generative AI technology, folks were talking a lot about AIOps: using AI to automate and scale complex IT processes (like identifying the root cause of a server failure or provisioning user access rights on demand).\n\nBut now that generative AI has entered the picture, IT tool vendors have access to a wide range of new types of AI-powered use cases. They can, for example, use AI to help customers formulate and execute plans for migrating from legacy platforms to the cloud or implementing initiatives like Clean Core.\n\nSince these processes involve parsing large volumes of data and making complex decisions, they are tedious and time-consuming to perform manually. AI can significantly streamline aspects of these operations. Although, don\u2019t expect AI to eliminate the need to keep skilled humans in the loop when managing complex, risky operations like platform migration.\n\n3. Business Processes Will Adapt for the AI Age\n\nBeyond the IT space and certain other niches, businesses adopting AI has been relatively limited. Generative AI has slipped into what Gartner calls the trough of disillusionment.\n\nI think the real challenge holding back use cases for AI in business is that business processes have not yet caught up with AI. To take full advantage of AI, companies need to do more than simply place AI tools in the hands of employees; they need to rethink the way employees work, too.\n\nFor example, if AI reduces the time it takes to complete a certain task by 90 percent, you need to reformulate your business process so that employees can efficiently repurpose all the time they save. Otherwise, AI simply shortens the duration of some workflows without creating real value.\n\nIt will take more than a year for businesses to make this pivot fully, but I suspect that 2025 will be the year when they\u2019ll start to make the major process changes necessary to enable AI use cases that extend beyond the simple chatbots and workflow automation we\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nMore on AIWhat Is AI Infrastructure?\n\n4. The Second Wave of Data Modernization Is Coming\n\nData modernization (the process of transforming data in ways that make it as useful as possible for a business) was a hot topic about a decade ago. Back then, big data was a big buzzword, and companies were investing in a new breed of data analytics, reporting and business intelligence solutions.\n\nBut given the proliferation of interest in AI, and the central role that high-quality data plays powering AI tools and services, I suspect we\u2019re in the early stages of second-wave data modernization. Whereas early data modernization initiatives centered on helping companies take stock of their data and use it for purposes like predictive analytics, the new wave of data modernization focuses on preparing data for use by AI.\n\nDoing so entails enhancing data quality like never before and working with new types of data, especially unstructured data, like documents or audio transcripts. These types of data are not as useful as structured data (like names and addresses in databases) for analytics, but they are key for tasks such as training chatbots.",

            "content": "Until recently, predicting outcomes in sports was usually based on historical data compiled from player and team statistics. This approach, however, can\u2019t guarantee outcomes; in fact, it often leads to dashed expectations and disappointing results.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of this predicament was the 2014 FIFA World Cup semi-final where Germany defeated Brazil 7-1. Traditional metrics favored Brazil, leaving the South American team stunned by their devastating loss and highlighting the inefficacy of existing statistical models in accurately representing team performance.\n\nThe Soccer Statistic You\u2019ve Never Heard\n\nStefan Reinartz, a former midfield Bundesliga player and UEFA Champions League competitor, cited that example on a recent panel discussion hosted by Soccerex Miami. After experiencing his own \u201cAha!\u201d moment, Reinartz became the founder of IMPECT, a German analytics company that revolutionized the role of statistics in the world of soccer.\n\nOptimize financial management, monetize content, enhance team performance, and quickly meet consumer expectations Learn how\n\n\u201cCommon soccer statistics like ball possession, winning tackles, running distance, and so on actually have no correlation to the end result,\u201d Reinartz said. \u201cI was quite shocked when I realized they really can\u2019t tell you anything about a player\u2019s or a team\u2019s performance.\u201d\n\nHe came to that realization when he read about the Moneyball approach, which uses advanced statistical analysis to acquire undervalued players and thus assemble a competitive team despite a limited budget.\n\n\u201cSome sports such as baseball may be more conducive to such a data-driven strategy, while others like soccer are more complex, making it difficult to create the right KPIs,\u201d he explained.\n\nSoccer is a low-scoring game involving 22 players in continuous action, requiring complex strategies and a lot of hard work to get past opponents to score. Apart from the number of goals and passes, individual statistics are almost nonexistent, making it challenging to create universally reliable metrics.\n\nRealizing that soccer statistics did not measure the true value of individual players changed his own assumptions. Together with another midfielder, Jens Hegeler, he founded IMPECT with the goal of developing soccer data that can be used to make valuable assessments of players and teams. They invented \u201cpacking\u201d to quantify the value of a pass or dribble.\n\nThe basic statistics in soccer, such as goals and assists, primarily reflect strikers and attacking midfielders, the players who do most of the scoring and assisting. Midfielders, who do most of the running and passing to initiate offensive moves, are seldom recognized statistically. What they do best is move the ball past opposition players. That is what packing measures.\n\nThe methodology is simple: Players earn a point for any move \u2014 a cross, a dribble, a long pass \u2014 that causes the ball to move past opposition players. Receivers also get points.\n\nToday, IMPECT is a thriving business collecting and selling packing data to help teams scout for players, analyze their own performance, and learn key facts about opponents.\n\nWhat\u2019s SAP Got to Do With It?\n\nDuring the discussion, Achim Ittner, vice president of Sports at SAP, described the company\u2019s journey from its roots in business software to developing specialized sports applications, emphasizing user-centric design and collaboration with renowned coaches and national teams.\n\n\u201cLike IMPECT, we\u2019ve been focused on developing data-driven solutions and relevant tools for sports clubs using direct feedback and a design thinking approach,\u201d Ittner said. He explained that SAP built a unified platform to address fragmented software ecosystems in sports. The platform integrates APIs and data sources to support processes like injury prevention, training recommendations, match preparation, and player well-being.\n\n\u201cSports analytics embodies the blend of data science and athletic performance, providing a blueprint to guide decisions made by coaches and trainers,\u201d he shared. \u201cThe significance of data in today\u2019s sports ecosystem cannot be overstated. It\u2019s necessary for everything from strategizing game plans to refining individual skills.\u201d\n\nSAP\u2019s engagement with IMPECT is just one example of how the compay collaborates with a variety of teams and experts to further shape its sports technology. New technologies \u2014 like social media, mobile, and digital capabilities, as well as sensors in player uniforms and equipment \u2014 are disrupting the sports industry. SAP is committed to helping sports organizations take advantage of these new innovations to deepen fan engagement, improve team performance, grow revenue faster, and efficiently operate their business and venues.\n\nBesides solutions for scouting and measuring team performance, SAP also has one for customer engagement and marketing. Afterall, the fan experience is just as important as the team\u2019s performance. The SAP Sports One solution provides a 360-degree view of each customer and fan to better target individual preferences and purchasing behaviors by offering personalized experiences over online, mobile, and social channels. Teams can grow their fan base, manage their merchandise, and increase loyalty with personalized rewards.\n\nDelivering the Experience\n\n\u201cA great sports experience is about so much more than winning the game,\u201d said Ittner. \u201cIt involves a mix of elements that includes players, spectators, and organizers.\u201d\n\nFor the fans, food and beverage, merchandise, a good streaming experience, and clear communications on schedules and navigating the venue are critical. Having the right players for a winning team and providing them with the best care and training before and after the game is the job of team management. And finally, the venue must provide exceptional facilities, infrastructure, safety, and security.\n\nSAP helps bring this all together, creating an intersection of sports, technology, and innovation.",

            "content": "Prince Tyagi |\n\nCorporate sustainability initiatives have emerged as a vital component of business operations. In such an environment, Prince Tyagi's pioneering SAP Transportation Management (TM) implementation at Coca-Cola serves as the benchmark to combine environmental responsibility with operational efficiency. His innovative solution answers one of the most daunting challenges facing the beverage industry today: accurately measuring and managing carbon footprint across complex global supply chains. Not only does the project demonstrate technical sophistication but also because it was done to transform the way one of the largest beverage companies in the world approaches the issue of sustainable transportation.\n\nWith the position of being the lead SAP Transportation Management consultant for this transformation project, Prince Tyagi realized the need to bring the transportation logistics together with sustainability reporting. His solution transformed how Coca-Cola tracks and manages its transportation-related carbon emissions and creates an integration between operational logistics and the measurement of its environmental impact. Every transportation resource is integration with sustainability parameter to calculate the carbon emission. Beyond mere compliance, Tyagi envisioned a system that would bring about meaningful change in the environment while driving the enhancement of operational efficiency.\n\nThe essence of Tyagi's innovation is a sophisticated system that automatically calculates carbon footprint data across all transportation activities. The architecture of the solution integrates multiple data points: vehicle types, fuel consumption, route optimization, and load efficiency. It provides real-time visibility into the environmental impact of every shipment. Interactive dashboards have been carefully designed to give stakeholders access to detailed sustainability metrics alongside traditional transportation KPIs for informed decision-making at every level of the organization.\n\nInteractive dashboards, developed by Prince Tyagi, represent a transportation management technology leap. It enables the decision-makers in route optimization for better environmental impact and tracks sustainability through detailed analytics. The system's intuitive interface brings such complex environmental data within ready reach of all the business functions. This introduces an overall culture of being environmentally responsible within that organization.\n\nThe standout feature of Tyagi's solution is its predictive analytics capability, which enables Coca-Cola to predict the environmental impact of different transportation scenarios. This forward-looking approach allows proactive decision-making in planning routes and choosing carriers to optimize cost efficiency and environmental impact. One of the key advantages the system has been providing in simulating different transportation strategies has been invaluable in helping the company achieve its sustainability goals while maintaining operational excellence.\n\nThe system's success is in the seamless integration with existing SAP modules, making sustainability considerations part of daily transportation planning rather than an afterthought. Prince Tyagi's understanding of both transportation logistics and environmental metrics helped him develop a solution that addresses the complex interplay between operational efficiency and environmental responsibility. His innovative approach has set new standards for sustainable transportation management in the beverage industry.\n\nBeyond Coca-Cola, this development has important implications, with other big business corporations that have been focusing on improving their environmental responsibility endeavors, reviewing Tyagi's solution. His work proves how, through technology advancement, two objectives could be met- one being business-related and the other environmental-in creating a benchmark for all organizations seeking to achieve sustainability objectives.\n\nIts ripple effect grows to this date as increasing more organizations consider embracing sustainable metrics integration with their transport management system. Prince Tyagi's work experience at Coca- Cola, working on leveraging technology in pursuing environmental accountability without being on the sidelines of maintaining their operational prowess, becomes the archetype for businesses to operate technology in accomplishing their obligations and responsibility. The fact that this has been very much a technical success of project implementation besides achieving meaningful changes towards corporate practices about sustainability underpins the sustainability journey.\n\nAbout Prince Tyagi\n\nA pioneer in the SAP implementation, Prince Tyagi has carved out himself with innovative work in transport logistics and maintenance solutions. The way he approaches carrier selection networks, especially in his experience of managing complex global operations for Apple, depicts his ability to meet complex business challenges. He has led multiple digital transformations for Fortune 500 companies as a solution architect. He has stayed committed to sustainability and operational excellence as he has continued in his quest for excellence in multiple SAP modules, including TM, PM-CS, and iMRO.",

            "content": "Project description by 3XN\n\nBuilt on the site of the former Olympic Velodrome and with Frei Otto and G\u00fcnther Behnisch's iconic Olympic Stadium as its neighbour, the new SAP Garden arena is informed by the legacy of its location and surroundings. The 62,500m\u00b2 arena project is designed by 3XN in collaboration with CL MAP and landscape architects Latz + Partner for client Red Bull.\n\n\"We are pleased to be opening the new SAP Garden arena, marking a new era for sport in the city of Munich,\" says Jan Ammundsen, Senior Partner at 3XN. \"The project has been a meaningful opportunity for us to extend the architectural legacy of the Olympic Park. It was important for our design to fit the modern sports facility into the existing, historic Olympic Park in a seamless way. We hope that it will become a focal point that gathers locals to experience and take part in sports.\"\n\nThe sports arena is the new home of ice hockey team EHC Red Bull Munich and basketball team Bayern Munich while three additional ice rinks serve as training and public facilities. The bowl can gather up to 10,700 spectators for ice hockey and 11,500 for basketball. Beyond the sports facilities, the arena offers three levels of VIP areas, merchandise shops, a large restaurant, a gaming room, offices and conference rooms, a parking garage and a public rooftop terrace.\n\nSAP Garden, a new arena in Munich's Olympic Park, by 3XN. Photograph Rasmus Hjortshoj.\n\nMelting into its historical context\n\nAdding a new structure into Behnisch & Partner's protected Olympic Park landscape posed a complex design challenge: how to respect the integrity of the park while also accommodating the significant spatial needs of the world class sport facility? To solve this, the design team concealed the arena's three additional ice rinks underneath an artificial hill that organically continues the park's existing pathways and landscape design. The arena itself is oval-shaped and asymmetrical in both its height and shape, forming an organic appearance which together with a green roof lets the building melt into the park and the cityscape.\n\n\"The Olympic Park is both in its architecture and landscape designed around the human scale,\" says Ammundsen. \"The sports facilities are nestled in the green terrain which rolls and undulates around the now iconic structures. SAP Garden is designed with careful consideration for these existing characteristics to both preserve and also add a new element to the uniquely harmonious relationship between the buildings and the park.\"\n\nThe arena's fa\u00e7ade is dynamic and welcoming with vertical pilaster strips that swing upwards and accentuate the glass-panelled entrances. Each of the 260 pilaster strips are unique in their geometry with the largest being over 18 metres tall and weighing one ton. This gives the building a dynamic fa\u00e7ade expression \u2013 at the same time simple and complex.\n\nSAP Garden, a new arena in Munich's Olympic Park, by 3XN. Photograph Rasmus Hjortshoj.\n\nPlace for the public\n\nSAP Garden is designed as a catalyst for activity - both on game days and 'off days'. As a sports arena, it is a destination for the many with the ability to house ice hockey, basketball and a multitude of third-party events. On days with no official activities, it remains a place full of life. Beyond serving as training facilities for the professional players, the arena's three additional ice rinks are built from the vision of improving the local sports infrastructure. All year round the rinks are open for schools, clubs and the public to use, becoming a place that gathers and strengthens local grassroots sports.\n\nAbove ground, sports fans can browse the merchandise shops while the e-sport community gains a home with the ambitious Gaming Garden - the new gaming hotspot for southern Germany. A restaurant with both indoor and outdoor service lets life unfold between the internal and external spaces while the top of the arena is a new destination for Munich with a rooftop terrace that invites everyone to enjoy the views over the park and cityscape.\n\n\"We focused very much on what will happen on the ice or on the parquet floor. What happens here is the reason why you come to the building, and we wanted to create an atmosphere of intensity,\" explains Ammundsen. \"Of course, it is also essential that the architecture is clear and intuitive enough that people are able to find their way quickly and move around without difficulty. But when you are sitting in your seat watching the game, the building should fade into the background. Then it is all about the atmosphere.\"\n\nSAP Garden, a new arena in Munich's Olympic Park, by 3XN. Photograph Rasmus Hjortshoj.\n\nA unique, full-scope arena design\n\nSAP Garden is at the forefront of arena designs, shaped to create an intense atmosphere and fan experience while being adaptive to its shifting purposes. Switching between an ice rink and a basketball court is a complicated matter as the two are different sizes. To accommodate this and ensure courtside seating for both sports, a unique stand-system has been developed. The existing stands can be shifted in height and slope while mobile stands are added for basketball games, placed on top of the covered rink, to create more seating.\n\n3XN's scope also includes the interior design where the use of digital media and light creates a flexible colour palette that can change the ambience of the arena in line with the branding or occasion. As such, the interior is centred around variety of atmospheres and identities. Areas and rooms are individual in their design which lets the users have unique experiences throughout the building. At the same time, all spaces have small design elements in common that tie the building together as a whole, creating an interior that is both cohesive and playful.\n\n\"There is a reason why we go to arenas, why it is so important to be able to go in person: we want to experience a feeling. I believe that this feeling only arises when we experience something together,\" explains Ammundsen. \"As architects, we want to help make this feeling in the hall as intense and exciting as possible. There are good tools for doing that: sound technology, lighting technology. The main thing is that the experience is something that is special, something that you cannot have anywhere else.\"\n\nSAP Garden is 3XN's third completed sports arena, following Royal Arena and Horsens Stadium in Denmark. The grand opening of the arena takes place on September 27 with an ice hockey game between the four-time German champions EHC Red Bull Munich and the Buffalo Sabres from the National Hockey League (NHL).",

            "content": "Maniruddin Banshi, 59, and his family of seven, pack up their lives in November every year and leave their native village in West Bengal\u2019s Bishnupur, South 24 Parganas district, to settle in a shack beside a road near Jaynagar, a town in the same district in Sundarbans, 65 kilometres away from Kolkata. Maniruddin has been making this journey for the past 42 years with his wife Mabia. Here, for four months, they tap palm trees for sap and boil it to make liquid jaggery. This is the only labour they are sure of, in the year.\n\nAs the temperature drops to 10 degrees Celsuis, the winter air is heavy with fog. Maniruddin wakes up at 2 a.m., wearing a thin lungi and a vest, and swiftly walks out of his hut made of dry date palm leaves. The Banshi family says the leaves don\u2019t keep the cold out, but it is their traditional practice that brings them back every year.\n\nManiruddin and Mabia work harmoniously together, not saying much to each other. Mabia says, \u201cI boil the sap that my husband brings back and make gur. The cold that makes the sap and jaggery sweeter also makes it harder for us to survive in these wobbly huts.\u201d\n\nEvery year, hundreds of shiulis (sap collectors) make the journey from their native villages from across West Bengal for areas like Jaynagar, Belpahari, Nadia, for four months in winter to produce the sought-after date palm jaggery. But their craft is facing an uncertain future due to urbanisation and changes in weather patterns.\n\nIn addition, its growing popularity across the country, with celebrity chefs like Ranveer Brar and Bollywood stars like Alia Bhatt talking about it on their social media channels, has pushed producers to compromise on quality. Nolen gur is used in Bengali households for sweets like pithas and payesh during Sankranti, the winter harvest festival in January.\n\nBefore the sun rises\n\nManiruddin knows these roads like the back of his hand. Light on his feet, he glides through the farmlands of Jaynagar to find the 600 trees he has leased this winter. In the darkness, there\u2019s only the rustle of dry leaves under his feet. He climbs a 15-foot tall date palm tree in five minutes to bring down a clay pot filled with khejur rosh (sap). At the top, he makes small incisions on the bark with his dabali (sickle) and quickly positions another pot. Even before the first light of day, three shiulis will have together collected about 300 pots of sap.\n\nAs the world sleeps, the shiulis begin the delicate task of boiling the freshly collected sap before it starts to ferment. By 4 a.m., large clay fires are lit, and wide iron vessels are placed atop the fire. The sap must be boiled continuously, with constant stirring, to ensure it thickens into golden jaggery that smells of sweetness. The entire process demands patience and precision, as even slight overcooking can spoil the batch. By dawn, the liquid thickens.\n\nMono, as Maniruddin\u2019s friends call him, is one of the oldest shiulis (sap collectors) in Jaynagar. He is accompanied by two of his associates who have learnt the craft from him over the years. They climb trees, tie pots, collect sap, boil, and repeat. For the rest of the year, Mono, his friends and family fish, farm, or do other odd jobs.\n\nIt is not the hardship that Maniruddin endures every day which makes him sad, but the fact that he could be the last of the shiulis of Jaynagar. \u201cWhen a shiuli dies in a home, another shiuli does not take birth there anymore. This is a tough job; the next generation does not want to take the strain of following these traditions. My art will die with me. The art I learnt from my forefathers,\u201d he says.\n\nJaynagar is known for a its moa, a soft, round, moist seasonal sweet made with the local nolen gur and puffed rice made from the Kanakchur heirloom variety. The delicacy, synonymous with Bengali winter, got a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2015.\n\nGen next\n\nAlmost 250 km away, Gulam Mustafa Khan, 61, and his fellow sap collectors face a similar battle in Jhargram district\u2019s Belpahari area. Most men who collect sap with Gulam are residents of Taldangra, in Bankura district. Every November, they migrate to different parts of Jhargram to collect date palm sap and make jaggery. They also live in similar looking homes, called gurmohol (jaggery hut). Gulam travels with his two sons and wants them to continue this practice after him. But he is not hopeful.\n\n\u201cWho likes to do this work like a monkey? Climbing trees. It is too risky with the fear of elephants, tigers, snakes. If we had better employment would we continue?\u201d he says.\n\nAmid the dense jungles of Belpahari, 200 km away from Kolkata, right beside the highway, Gulam, Ansar Ali Khan, Islam Nabi Khan, and many others have set up their huts. The huts take three days to build, but they break it before every season of sap collection ends and it is time for them to leave. They are only seasonal settlers after all. They come to Belpahari because the story goes that this region has the sweetest nolen gur in the southern part of West Bengal.\n\nHigh demand, diminishing quality\n\nThe number of date palm trees is reducing every year due to urbanisation and associated deforestation. An experienced shiuli like Gulam points out that due to high demand of nolen gur, people are cutting holes in trees every year to extract sap, but in an ideal situation the trees need two to three years of rest after every season to keep offering the sweet sap. \u201cThe trees here are asking us to give them some rest. We know them like our children,\u201d Gulam says, sighing.\n\nSaddam Hussain Khan, a 42-year-old shiuli from Belpahari becomes teary-eyed as he recalls how city dwellers drive by their huts in winter and buy nolen gur, but never without bargaining. He adds, \u201cThey do not respect us, our labour, or the hardships we endure to get the nolen gur to their plates. They come in their big cars and think we are charging them extra. Would any of them put in the same labour for the same money? Just because we are poor, it is acceptable to disrespect our work.\u201d\n\nSaddam and other shiulis typically lease around 200 trees for \u20b9150 per tree or offer 2 kg of gur per season to the tree owners. A team of three or four people earn approximately \u20b940,000 over four months, which families live on. While the collectors sell gur for \u20b960\u2013130 per kg, it fetches \u20b9200\u2013600 in Kolkata markets, and online prices can exceed \u20b9800 per kg for organic varieties.\n\nManiruddin also says that rising average temperatures in winter have made the sap less sweet; the quantity of sap too has reduced drastically.\n\nBhabani Shankar, a retired engineer and the Chief Advisor to Mishti Udyog, an association to bring together the sweet sellers of the State, says adulteration of nolen gur has become a reality.\n\nIn the Jaynagar area, they had taken an initiative in 2021 along with the local administration to plant around 2,000 date palm trees to promote nolen gur. The trees did not survive due to the hurried plantation.\n\nCollateral damage\n\nLegacy Jaynagar moa maker and owner of Binapani Mishtanna Bhandar in Baharu of Jaynagar block, Mahadeb Das, 75, whose family business started around 1910s, says that the taste of his family\u2019s creation is changing over time. Mahadeb has battled poverty and worked as a child alongside his father. He remembers his father making the moas with their fragrant nolen gur fresh from the clay ovens and heading out on local trains to sell them in Kolkata. He picked up the skills through observation and has carried on the legacy ever since.\n\nGanesh Das, Mahadeb\u2019s son, says that no matter how hard he has tried to hold on to the legacy, he has had to accept over the years that every harvester now adds sugar to the nolen gur to keep up with the high market demand, harsh working conditions, and low reward. \u201cManiruddin and his family have been supplying nolen gur to our business for over 20 years, but the quality has deteriorated over the years,\u201d says Ganesh.\n\nCustomers too have registered a fall in the quality of West Bengal\u2019s date palm jaggery. Recently, the Sealdah Division of Eastern Railway started \u2018one station one product\u2019 on the busy Sealdah railway line, selling Jaynagar moa. The operators of the stall say that since people are assured of the quality, the shop has started selling over 50 kg of sweets in just a few weeks.\n\nBhabani, a resident of Jaynagar himself who has seen the change in the quality of gur over the decades, says, \u201cThe market is filled with fake products. There is even a nolen gur fragrance, which fools people,\u201d he says.\n\nNilanjan Mishra, a scholar who works closely with the farmers and harvesters of West Bengal says, \u201cWe need to collectivise the shiulis to address their issues and struggles of sustainability. If we fail to do that, their artform \u2014and our beloved nolen gur, which is a cultural heritage \u2014 will also die.\u201d Mishra also feels that more research needs to be commissioned on why and how climate change is affecting this industry and what steps can be taken for its conservation.",

            "content": "As investors seek assets that will shine under a Donald Trump presidency, one corner of the US stock market expected to benefit from the Republican's policies has been stumbling.\n\nShares of smaller US companies have been under pressure, with the small-cap Russell 2000 last week marking a 10 per cent correction from its November highs. The S&P 500, the benchmark for large-cap companies, declined less than three per cent in that time.\n\nTrump, who will be inaugurated for his second term on Monday, is expected to back an agenda promoting domestic economic growth, increasing the appeal of small-cap stocks.\n\nBut the group encountered a severe headwind in recent weeks: the prospect of higher interest rates than previously expected, which stand to raise borrowing costs that hit smaller companies particularly hard.\n\n\u201cWith more pro-growth policies, small caps tend to do better in theory when the economy is stronger,\u201d said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.\n\n\u201cYou almost have this tug of war,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cOn one side, stronger growth should be good for small caps. On the other side, high interest rates are negative.\u201d\n\nSmall caps and equities broadly won some relief this week from an encouraging inflation report that calmed surging Treasury yields.\n\nThe focus on small caps comes as investors look for \u201cTrump trades\u201d that have room to run.\n\nThe overall stock market has given up some gains since Trump's Nov 5 victory, when investors were enthused about his pro-growth agenda benefiting equities broadly. The S&P 500 is up 3 per cent since the election.\n\nSome Trump trades continue to thrive. Shares of Tesla , led by Trump backer Elon Musk, have gained over 60 per cent since Nov 5. Bitcoin, which is expected to benefit from a friendlier crypto regulatory environment, is up over 40 per cent.\n\nSmall caps, however, have pulled back. The Russell 2000 index surged nearly 6 per cent on the day after Trump's win. Later in November, it hit its highest closing level in three years. Now the index is little changed since the election.\n\nAn expectation of fewer interest rate cuts this year has dampened sentiment for small caps, with the Federal Reserve in December projecting less easing as it raised its estimate for inflation in 2025.\n\nTreasury yields have surged. This week, the benchmark 10-year yield hit a 14-month high.\n\nSmaller companies \u201ctend to have greater debt loads...so not getting the follow-through with lower interest rates is something that sort of poured a bit of cold water\u201d on hopes for small-cap strength, said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management.\n\nThe Russell 2000 surged following Trump's 2016 election and the index kept outperforming the S&P 500 in the year following his first victory, rising 24 per cent against a 21 per cent for the large-cap index.\n\nUnder Trump, the prospect of reduced regulations and promotion of domestic business should benefit smaller companies, whose businesses tend to be more US-focused than larger, multi-national corporations, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nBut while the group's outlook improves under Trump compared to his predecessor Joe Biden, the incoming president's favoring of tariffs could cause problems for smaller companies if they disrupt supply chains, Samana said.\n\n\u201cThere will be some things that are helpful under the Trump administration... but there will also be some negatives,\u201d Samana said.\n\nSmall-cap bulls are counting on some catch-up. The S&P 500's nearly 50 per cent gain over the past two years is more than double the rise for the Russell 2000.\n\nStill, small caps could face headwinds if interest rates keep rising. Small-cap indexes tend to be more highly weighted toward financials and industrials, sectors that are relatively more sensitive to higher rates and inflation, according to Truist's Lerner.\n\nThe Russell 2000 held a 37 per cent weight with those two sectors as of the end of 2024, compared to a roughly 22 per cent for those groups in the large-cap S&P 500.\n\nTrump's arrival presents an opportunity for small caps, BMO's Ma said, \u201cbut that thesis for outperforming probably hinges more on a favorable interest rate environment.\u201d",

Show more The Global Alliance for Social Entrepreneurship is one of the largest multi-stakeholder collaborations in the social innovation sector. The Alliance has 100 members \u2013 corporations, investors, philanthropists, governments, researchers, media, and industry actors \u2013 who work together to build an engaged ecosystem of key public and private sector leaders in support of a social innovation movement that transforms society to be more just, sustainable and equitable. Launched in response to the COVID-19 crisis by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship together with Ashoka, Catalyst2030, Echoing Green, GHR Foundation, Skoll Foundation, and Yunus Social Business in April 2020. In that pursuit, the Global Alliance will continue to mobilise a trusted community of leaders together with core partners - SAP, Bayer Foundation, Motsepe Foundation, GHR Foundation, Porticus, Deloitte, Microsoft and Catalyst 2030, that acts and learns together so that social entrepreneurs can flourish. Contact us to get involved.\n\nThe growing field of social entrepreneurship\n\nThe findings revealed that social enterprises are not just impactful, but also an economic force. Approximately 10 million social enterprises worldwide are employing 200 million people \u2013 6% of the global formal job market \u2013 and $2 trillion in annual revenues, surpassing the size of the global fashion industry.\n\nEarly insights from the soon to be published European Social Enterprise Monitor now reveal more detailed information about the demographics and behaviours of established social entrepreneurs. Social enterprises are already highly engaged in social procurement, selling their goods and services to businesses or governments. Over 50% are selling to governments, 70% to businesses, and close to 30% to multinational corporations.\n\nSocial procurement\n\nRecognizing this critical role of social procurement in social entrepreneurship, members of the Schwab Foundation\u2019s Global Alliance for Social Entrepreneurship collaborated with Austria-based technology company Prewave to analyze over 150,000 supply chain events (January 2023 to October 2024).\n\nThe report outlines top categories of critical supply chain events included:\n\n\n\nLegal disputes (e.g., lawsuits, investigations, sanctions) at 26%.\n\nSocial disruptions (e.g., protests, labor strikes) at 19%.\n\nEnvironmental disruptions (e.g., severe weather, floods) at 13%.\n\nHealth and safety concerns (e.g., injuries, fatalities) at 11%.\n\nCriminal activity (e.g. fraud, corruption, or theft) at 9%\n\nOctober 2024 marked an absolute high of social disruptions, with 1,268 supply chain events driven by social factors. Industries most affected by social issues included transportation and logistics, automotive, metals & minerals, utilities, food & beverage, and retail.\n\nThese findings underscore the urgency of linking procurement strategies to social impact. Buying from social entrepreneurs is a practical pathway to resilience and value creation, as demonstrated by numerous case studies outlined in the report. Beyond the quantitative data, the report also highlights new regulatory developments and financial innovations that support social impact in supply chains. It features 10 country and regional profiles -specific studies from Latin America, North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, offering a global perspective on the potential of social procurement.\n\nData and insights that drive impact\n\nFor 2025, the Schwab Foundation has launched a new collaboration with the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and a range of ecosystem actors to surface further longitudinal insights on social and environmental priorities and behaviours among entrepreneurs around the world. The data surfaced through this work will indicate whether the principles of social entrepreneurship continue to transform the mainstream business world.\n\nThis growing body of evidence shows that social innovation has become a transformative force for sustainable development. As partnerships deepen across sectors and geographies, social enterprises can further scale their impact \u2013 just like Industree Foundation or Rangsutra improved livelihoods for thousands of women artisans by selling high-quality textile products to IKEA and others.\n\nAt the same time, companies like AXA integrate social innovation into their core business, developing affordable insurance products for 14 million people in low- and middle-income countries. Others, like SAP, are strengthening the ecosystem for social procurement by integrating novel verification processes for social enterprises in the supplier platform Arbia. The Rise Ahead Pledge, the Corporate Leadership Council, and the growing community of Schwab Foundation social innovators are signs of hope that we can leverage business means to address our key issues and lead systems change globally.",

The S&P 500, the benchmark for large-cap companies, declined less than 3% in that time.Trump, who will be inaugurated for his second term on Monday, is expected to back an agenda promoting domestic economic growth , increasing the appeal of small-cap stocks But the group encountered a severe headwind in recent weeks: the prospect of higher interest rates than previously expected, which stand to raise borrowing costs that hit smaller companies particularly hard.\"With more pro-growth policies, small caps tend to do better in theory when the economy is stronger,\" said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.\"You almost have this tug of war,\" Lerner said. \"On one side, stronger growth should be good for small caps. On the other side, high interest rates are negative.\"Small caps and equities broadly won some relief this week from an encouraging inflation report that calmed surging Treasury yields.The focus on small caps comes as investors look for \"Trump trades\" that have room to run.The overall stock market has given up some gains since Trump's Nov 5 victory, when investors were enthused about his pro-growth agenda benefiting equities broadly. The S&P 500 is up 3% since the election.Some Trump trades continue to thrive. Shares of Tesla , led by Trump backer Elon Musk, have gained over 60% since Nov 5. Bitcoin, which is expected to benefit from a friendlier crypto regulatory environment, is up over 40%.Small caps, however, have pulled back. The Russell 2000 index surged nearly 6% on the day after Trump's win. Later in November, it hit its highest closing level in three years. Now the index is little changed since the election.An expectation of fewer interest rate cuts this year has dampened sentiment for small caps, with the Federal Reserve in December projecting less easing as it raised its estimate for inflation in 2025.Treasury yields have surged. This week, the benchmark 10-year yield hit a 14-month high.Smaller companies \"tend to have greater debt loads...so not getting the follow-through with lower interest rates is something that sort of poured a bit of cold water\" on hopes for small-cap strength, said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management The Russell 2000 surged following Trump's 2016 election and the index kept outperforming the S&P 500 in the year following his first victory, rising 24% against a 21% for the large-cap index.Under Trump, the prospect of reduced regulations and promotion of domestic business should benefit smaller companies, whose businesses tend to be more U.S.-focused than larger, multi-national corporations, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.But while the group's outlook improves under Trump compared to his predecessor Joe Biden, the incoming president's favoring of tariffs could cause problems for smaller companies if they disrupt supply chains, Samana said.\"There will be some things that are helpful under the Trump administration... but there will also be some negatives,\" Samana said.Small-cap bulls are counting on some catch-up. The S&P 500's nearly 50% gain over the past two years is more than double the rise for the Russell 2000.Still, small caps could face headwinds if interest rates keep rising. Small-cap indexes tend to be more highly weighted toward financials and industrials, sectors that are relatively more sensitive to higher rates and inflation, according to Truist's Lerner.The Russell 2000 held a 37% weight with those two sectors as of the end of 2024, compared to a roughly 22% for those groups in the large-cap S&P 500.Trump's arrival presents an opportunity for small caps, BMO's Ma said, \"but that thesis for outperforming probably hinges more on a favorable interest rate environment.\"",

            "content": "Infor Nexus, the single-instance supply chain network platform providing visibility and collaboration, recently announced NexTrace. This solution is designed to improve customer transparency and provide a competitive advantage. With the EU Digital Product Passport (DPP) set to take effect in 2027, some companies are preparing now by implementing traceability solutions. NexTrace aims to give customers a head start to meet regulatory requirements like the EU DPP and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).\n\nNexTrace provides end-to-end transparency by seamlessly tracking raw material through to finished products and beyond, ensuring full traceability throughout the entire supply chain journey. It integrates supplier ESG data and certificates for a holistic view of sustainability and compliance information. Leveraging AI technology and a supplier-centric philosophy, NexTrace simplifies the data collection process, ensuring accuracy and compliance.\n\n\u201cLast June, we launched Map and Trace, which empowers our customers to map their supply chains and collect documentation from multiple supplier tiers. Map and Trace provides evidence of chain of custody compliance with regulations such as the US UFLPA and the French AGEC law. With NexTrace, we\u2019re taking this to the next level by proactively gathering full-scale item-level traceability from each tier of the supply chain. This will help our customers to not only meet upcoming regulations like the EU Digital Product Passport but also gain a competitive edge by providing comprehensive data on their products\u2019 journey, composition, and sustainability,\u201d said Brian Carelli, Infor VP, Sustainability and Partnerships.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nMeeting regulatory and consumer demands for product traceability requires collaboration across supply chain tiers. By connecting to Infor Nexus, companies gain a head start, leveraging an established ecosystem of over 94,000 brands, retailers, and suppliers already on the platform. Managing traceability and chain-of-custody data alongside existing supply chain processes on a unified platform can accelerate progress, boost efficiency, and reduce reliance on multiple systems.\n\nNexTrace capability highlights:\n\nEnables seamless lot and item-level tracing by tracking the movement of raw material lots and batches through their conversion into finished products\n\nLeverages AI to collect data from the multiple tiers of suppliers, while automatically associating transactions from one tier to the next, helping to reduce the burden on suppliers and increase data accuracy and tracing efficiency\n\nAllows suppliers to upload data from existing reports in one step, rather than necessitating manual data entry\n\nRFID scanning of serialized barcodes at source automatically links the multi-tier chain of custody data\n\nIntegrates supplier ESG data and certificates with traceability information, providing a comprehensive view of sustainability and compliance throughout the supply chain\n\nCreates a digital link and visualization to share traceability and product information with consumers, enhancing transparency and trust throughout the supply chain\n\nTracing data automatically updates the network graph creating linkages between products and materials providing a higher fidelity map of your supply chain network\n\n\u201cVendors will be eager to tout their Digital Product Passport solutions at NRF, but their focus is often on flashy features, rather than the minutiae of how to feed such data-hungry systems. At NRF, we look forward to demonstrating how trace data is built and how to scale a system of this magnitude,\u201d said Carelli.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nTraceability is a well-timed capability amidst increasingly regulated supply chains. Supply chain traceability solutions play a crucial role in helping companies meet existing and upcoming regulatory requirements by providing end-to-end visibility, data accuracy, and compliance assurance. Regulations such as the EU Digital Product Passport (DPP), the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) require businesses to track the origin, movement, and handling of goods across global supply chains. Traceability solutions, powered by blockchain, IoT, and AI-driven analytics, enable companies to document product journeys, verify ethical sourcing, and ensure regulatory compliance with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. For example, pharmaceutical firms must comply with the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), requiring digital serialization and tracking of prescription drugs. Similarly, food and beverage companies must meet FSMA traceability mandates by 2026 to prevent contamination and enhance food safety. As governments worldwide tighten regulations on sustainability, labor rights, and product safety, businesses investing in robust traceability systems can avoid fines, reduce supply chain risks, and build consumer trust. By 2026, supply chain software solutions that do not offer built-in traceability will struggle to comply with regulatory requirements. And by 2027, traceability will be a standard expectation for enterprise procurement and supply chain solutions. And by 2028, AI- and IoT-based traceability solutions will be a base feature in all major SCM platforms.\n\nNexTrace adoption will be accelerated by the existing Infor Nexus platform. Infor Nexus already connects over 94,000 brands, suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers, making it easier for businesses to onboard NexTrace without having to build new integrations from scratch. So companies already using Infor Nexus for supply chain execution can seamlessly activate NexTrace without major reconfiguration. Also NexTrace leverages real-time data flows from Infor Nexus, ensuring traceability is embedded within existing logistics, procurement, and compliance processes. So, a retailer tracking sustainability compliance for its suppliers can extend traceability within the same Nexus Control Center dashboard. NexTrace benefits from Infor\u2019s cloud-first architecture, meaning companies using Infor CloudSuite ERP can integrate traceability directly into their finance, procurement, and logistics modules. For instance, fashion and apparel brands can track organic certifications and ESG compliance through an automated traceability workflow. Unlike siloed ERP solutions, Infor Nexus operates as a multi-enterprise business network (MEBN), enabling real-time data exchange across partners. As such, automotive companies can track material sourcing and carbon emissions through collaborative tracking on Nexus.\n\nTraceability will transform supply chain professionals from reactive managers to strategic decision-makers. Roles like supply chain, logistics, and procurement managers will evolve significantly as traceability enters the mainstream. Instead of waiting for supplier updates, a supply chain manager will be able to instantly verify if raw materials meet ESG compliance. Similarly, if a key supplier is flagged for non-compliance, the traceability system will suggest alternative sources in real time. Digital records of product movement will ensure adherence to regulations, and the system will automatically generate compliance reports instead of requiring manual audits. IoT integration with traceability systems will provide logistics managers with a live digital twin of shipments, ensuring immediate updates. So, if a temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical shipment deviates from the required temperature range, an alert will be triggered. Also, AI-driven root cause analysis will identify logistics disruptions before they escalate. If a port delay occurs, the system will automatically suggest rerouting options. And a logistics manager will be able to compare CO\u2082 emissions for different shipping routes to meet sustainability goals. On the procurement side, managers will be able to instantly see whether a supplier complies with Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) before signing a contract. And AI-powered risk scoring will help select low-risk, high-reliability suppliers. Traceability systems will be able to rank suppliers based on sustainability, on-time delivery, and compliance records.",

            "content": "It\u2019s wrap on NRF, and it is no surprise that customer engagement and artificial intelligence (AI) were top of mind for most retailers. This furthers SAP\u2019s commitment to delivering compelling innovation that empowers our customers to deliver the best customer experience.\n\nWe are leaving the biggest retail event of the year with so much excitement for what\u2019s to come for the SAP Customer Experience portfolio this year. Here\u2019s a look into SAP CX innovations for 2025.\n\nPut the customer at the center of your business: Deploy industry-tailored CX solutions from SAP Learn how\n\nData-Driven Loyalty Management Solution\n\nWe announced a new loyalty management solution that helps brands earn the loyalty of their customers using experiential journeys and personalized, real-time offers.\n\nCreating loyalty is key to profitable growth; however, lasting loyalty has been illusive to many brands. According to the SAP Emarsys Customer Loyalty Index, there are diverse motivations among consumers that drive brand loyalty. Forty-percent credit their loyalty to long-standing reputations, 30 percent say brand consistency is what brings them back, and 22 percent say it\u2019s because of a brands iconic status. Yet, despite this loyalty, only 17 percent of consumers feel \u201ctruly valued,\u201d leaving the majority wanting more.\n\nHelping consumers feel truly valued is no small feat. Traditional reward redemption methods focus only on customers who actively join loyalty programs, and that is no longer enough. Brands are innovating loyalty programs to create a sense of nostalgia, community, and devotion that delivers a memorable experience through personalized offers across the entire life cycle and on every channel.\n\nThe new loyalty solution from SAP aims to equip organizations with experiential journeys and personalized, real-time offers to help earn customer loyalty through integration with the SAP Commerce Cloud, SAP Service Cloud, SAP Emarsys and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, retail, fashion, and vertical business solutions. Key features that enable this are:\n\nLoyalty profiles that connect every shopper with a cloud-based loyalty wallet, facilitating targeted and personalized offers, entitlements, and real-time basket analysis\n\nMulti-brand loyalty management, as well as shared loyalty programs with partners that centralize loyalty programs across regions and markets, enabling combined brand programs for gaining market share\n\nA single place for omnichannel promotion planning with real-time redemption to deliver any type of offer, digital payment, and gifting to all customers on any channel\n\nLoyalty journey planning that delivers experiential omnichannel journeys tailored to customer needs through personalized commerce, marketing, service, and retail interactions\n\nQuantifiable metrics that track promotion performance and loyalty-related liabilities, linking to financial systems to measure ROI, and enable settlements with the member and partner brands\n\nWe are currently recruiting customers for a lighthouse program, and interested customers can learn more by contacting Yaron Gur-Ari. The solution is expected to be available in the second half of 2025.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Makes Shopping Frictionless\n\nWe are also launching an AI shopping assistant to make e-commerce search and discovery a lot easier for customers.\n\nSearch abandonment is a real challenge. According to a 2023 Google research report, retailers face more than a $2 trillion loss when shoppers cannot find what they are looking for on a retailer\u2019s website. And to add insult to injury, search challenges also serve a huge blow to customer loyalty, with 78 percent of consumers viewing brands differently and 82 percent of consumers saying that they would avoid websites where they\u2019ve experienced search difficulties.\n\nWith the AI shopping assistant, users can now deliver that white-glove experience to their customers online. For industrial buyers, it acts as a technical specialist \u2014 helping source specific replacement parts, comparing complex specifications, and suggesting compatible components. For retail customers, it serves as a personal shopper \u2014 understanding style preferences, recommending complementary accessories, and answering detailed product questions.\n\nThe assistant seamlessly integrates with SAP Commerce Cloud through a flexible API, allowing users to easily plug it into new or existing storefront while maintaining the brand experience. With built-in security and support for multiple languages, it is designed to deliver sophisticated product discovery at scale.\n\nThe AI shopping assistant, as part of the SAP CX AI Toolkit, is available for early access now and will be generally available in March of 2025 for SAP Commerce Cloud customers.\n\nEffortless Payment Service Integration\n\nWe previously announced a new composable payment solution, SAP Commerce Cloud, open payment framework, that helps retailers continue to scale and remain agile as new payment options gain popularity.\n\nOpen payment framework is a no-code, low-code framework that gives retailers a low-cost, adaptive, and agile payments system that can best fit their business and customer needs without the need to build out integrations on their own. Extensible and headless, the framework ensures that the front and back ends are decoupled and operate independently, catering to a wide range of requirements across channels and allowing customers to have the freedom to pick their preferred payment methods. It covers common payment needs and end-to-end payment processes across authorization, capture, refunds, and re-authorization as well as automatic updates with security and compliance standards. Open payment framework is natively integrated with SAP Commerce Cloud.\n\nOpen payment framework is planned for general availability on January 22, 2025. Customers can sign up for SAP Early Adopter Care program here.\n\nIntelligent Search Service Makes Product Discovery Easier\n\nThe intelligent search service is a modern, multi-tenant SaaS solution designed to deliver seamless, AI-powered search experiences for both shoppers and business users. Key benefits that empower end-to-end commerce journeys are:\n\nEffortless product discovery for shoppers on the storefront with natural, intuitive search capabilities, enhanced by AI-driven verbatims, flexible indexing, and intelligent scoring. Features like smart word suggestions and personalized recommendations help showcase the most relevant products, improving navigation and driving higher satisfaction.\n\nSearch operation management with ease for business users through back-office processes that enable data-driven merchandising strategies, powered by integration with intelligent selling services. This ensures measurable impact and optimization of search experiences.\n\nBy combining modern technology with AI, the intelligent search service maximizes conversion rates and product views, delivering a natural and intuitive shopping experience. It helps retailers not only enhance customer satisfaction but also build long-term loyalty and lifetime value.\n\nThe service is planned for general availability on January 22, 2025. Customers can sign up for SAP Early Adopter Care program here.\n\nAt SAP, we are committed to empowering businesses to deliver exceptional customer experience while driving profitable growth. By leveraging connected, insightful, and adaptive technology solutions, we help our customers put their customers at the center of their operations to build loyalty, foster innovation, and unlock new opportunities for success.\n\nTo learn more about SAP CX, visit sap.com/cx.\n\nBalaji Balasubramanian is senior vice president and global head of Commerce and Industry Cloud at SAP.",

The project echoes the same democratic ideals as its historic surroundings, uniting sports and the local community in a state-of-the-art sports arena. Built on the site of the former Olympic Velodrome and with Frei Otto and G\u00fcnther Behnisch's iconic Olympic Stadium as its neighbor, the new SAP Garden arena is informed by the legacy of its location and surroundings. The 62,500m\u00b2 arena project is designed by 3XN in collaboration with CL MAP and landscape architects Latz + Partner for client Red Bull. \"We are pleased to be opening the new SAP Garden arena, marking a new era for sport in the city of Munich,\" says Jan Ammundsen, Senior Partner at 3XN. \"The project has been a meaningful opportunity for us to extend the architectural legacy of the Olympic Park. It was important for our design to fit the modern sports facility into the existing, historic Olympic Park in a seamless way. We hope that it will become a focal point that gathers locals to experience and take part in sports.\" The sports arena is the new home of ice hockey team EHC Red Bull Munich and basketball team Bayern Munich while three additional ice rinks serve as training and public facilities. The bowl can gather up to 10,700 spectators for ice hockey and 11,500 for basketball. Beyond the sports facilities, the arena offers three levels of VIP areas, merchandise shops, a large restaurant, a gaming room, offices and conference rooms, a parking garage, and a public rooftop terrace.\n\nMelting into its historic context - Adding a new structure into Behnisch & Partner's protected Olympic Park landscape posed a complex design challenge: how to respect the integrity of the park while also accommodating the significant spatial needs of the world-class sports facility? To solve this, the design team concealed the arena's three additional ice rinks underneath an artificial hill that organically continues the park's existing pathways and landscape design. The arena itself is oval-shaped and asymmetrical in both its height and shape, forming an organic appearance which together with a green roof lets the building melt into the park and the cityscape. \"The Olympic Park is both in its architecture and landscape designed around the human scale,\" says Ammundsen. \"The sports facilities are nestled in the green terrain which rolls and undulates around the now iconic structures. SAP Garden is designed with careful consideration for these existing characteristics to both preserve and also add a new element to the uniquely harmonious relationship between the buildings and the park.\" The arena's fa\u00e7ade is dynamic and welcoming with vertical pilaster strips that swing upwards and accentuate the glass-panelled entrances. Each of the 260 pilaster strips is unique in its geometry with the largest being over 18 meters tall and weighing one ton. This gives the building a dynamic fa\u00e7ade expression \u2013 at the same time simple and complex.\n\nA place for the public - SAP Garden is designed as a catalyst for activity - both on game days and 'off days'. As a sports arena, it is a destination for the many with the ability to house ice hockey, basketball and a multitude of third-party events. On days with no official activities, it remains a place full of life. Beyond serving as training facilities for professional players, the arena's three additional ice rinks are built with the vision of improving the local sports infrastructure. All year round the rinks are open for schools, clubs, and the public to use, becoming a place that gathers and strengthens local grassroots sports. Above ground, sports fans can browse the merchandise shops while the e-sport community gains a home with the ambitious Gaming Garden - the new gaming hotspot for southern Germany. A restaurant with both indoor and outdoor service lets life unfold between the internal and external spaces while the top of the arena is a new destination for Munich with a rooftop terrace that invites everyone to enjoy the views over the park and cityscape. \"We focused very much on what will happen on the ice or the parquet floor. What happens here is the reason why you come to the building, and we wanted to create an atmosphere of intensity,\" explains Ammundsen. \"Of course, it is also essential that the architecture is clear and intuitive enough that people can find their way quickly and move around without difficulty. But when you are sitting in your seat watching the game, the building should fade into the background. Then it is all about the atmosphere.\"\n\nA unique, full-scope arena design - SAP Garden is at the forefront of arena designs, shaped to create an intense atmosphere and fan experience while being adaptive to its shifting purposes. Switching between an ice rink and a basketball court is a complicated matter as the two are different sizes. To accommodate this and ensure courtside seating for both sports, a unique stand system has been developed. The existing stands can be shifted in height and slope while mobile stands are added for basketball games, placed on top of the covered rink, to create more seating. 3XN's scope also includes interior design where the use of digital media and light creates a flexible color palette that can change the ambiance of the arena in line with the branding or occasion. As such, the interior is centered around a variety of atmospheres and identities. Areas and rooms are individual in their design which lets the users have unique experiences throughout the building. At the same time, all spaces have small design elements in common that tie the building together as a whole, creating an interior that is both cohesive and playful.\n\n\"There is a reason why we go to arenas, why it is so important to be able to go in person: we want to experience a feeling. I believe that this feeling only arises when we experience something together,\" explains Ammundsen. \"As architects, we want to help make this feeling in the hall as intense and exciting as possible. There are good tools for doing that: sound technology, and lighting technology. The main thing is that the experience is special, something that you cannot have anywhere else.\" SAP Garden is 3XN's third completed sports arena, following Royal Arena and Horsens Stadium in Denmark. The grand opening of the arena takes place on September 27 with an ice hockey game between the four-time German champions EHC Red Bull Munich and the Buffalo Sabres from the National Hockey League (NHL).",

Suppliers can join the network for free.\n\nLast year alone, $100 billion in opportunities were posted for suppliers to respond to on SAP Business Network\u2019s Discovery solution.\n\nEvans asked Harris to describe how SAP Business Network impacts customer experiences, and those improved experiences extend to buyers and suppliers.\n\n\u201cBoth audiences see improvements to their business efficiency through increased order visibility and direct communication channels,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe network also provides tools for direct system-to-system integration to really accelerate operations even further.\u201d\n\nHarris outlined specific functions and outcomes for SAP Business Network users:\n\nSuppliers can publish their catalogs to increase discoverability and provide streamlined buying experiences\n\nCustomers can reduce maverick buying through catalog-based purchasing\n\nSuppliers\u2019 customers get the right products at the right place, right price, and right time while errors and delays are reduced\n\nInvestment in low-value work \u2014 such as responding to order-status inquiries can be reduced in favor of focusing people on higher-value functions\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nDriving Value Across Company Sizes, Industries\n\nThe benefits of SAP Business Network are available to businesses of all sizes, from global enterprises to boutique firms. \u201cWe have the biggest companies in the world as suppliers on the network, but we also have millions of SME-sized organizations as well,\u201d Harris explains, adding that the company is actively working to make it easier for smaller firms to participate.\n\nWith its new \u201cPromote\u201d subscription plan scheduled to launch in early 2025, smaller suppliers gain the same opportunities that larger suppliers have: namely, to be discovered by a wide range of buyers on the network.\n\n\u201cSmaller suppliers don\u2019t always have a way to showcase their catalogs of products or services in the same way that maybe a large company or a large supplier would have,\u201d Harris explains. \u201cThis new set of capabilities we\u2019re providing will not only provide a platform for their catalogs, but it also gives them new tools like GenAI to help draft product summaries and descriptions so that their catalog items can really stand out.\u201d\n\nCompetitive Edge(s)\n\nIn total, SAP Business Network\u2019s supplier community spans 192 countries, covering all industries, and providing goods and services in every category. Its reach and functionality are key differentiators.\n\n\u201cWhere SAP Business Network stands out is in the breadth and depth of the capabilities that we offer [and] in the size of our network,\u201d says Harris, who notes that it supports indirect procurement, direct materials procurement, supply chain, logistics, asset management, contingent workforce, and working capital management functions. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other software company in this market that comes close to addressing such a broad scope of processing capabilities.\u201d\n\nBecause of that breadth, Harris encourages businesses that aren\u2019t among the millions already on the network to start making the most of this resource. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on those cost savings. You\u2019re missing out on improving efficiency throughout your business and with your trading partners. You\u2019re missing out on better visibility throughout your supply chain.\u201d\n\nBy digitizing a wide range of collaboration points between buyers and suppliers, SAP Business Network is enabling customers to drive business transformation in the AI era. The dawn of 2025 is an optimal time to capitalize on these benefits.\n\nLearn more about SAP Business Network\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

We are proud to be recognized as one of the first winners of this award and look forward to many more years of success in the chemical industry leveraging our partnership with SAP along the way.\"\n\nBeginning in 2005, ASUG and SAP have collaborated on a number of benchmarking programs to help customers compare their organizations' key performance indicators (KPIs) with best-in-class KPIs. The programs provide a unique opportunity for organizations to assess areas of excellence and determine those for improvement. They allow participants to learn about current and emerging best practices and to quickly adopt ideas fueling excellence at world-class organizations. Participation in the programs is free. More than 400 SAP customers have participated in the benchmarking and best practices program since its introduction, with more the 650 studies completed.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author",

            "content": "A few months ago, leading customer success platform Gainsight partnered with multinational software company SAP to deliver a powerful integration between Gainsight CS and SAP Sales Cloud. This integration helps businesses transform how they deliver value-driven customer experiences at scale to maximize customer retention and revenue growth. Pulse 2.0 interviewed Gainsight President and COO Chuck Ganapathi and SAP\u2019s Senior Vice President of CX Solution Management Nitin Badjatia to learn more about their partnership.\n\n\n\n(Left: SAP\u2019s Senior Vice President of CX Solution Management Nitin Badjatia, Right: Gainsight President and COO Chuck Ganapathi)\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): What was the primary motivation behind the strategic partnership between Gainsight and SAP, and how do you envision it transforming customer success for SAP customers?\n\nSAP (Nitin): The sales journey is continuous, and organizations committed to customer success recognize the importance of consistently meeting customer expectations while uncovering new, innovative growth opportunities. This is central to our strategy for SAP Sales Cloud, which is why SAP is excited to partner with Gainsight.\n\nBy integrating Gainsight\u2019s AI-powered customer success platform directly into SAP Sales Cloud, we\u2019re helping businesses stay closely attuned to customer needs and deliver relevant value at every touchpoint. Our partnership bridges the pre-and post-sales journey, bringing in the data intelligence needed to streamline workflows. This is going to drive significant automation and foster collaboration between teams that are often siloed. Ultimately, it will help us close deals faster, retain more clients, and expand business more effectively.\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): Can you elaborate on how the integration of Gainsight CS with SAP Sales Cloud will enhance the customer experience and drive retention for businesses?\n\nGainsight (Chuck): Gainsight joined forces with SAP to empower businesses to act with greater precision, nurturing customer loyalty and driving retention in a way that\u2019s never been possible before. By integrating the CS experience into SAP Sales Cloud, we are creating seamless workflows that streamline processes and enhance relationships at scale. As for customers, this will feel like a unified experience with less friction by delivering a holistic view of the customer journey on a single platform that supports both sales and customer success teams. For example, imagine a healthcare technology company aiming to boost customer retention and maximize growth opportunities. With this integration, this company\u2019s customer success teams can build personalized success plans and targeted support strategies aligned with each of their customer\u2019s specific goals, enhancing upsell and cross-sell potential. Meanwhile, sales teams gain valuable insights into metrics like customer satisfaction and system usage patterns, enabling them to refine their approach and better tailor future sales cycles. This unified strategy will allow both teams to deliver a more seamless, client-centered experience, fostering stronger relationships and supporting sustainable growth.\n\nFor customers looking for even deeper, real-time insights, they can use AI tools to better understand the strength of each customer relationship. Powerful solutions such as Staircase AI provide analysis of every customer interaction, across every channel, in real-time. Today, companies determine customer health through human judgment and explicit signals like NPS and product usage, but these indicators can be unreliable. With Staircase AI, businesses can tap directly into the implicit signals hidden within human interactions.\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): What specific strategies will the partnership employ to address the challenges of bridging the handoff between pre- and post-sales?\n\nSAP (Nitin): First impressions are everything, and that handoff can make or break the customer experience. To effectively address the challenges of bridging the handoff between pre- and post-sales, organizations should focus on strategies that enable seamless data flow and collaboration between teams. By using a flexible, plug-and-play framework in SAP Sales Cloud, businesses can effortlessly incorporate Gainsight data into their SAP Sales Cloud environment, ensuring it aligns seamlessly with existing data and while reinforcing SAP\u2019s commitment to intelligent CX. Automated workflows and shared customer insights create continuity for each customer\u2019s journey, so no matter where they are\u2014before, during, or after the sale\u2014their experience is cohesive and responsive. This continuity allows teams to work together seamlessly, minimizing friction for the customer.\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): What unique advantages do Gainsight\u2019s AI-powered solutions offer to businesses?\n\nGainsight (Chuck): Gainsight\u2019s AI capabilities give businesses an edge by helping them understand not just what\u2019s happening with a customer but why. Gainsight AI is specifically designed and trained to understand the unique post-sales needs of businesses and tailor its insights to each individual company\u2019s specific requirements. Customers can then leverage this intelligence at various stages of the customer journey, including meeting preparation, email drafting, risk identification, and identifying expansion opportunities.\n\nStaircase AI by Gainsight is unique in that it pulls data from every conversational point of the customer journey, including email, meetings, chat, Slack, and ticketing systems. It then continuously scans millions of interactions between teams and customers, helping to identify patterns that signal growth opportunities or churn risks as well as sentiment and relationship strength to inform decisions that improve customer experience and drive growth.\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): How will this partnership promote collaboration across different teams\u2014sales, customer success, and support\u2014within organizations?\n\nGainsight (Chuck): These departments are often viewed as siloed functions, yet they all interact directly with customers. How they collaborate behind the scenes is crucial. It begins with a cultural shift that prioritizes customer success as a core part of the organization\u2019s mindset. The integration between Gainsight and SAP makes this vision a reality by fostering collaboration and aligning all customer-facing teams around a shared set of data and insights. Sales, customer success, and support teams each bring unique strengths to the customer relationship, and with a unified understanding of the customer\u2019s journey, they can work more effectively together. Gainsight\u2019s platform enables cross-functional playbooks, allowing every team to contribute to customer success and drive retention and growth.\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): What metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) do you believe will best reflect the success of this partnership for SAP customers?\n\nSAP (Nitin): We focus on metrics like customer retention rates, Net Promoter Scores (NPS), and revenue growth attributable to customer success activities. Additionally, seeing an increase in cross-functional collaboration\u2014reflected in reduced time to value and higher upsell success\u2014will also be indicators that our customers are reaping the benefits of this partnership.\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): How do you see the Gainsight partnership unlocking new possibilities for industries that have traditionally been less focused on customer success?\n\nSAP (Nitin): Industries like retail, manufacturing, and utilities have historically been product-centric but are increasingly recognizing the importance of customer success. In the past, customer success teams were mainly seen as essential for SaaS companies focused on retention. However, now businesses across many sectors understand the importance of repeat customers. These companies view accounts not just as transactions but as sources of recurring revenue\u2014customers who could eventually leave if not properly managed.\n\nThrough our integration with Gainsight, these industries now have the tools to proactively manage customer relationships, spot upsell opportunities, and ensure customers are realizing value from their products. This partnership brings the concept of customer success to new sectors, empowering them to innovate their engagement strategies and build stronger customer loyalty.\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): How do you believe this partnership positions Gainsight and SAP in the competitive landscape of customer success solutions?\n\nGainsight (Chuck): By combining Gainsight\u2019s industry-leading customer success technology with SAP\u2019s deep enterprise reach, we\u2019re positioning ourselves to lead the customer success market. Our joint approach aligns pre- and post-sales efforts in a way that hasn\u2019t been done at this scale before. We\u2019re not just meeting the current needs of existing customers\u2014we\u2019re always looking for ways to bring our technology into the hands of new businesses that can benefit from it. We\u2019ve done this with the acquisition of Staircase AI, enabling teams to uncover the hidden signals and patterns they might miss. And make sharper, data-driven decisions for better outcomes. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how AI can improve the continuous sales and post-sales journey.\n\nAs the leader in this space, it\u2019s on us to continue pushing beyond the current reach of customer success and solve similar challenges for new industries. This is how we lead\u2014by setting a new standard for integrated, data-driven, and AI-powered customer success that gives our customers a distinct competitive advantage.\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): What role do you see innovation playing in customer success moving forward, particularly in the context of this partnership?\n\nGainsight (Chuck): Innovation, particularly with AI, is critical to evolving customer success, especially as the technology continues to transform how we understand and engage with customers. With SAP, we\u2019re not only driving new technological capabilities but also setting new benchmarks for how AI can predict needs, improve retention, and create stronger customer outcomes. This partnership is our commitment to helping customers grow through innovation.\n\nPulse 2.0 (Amit): What message would you like to convey to current and prospective SAP customers regarding the benefits they can expect from this new partnership?\n\nSAP (Nitin): To our customers, I\u2019d say: This partnership is about empowering you to get closer to your customers than ever before. With Gainsight CS integrated into SAP Sales Cloud, you\u2019ll have the tools to engage, retain, and grow your customers in a proactive, data-driven way. We\u2019re here to help you not just meet but exceed customer expectations in a competitive market.",

However, these transformations are neither swift nor inexpensive, and sometimes the costs can be hidden.\n\nThat is why SAP has partnered with Oxford Economics on a new and comprehensive survey of large organizations, providing an exclusive look at the current global state of business transformation.\n\n\u201cThe Estimation Game: What Do Business Transformations Really Cost?\u201d reveals the true cost of business transformation, with the data aimed at helping organizations maximize transformation success and take the guesswork out of transformation budgeting.\n\nSpanning a range of industries and focusing on companies with a minimum revenue of $500 million, the report provides insights from a balanced audience of 800 respondents, including IT professionals and leaders from corporate strategy, R&D, finance, manufacturing, HR, and operations.\n\nThe paper further reveals that:\n\nBarely half of transformations go according to plan (51 percent)\n\nFifty-eight percent of transformations end up going over budget\n\nThe average cost of transformation efforts is \u20ac9.5 million\n\nSixty-three percent of respondents face resistance from leadership regarding the value of transformation efforts\n\nNearly half of the initiatives highlighted by respondents remain incomplete, and budgetary constraints pose a significant challenge\n\nFrom Strategy to Execution\n\nIn broad terms, this disconnect between the confidence level of respondents and what the report data reveals about the true cost and organizational impact of transformation can be understood in the equivalent disconnect between strategy and execution.\n\nFor example, while three in five say their major transformation plan was well communicated across their organization, only 53 percent say it was clearly defined in the first place.\n\nWhile most companies are employing strategic practices such as crafting mission statements, appointing dedicated leaders, and forming cross-functional teams, they can lack the final piece of the puzzle when it comes to converting strategy into action.

            "content": "\n\nSAP\u2019s Cloud-First Strategy\n\nSAP\u2019s decision to prioritize a cloud-first strategy has changed the way its enterprise solutions are designed, delivered, and used. For businesses, this transition is helping to make their IT systems more flexible and scalable. For SAP consultants, it is creating complexity in working practices and talent markets, but also revealing new ways to build a rewarding career.\n\nIn this article IgniteSAP will discuss how adjusting to this shift requires consultants to refresh and build their skills, deliver value to clients, and plan their long-term career paths with a clear view of expected developments in the SAP services industry.\n\n\n\nBenefits of Cloud Deployments\n\nSo, other than the fact that SAP\u2019s release strategy is structured around cloud ERP, why do customers now need it?\n\nCompanies are no longer looking for systems that run on hardware in their data centers. Instead, they want systems that can adjust to changing business conditions, support hybrid work models, and take advantage of the latest advances in data analytics and AI.\n\nBusinesses are demanding more efficient ways to manage costs, and cloud systems usually operate on a subscription. This makes it easier for companies to adopt new solutions without tying up large amounts of budget.\n\nCloud solutions also allow companies to adapt their IT systems faster. Instead of costly and disruptive implementations, often taking years to complete, cloud systems offer automated, regular updates that help businesses stay competitive. Cloud platforms also provide scalability that is nearly impossible to match with on-premise systems, and cloud resources can be expanded or reduced quickly if a business is growing, entering new markets, or even dealing with seasonal demand.\n\nProducts such as S/4HANA Cloud and SAP Business Technology Platform are designed to give businesses faster access to new features, reduced dependency on complex infrastructure, and greater ability to scale. SAP\u2019s partnerships with hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have further strengthened its ability to provide flexible and powerful cloud solutions.\n\nThose are just the primary advantages that are driving cloud ERP adoptions, and the key reasons why SAP customers need more consultants familiar with cloud technology.\n\n\n\nHow SAP Consultants Can Adapt\n\nThis transition requires SAP consultants to make significant adjustments in both technical skills and career strategy as the demand for expertise in on-premise systems like ECC is shrinking, and new opportunities are opening up in the cloud space.\n\nKnowledge of SAP\u2019s cloud products is becoming a key differentiator for consultants. Mastery of S/4HANA Cloud, SAP BTP, or RISE with SAP can open doors to roles implementing a variety of systems.\n\nDespite a widespread cloud shift, many businesses also currently rely on on-premise systems for critical operations and components of hybrid systems, and will continue to need support during migration projects.\n\nThis means that understanding legacy systems is still important in the short term, perhaps even for a few years after the 2027 deadline for SAP ECC support (2030 for customers with Extended Support).\n\nDespite many customers holding on to on-premise for longer than they perhaps should, consultants who want to stay relevant in the long run must invest time and money in learning cloud technologies, even if their employer does not fund these activities.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Technology and Cloud Adoption Challenges\n\nAnother factor shaping the role of SAP consultants is the growing complexity of customer expectations. As more use cases and customer success stories are shared, businesses today expect more from their IT systems than ever before.\n\nAlong with managing core business functions like finance and operations, customers now want these systems to integrate with advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, and IoT devices. Consultants who initially were trained to implement one software platform must have a clear understanding of many now integrated within the SAP portfolio.\n\nThis means that consultants must expand their expertise to include these new areas. For example, a consultant working with a manufacturing company might need to incorporate IoT data into production planning processes, while those working in retail may focus on using AI to predict customer demand.\n\nAddressing these demands also requires consultants to tackle the concerns businesses have about moving to the cloud. Although the benefits of cloud adoption are now well known, many organizations worry about the costs, disruptions, and risks involved.\n\nSAP consultants can reduce these concerns by providing clear strategies for migration, helping clients understand how cloud systems can reduce operational costs over time, and explaining how SAP\u2019s security features protect sensitive data. Encouraging a phased migration approach can allow businesses to test cloud solutions on smaller, less critical systems before moving their entire operation.\n\nWhen planning implementations and migrations, consultants should carefully consider the business leader\u2019s or finance executive\u2019s viewpoint, and think about how a new system can help a company reduce costs, reach new customers, or improve operational efficiency. By focusing on these results, consultants can demonstrate their value to clients in terms that resonate clearly with business leaders.\n\nSo SAP consultants today are at a turning point in their profession. The skills that defined the field are still relevant, but they are no longer enough to sustain a career in the changing SAP services market.\n\n\n\nS/4HANA Cloud and SAP BTP\n\nAs the cloud-based version of SAP\u2019s ERP system, S/4HANA Cloud provides businesses with the ability to adopt preconfigured best practices and benefit from quarterly updates.\n\nFor consultants, understanding how to implement and optimize this core system is vital. This includes knowing how to balance the benefits of standardization with the need for customization, which is increasingly achieved using side-by-side extensions built on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).\n\nSAP BTP is enabling consultants to address the complexities of modern business requirements. Its capabilities are diverse, ranging from system integration and application development to advanced analytics.\n\nConsultants who specialize in crafting integration strategies can help clients create workflows that span these multiple platforms, and the Extension Suite allows businesses to build custom functionality without modifying the core, which is essential in a cloud environment where maintaining the \u201cclean core\u201d is a priority.\n\nAnalytics is another area where SAP BTP has significant value. Tools like SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC), which is part of BTP, enable businesses to turn their data into actionable insights. SAC combines planning, reporting, and predictive analytics into a single solution, allowing organizations to visualize data in real time and forecast future trends.\n\nAcquiring expertise in SAC allows consultants to go beyond traditional ERP roles and contribute to strategic decision-making processes. By designing dashboards, creating predictive models, and integrating SAC with other SAP or third-party applications, consultants can help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.\n\n\n\nEmerging Technologies and Skills\n\nWhile mastering SAP\u2019s core cloud tools is essential, consultants must also consider the broader technology landscape. Emerging technologies are becoming integral to how businesses operate and compete.\n\nSAP has now incorporated these technologies extensively into its ecosystem, and consultants have new ways to provide value to their clients. For example, AI and ML are increasingly used in areas like predictive maintenance, demand forecasting, and fraud detection. Consultants who understand how to implement and refine AI/ML models in SAP systems can help businesses further automate processes and uncover new efficiencies.\n\nIoT sensors can monitor equipment in real time, enabling predictive maintenance and reducing downtime. In logistics, IoT devices can track shipments and optimize supply chain performance. By understanding how to configure and integrate IoT solutions, consultants can distinguish themselves as specialists in high-demand areas like smart manufacturing and supply chain optimization.\n\nConsultants need to understand and explain to their clients how technology aligns with business goals. This requires a shift to a more holistic approach that considers the client\u2019s industry, competitive environment, and long-term vision. For instance, a consultant working with a healthcare organization might focus on how cloud systems can improve patient outcomes by simplifying operations and enabling better data sharing. Or, consultants in the retail sector might work on projects that enhance customer experiences through personalized marketing powered by AI.\n\nAn emerging area for consultants is sustainability. Solutions like the SAP Sustainability Control Tower allow organizations to track their carbon emissions, manage compliance with environmental regulations, and identify areas for improvement. While adoption is not widespread, as more regulations come into force, businesses which do not meet these standards will increasingly receive enforceable fines and damage to brands and reputations. Consultants can help clients integrate sustainability into their operations, creating both compliance advantages, and also using carbon tracking and other sustainability metrics for assessments of efficiency in manufacturing and distribution processes: helping to reduce operating costs in large organizations.\n\n\n\nStanding Out from the Crowd\n\nAs the SAP ecosystem becomes increasingly complex and competitive, standing out as a consultant requires more than technical expertise.\n\nBuilding a professional brand is one way to promote long-term career success. Sharing knowledge through articles, presentations, or online discussions can help consultants establish themselves in the SAP community.\n\nParticipating in SAP user groups, attending events like SAP Sapphire, and staying active on platforms like LinkedIn are all effective ways to build visibility and network with other professionals. These activities enhance a consultant\u2019s reputation but also provide opportunities to learn.\n\nConsultants must continuously learn to remain competitive. The quarterly updates that are a common feature of cloud systems introduce new features and capabilities on an ongoing basis. Staying current and able to introduce the latest improvements requires a commitment to regular training and certification. Regularly checking the content of courses on the SAP Learning platform and acquiring additional certifications should help consultants who want to keep their skills sharp.\n\nBusinesses adopting cloud solutions now expect measurable improvements that justify their investment. This could mean reducing operational costs, improving process efficiency, or accelerating time-to-market for new products. Consultants who can frame their contributions in terms of business impact and preferably in monetary terms will differentiate themselves from competitors.\n\nThe shift to a cloud-first world has transformed what it means to be an SAP consultant. Success now depends on mastering cloud platforms, building expertise in emerging technologies, and delivering outcomes that drive real business value. Applying technical knowledge with a focus on strategic goals will support consultants to excel in this evolving ecosystem and play an important part in shaping the future of enterprise technology.\n\nIf you are an SAP professional looking for a new role in the SAP ecosystem our team of dedicated recruitment consultants can match you with your ideal employer and negotiate a competitive compensation package for your extremely valuable skills, so join our exclusive community at IgniteSAP.",

Each day brings new challenges with the rewarding opportunity to directly impact critical systems for the U.S. Federal sector \u2014 especially on projects like the one she\u2019s currently involved in with the U.S. Navy.\n\nThis role has not only deepened her technical skills, it\u2019s also given her a sense of accomplishment as she can see the tangible effects of her work in improving system performance and overall operational efficiency.\n\nBuilding a career in SAP consulting\n\nTeniesha\u2019s journey into SAP consulting wasn\u2019t one that followed a typical technical path. She started with a degree in Communications, where she honed her communication skills \u2014 an asset that\u2019s crucial in technical consulting. She then expanded her knowledge by studying Cybersecurity and obtaining a Security+ certification.\n\nHer technical foundation was strengthened when she pursued SAP certifications, most notably the SAP Certified Application Associate for Business Process Integration with S/4HANA.\n\nReal-world experience has played a significant role in shaping her career, and she considers herself lucky to have had an experienced mentor when she joined her first SAP project. Their guidance accelerated her learning, and she was able to dive deep into the different SAP modules and functionalities. This hands-on experience, combined with continuous self-study and online courses, has been critical in keeping her sharp and up-to-date in a fast-paced, ever-evolving field.\n\nNetworking within the SAP community has also been a game-changer for her. From attending industry conferences to connecting with fellow SAP professionals on LinkedIn, these connections have offered valuable insights, new opportunities, and collaborations that have enriched her career.\n\nLeveraging technical skills to solve real-world problems\n\nOne of the most rewarding parts of Teniesha\u2019s job is using her technical expertise to solve real-world problems. Here are examples of how she has applied her skills to make a difference:\n\n1. Resolving audit log capacity issues:\n\n\u201cDuring a routine system check, I noticed that the audit logs were nearing capacity, which could have resulted in non-compliance and system failure. I quickly escalated the issue, worked with my team to resolve it, and ensured the logs kept recording as required. By addressing this proactively, we avoided potential downtime and kept the system running smoothly,\u201d said Teniesha.\n\n2. Fixing Fiori tile display issues:\n\n\u201cA client reported issues with Fiori tiles not displaying correctly, which affected user functionality. After investigating, I identified the root cause and implemented the appropriate SAP Note, fixing the issue and improving user experience. This kind of problem-solving not only benefits the client, but also enhances operational efficiency across the board,\u201d said Teniesha.\n\nThe future of SAP: how AI and machine learning will shape the role of consultants\n\nLooking ahead, AI and machine learning are poised to revolutionize the role of SAP consultants. Already, we are beginning to see AI-powered tools integrated into SAP, enabling automation of routine tasks and providing predictive analytics that can help identify system issues before they escalate. For SAP consultants, this means there will be a growing need to understand how AI can be applied within the SAP ecosystem, configure AI-driven solutions, and interpret the insights generated by AI tools.\n\nHowever, even as automation increases, the role of the consultant remains critical. Consultants will still need to ensure that AI implementations align with specific business needs and goals. As such, staying ahead of technological trends and continuously upskilling will be key to remaining competitive in this space.\n\n\u201cWith the right mindset, continuous learning, and a passion for problem-solving, a career as an SAP consultant can be incredibly rewarding, offering opportunities to grow both personally and professionally in a field that is always at the forefront of innovation,\u201d said Teniesha.\n\nDiscover Your Potential at IBM Consulting\n\nTo hear more about the great work our SAP Consultants do, check out these stories:\n\nDiscover Paul\u2019s story, who began his journey at IBM as a consultant in the SAP practice\n\nMeet Whitley, who went from intern to Senior Consultant in only five years.\n\nLeran about the essential skills you need to succeed as an SAP Consultant.\n\nRead more about what a consultant actually does, the skills you need to become one and the career opportunities available for consultants.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in a career as an SAP Consultant within IBM Consulting, visit our careers website to explore open positions in this field.

For ECC and R3, that deadline is the end of 2027, while customers running older versions of those systems could have support for their mission-critical ERP systems cease this year or in 2026.\n\nIn a conversation late last week, IBM Power General Manager Tom McPherson said the new Power-specific version of RISE offers those 10,000 on-prem SAP-on-Power customers tangible advantages in speed of migration, overall cost, and what McPherson described as \u201cinvestment protection.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s definitely a sticking point for some customers that can see, at least on paper, the theoretical advantages of moving to the cloud with SAP\u2019s S/4HANA, but are concerned that the related expenses will be prohibitive.\n\nThe new IBM-SAP program helps mitigate those concerns, McPherson said, with \u201cbuy-back\u201d plans for customers\u2019 legacy Power systems, as well as with financial incentives for systems integrators managing the migrations for customers.\n\nSecurity considerations are also paramount in the minds of customers, McPherson said, and the RISE for Power program addresses that by replicating the high-security capabilities of on-prem Power while also being optimized for enterprise AI via a range of IBM technologies.\n\nI thought it was interesting to see how the IBM press release about the new partnership referred to IBM as a \u201chyperscaler,\u201d a designation that IBM has largely eschewed over the past few years.\n\nMcPherson said that term applies in this limited context because the required hyperscaler code stack for S/4HANA runs within the IBM Cloud.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nThe press release from the two iconic enterprise-tech companies says that RISE with SAP on IBM Power Virtual Server is \u201cthe fastest and easiest path for IBM Power customers to accelerate their ERP transformation, and delivers \u201cfaster, less disruptive transitions to the cloud.\u201d\n\nFor IBM itself, those outcomes are far from theoretical: When IBM migrated its SAP ERP from Power on-prem to the Power Virtual Server, the company realized a 30% reduction in infrastructure costs and related operations. From the press release:\n\n\u201cIn one of the largest and most complex SAP S/4HANA Cloud modernization projects of any SAP customer to date, according to SAP, IBM recently moved its quote-to-cash and record-to-report processes to RISE with SAP on IBM Power Virtual Server.\n\n\u201cThe IBM project touched more than 150,000 users across 175 countries in 18 months. During this time, it resulted in a 30 percent reduction in infrastructure costs and related operations by rationalizing overall server and data footprint and increasing process automation.\u201d\n\nFor SAP, a $10 Billion Opportunity?\n\nWhile the cost of ERP migrations can vary broadly, a market projection posted by SAP about 16 months ago put the average SAP revenue for every migration at about $1,000,000.\n\nIn an analysis I did in Oct. 23 headlined \u201cSAP Eyes $27.5 Billion Opportunity with Expanded RISE Program,\u201d I posted a slide from SAP in which it estimates that the move of its 25,000 on-prem customers (the number it had at that time) could generate revenue for SAP of 25 billion euros, which translates to about $27.5 billion.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

According to Chris Burton, SAP\u2019s director of sports sponsorships, the value and reach of international sailing events has been successfully identified as promoting the SAP brand and aligning the company and the values it was built on with a sport whose essence is very similar. \u201cInnovation, teamwork and success are key words in the world of competitive sailing and key reasons why SAP has grown into one of the worlds leading business software solutions providers across the globe,\u201d says Burton.\n\nSAP is the leading provider of business software solutions and the third largest software company in the world with more than 18,800 companies in over 120 countries running more than 56,000 installations of SAP software. The company is listed on several exchanges including the Frankfurt stock exchange and NYSE under the symbol \u201cSAP.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs one of the \u2018Cape of Great Events\u2019 key projects, the Cape To Rio provides us with a platform to showcase Cape Town internationally through international television distribution, the official website and creating \u201cambassadors\u201d out of the international participants\u201d, says Pat Lennox, Head: Special Projects, Economic Development and Tourism Directorate.\n\nBruce Parker-Forsyth, managing director of event organisers WORLDSPORT South Africa, said that they were absolutely delighted with the SAP sponsorship. \u201cThe Cape to Rio 2003 forms part of an aggressive strategy to involve South Africa in the business of international ocean racing and to raise the status and reputation of this classic blue water epic. With SAP\u2019s involvement, we can ensure that the race becomes even more attractive to professionally competitive international racing teams, while maintaining its appeal to amateurs,\u201d mentions Parker-Forsyth.\n\nThe SAP Cape to Rio 2003 starts in Table Bay on the 4th and 11th of January 2003 when the two fleets take to the Atlantic for an ocean crossing of over 3400 miles in an attempt to break the current crossing record of just over 12 days.",

This drop pushed the cost of production of sugar by Rs 140 per quintal.The UPSMA also stressed that the prices of sugar did not increase in the ongoing fiscal year despite the increase in cane SAP in Jan last year. The minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar was last revised in 2019 and has since remained stagnant, the association pointed out.The UP govt, in Jan last year, raised the SAP of all sugarcane varieties by Rs 20 per quintal for all three varieties of sugarcane. SAP for early maturing varieties increased from Rs 350 per quintal to Rs 370. For common varieties, it increased from Rs 340 to Rs 360, while for late maturing varieties, it was raised from Rs 335 to Rs 355 per quintal.UPSMA's fresh concern stems from indications from the cane development department that the govt may consider further revision in SAP in the wake of protests by farmer groups. The issue, sources said, has already started gaining ground in the politically significant west UP region, which has a sizable presence of sugar mills.Sources said that a decision on SAP is expected to be taken by the state cabinet headed by CM Yogi Adityanath in the next few days. A senior official said that a high-level committee headed by the chief secretary and the cane development department would take up the issue before the cabinet. Sources said that the issue of raising the SAP has been building up since the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in which the BJP faced a setback.The association further said that the transportation rebate has been low despite the much higher increase in freight cost. The UPSMA also underscored the \"extremely low administered\" price of Rs 152 per quintal for molasses, essentially used for the manufacture of country liquor. The price of molasses in the free market is pegged at Rs 1000 per quintal, a senior UPSMA official said.\"Even the realisation from ethanol (even though it is a separate business) has not seen any commensurate price rise compared to the cane price increase over the past two years,\" the association wrote, urging the govt to revise the prices of ethanol on a \"priority basis.\"",

If the prices are increased, it will bring cheer to farmers but may impact sugar millers, who claim to be facing financial hurdles.\n\nRecently, Sugarcane Minister Lakshmi Narayan Choudhary, while speaking to Kisan Tak, stated that a decision regarding sugarcane SAP might be taken in the cabinet meeting whenever it is held in the second week of January. He mentioned that the report from the Sugarcane Research Center and experts has already been received. However, Choudhary refrained from specifying the exact amount by which the price might be increased\n\nEarlier in the assembly, he mentioned that full efforts are being made to ensure farmers receive a fair price for sugarcane, and that this process is currently underway.\n\nThe association cites that an extremely low rate of transport rebate being allowed despite much higher increase in freight cost. Further, realization from ethanol (even though it being separate business with investment for same) has not seen any commensurate price rise compared to the sugarcane price increase over the past two years.\n\nMillers in the state feel that a hike in the sugarcane SAP will put financial pressure on them, as they are in no position to afford any increase.\n\nMillers are also urging the government to increase the MSP of sugar. The current MSP of sugar, set at Rs 31 per kg in February 2019, has remained unchanged. However, industry groups have called for an increase due to rising production costs and financial pressures on sugar mills.\n\nFor more details and in-depth insights, keep reading ChiniMandi, your go-to source for the latest news on the Sugar and Allied Sectors news.",

The SAP for early maturing varieties increased from Rs 350 to Rs 370 per quintal, for common varieties from Rs 340 to Rs 360, and for late maturing varieties from Rs 335 to Rs 355 per quintal.\n\nFarmer organizations have expressed dissatisfaction with the moderate price hikes in recent years. While the government increased the price by Rs 20 per quintal in 2023-24, farmers argue that such increases are insufficient and should be made annually to account for rising production costs.\n\nOn the other hand, sugar mill owners have voiced opposition to any price hikes. They argue that while they make regular payments and operate their mills throughout the season, this year the recovery rate of sugar from cane is also low. Mill owners warn that increased costs could affect their ability to make timely payments and stress that maintaining mill operations under these circumstances will be increasingly challenging.\n\nRecently, amid the expected increase in the SAP for the 2024-25 season, the UP Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA) has raised concerns about a decline in sugar recovery, which would lead to higher production costs. In a letter to UP Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, the association highlighted a decline in recovery. The drop in sugar recovery as compared to last year has increased substantially to now approx. 0.84% which has significantly pushed up the cost of production.\n\nMillers are also urging the government to increase the MSP of sugar. The current MSP of sugar, set at Rs 31 per kg in February 2019, has remained unchanged. However, industry groups have called for an increase due to rising production costs and financial pressures on sugar mills.\n\nAlso Read: UPSMA expresses concern over drop in sugar recovery amid expected increase in sugarcane SAP\n\nFor more details and in-depth insights, keep reading ChiniMandi, your go-to source for the latest news on the Sugar and Allied Sectors news.",

            "content": "Working together in a co-innovation project, SAP customer Etienne Lacroix Group, SAP partner STMS, and SAP Co-Innovation Lab created a prototype for a generative AI solution that produces shipping labels for dangerous goods.\n\nAs the world\u2019s No.1 fireworks provider, French pyrotechnics company Etienne Lacroix ships fireworks globally and has supported events such as the Burj Khalifa Grand Opening Fireworks Show in Dubai and Bastille Day, France\u2019s national holiday that is celebrated on July 14 each year.\n\nLogistics play a major role for the global player in the pyrotechnics sector, as shipping hazardous materials such as fireworks requires special precautions, especially when crossing international borders. Labels typically include warning pictograms and complex regulatory information in various formats. Recipients such as customs officers must be able to tell at a glance what sort of goods are inside, what the required shipping conditions are, and who is authorized to open the freight.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, customers have their own specific requirements,\u201d Eric Marini, director of Information Systems at Etienne Lacroix explains. \u201cAlso, there are different color codes in place for hazmat, depending on the country of destination. Red may mean danger in European countries, but in China, for example, it stands for celebration. Green has a different meaning in the Middle East that it does in the U.S., and so on.\u201d\n\nWith so many different regulations in place around the globe, labeling the shipments at the end of the production line is not only time-consuming, but also leaves a lot of potential for human error. Now, with support from SAP partner STMS and SAP, the prototype for a generative AI solution was introduced that has the potential to reduce human involvement to a minimum.\n\nBusiness AI Co-Innovation Project with SAP partner STMS\n\nIn early 2024, S\u00e9bastien Faure, general manager at STMS SOLUTIONS, a longtime partner of both SAP and Etienne Lacroix, participated in a Hack2Build event where SAP partners leveraged SAP technology to address pain points of their customers. The idea for a generative AI use case came up, and STMS approached its customer Etienne Lacroix.\n\nAt that time, IT and business experts at Etienne Lacroix were very interested in how generative AI could assist them in making their processes easier.\n\n\u201cBut I have to admit, I was also a little skeptical,\u201d Marini says. \u201cEverybody is currently talking about AI, about how to introduce it to the industry and the huge benefits we will reap from leveraging it. But suggestions are scarce when it comes to implementing it in a way that guarantees the company will benefit from it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we looked at the pain points of the company and discussed possible use cases with SAP Co-Innovation Lab,\u201d Faure says. \u201cWe received the requirement from the business that AI should help avoid human tasks that are error-prone and don\u2019t actually add value.\u201d\n\nAchieve real-world results and attain your full potential with AI embedded across your business Learn more\n\nSupply Chain Use Case with Generative AI\n\nThe team quickly identified that the administrative process of creating labels for shipping was a task currently performed by human employees that required a huge amount of time and focus. The huge potential for the usage of generative AI was evident.\n\n\u201cWith guidance from experts from the SAP partner organization, we were able to build a specific SAP app on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) and SAP S/4HANA to organize and use AI,\u201d Faure says. \u201cWe then collected feedback from the business experts at Etienne Lacroix and, in the next step, brought in the generative aspect.\u201d\n\nTo meet the regulations from the customer, the developers from STMS aggregated all the necessary data and created a model on SAP HANA Cloud vector engine.\n\nThanks to SAP HANA Cloud vector engine, which was newly introduced in 2024, SAP Business AI can allow customers and partners to leverage large language models (LLMs) in a much more accurate way on multi-model database SAP HANA Cloud. In case of the generative AI use case for Etienne Lacroix, the LLM was ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo.\n\n\u201cTechnically, this prototype leverages everything SAP has to offer in terms of AI right now,\u201d Faure says. \u201cThe app uses SAP\u2019s generative AI hub and SAP HANA Cloud vector engine to draw on all the necessary information and generate the label.\u201d\n\nThe remaining human task is to validate whether everything on the label is correct. \u201cThat was the most important requirement,\u201d Marini says. \u201cHuman intervention must be guaranteed, as with all AI use cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the generative aspect that makes all the difference,\u201d Miliau Pape from SAP Co-Innovation Lab says. The LLM suggests what should go on the specific label\u2014such as warning pictograms\u2014based on legal regulations, historical customer requirements, cultural standards, and so on. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides the LLM with context and makes the outcome relevant and reliable. \u201cSimply put, when the AI is trying to be as creative as possible, the RAG provides guardrails, so it doesn\u2019t potentially go wild and come up with nonsense,\u201d Pape says.\n\nFor each shipment, a prompt draws on destination, shipping route, specific customer data, such as the storage and language this customer required the last time, or the colors or signs used to indicate that the shipment contains hazardous materials and can only be opened by experts with a certain certification.\n\n\u201cMy first thought when I saw this, was\u2014simply put\u2014wow,\u201d Marini says. \u201cWow, they actually did it. Wow, this will make our lives easier. This generative AI use case, at this point, may still be only a prototype, but it\u2019s an applicable idea, an actual use case for an actual pain point in our company.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo show the world of possible, push the boundaries of the technology\u2014that is the purpose of the exercise,\u201d Pape says.\n\nEtienne Lacroix Group is in the process of migrating to SAP S/4HANA. With the components of the app ready on SAP Business Technology Platform, go-live is planned for 2025.\n\n\u201cOur ERP was aging and no longer very popular with business users,\u201d Marini says. \u201cMigration to SAP S/4HANA gives us access to the newest technologies such as generative AI. This motivates users to take ownership of their IT solutions again and brings our business and IT together. All in all, it allows our company to fully exploit the potential of our SAP system.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe generative AI solution for labeling shipments is a tangible proof of the power of AI, a real use case, and we have it in our company. It is a very decisive first step in our AI journey.\u201d",

            "content": "Deciding on the right strategy for change management is a paramount step when undertaking a tech transformation. With business elements to consider such as technical debt \u2013 the concept of the cost of future work required to fix a software solution that was created quickly and poorly \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise that extensive business transformations gain a reputation of being tricky.\n\nWith all of its business processes running on SAP, Equinor, the Norwegian state-owned multinational energy company, has embarked on a Next-Gen Project \u2013 a transition to S4/ HANA, with the ambition for it to make an impact beyond a mere technical upgrade.\n\nBut faced with considerable project demands, how can leaders handle it all?\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\n\u201cSomeone in my team did an estimation that it would take us at least 20 years to finish the project if we were going with a test strategy. Then what about lift and shift? We could do that, it would be easier \u2013 but we\u2019d miss out on so much,\u201d Ingrid Marie Larsen Gaarder, delivery area lead for procurement in Equinor\u2019s upgrade project, mused at the recent SAPinsider EMEA conference.\n\nThis is when Equinor, which is on its own grand-scale transition journey to renewables, recognized the clean core concept as a means to reduce technical depth as part of its upgrade.\n\n\u201cWe were aiming to transform the way we work, the business processes, the technical landscape and the platforms,\u201d Frank St\u00f8dle, lead developer and product owner for development and UX in the Equinor upgrade project, shared to an audience of SAP Insiders.\n\nThe project was set up to transform business processes and technical landscapes, with a focus on a clean core approach, something St\u00f8dle can see evolving: \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard anyone else use it outside of the SAP domain. But as time evolved, I think the whole clean core concept evolved into more of a philosophy going beyond software, also integrating data processes and operations.\u201d\n\nThe interconnection between clean core and reduced technical debt also became part of the project\u2019s foundation as \u201cto me, clean core is a means to reduce technical depth if you do a 100 percent clean type of implementation, You will reduce the technical debt, [although] you will not eliminate it,\u201d St\u00f8dle says.\n\nBeing presented with the opportunity to start afresh and get rid of the things that will prevent upgrades in the future, the Equinor team was faced with the question of how to make the most out of this opportunity.\n\nEquinor\u2019s Next-Gen ERP project\n\nAfter the project adopted a hybrid agile methodology that allowed teams to strike a balance between structure and flexibility and formed functional teams to manage the project, Equinor faced some challenges with extensive custom code. Accordingly, it decided to standardize processes to fit SAP\u2019s requirements.\n\nEmbarking on this journey of innovation, Larsen Gaarder shares that instead of \u201cchanging everything in SAP to fit their needs and overcomplicating the space, the team decided to change the process to fit the standard\u201d.\n\nUltimately, the team focused on the implementation of the custom solution management system, built on SAP Fiori elements, tracking code quality via a three-star rating system, with ratings managed by lead developers.\n\nWith governance being an essential part of how the project was executed, the team introduced some tooling to support and streamline the governance process. \u201cWe created a website because I have an obsession with not hiding your guidelines, your governance and best practice in Word documents and team sites,\u201d St\u00f8dle says.\n\nEquinor opted for a nice-looking, searchable website where developers and all the teams can easily retrieve and use the guidelines. This website was built using a tool called MK docs, an open-source tool combined with GitHub and Markdown. \u201cSo that\u2019s a small tip for you. Do not hide your governance where it will be really hard to find.\u201d\n\nAnother important consideration the leaders took seriously to reach success was taking the time to build future teams to become a backbone after the project ended. Even after the majority of workers involved in the implementation had moved on, they worked to attract and retain some key people to keep things running smoothly after the official finish line, whilst also making sure their efforts were appreciated throughout the project.\n\nAt the time of writing, Equinor is about to go live with the SAP S/4HANA transition in January 2025, with ongoing efforts to manage remaining gaps and maintain system integrity.\n\nReflecting on their nearly-done and dusted transformation, the Equinor leaders demonstrated that even in seemingly complicated and multifaceted projects, by embracing the clean core philosophy, prioritizing reduced technical debt and fostering agile teamwork, they can optimize the results.\n\nAt the finish line, the team has not only modernized its ERP infrastructure but also positioned itself for long-term resilience and scalability. The project\u2019s commitment to standardization, governance and building a sustainable team culture demonstrates that with the right vision and execution, even the most complex transitions can drive meaningful change \u2013 a guarantee of success, some would say.",

S/4HANA is SAP\u2019s proprietary enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which uses data and decisioning to help retailers keep their business up and running on a day-to-day basis; it\u2019s used by some of retail\u2019s largest players.\n\nThe release includes several AI-powered tools that the company believes will help retailers meet customer expectations, in turn helping with retention metrics. SAP Emarsys data shows that eight in 10 consumers said they don\u2019t feel valued enough by the brands they put their loyalty behind.\n\nBy integrating S/4HANA with Emarsys and others SAP tools, the company announced that, in the back half of 2025 it will empower retailers with a new, loyalty-focused system. It will assign each customer a loyalty wallet on the cloud, allowing them to receive personalized offers and discounts; will allow retailers with multiple brands (think Gap and its sister brands, Old Navy, Athleta and Banana Republic) to manage multi-brand loyalty programs and more.\n\nAnd though those loyalty capabilities won\u2019t be available until the second half of the year, retailers and brands also have a new capability to look forward to in the first half of the year: an AI shopping assistant. The company said it will change e-commerce by leveraging \u201cthrough natural language conversations that help customers quickly find exactly what they need,\u201d though it did not specify what the exact capabilities of the product will include.\n\nLeslie Hand, group vice president for IDC Retail Insights, said the S/4HANA availability update, paired with the incoming AI-powered systems marks an exciting leap for SAP.\n\n\u201cSAP\u2019s announcement of an all-in-one platform tailored for retail represents a meaningful differentiator in the market,\u201d Hand said in a statement. \u201cRetailers often struggle with fragmented solutions that excel in some areas but cannot deliver the end-to-end integration necessary for seamless retail operations.\u201d\n\nAlo Yoga taps Invent.ai\n\nInvent.ai, formerly known as Invent Analytics, announced Wednesday that it has been partnering with activewear brand Alo Yoga on inventory planning and replenishment.\n\nAccording to the company, Alo tapped Invent because of its AI-powered decisioning and demand forecasting, in hopes that it would improve Alo\u2019s allocation and buying processes. In the first three months of the partnership, Invent brought Alo increased revenue, inventory accuracy and customer sentiment, though the two companies did not disclose the numerical gains associated with those key performance indicators.\n\nSome of that success has come as Alo has gained the ability to launch new products and colors on faster cycles, and better understood how best to allocate that new inventory as its store footprint grows. Eva Yerkes, executive vice president of planning and allocation at Alo, said Invent has already proven out its value.\n\n\u201cOur collaboration with invent.ai has reshaped our inventory planning, enabling us to keep up with fast-changing customer demands,\u201d Yerkes said in a statement. \u201cInvent.ai is one of the few companies delivering true AI solutions. Its technology surpassed our expectations, achieving superior results.\u201d\n\nGurhan Kok, CEO of Invent.ai, said the partnership is a prime example of how the company\u2019s technology can make a difference for a client.\n\n\u201cWith our AI-decisioning technology solution, we empower the planners to achieve real-time responsiveness to market trends, ensuring the right products are in the right stores at the right time,\u201d Kok said in a statement.\n\nInvent has also partnered with retailers and brands like Gap, Mavi, Men\u2019s Wearhouse and Academy Sports & Outdoors.\n\nBamboo Rose scoops up supply chain AI startup\n\nProduct lifecycle management (PLM) provider Bamboo Rose announced Tuesday that it had acquired Verteego, a startup focused on AI-powered decisioning for the retail supply chain. The two companies did not disclose the financial details of the deal.\n\nVerteego uses companies\u2019 data to make recommendations and decisions around demand planning, purchasing and replenishment. Its proprietary Decision Intelligence tool gathers those capabilities into one system, using retailers\u2019 data to run simulate multiple scenarios and recommend what the system perceives to be the best outcome.\n\nRupert Schiessl, Verteego founder and CEO, said that system was the selling point that brought the acquisition deal together.\n\n\u201cBoth teams were immediately and continuously aligned to a future that brought Verteego\u2019s AI-fueled Decision Intelligence capabilities to the Bamboo Rose platform,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOur AI will act as an intelligent orchestrator, providing detailed assistance and guidance across the end-to-end Bamboo Rose Retail Management Platform.\u201d\n\nMatt Stevens, CEO at Bamboo Rose, said the move is meant to broaden the company\u2019s ability to serve a wide variety of customer needs.\n\n\u201cThe market is littered with firms who rushed to have any semblance of an AI story in place. This resulted in one-off, vertically-oriented approaches which have proven very difficult to leverage across multiple use cases and large data sets,\u201d said Matt Stevens, CEO at Bamboo Rose. \u201cOur hallmark is efficiency at scale. Bamboo Rose\u2019s AI-powered Decision Intelligence leverages our customer\u2019s data horizontally to unlock unprecedented gains in automation and effectiveness end-to-end, from planning, development, and buying all the way through global trade management.\u201d",

SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, retail, fashion, and vertical business solution centralizes operational data and integrates finance, procurement and merchandising processes.\n\nThe ERP vendor will also deploy an AI-powered shopping assistant in its Commerce Cloud solution during the first half of the year and customer loyalty program management toolkit later in 2025, according to the announcement.\n\n\u201cOur strategy is to be modular but integrated,\u201d Kristin Howell, global VP of SAP retail solutions management, said. \u201cCIOs are looking to shrink the distance right between the customer and the data \u2014 the fewer integrations, the better.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe retail solution continues SAP\u2019s ongoing push to grow its cloud business. The company leaned on migration incentives, generative AI enhancements and a massive internal restructuring to drive customers to cloud last year.\n\nSAP also pledged to provide every customer with a dedicated enterprise architect as the clock winds down toward the 2027 sunsetting of mainstream support for SAP ERP Central Component on-prem solutions.\n\nWhile cloud eclipsed the company\u2019s on-prem revenues during Q3 2024, Gartner estimated that nearly two-thirds of SAP ECC clients had not yet licensed SAP S/4HANA by the midpoint of last year. The firm found little evidence that migrations were on pace to meet the 2027 deadline.\n\nIndustry-specific solutions are another lever SAP is using to bring customers to the cloud.\n\n\u201cWe built the cloud-based ERP almost from the ground up that\u2019s specifically designed for retail businesses,\u201d Howell told CIO Dive.\n\nIn addition to integrating internal business processes, retail solutions extend to customer-facing applications, an area that rose in the CIO priority list last year, according to Foundry\u2019s State of the CIO report.\n\nPublic cloud architecture eases access to core data for marketing as well as finance, supply chain and procurement.\n\n\u201cA big part of our cloud ERP strategy is to unlock that data so that retailers don\u2019t have to ship it out of SAP into another system to match inventory, orchestrate an order or design the right marketing campaign for a consumer,\u201d said Howell.\n\nThe solution is designed to fit the needs of new and existing customers.\n\nFor digital-native businesses, the ERP offers \u201cretail in a box,\u201d Howell said. Existing customers with on-prem or private cloud deployments can integrate the retail solution as part of a broader migration plan.\n\n\u201cIt's SAP talking to SAP,\u201d Howell said. \u201cThe taxonomy is very similar.\u201d",

            "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. To wit, the SAP SE (ETR:SAP) share price has flown 100% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite. On top of that, the share price is up 19% in about a quarter.\n\nSince it's been a strong week for SAP shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for SAP\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring the three years of share price growth, SAP actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 21% per year.\n\nThus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.\n\nThe modest 0.9% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. It may well be that SAP revenue growth rate of 6.5% over three years has convinced shareholders to believe in a brighter future. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nXTRA:SAP Earnings and Revenue Growth January 9th 2025\n\nSAP is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think SAP will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, SAP's TSR for the last 3 years was 112%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that SAP has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 74% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 17%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand SAP better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for SAP you should know about.",

            "content": "Adobe Stock\n\nIn readiness for our Q1 2025 theme of Procurement Transformation, which will include how to even start your digital journey, how to make the case for it, how to shape your digital roadmap and how to survive it, we have received input from some solution providers on their own customers\u2019 journeys.\n\nJeff Collier, Chief Revenue Officer, SAP Intelligent Spend and Business Network, shares what their customers are looking for from their digital procurement investment.\n\nWhat customers prioritize when investing in procuretech\n\nSAP customers prioritize specific ROI metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) when selecting procurement technology, like cost savings, improved supplier collaboration and data-driven decision making. For instance, many of our customers have achieved faster turnaround times and more on-time deliveries. Metrics such as reducing supplier numbers, increasing digital contract usage and enhancing sourcing efficiency are common priorities. Advanced technologies like AI and generative AI play a crucial role in automating tasks, reducing errors and improving productivity. By integrating these technologies, organizations unlock efficiencies, enhance decision making and create more agile, connected supply chains, ultimately boosting their ROI.\n\nHow customers justify procuretech investment to stakeholders\n\nWhen procurement teams talk to stakeholders about investing in technology, they often highlight how it can save money and reduce risks. In a world where disruptions are common, businesses need tools to keep their inventory steady and ensure they can adapt quickly to changes.\n\nTo justify spending on digital procurement solutions, customers focus on metrics that align with stakeholder priorities. KPIs like risk reduction, shorter procurement cycle times, savings on supplier contracts and improved on-time delivery rates help show why technology investments are necessary. Sharing stories and case studies from other companies can also be very convincing, as they illustrate how the solution can cut costs. These examples tend to resonate well with stakeholders who are mainly concerned with long-term stability.\n\nFor instance, a case study from a global manufacturing company revealed that after implementing a digital procurement solution, they reduced their procurement cycle time by 30% and achieved a 15% savings on supplier contracts. This not only improved their bottom line but also enhanced their ability to respond to market changes. Such stories provide concrete evidence that can reassure stakeholders about the value of procurement technology investments.\n\nTheir key challenges in transitioning to procuretech\n\nWhen companies transition to procurement technology, they often face challenges related to change management. If they don\u2019t get buy-in from stakeholders throughout the organization, they might experience lower adoption rates, slower implementation and reduced return on investment. Without widespread support, there can be resistance to new workflows, misalignment on priorities and underutilization of crucial features like AI or generative AI.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, it\u2019s crucial to involve all teams early in the process, explaining why the technology is important and providing thorough training to address specific pain points. Partnering with a comprehensive provider like SAP can help ease many common issues procurement teams face.\n\nFor example, one of our European customers in the chemicals industry faced challenges with the adoption of e-sourcing processes due to the tool not being mandatory. By engaging employees in sustainability efforts and focusing on digital transformation, the company was able to overcome these hurdles and excel in today\u2019s business landscape. Similarly, one of our customers, a large American food and beverage company, improved visibility and efficiency in managing external workers by streamlining processes across multiple ERP systems and procurement functions. These examples highlight the importance of early involvement and comprehensive support in overcoming transition challenges.\n\nIndustry trends and regulatory shifts driving urgency for procuretech investment in 2025\n\nAI-driven procurement strategies, evolving requirements and changing demographics are pushing procurement teams to rethink their approach as we head into 2025. This industry transformation is prompting organizations to focus on nurturing existing talent, upskilling their workforce and attracting bright young professionals to the field.\n\nThe stage is set for junior procurement leaders who proved their capabilities during the challenging Covid years. We are looking to these individuals \u2014 especially those who can demonstrate tangible achievements in sustainability, AI integration or risk management \u2014 to step up. We anticipate a year marked by new names, fresh perspectives and a reshaped procurement industry in 2025.\n\nFor instance, one of our large European customers in the consumer products space has been at the forefront of integrating AI into its procurement processes. By leveraging SAP Ariba solutions, the company has enhanced its sustainability efforts and improved risk management. Highlighting this shift, one of its procurement leaders said: \u201cThe integration of AI has not only streamlined our processes but also empowered our team to make more informed decisions, aligning with our sustainability goals.\u201d This example underscores the urgency and benefits of embracing procurement tech in response to industry trends and regulatory shifts.\n\nMany thanks to SAP Intelligent Spend and Business Network for sharing this insight with us.\n\nMembers can read our in-depth analysis of its solution here and here.\n\nAs always, reach out to discover how Spend Matters can help with your procuretech ambitions for next year.\n\nConsult TechMatch \u2013 our tech selection tool that helps procurement and finance technology buyers quickly explore the market and identify best-fit solutions.",

No whipped cream.\n\nThe \"SAP Business AI\" page shows up as part of the \"All Products\" list on the SAP website. But don't be fooled: SAP Business AI is not a product. I think SAP Business AI is what happens when you have a hodgepodge of AI and quasi-AI features that have accumulated into your product portfolio, and you want a sticky name that people can remember.\n\nI'm not saying that SAP doesn't have AI in its products - of course it does. There are data science and machine learning-ish features like forecasting in SAP Intelligent Agriculture. There are (lots of) generative AI features enabling things like SAP Emarsys Customer Engagement. These are just a few of many.\n\nBut if you want to actually find out where AI meets up with products relevant to your business, you should ignore the SAP Business AI page. Instead, go to the Discovery Center AI catalog, pick the relevant thing in the \"Products\" drop-down, and click the tiles to get a very nice info view. Many of them even have pricing information! If you're a techno-dork, follow a similar path to the SAP BTP services page, and search for \"AI Enabled\". Same deal: click the tiles to find out more. The information is pretty good.\n\nMaybe someday we'll get to a point where all software is assumed to have AI suffused throughout, and we don't really need to see whether some feature uses AI. Until then, I think we're going to have to do a lot of filtering. PM\n\nABAP Like It\u2019s 2025\n\nThe other day my Reddit feed surfaced a post asking for ABAP beginner advice. The OP shared that they \u201cjust finished an Sap Abap Diploma course that the last thing i've learned is a little bit of Batch Imput\u201d (original grammar preserved) and they wanted to dive into RAP but had no idea what \u201cODATA, FIORI, Ui5, BTP, CDS\u201d were.\n\nYou might chuckle or shake your head at this inquiry. If you did, I\u2019m curious: how did you gain this knowledge?\n\nMany ABAP veterans, like me, sort of grew into technology as we lived to see its rise and fall. We remember when there were only two different ALV frameworks. We\u2019ve known the world before Fiori and HANA. We\u2019ve heard about the secret projects called River and Steampunk. We got to know the OG SAP Build.\n\nBut what does ABAP (and broadly, SAP development) look like in 2025 to someone without a 20-year head start? It must feel like being air-dropped into the middle of a battlefield.\n\nThe shady \u201cABAP school\u201d clearly did not prepare OP for the real world. It\u2019s clearly not an isolated incident. There should be a global crackdown on such schools, with riot-gear-clad law enforcement door-busting\u2014but that\u2019s another story. Now that OP is out, they\u2019re exposed on the world wild web like a gazelle in a lion reserve.\n\nGoogle search is crap. SAP Community is a hot mess. SAP Learning website insists on including BTP in everything. Udemy is a bazaar of randos shouting in all caps, pushing \u201cABAP OOPS\u201d wares with a deep dive into PF status, if you got coin. And LinkedIn is where ex-something influencers spread the good word of ground-breaking \u201c@Odata publish Annotation\u201d. Hashtag blessed.\n\nIt feels like between \u201clike it\u2019s 1999\u201d and \u201cCloud everything\u201d the current year is somehow getting lost. And what\u2019s actually important, useful, and practical, drowns in the noise of 500 emojis. Class of 2025, I don\u2019t envy you. JP\n\nTake a look at our past issues\n\nFully Awesome, Fully Crazy\n\nI spend much of my professional life in the dark corners of huge ERP systems. Creating applications for them is a huge pain. Unless you've done it, it's hard to understand the complexity of such a task - I'm kind of surprised that I've ever done a successful enterprise app. To create an ERP system feels like a superhuman task of another order altogether.\n\nSo when I hear about an audacious product like Cogna, I am simultaneously amazed and skeptical. Cogna doesn't appear to have plans to fully replicate an SAP-sized ERP, but they do claim a three-step method:\n\nDiscover: \"Describe the challenges your business or team is facing and identify opportunities for improvement.\"\n\nDefine: \"Collaborate within our platform to create the ideal tools to deliver on opportunities.\"\n\nDelivered: \"Our AI-powered platform will build and deploy a solution within two weeks, with the Solution Strategist available to take input, and make adjustments as needed.\"\n\nTwo weeks!? I need to see a demo video, because that is either to be expected because the scope is limited, or utterly insane.\n\nThis encapsulates what AI feels like to me at the moment. The idea that you can foresee something becoming possible, and that possibility feels so imminent that you just go ahead and start the project even if right now it can't be done. I'm not saying that what Cogna promises can't be done - I'm saying that thinking it could be done is a leap forward. PM\n\nRed Flags of Doom\n\nDoes your project have more red flags than a Soviet parade? Stay in SAP game long enough and you\u2019ll see everything Martin Coetzee listed in this post.\n\nThe \u201cpremature solutioning\u201d is one of my favorites. Sure, we need to be realistic eventually, but stuffing the dreams into a Procrustean bed of SAP extensibility too early leads to missed opportunities.\n\nAnd \u201cFunctional Consultants that design the technical solution\u201d makes me want to borrow John Stewart\u2019s trademark \u201cmeet me at camera 3\u201d moment. Dear consultants, please stop writing \u201cread from VBAK where\u2026 and LOOP\u201d stuff in the functional specifications. It\u2019s the developer\u2019s job to figure out what to read from where and how. While we appreciate your technical insights, what we really need to do our job best is some context for the requirements\u2014things like why they are needed and what goal we\u2019re trying to achieve.\n\nAs Martin wrote, the subject of incompetence is almost taboo. In my experience, it frequently starts when someone is grabbed for a project because they\u2019re the only one available\u2014not because they\u2019re the best person for the job. In the best-case scenario, the result will be underwhelming, likely due to extra effort from others. In the worst case, spectacular failures happen when the incompetent one is also the loudest. JP\n\nQuantum Computing\n\nIn early December, Google was in the news with their new quantum chip Willow announcement. I won\u2019t pretend to understand much about the quantum computing subject, but I like to keep my ear to the ground in case it turns into something big. There are concerns about its potential of breaking RSA encryption, which seems like a big deal. This awesome video from Fireship explains it all in under 10 minutes. Just watch it and then show off your mad knowledge and sophistication at the water cooler. You\u2019re welcome! JP\n\nSave your friends from enterprise software boredom! Share our Nerdletter! Share\n\nA Long Half-Life\n\nI was going to write a piece about the developer job situation in 2024, based on this Stack Overflow recap podcast. But I had an internet-addled-attention-span moment and got caught up in this episode, which mentions the half-life of developer skills in modern AI environments: 2 years.\n\n2 years! And it seems reasonable to assume that that will only contract further.\n\nI'm not making a value judgment about the half-life of those skills. It's great to write flashy new stuff. I do it all the time! I try lots of frameworks, throw away loads of little kooky prototypes, and read papers that will be irrelevant by the time I'm done reading them. I live and breathe to be on the bleeding edge.\n\nWhen I imagine how much of my experimental AI framework code from 2022 is still in active use, I laugh. (None!) That ABAP I wrote from my first year doing that, in 2010? Guaranteed it's still actively running.\n\nABAP developers, your skills' half-life is measured in decades. That two-line user exit? There's a decent chance that's the last code that will ever execute in a corporate datacenter before the Singularity nano-swarm swallows all computers. PM",

            "content": "Realistically, no one can afford disruptions and delays in operations in the competitive arena of today\u2019s globalized world. However, with the growing complexity of technology landscapes among organizations, many face challenges that may affect and disrupt efficiency and compliance.\n\nThe most common pain points faced by businesses today include complex and costly legacy systems, struggling to migrate to SAP S/4HANA, data overload and inefficiency, lack in data quality, slow innovation and lack of agility, regulatory and compliance challenges and high total cost of ownership (TCO). Ensuring clean data \u2013 data that is accurate, complete and compliant \u2013 is critical to addressing these challenges and driving business success.\n\nTo tackle most of these challenges, SAP developed the concept of Clean Core, an approach to achieve a modern, flexible and cloud-compliant SAP S/4HANA Cloud. According to SAP, Clean Core is achieved by integrating and extending SAP S/4HANA Cloud in such a way that it is cloud-compliant, \u201cwith optimal master data quality and perfected business process governance.\u201d Central to this is the emphasis on clean data as a cornerstone for effective migration and system efficiency.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nHowever, is SAP Clean Core enough to address these issues on its own? Thomas Failer, the CEO of Data Migration International, the inventor of the One Click Transformation approach based on the JiVS Information Management Platform for data migration and application retirement, shared that, while SAP Clean Core is a solid method for integrating SAP S/4HANA Cloud that allows you to minimize customizations, developments and move only relevant data, its process can be elevated even further.\n\nAccording to Failer, it is possible by enhancing SAP Clean Core with a solution specifically designed for data migration. As an example, Failer explained that, while SAP Clean Core allows users to achieve easier upgrades and lean and scalable system architecture, DMI\u2019s One Click Transformation can support the whole process by archiving historical data and managing it outside the core system, giving users the ability to retire legacy systems without losing access to critical historical data. Furthermore, the One Click Transformation enables the business to clean up and transform the relevant master data in a simple way.\n\nAdditionally, with SAP Clean Core ensuring that only relevant and high-quality data is migrated to S/4HANA, DMI\u2019s One Click Transformation can separate operational data migrated to S/4 from historical data archived in JiVS, thus reducing data volume in new target systems by 90-95 percent and enabling more efficient migration. Furthermore, according to Failer, it can automate large portions of migration and reduce its costs and timeframe by 50 percent, therefore eliminating downtime challenges and providing a more focused and clean dataset for operational systems.\n\nAll these functions can also help improve business agility, according to DMI\u2019s executive. Specifically, Failer said, \u201cOur One Click Transformation approach complements SAP Clean Core by freeing up resources to focus on new projects and innovations and enabling businesses to adapt quickly to market changes, and bringing the data into optimal shape without the burden of legacy systems or poor-quality data.\u201d\n\nEnhanced data quality and focus on relevant, essential data lead to greater process excellence and significantly reduce the effort required for troubleshooting caused by inaccurate or inconsistent data.\n\nHigher business agility also means a higher ability to ensure compliance and governance \u2013 and JiVS can help reinforce it by storing historical data securely while ensuring accessibility for audits and supporting data privacy regulations with tools for data retention and controlled access.\n\nFinally, the joint effort between SAP Clean Core and One Click Transformation powered by JiVS IMP can help organizations reduce TCO and drive sustainability: as Failer shared, on top of SAP Clean Core\u2019s elimination of unnecessary customizations, JiVS can \u201cminimize data-related expenses for storage, processing and migration and simplify the decommissioning of legacy systems, supporting efficient system upgrades with a clean S/4HANA core.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOn top of that, with SAP Clean Core contributing to sustainability goals by reducing IT system complexity and optimizing resource usage, JiVS enhances sustainability by archiving legacy data to significantly reduce storage and energy consumption and supporting efficient data lifecycle management to minimize the IT carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nSo, as can be concluded from the insight from DMI\u2019s CEO, migration to SAP S/4HANA does not just have to be a necessity and complex process: with the help of the SAP Clean Core approach and solutions like JiVS, it can also be an opportunity to enhance your tech stack with processes that increase your agility, compliance, sustainability, and above all, data quality.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe equity market has climbed consistently over the past few years on the global economy recovering from the COVID-19-fueled slowdown. On the other hand, artificial intelligence has emerged as a key catalyst pushing the market to new heights. Tech-laden Nasdaq, home to some of the biggest AI investment plays, was up by 29% in 2024, adding to the 43% gain generated in 2023.\n\nThe big question at the start of the new year is whether the AI-driven rally is sustainable. Has the market run ahead of itself, as some stocks have increased by more than 200%, resulting in overstretched valuations? If history is anything to go by, investors have nothing to worry about, but be optimistic, as the equity market has always rallied each year after a 28% or more gain the previous year.\n\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, the artificial intelligence industry is expected to reach its peak in 2025, with a $2 trillion increase in capital expenditures over the following three years. Governments around the globe pushing for friendly regulatory conversations on AI ethics and safety should spur innovation in the sector.\n\n\u201cWe believe tech stocks will be robust in 2025 on the shoulders of the AI Revolution and $2 trillion+ of incremental AI Capex (spending) over the next 3 years,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nThe fact that big tech companies are ramping up their AI investments to gain a competitive edge affirms AI rally sustainability. Wall Street experts expect several businesses to continue growing due to the untapped potential of revolutionary technology. As large-cap tech revises their AI capital expenditures upward, investors should position themselves for opportunities. Analysts at UBS expect AI capital expenditure to reach record highs of $280 billion in 2025, up from about $224 billion in 2024. The increase in AI capital expenditure is expected to result in game-changing innovations and development, which should support and fuel the AI rally. Nevertheless, the analysts have warned that AI revenues are likely to lag capital expenditures.\n\n\u201cBig tech firms will likely make more headway in monetizing their AI spending this year. While AI revenues are likely to again lag behind Capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d UBS said in a research note.\n\nAmid the expected increase in AI capital expenditure, analysts at BNY Mellon Wealth Management believe that \u201cAI\u2019s role in the world will surpass that of other technologies that propelled earlier periods of tidal change.\u201d Its increased roll should also strengthen bullishness in the equity market, broadening the gains, as in 2024.",

            "content": "The Schaeffler Group has been driving groundbreaking inventions and developments in the field of motion technology over the last 75 years. From bearing solutions and linear guidance systems to repair and monitoring services, the manufacturer has innovated a range of critical technologies, products, and services for electric mobility, CO\u2082-efficient drives, chassis solutions, and renewable energies.\n\nSAP Returnable Packaging Management: Drive sustainability, reduce packaging costs, and promote collaboration with supply chain partners Learn how\n\nAll this hard work and ingenuity has turned Schaeffler into a reliable partner in making motion more efficient, intelligent, and sustainable across the entire life cycle.\n\nAccording to Christof Heurung, head of Strategic Digitalization at Schaeffler: \u201cWe see sustainability and digitalization as key topics for our future success. By combining the right digital technologies, such as AI innovations, with our pioneering spirit, we can take sustainability to the next level and create an even more sustainable future for Schaeffler, as well as for our customers and suppliers.\u201d\n\nPartnering for Greener Supply Chain Digitalization\n\nShipping diverse offerings to customers worldwide requires a wide array of containers \u2014 all of which must be managed efficiently and transparently across internal operations, suppliers, and customers. However, to be successful, this approach demands the integration of numerous business systems and applications to access and exchange information securely, streamline processes strategically, and react to new challenges and opportunities with precision.\n\nUnfortunately, most companies fall short of achieving this advantage. Shipping containers are often managed with a fragmented application landscape. This setup challenges the ability to respond quickly to packaging trends and new business requirements. It also limits the transparency needed to reconcile customers\u2019 returnable-packaging accounts accurately and outsource delivery services to the right shared-service center. Suppliers using the same containers operate on a separate third-party system, leading to disjointed operations.\n\n\u201cAfter using SAP solutions for around 40 years now, during the past five years, we have established a strategic partnership with SAP to develop and introduce new IT application systems while forging ahead in our desire to run a more sustainable operation,\u201d says Gerhard Stoessel, IT program lead for SAP S/4HANA at the Schaeffler Group. \u201cSuch a relationship is allowing Schaeffler and SAP to identify unmet industry needs and launch numerous innovations.\u201d\n\nIntroducing Industry-Wide Circular Logistic Flows\n\nOne of those innovations is the SAP Returnable Packaging Management solution. The industry-specific solution supports circular logistic flows for returnable and reusable packaging material such as containers, boxes, and pallets \u2014 from supplier and customer deliveries to intra-company movements and the journey back to the company.\n\nWhen Schaeffler first used SAP Returnable Packaging Management, it covered only 30% of container management requirements. Sven Proschek, product owner of SAP S/4HANA Cloud for logistics at Schaeffler, notes that the company\u2019s close collaboration with SAP was key to turning this trend around: \u201cOur partnership with SAP enabled us to enrich the solution with the industry-relevant capabilities that companies like ours need, as well as near-seamless, end-to-end integration of the container management cycle.\u201d\n\nSchaeffler is currently rolling out the solution across over 80 manufacturing plants in its worldwide ecosystem. This approach is streamlining the supply chain into a more efficient and robust network, resulting in fewer delivery failures and deeper transparency in the company\u2019s packaging material inventory. The overall workload is decreasing even though the company ships products to more customers \u2014 thanks to AI capabilities such as container reconciliation automation and self-services for reordering packaging materials and checking inventory.\n\n\u201cWe can now react quickly to new trends, support an end-to-end collaborative solution for suppliers and customers, and save time and costs through automation,\u201d Proschek reports. \u201cEfficient container management also helps us avoid delivery failures due to shortages.\u201d\n\nMaking Sustainability More Cost-Efficient\n\nSchaeffler is also exploring new AI-enabled capabilities for SAP Returnable Packaging Management that can help the business, as well as its peers, further bridge the gap between sustainability and cost efficiency.\n\nOne idea that is gaining traction is machine learning-powered returnable packaging account matching. It aims to reduce the manual effort needed to analyze unmatched items and determine whether the underlying issue is a logistical exception or a discrepancy in matching attributes between incoming statements and open line items.\n\nWith this capability, Schaeffler can perform returnable account matching with the help of machine learning models and automate the matching process by activating line-item matching. Doing so streamlines the reconciliation process and enhances efficiency, empowering packaging planners to focus on strategic tasks. Additionally, it minimizes errors and increases the accuracy of the returnable packaging material inventory across the supply chain.\n\nExpanding the Possibilities with a Future-Minded Vision\n\nSchaeffler\u2019s commitment to innovation and sustainability is evident in its adoption of AI-powered solutions for sustainable packaging and supply chain management. By using technologies such as the line-item matching functionality available in SAP Returnable Packaging Management, Schaeffler is not only streamlining its operations but also reducing costs, minimizing errors, and increasing efficiency.\n\nAs Schaeffler continues to lead the way in sustainable packaging practices, it sets a compelling example for the industry, showcasing the transformative potential of cloud innovations and AI in driving sustainable business practices.\n\nRead more about Schaeffler Group\u2019s experience with SAP Returnable Packaging Management Download the document\n\nKorbinian Koblitz is Business Development lead at SAP.",

            "content": "By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at SAP SE ( ), which is up 100%, over three years, soundly beating the market decline of 15% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 77%, including dividends.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver the last three years, SAP failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 21% (annualized).\n\nThis means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.\n\nThe modest 0.9% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. It could be that the revenue growth of 6.5% per year is viewed as evidence that SAP is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.\n\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nSAP is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of SAP, it has a TSR of 112% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that SAP shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 77% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 17% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

            "content": "\n\nSAP consulting in 2025\n\nThe field of SAP consulting in 2025 offers many rewards for those prepared to adapt, grow, and thoughtfully plan their careers.\n\nAs the SAP ecosystem evolves due to advancing technology, changing economies, and shifting business requirements, consultants must navigate these changes with care and readiness.\n\nWhether you are employed full-time, exploring new roles, or working independently, increasing your income as an SAP consultant is always possible, by assessing your current situation and exploring the SAP talent market.\n\nHere IgniteSAP will outline some of those options for SAP consultants looking to maximize their earnings this year.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the SAP Consulting Market\n\nIn 2025, demand for SAP consultants continues to rise as many organizations transition to advanced platforms like S/4HANA and adopt cloud-based solutions. The phase-out of ECC has led to a wave of migration projects, creating a need for skilled consultants to handle these transitions. Meanwhile, technologies such as AI, machine learning, and IoT are transforming how businesses operate, requiring consultants to broaden their technical skills.\n\nAlong with technical abilities, clients want consultants who understand the specifics of their industry and can address unique business challenges. Succeeding in this competitive space means keeping up with market trends and building expertise in emerging tools like SAP\u2019s Business Technology Platform or low-code/no-code development. Those who can align their skills with these priorities become essential for organizations working toward digital transformation.\n\n\n\nAdvancing Within Your Current Organization\n\nEarning more as an SAP consultant doesn\u2019t always require finding a new employer. Your current role may hold untapped opportunities for higher pay and responsibility.\n\nStart by reviewing and documenting your previous contributions, such as cost reductions, process improvements, or successful project outcomes. Aim to make a reasonable assessment of the value you bring to the organization. This data can help you make a strong case for a raise.\n\nProposing new projects that support the company\u2019s goals can also highlight your abilities. For instance, suggesting ways to improve system connectivity or automate repetitive tasks can demonstrate your strategic value. Additionally, gaining certifications in areas that match the extra skills needed by your organization, like SAP Integration Suite or S/4HANA cloud solutions, can set you apart and make a solid case for promotions. You might even be offered funding for completing extra training.\n\n\n\nSAP Consulting Career Mobility\n\nChanging employers can be a highly effective way to increase your earnings. Many companies are willing to pay higher salaries to attract experienced SAP consultants, especially in areas where talent is scarce.\n\nWhen looking for new opportunities, building a strong personal brand is crucial so try to give your online presence a boost in the months leading up to your job search. Highlighting your accomplishments on platforms like LinkedIn or showcasing your expertise through a professional portfolio can attract recruiters and employers.\n\nWorking with specialized recruitment agencies, such as IgniteSAP, can also help you find premium opportunities. These agencies can help you build a strategy for progress, and often have insights into employer needs and market trends, enabling you to secure the roles that align with your interests and career goals.\n\n\n\nCreating New Income Streams\n\nAlong with your daily consulting activities, there are many ways to diversify your income. Developing and selling tools or templates for SAP implementations is one example. For instance, creating reusable frameworks for common integration tasks or industry-specific pre-configured solutions can appeal to businesses looking for efficiency. Clearly showing your unique working methods and technical innovations helps you shine when applying for new roles as well.\n\nYour stock of SAP knowledge is valuable, and you could also lead occasional workshops for corporate teams, host webinars, or design online courses for professionals seeking to improve their SAP skills. These activities not only generate income but also build your reputation as an expert in the field.\n\nExperienced consultants may also consider offering advisory services on a retainer basis. This provides steady, ongoing income as you support clients with regular system reviews, compliance updates, or performance improvements. Such long-term engagements often lead to deep client relationships, which can result in more opportunities over time.\n\n\n\nHigh-Demand and Emerging Specializations\n\nYour area of specialization plays a key role in determining your earning potential. Expertise in S/4HANA continues to be in high demand as companies migrate to this platform. Skills in Analytics Cloud, and emerging SAP AI functionalities are increasingly required.\n\nBusinesses are seeking frictionless operations across various platforms, making skills in SAP Integration Suite particularly valuable. Consultants with knowledge of IoT and machine learning can find opportunities in industries like manufacturing and logistics, where these technologies are being applied to improve operations.\n\nEmerging technologies such as automation and business process optimization are also creating niches for consultants. By staying informed about these advancements and building relevant expertise, you can qualify for roles that offer premium compensation.\n\n\n\nStrengthening Client Relationships\n\nBuilding and maintaining strong relationships with clients is an essential way to maintain, and to boost your earnings as an SAP consultant. Happy clients often return with more projects or refer you to others, expanding your opportunities. To encourage trust it\u2019s necessary to deliver consistent, high-quality results while keeping communication open and transparent throughout the project.\n\nOne way to deepen these relationships is by offering post-implementation support. This shows your dedication to helping clients succeed even after the initial project ends. For example, assisting with fine-tuning systems or successfully addressing unexpected issues makes you a reliable partner.\n\nNegotiating performance-based payments with clients is another way to increase your income. These arrangements tie your compensation to measurable outcomes, such as meeting project deadlines or improving system efficiency. This adds to your earnings but also demonstrates accountability and confidence in your abilities.\n\nAsking clients for testimonials and permission to showcase your work helps you attract new business. Positive reviews can be used on your LinkedIn profile, website, or professional portfolio, making it easier for potential clients to see your value. A referral program offering incentives for recommendations can expand your network and lead to more high-value projects.\n\n\n\nNetworking and Becoming a Thought Leader\n\nNetworking within the SAP community is a powerful way to uncover new opportunities and increase your visibility. Joining discussions in forums, conferences, or webinars connects you with other professionals and potential clients. Being active in these spaces keeps you updated on industry trends but also helps others recognize your expertise.\n\nPublishing articles or reports about SAP-related topics is another way to grow your reputation. By sharing practical advice or exploring innovative solutions, you position yourself as an authority in the field.\n\nMentoring newer consultants is a valuable way to give back to the community while strengthening your network. By helping others grow, you solidify your position as a trusted leader in the SAP consulting space. This can lead to unexpected opportunities, including partnerships or referrals from those you\u2019ve supported as their own networks grow.\n\n\n\nBalancing Freelance and Full-Time Roles\n\nFreelancing allows for more flexibility and often higher hourly rates, but understand it comes with added responsibilities, such as managing taxes, contracts, and insurance. If you choose this route, focusing on short-term projects with high payoffs can help you make the most of your time. Offering your services to clients in different time zones or regions can also keep your workload steady and broaden your reach, so fluency in other languages can also help.\n\nFor independent consultants, working with an accountant to identify tax-saving strategies can reduce overall costs. Investing in insurance, such as professional liability coverage, protects you from risks tied to high-stakes projects. Retirement planning is another important consideration for those who don\u2019t have employer-sponsored plans.\n\nFor those in full-time roles, exploring other regions can also open up new opportunities. Some regions offer higher salaries for skilled consultants. Taking on assignments in these areas boosts your earnings and exposes you to unique projects and experiences.\n\nFull-time employment provides much greater financial stability and valuable benefits like healthcare or retirement plans, which can be substantial. Performance bonuses or pay tied to project milestones can also help bridge the income gap between full-time roles and freelancing.\n\nSound financial management can have a big impact on your earnings. Having savings to fall back on, even for those in stable and full-time employment, can help you if you decide leave your current employer. This financial buffer can fund a period of training or an extended job search, for those looking for their perfect employers.\n\n\n\nAligning Skills with SAP\u2019s Roadmap\n\nTo maximize your earnings, it\u2019s important to develop skills that match SAP\u2019s evolving priorities. The company\u2019s focus on cloud adoption, intelligent enterprise solutions, and low-code platforms means these areas will continue to see high demand. Pursuing certifications or training programs related to SAP Integration Suite, advanced analytics, or industry-specific platforms and cloud infrastructure ensures you stay competitive.\n\nKeeping an eye on broader trends in the SAP services industry, such as the increasing role of AI and automation, also helps you anticipate client needs. Find an area of emerging SAP technology that extends your current skills, and acquire training and gather experience to bring added value to your clients. By adapting your skills, you maintain your relevance in a field that is constantly changing.\n\nMaximizing your earnings as an SAP consultant in 2025 requires you to combine strategies that range from building technical skills to strengthening relationships and exploring new income opportunities. Staying adaptable to industry trends and continuously improving your abilities will set you apart in the market. Whatever your circumstances and professional objectives, success lies in your ability to innovate, learn, and deliver value to your clients.\n\nIf you are an SAP professional looking for a new role in the SAP ecosystem our team of dedicated recruitment consultants can match you with your ideal employer and negotiate a competitive compensation package for your extremely valuable skills, so join our exclusive community at IgniteSAP.",

            "content": "\n\nAn Important Year for SAP Consulting\n\nThe year 2025 is a turning point for SAP and its ecosystem as the company continues its evolution into a cloud-centric enterprise. SAP consultants must prepare to navigate an environment shaped by rapid technological advancements, shifting market dynamics, and an increasing emphasis on specialized solutions.\n\nThis article from IgniteSAP discusses SAP\u2019s development plans and their implications for consultants aiming to excel in this changing landscape.\n\n\n\nSAP\u2019s Strategic Direction\n\nSAP\u2019s Ambition 2025 initiative highlights the company\u2019s plan to overhaul their operations, optimize resources, and achieve significant financial growth. SAP\u2019s stated objective is \u20ac10 billion in non-IFRS operating profit this year, and they have focused on expanding cloud offerings and improving efficiency.\n\nThe company\u2019s transformation includes restructuring efforts and investments in scalable SaaS models, contributing to its goal to become a dominant cloud enterprise. In official SAP Investor Relations documents, these measures include consolidating overlapping product lines, reorganizing internal teams for better efficiency, and divesting non-core products that do not align with SAP\u2019s cloud-first focus.\n\nAccording to CEO Christian Klein, S/4HANA Cloud is expected to be the primary engine for SAP\u2019s expansion, delivering a modern ERP with built-in AI and data analytics that help businesses automate processes and improve decision-making, SAP\u2019s other AI integrations are also expected to substantially increase the corporation\u2019s growth.\n\nThese strategies align with broader market trends, favoring subscription-based services over traditional licensing in order to provide more predictable revenue for the purposes of expansion. By emphasizing a subscription model, SAP also intends to reduce the total cost of ownership for customers.\n\nConsultants will find opportunities in helping businesses adapt to SAP\u2019s evolving delivery models, ensuring alignment between technological capabilities and organizational objectives.\n\n\n\nS/4HANA Cloud\n\nOriginally, SAP announced that mainstream maintenance for ECC would end in 2025. However, to accommodate the large existing customer base, this deadline was extended to 2027, with extended support running until 2030. In presentations at SAP Sapphire, and in statements during their quarterly financial results statements, SAP executives have consistently urged customers to start planning so they can avoid a last-minute rush.\n\nIn 2025, SAP expects a critical mass of ECC customers to have migrated or begun their migration journey to S/4HANA, which, given the timescale for large implementations, means we can expect many customers competing for a limited number of SAP consultants.\n\n\n\nIn SAP\u2019s quarterly financial statements and press releases, S/4HANA customer adoption saw double-digit growth in the first half of 2024, reflecting accelerating interest in SAP\u2019s cloud ERP offerings. Christian Klein, CEO of SAP, has highlighted that most new customers are opting for S/4HANA Cloud over on-premise versions, a trend expected to intensify in 2025. These figures align with a broader industry shift: as organizations modernize their ERP landscapes, the speed and scale of cloud deployment have become vital competitive differentiators.\n\n\n\nRISE with SAP\n\nBy 2025, SAP intends for RISE to be the primary vehicle for customer migrations. In multiple conference keynotes executives have explained how RISE with SAP helps companies minimize risk and reduce upfront infrastructure investments.\n\nRISE with SAP comprises several core components: Business Process Intelligence provides real-time insights for optimizing and standardizing operations before and during migration, while technical migration tools (including data utilities, system conversion methodologies, and guided deployment packages) simplify the transition.\n\nSAP BTP serves as a foundation for extending, integrating, and customizing S/4HANA solutions, and embedded analytics and AI services expedite decision-making and automate routine tasks in the post-migration environment.\n\nThis framework lowers the complexity barrier, making S/4HANA migration more accessible for both large enterprises and mid-market firms.\n\n\n\nCloud Migration and the Hybrid Landscape\n\nMany organizations migrating to S/4HANA already have workloads on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private clouds. SAP has responded by forging strategic partnerships with major hyperscalers, ensuring that S/4HANA Cloud can be deployed in multi-cloud or hybrid environments.\n\nIn official statements, SAP conveyed the importance of these alliances to smooth out deployment, reduce latency, and provide consistent global support. By 2025, SAP envisions a landscape where the majority of its S/4HANA clients leverage multi-cloud setups for flexibility and resilience.\n\nThese evolving delivery models create strong demand for consultants experienced in cloud architecture, system integration, and security best practices. SAP consultancies that can design, deploy, and manage hybrid infrastructures stand to benefit most in the coming years. SAP Community discussions and TechEd workshops emphasize the need for technical and functional experts who can align organizational objectives, data migration strategies, and custom extension scenarios with the capabilities of S/4HANA Cloud.\n\n\n\nOpportunities for Consultants\n\nAs RISE with SAP becomes a primary migration framework, consultants who thoroughly understand its components, including licensing structures to advanced analytics, will become invaluable. Many enterprises struggle with the complexities of bundling infrastructure, software, and support services into a single contract. Consultants who can clarify these aspects and adjust them to each customer\u2019s unique context will see heightened demand.\n\n\n\nThough SAP is encouraging most customers to adopt RISE, many enterprises require hybrid models, retaining critical processes on-premise while embracing new functionalities in the cloud. This approach calls for consultants familiar with network architecture, security protocols, data governance, and integration methodologies across different platforms. Aligning these hybrid or multi-cloud strategies with existing business goals, while managing risk and regulatory compliance, will be a prized skill set in 2025.\n\nThe push to adopt S/4HANA Cloud is also about future-proofing. By using built-in AI and predictive analytics, businesses can gain real-time insights and agility. Consultants who can educate and guide customers on how to harness these advanced functionalities are likely to remain in high demand. SAP\u2019s financial projections through 2025 hinge upon rapid customer adoption of these next-generation capabilities.\n\n\n\nSAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)\n\nServing as a centralized hub, BTP eases connectivity between SAP and non-SAP applications, enabling businesses to innovate while maintaining their recommended clean core implementation strategy.\n\nAt SAP TechEd 2024, SAP executives reiterated the importance of BTP as the foundational layer underpinning SAP\u2019s entire cloud portfolio. BTP integrates application development, data management, analytics, AI, and ML services so organizations can extend or customize SAP solutions without extensive code-based deployments. The platform\u2019s low-code and no-code tools also allow consultants and users to create custom solutions without disrupting critical functionalities.\n\nConsultants proficient in BTP will find extensive opportunities helping clients adapt to the clean-core approach, enabling faster implementation times and making it easier for customers to adopt new capabilities in line with SAP\u2019s 2025 plan for fully cloud-enabled, intelligent processes.\n\n\n\nAI and Advanced Analytics\n\nMany AI and machine learning capabilities are already deeply embedded across SAP\u2019s portfolio, changing decision-making and process optimization for businesses. SAP Business AI, adopted by thousands of customers so far, delivers predictive analytics, automated workflows, and advanced insights that enable organizations to respond effectively to rapidly changing conditions. During last year\u2019s Sapphire keynote sessions, SAP highlighted that AI/ML capabilities will be standard in S/4HANA Cloud and other core applications by 2025.\n\nIncorporating AI into SAP solutions enhances operational efficiency by automating routine tasks, improving data accuracy, and uncovering actionable insights. For instance, within SAP S/4HANA, AI-driven tools streamline inventory management by forecasting demand fluctuations and identifying bottlenecks in supply chains. These capabilities empower businesses to optimize their operations and remain agile in the face of volatility in their markets.\n\nAnother significant application of AI lies in consulting processes like automated testing and data migration. AI-powered tools can be used to identify potential errors, optimize workflows, and accelerate implementation timelines, thereby reducing project risks.\n\nSAP has stated that by 2025, it aims to be recognized not only as an ERP and cloud solutions provider but also as a top-tier analytics vendor, furnishing companies with end-to-end data insights that drive innovation.\n\nConsultants proficient in configuring and managing these functionalities can help clients achieve faster returns on investment while ensuring smooth transitions during system upgrades. Whether enabling predictive maintenance in manufacturing or streamlining HR processes, mastery of AI tools positions consultants as valued partners in their clients\u2019 digital transformation journeys.\n\n\n\nIndustry Cloud and Vertical Solutions\n\nIndustry Cloud solutions reflect SAP\u2019s focus on delivering sector-specific value by addressing unique operational challenges across industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and financial services. These pre-configured offerings combine best practices with flexibility, enabling businesses to adopt tailored solutions with minimal disruption. SAP aims to expand these vertical solutions to cover a broader range of industries, reinforcing its leadership in cloud-based vertical services.\n\nFor consultants, specializing in vertical domains presents an opportunity to bridge the gap between technology and business outcomes. Expertise in Industry Cloud will be crucial for driving innovation and optimizing processes within specific sectors, enhancing the consultant\u2019s relevance in a competitive market.\n\n\n\nRegional and Regulatory Challenges\n\nSAP\u2019s global footprint means its solutions must adapt to varying regional requirements, including data sovereignty, privacy regulations, and industry-specific compliance mandates. For instance, the GDPR in Europe, and data localization laws in markets like India shape how SAP solutions are deployed and managed.\n\nConsultants must be prepared to navigate these complexities by tailoring implementations to local requirements. This includes addressing challenges related to cross-border data flows, ensuring adherence to compliance standards, and managing multi-cloud environments with region-specific considerations.\n\nSustainability is another emerging area, with SAP recently releasing its Green Ledger, along with other solutions such as Sustainability Control Tower, to help customers track resource usage and implement carbon accounting. Customers have yet to adopt such solutions at scale, but increasing environmental legislation will soon make sustainability a key requirement of ERP systems.\n\n\n\nEcosystem Growth and Partnerships\n\nSAP\u2019s partnerships with hyperscalers, as well as the most well-known service providers continue to expand the ecosystem\u2019s capabilities. These collaborations enable businesses to deploy SAP solutions in multi-cloud environments, or create innovative deployment packages for customers providing services integrating SAP data with cloud-based AI or big data services.\n\nConsultants can augment their SAP skills with additional relevant capabilities. Third-party marketplaces, such as the SAP App Center, offer pre-built solutions that complement SAP\u2019s core functionalities. Consultants with the skills to integrate third-party solutions can help clients evaluate and implement these tools to address specific business needs.\n\nAs mergers and acquisitions reshape the ecosystem, integration expertise becomes increasingly valuable. Consultants who can align disparate systems and harmonize data across newly combined entities will find themselves in high demand.\n\n\n\nTalent Shortages and Skill Development\n\nDespite significant talent and training initiatives, the SAP ecosystem faces a significant shortage of skilled consultants, particularly in high-demand areas like S/4HANA migrations, Industry Cloud implementations, and advanced analytics. Although this is a substantial issue for the SAP ecosystem as a whole, the skills gap presents opportunities for individual consultants willing to invest in professional growth, as demand for skilled consultants is high, and increasing.\n\nTraining programs, such as those offered by SAP Learning Hub, provide pathways to develop in-demand competencies. Certifications in areas like SAP BTP, AI/ML, and S/4HANA Cloud can set consultants apart in the marketplace. Training should be backed up with practical experience gained through participation in relevant client projects to build credibility and expertise, as employers value proven skills along with certification.\n\n\n\nCareer Paths and Professional Development\n\nSAP\u2019s Road Map Explorer offers consultants a comprehensive view of upcoming product updates, enhancements, and strategic priorities. This tool is invaluable for aligning career development with emerging trends. Regularly checking for upcoming releases can help inform choices for upskilling and certification. By staying informed, consultants can anticipate client needs and position themselves as forward-thinking advisors.\n\nTo stay relevant, consultants should focus on acquiring skills in cloud migration, AI-driven analytics, and Industry Cloud solutions. These areas are central to SAP\u2019s strategy and reflect the priorities of clients navigating digital transformation. Resources like SAP Learning Hub and certifications provide clear pathways to build expertise.\n\nRegular review of SAP product updates, announcements, and roadmaps ensures consultants remain ahead of the curve. This proactive approach enables them to anticipate client needs and provide strategic guidance.\n\nParticipation in SAP user groups, such as ASUG, and events like SAP Sapphire and TechEd provides extra opportunities to connect with peers, share knowledge, and learn about SAP\u2019s latest advancements. Networking within these communities not only enhances visibility but also encourages collaboration and innovation.\n\n\n\nPreparing for Success\n\nSAP\u2019s strategic focus on cloud-first solutions, advanced analytics, and industry-specific offerings defines its vision for 2025. These priorities create new opportunities for consultants willing to adapt to this evolving landscape.\n\nThe path to success lies in a commitment to continuous learning, specialization in high-demand areas, and active engagement with the SAP ecosystem.\n\nThis year, consultants must seize the moment to improve their skills, explore new opportunities, and deliver transformative solutions that drive client success. By taking these decisive steps now, they can ensure a successful career in the SAP ecosystem.\n\nIf you are an SAP professional looking for a new role in the SAP ecosystem our team of dedicated recruitment consultants can match you with your ideal employer and negotiate a competitive compensation package for your extremely valuable skills, so join our exclusive community at IgniteSAP.",

            "content": "No company does business alone, and today\u2019s leaders have a unique opportunity to manage their supply chains as strategic assets that can optimize and even expand their customer relationships.\n\nThat requires them to build efficient procurement, supply chain, and distribution processes while recognizing that serving customers effectively is the single biggest objective \u2014 the \u201cwhy\u201d \u2014 that should drive \u201chow\u201d those processes operate.\n\nSAP Business Network is a powerful platform for linking core business processes between trading partners while ensuring visibility, efficiency, and compliance. SAP Business Network closes the break point between buyers and suppliers, contract manufacturers, service providers, and carriers by enabling digitized transaction exchange, information sharing, and trading partner discovery, while leveraging AI and configurable business rules.\n\nCloud Wars Founder Bob Evans recently spoke with Valerie Blatt, global head for SAP Business Network customer success and go-to-market, to understand how customers use the SAP Business Network in supply chains and trading partnerships that are so critical to their ability to innovate and compete in today\u2019s rapidly changing business environment.\n\nThe Customer-Centric Supply Chain\n\nBlatt provided context by explaining the benefits of a robust supply chain in optimizing customer relationships. \u201cIt\u2019s about delivering that great customer experience, ensuring that the customers get their goods and services and that, ultimately, they\u2019re satisfied in buying again,\u201d she said.\n\nThis priority must be clearly established and understood when operating and fine-tuning the supply chain. \u201cSupply chain executives should think the \u2018why\u2019 is actually their customer, not the operation,\u201d Blatt explained. Efficient processes \u2014 delivering goods and services that meet customers\u2019 needs \u2014 are the \u201chow\u201d behind great customer experiences.\n\nStill, optimized customer experiences can\u2019t come at the expense of core business objectives. \u201cWe need to think about how we meet the business imperatives around efficiency and cost management and be conscious of how we deliver a great customer experience.\u201d\n\nAsked about challenges that customers face when balancing operational efficiency in the supply chain with customer satisfaction, Blatt cited visibility, referencing experiences during and after Covid, when customers frequently didn\u2019t know when orders would arrive, where they were coming from, or what external factors such as delays at ports were causing disruptions. Such a lack of visibility makes it more difficult to manage risk, but the challenges shouldn\u2019t deter an organization in its efforts to deliver great customer experience. \u201cEven in customer-centric supply chains, you don\u2019t have to trade one off for the other,\u201d she said.\n\nAdditionally, compliance and meeting regulatory requirements are increasingly recognized as mission-critical supply chain priorities. \u201cIt\u2019s not only operating as efficiently as you can from just being internally efficient, but it\u2019s understanding what\u2019s going on in the world from a regulation standpoint as well,\u201d Blatt said.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis\n\nHelping Businesses Perform Better\n\nAs companies strive to establish customer experience as their supply-chain \u201cwhy,\u201d some are not fully embracing the technology or cultural changes that will yield optimal customer experiences.\n\n\u201cWhile most companies have done a pretty good job at deploying technologies and automating their core processes, a lot of companies are actually, in my opinion, not bold enough when it comes to really driving the changes that they need to drive,\u201d Blatt commented.\n\nMore specifically, Blatt believes that many companies are failing to implement transformative technologies that will benefit customers because they don\u2019t see such technologies as a competitive advantage. \u201cThey\u2019re still thinking of themselves as an operator,\u201d she said.\n\nTo illustrate the point that some companies aren\u2019t changing fast enough, Blatt recounted a recent event in Europe where she asked a group of senior executives how many of their companies still send orders via fax. With one exception, all of the 50 or so in attendance still do so.\n\nSo how does SAP Business Network help companies build modern, efficient supply chains for standout customer experiences?\n\nThe network modernizes how companies connect and collaborate across procurement and supply chain processes: integrating with back-end systems on both sides of a trading partner relationship, enabling organizations to share information to gain all-important visibility, operate more efficiently, and comply with internal policies and external regulations.\n\nIncreased visibility, efficiency, and compliance, in turn, drive continuous improvement that is making customer-centric supply chains a reality.\n\nIn fact, a study that SAP conducted with IDC* found that SAP Business Network customers had a remarkable 404% three-year return on their investment. Customers also reported 30% faster go-to-market speed, and 27% faster product/order delivery time when using SAP Business Network.\n\nAdditional customer benefits that have been quantified through SAP Performance Benchmarking:\n\n40% to 60% reduction in expedited logistics operating costs for improved visibility\n\n40% to 60% reduction in operating costs for processing invoices for greater efficiency\n\n83% of total invoices processed without exceptions for enhanced compliance\n\nWhat started out as a procurement network roughly 20 years ago now supports over $6 trillion worth of transaction volume on a rolling 12-month basis, thanks in large part to the types of efficiencies detailed above.\n\nAs these data points indicate, SAP Business Network provides businesses with a range of opportunities to create processes that deliver exceptional supply chain performance and customer experiences.\n\nBut companies also need to embrace the changes required in terms of technology, processes, and organizational considerations.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say to all my supply chain friends, whether you\u2019re in planning, whether you\u2019re in operations, whether you\u2019re in logistics, whether you\u2019re in procurement be bold,\u201d Blatt said. \u201cYour competitors, I think, are going to be bold, and we are going to see this more and more, that the companies that can be super-efficient and customer-centric at the same time\u2026are the customers that are going to win.\u201d\n\nBe efficient. Be customer-centric. Be bold. That\u2019s a solid prescription for supply chain success in 2025.\n\nGet more insights on SAP Business Network.\n\n* IDC Business Value Snapshot, sponsored by SAP, \u201cBusiness Value of SAP Business Network \u2013 Buy Side,\u201d IDC #US52679524, 2024.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies.

            "content": "For any large enterprise like Microsoft, monitoring threats to infrastructure and applications developing and maintaining an always-on Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution like Microsoft Sentinel that\u2019s equipped to ward off threats isn\u2019t only a weighty task but also a truly challenging undertaking.\n\nThe threat landscape is constantly evolving, and data breaches\u2014originating from outside or within organizations\u2014are commonplace. Organizations now acknowledge that securing their digital perimeter is an insufficient and inherently reactive approach. That\u2019s because modern security solutions, to be robust, must protect the entire enterprise environment, including core business processes, the sensitive data that those processes might expose, and the systems that support those processes. This recognition prompted Microsoft to seek a more complete, continuous, and dynamic solution to better protect its SAP assets\u2014Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM platform that uses built-in AI to quickly help analyze large volumes of data across an enterprise. Microsoft\u2019s SAP assets include applications that support Microsoft\u2019s core business processes and combined, comprise an impressive 24 terabytes (TB) of data.\n\nMicrosoft had a two-fold rationale for developing its new Microsoft Sentinel SAP SIEM solution: to better detect suspicious activity and to fully document security incidents and how the organization resolves them. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems like SAP are facing increasing cybersecurity threats, across the industry spectrum, from healthcare and manufacturing, to finance, retail, and e-commerce. Threat actors, recognizing such systems\u2019 vulnerabilities, have identified ERP systems as a prime target. SAP vulnerability is a critical concern for enterprise executives and senior security professionals, given that the average cost of an SAP breach is $5 million per attack. That cost doesn\u2019t figure in the reputational damage a breach or attack might confer, which is often substantial and prolonged.\n\n[Using Microsoft Azure AD MFA at Microsoft to enhance remote security. Moving to next-generation SIEM with Microsoft Sentinel. Using shielded virtual machines to help protect high-value assets.]\n\nIdentifying threats\u2014and a solution\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel and Microsoft\u2019s SAP Security teams defined a roadmap to address current challenges and chart a path to using the preventive and detective capabilities of Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Azure. Additionally, the collaborative efforts of SAP and Microsoft Azure increase end-to-end visibility across enterprise systems and applications and help bolster system resilience. Although Microsoft has tools in place to detect and log threats across its SAP landscape, the challenge was managing the number of tools, the data sources, and the effort required to analyze and help remediate a threat.\n\nConsidering that any breach in Microsoft SAP applications could have catastrophic consequences for us, we knew that we needed a solution that enabled rapid vulnerability detection and monitoring capabilities to reduce risks to the organization. We needed an internally managed and configured SIEM solution that could baseline user behaviors and detect anomalies across SAP to include the OS and network layer, the database layer, and the application and business logic layers. \u2014Kusuma Sri Veeranki, senior software engineer and SAP security lead, Microsoft Digital\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft also wanted to implement a centralized SIEM solution that detects and helps prevent threats. The SIEM tools in use were effective, but the monitoring structure was inherently reactive because it didn\u2019t allow for real-time monitoring. When a potential threat or an active security incident was identified, an alert was generated. However, the time to assess and remediate threats was variable, and response lags were common. Further, the process for addressing some vulnerabilities involved patching, for example, so any exposure remained viable until patches were applied across the system. Finally, there wasn\u2019t an easy way to follow an SAP security alert through the system to determine the remedial actions taken within Microsoft and by whom.\n\nMicrosoft also recognized that the existing SAP SIEM solution didn\u2019t always meet its stringent compliance requirements and didn\u2019t permit sufficient visibility into the entire threat environment. And from an enterprise-wide perspective, Microsoft was essentially operating separate corporate and SAP security solutions, an outdated model that the company sought to replace. The new monitoring solution, when operational, would include a separate Sentinel instance for SAP but would also fully integrate with the Microsoft corporate Security Operations Center (SOC).\n\nWe\u2019re excited to be able to use the capabilities that Sentinel provides our customers out of the box along with SAP specific capabilities on an initiative as important as Microsoft SAP security. This represents a new approach in SIEM solutions. \u2014Yoav Daniely, principal group product manager, Microsoft Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management\n\n\u201cConsidering that any breach in Microsoft SAP applications could have catastrophic consequences for us, we knew that we needed a solution that enabled rapid vulnerability detection and monitoring capabilities to reduce risks to the organization,\u201d says Kusuma Sri Veeranki, a senior software engineer and SAP security lead for Microsoft Digital, the organization that powers, protects, and transforms the company. \u201cWe needed an internally managed and configured SIEM solution that could baseline user behaviors and detect anomalies across SAP to include the OS and network layer, the database layer, and the application and business logic layers.\u201d\n\nThe ideal solution, Veeranki says, would also permit visibility into all other systems, products, and applications that interconnect with SAP.\n\nSAP as Microsoft Sentinel \u2019customer zero\u2019\n\nTo develop its new SIEM solution for SAP, the organization decided to use Microsoft Sentinel, a relatively new product, in conjunction with Microsoft\u2019s existing security, orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform. Developed initially for Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinel is designed to collect data and monitor suspicious activities at cloud scale by using sophisticated analytics and threat intelligence. Recently cited in a Forrester Consulting study as an efficient, highly scalable, and flexible SIEM solution that incorporates Azure Log Analytics, Sentinel is also the first cloud-native product in the market.\n\nOur objective is to deliver a configurable solution that has the ability to monitor end-to-end processes and take the appropriate action as defined within the system, including those that should be stopped. Many of the current products on the market are SAP-centric but are limited in their integration capabilities. So, we\u2019re customer zero for leveraging Microsoft Sentinel for SAP security and for enabling that cross-correlation capability. \u2014Aaron Hillard, principal software engineering manager and SAP security lead, Microsoft Digital\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be able to use the capabilities that Sentinel provides our customers out of the box along with SAP specific capabilities on an initiative as important as Microsoft SAP security,\u201d says Yoav Daniely, principal group product manager on the Microsoft Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management (SCIM) team. \u201cThis represents a new approach in SIEM solutions.\u201d\n\nTo configure Microsoft Sentinel to monitor the entire Microsoft SAP environment\u2014it includes 15 SAP production systems including six Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) systems\u2014the engineering team and the Microsoft Azure product group recognized that the solution also needed to provide cross-correlation coverage. Cross correlation is the ability to surveil the entire organization to include junctures where SAP integrates with other systems and applications such as Microsoft Dynamics 365. For example, Sentinel could detect a hypothetical scenario in which a user who creates a new payee in Dynamics but also \u201cpays\u201d that customer in SAP without the activity being detected.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to deliver a configurable solution that has the ability to monitor end-to-end processes and take the appropriate action as defined within the system, including those that should be stopped,\u201d says Aaron Hillard, principal software engineering manager and SAP security lead in Microsoft Digital. \u201cMany of the current products on the market are SAP-centric but are limited in their integration capabilities. So, we\u2019re customer zero for leveraging Microsoft Sentinel for SAP security and for enabling that cross-correlation capability.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the goal is to equip Microsoft Sentinel to assess and respond dynamically to all security threats across all enterprise hosts, platforms, applications, and business processes, and then provide automated remediation as feasible and appropriate. The risk scenarios that Microsoft Sentinel addresses will continue to expand as the product evolves.\n\n\u201cSentinel gives us the ability to monitor the data and activities holistically, because Microsoft, like many other enterprises, uses numerous systems throughout the operations environment,\u201d Veeranki says. \u201cThat\u2019s a key differentiator of Sentinel compared to SIEM systems that are designed purely for SAP.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel incorporates advanced machine learning and AI capabilities that identify suspicious patterns and activities that previously defied detection. Additionally, it is able to readily integrate numerous platforms and products that enterprise companies use and enable organizations to customize configuration to meet their security-monitoring needs.\n\nManaging massive inputs efficiently with an innovative data connector\n\nTo date, the Microsoft SAP and Microsoft Sentinel SAP threat monitoring engineering teams identified an initial 27 initial high-risk scenarios that encompass a broad range of use cases. These use cases involve changes in system, client, or audit-log configuration, and suspicious or unauthorized user logins, data access, or role assignments. Monitoring also covers account-modification or password-change activities, and any audit-log manipulation or brute-force attack, among others. Other risk scenarios are being identified with respect to highly sensitive business and financial threats, and the teams are developing and completing proofs of concept for those scenarios. The SAP and Sentinel teams will continue to expand the threat-detection capabilities of Microsoft Sentinel and the risk scenarios that it addresses the product evolves.\n\nThe Microsoft SAP footprint is massive and change management within the platforms is highly complex. Therefore, to prevent system overload because of memory requirements, the engineering team must deploy a robust yet nimble mechanism to accommodate the vast amount of data coming into Microsoft Sentinel. To that end, the engineering team developed a Microsoft Sentinel-specific data connector that manages SAP inputs in a manner that\u2019s specific to the underlying applications. The connector facilitates a complete security solution to visualize, alert, and respond to threats, and it\u2019s easily configurable through built-in watchlists that match specific environment needs.\n\nThe data connector extracts data for monitoring, stores it, and then moves it through Sentinel in an incremental manner that the system can \u201cunderstand,\u201d says Anirudh Dahuja, an SAP platform engineer in Microsoft Digital. \u201cOtherwise, there\u2019s a risk of overloading the system, an issue that we\u2019ve encountered,\u201d he says.\n\nTo accomplish efficient use of the new tool, the engineering team used indexing to accommodate unwieldy tables and expedite querying. The team also incorporated secrets connectivity by using the Microsoft Azure Key Vault, which provides a secure store to create, store, and maintain keys that access and encrypt cloud resources, apps, and solutions. To manage the requisite memory optimization, the team leveraged Docker containers to accommodate the data connector functions before moving data into Microsoft Sentinel using custom Microsoft Azure APIs.\n\nThere\u2019s another challenge that Microsoft Sentinel engineers are experiencing and working to remedy: how to reduce the \u201cnoise\u201d in the monitoring system to differentiate between authorized, permissible activities and real threats that warrant action. Because Sentinel is designed to detect a very broad range of potentially suspicious or intentionally malicious activities, the number of alerts it raised initially produced many false positives.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re working on now\u2014improving alert fidelity and fine-tuning the system to produce fewer false positives,\u201d Veeranki says.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest advantage of using Sentinel for SAP monitoring\u2014the analytics. There are a lot of other tools in the market that alert you to SAP threats, but that\u2019s where they stop. Microsoft Sentinel offers a scalable cross-platform solution to detect and mitigate threats in near real time. We\u2019re not only detecting threats but also quickly responding to and remediating them. \u2014Anirudh Dahuja, SAP platform engineer, Microsoft Digital\n\nShe adds that Microsoft will continue to share the challenges and remedies that teams discover as the Microsoft Sentinel implementation proceeds. Customers then can accelerate their own implementations by using these learnings.\n\nTallying early Sentinel benefits and moving forward\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel allows for comprehensive cross correlation across enterprise resources, in addition to SAP, thereby helping identify known and previously difficult-to-detect security threats in near real time. That\u2019s a capability high on the wish list for many of Microsoft\u2019s existing enterprise customers. Interestingly, two other critical Sentinel benefits are emerging. Despite the initiative\u2019s early development stage\u2014it\u2019s been less than a year since its inception\u2014Microsoft Sentinel has proved highly scalable and customizable from the outset. It also promises to engender efficiencies generally for Microsoft security operations, by providing a single SIEM system and \u201cpane of glass\u201d through which to continuously view security logs, alerts, and incidents across the enterprise.\n\nFurther benefits, still in development, are the advanced analytics being integrated to help detect anomalies in activities involving SAP systems and the automated remediation that Microsoft Sentinel will eventually provide. That\u2019s a winning combination, in Dahuja\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest advantage of using Sentinel for SAP monitoring\u2014the analytics. There are a lot of other tools in the market that alert you to SAP threats, but that\u2019s where they stop.

            "content": "Introduction\n\nImplementing SAP S/4HANA, whether through SAP RISE or natively on AWS, is a major endeavor for organizations, involving long timelines and multiple layers of complexity. A key focus in these initiatives is the adoption of simplified business processes and cleaning the core, which requires substantial adjustments and thorough testing in controlled environments. Success in these projects depends on effectively navigating new SAP S/4HANA functionalities, understanding simplification processes, and supporting organizational change through robust training programs.\n\nWell before the implementation begins, customers and partners may want to deploy a working non-production SAP S/4HANA system on AWS to assess performance and functionality. This preliminary deployment allows them to conduct a fit-gap analysis and explore how AWS services can modernize business processes before migrating production workloads, ultimately supporting a strong business case. For such evaluations, SAP offers a Fully-Activated Appliance (FAA), a pre-packaged SAP S/4HANA system designed for non-production scenarios like sandbox, proof-of-concept, scoping, or fit-gap analysis. The appliance includes ready-to-use demo scenarios based on SAP Best Practices and a separate client for greenfield activation of SAP Best Practices across all available localizations.\n\nThe SAP S/4HANA FAA can be deployed through two main methods:\n\nSAP Cloud Appliance Library (SAP CAL)\n\nThis is the fastest and simplest method available. By using SAP CAL, you can deploy the appliance on AWS, in about 1-2 hours. SAP CAL offers a pre-configured system template that is ready for instant use. Please note that SAP licenses for the deployed SAP products are required to use SAP CAL. If you plan to keep an appliance for more than 30 days, there are two important considerations to keep in mind:\n\nLicense(s) for the SAP product(s) built into the appliance are needed\n\nSubscription of SAP Cloud Appliance library is required\n\nThe SAP Cloud Appliance Library system verifies the licensing and subscription status of the organization associated with the S-User who initiated the appliance creation. Activation of the appliance beyond the initial 30-day period is contingent upon successful validation of the required licenses and an active SAP Cloud Appliance Library subscription.\n\nPlease refer to SAP Cloud Appliance Library FAQ and FAQ for Licenses for more details.\n\nCustom Installation\n\nFor customers who have their own license from SAP and prefer more control over their infrastructure or need to align with specific AWS account structures, there\u2019s an option to manually install the appliance within their own AWS environment. This method offers greater flexibility but requires more technical expertise and time, typically taking a few days for setup.\n\nAlthough the installation process for the SAP S/4HANA FAA differs from a standard SAP installation and involves several technical steps which can be challenging for functional users in the evaluation phase, this blog introduces a more efficient alternative. Here, we\u2019ll outline an automated installation method using AWS Launch Wizard, which reduces deployment time and effort to under two hours.\n\nThe goal of this blog is to show how this streamlined approach can accelerate the early stages of SAP S/4HANA exploration and implementation, helping organizations advance their RISE with SAP or native SAP S/4HANA journey on AWS.\n\nKey Considerations\n\nThe custom installation option offers flexibility to tailor the setup to specific AWS account structures and administrative controls.\n\nIt grants full administrative rights and comprehensive control over the system configuration.\n\nThis approach is ideal for organizations with strict data governance policies or unique infrastructure needs.\n\nWhichever method is chosen, the SAP S/4HANA FAA delivers a complete SAP S/4HANA environment with pre-configured best practices, sample data, and demo scenarios for evaluation, testing, and proof-of-concept.\n\nLeveraging AWS Launch Wizard, we reduce the setup time for the SAP S/4HANA FAA from days to under 2 hours.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nArchitecture\n\nTo achieve this streamlined installation approach, we actively maintain a GitHub repository with the necessary deployment files. You can find the latest information about supported versions and further installation instructions here.\n\nInstallation Process\n\nTo install the SAP S/4HANA FAA, follow these steps:\n\nStart by downloading the SAP S/4HANA FAA installation media and Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM) from the SAP Software Download Center. Then, upload these files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The name of the Amazon S3 bucket must begin with \u201claunchwizard-\u201c.\n\nNext, download the post_deploy_s4h_faa.sh script from this location. Open this script and adjust it to set three essential parameters:\n\ns4h_faa_exports: Set this to the S3 URI path where you stored the SAP S/4HANA FAA .ZIP exports. s4h_swpm: Set this to the S3 URI path where you placed the SWPM .SAR file. s4h_version: Set this to choose the SAP S/4HANA FAA version to be installed (currently only 2023_FPS00 is supported)\n\nOnce these modifications are complete, upload the post_deploy_s4h_faa.sh script to the same S3 bucket containing the SAP installation media. Store the file in the post_deploy directory.\n\nNow, access the AWS console and select the region where you want to deploy the SAP S/4HANA system.\n\nGo to the AWS Launch Wizard service and start setting up an SAP infrastructure-only single instance deployment. Select EC2 instance size of at least R[5|6|7]i.8xl to ensure sufficient memory and storage to host the SAP S/4HANA FAA.\n\nFor more information, refer to the AWS Launch Wizard User Guide. The SAP S/4HANA FAA installation package supports deployment via both the Console and AWS CLI. If you prefer using the AWS CLI, you can download and customize a sample JSON specification file to suit your needs before deployment.\n\nDuring this process, specify the post_deploy_s4h_faa.sh script as the post-deployment configuration script.\n\nOnce the deployment process completes successfully, you will have access to the SAP S/4HANA FAA 2023 FPS00 on the designated host.\n\nThe deployment is expected to take around 60 to 90 minutes. You can monitor the progress by checking the deployment log at \u201c/root/install/post_deploy.log\u201d.

That means our products and services can help the vast majority of companies driving the global economy organize their supply chains, transportation, and financial data in a way that can enable an equitable, circular economy and net-zero emissions.\u201d\n\nUnder his leadership, SAP reduced its data centre emissions by 35% through innovative cooling technologies and renewable energy procurement. The company also achieved its 2025 carbon reduction targets two years ahead of schedule, cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 55% compared to 2015 levels.\n\nThe sustainability landscape has shifted dramatically during Daniel's tenure. The SEC's climate disclosure rules, the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and the International Sustainability Standards Board's new frameworks have created complex compliance requirements for companies. Daniel played a crucial role in developing SAP's sustainability reporting platform, which helps clients navigate these regulations.\n\n\u201cFor SAP, fulfilling our vision to \u2018make the world run better and improve people's lives\u2019 is not just an idealistic, altruistic or moral goal,\u201d says Matthias.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that through a sustainable strategy, we will be more successful as a company in the long term. Sustainable practices lead to increased efficiency and cost savings, as well as attraction and retention of top talent.\n\n\u201cMoreover, by addressing environmental and social impacts proactively, we reduce risks and create more resilient supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis ultimately drives innovation, opens new market opportunities and ensures the long-term viability and competitiveness of SAP.\u201d\n\nDaniel's approach to sustainability extended beyond environmental metrics. Under his leadership, SAP introduced social impact measurements into its procurement processes and established a supplier diversity programme that increased spending with minority-owned businesses by 45%.\n\n\u201cI am a firm believer that sustainability cannot be an add-on topic,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cFor long-term success, companies need to truly embed sustainability in their business strategy, processes and operations end-to-end.\u201d\n\nChallenges for sustainability in the tech sector\n\nThe technology sector's sustainability challenges remain significant \u2013 data centres now account for approximately 2% of global energy consumption, with projections suggesting this could rise to 8% by 2030. Despite progress in renewable energy adoption, the industry's absolute emissions continue to rise due to growing demand for cloud services and data processing.\n\nSAP addressed this paradox through its SAP cloud ERP portfolio, which helps clients optimise their cloud usage while minimising environmental impact.\n\nWhat is Daniel\u2019s legacy?\n\nIt is undeniable that the impact that Daniel has had on SAP\u2019s sustainability strategy will be felt for years.\n\nThe programmes and initiatives that he has started will continue to have an impact.\n\nDespite retiring from his role at SAP, he will remain in the sustainability field as Chairman of the Board at econsense, where he expects to continue collaborating with SAP.\n\nTo read the full article in the magazine, click HERE.\n\nExplore the latest edition of Sustainability Magazine and be part of the conversation at our global conference series, Sustainability LIVE.\n\nDiscover all our upcoming events and secure your tickets today.\n\nSustainability Magazine is a BizClik brand",

This server utilized different template models for 3D modelling of SAP. The one which is selected for this study was modelled by incorporating the 2PSG_A protein from PDB. This tool provided crucial information about the protein's structural attributes. The model's confidence was notably high i.e., 100%, which increased its reliability in terms of accuracy. This high degree of confidence guided the selection of the first predicted structure, which was then downloaded to undergo further evaluation. In addition to this, the coverage score of 85.6% suggested the high homology between the query and the template sequence. This high fraction of coverage indicated that most of the sequence had a structural reference as well. Moreover, the The E-value of 4.1E-55 also revealed an extremely low probability of the fact that the observed alignment has occurred by random chance signifying the reliability of the predicted model of SAP protein. The Z-score of 16.365 also supported the outcome scores of the previously discussed factors which suggested the high significance of the modelled protein. This initial model provided a strong framework for further investigation of the functional attributes of the protein and its potential as a target for drug discovery initiatives. The Fig. 2 illustrates the predicted structure of the protein under study which is comprised of an efficient blend of crucial structural components including alpha helices and beta sheets.\n\nFig. 2 The predicted 3D model of Secreted Aspartyl Proteinase (SAP) of C. lusitaniae Full size image\n\nProtein structural validation\n\nThe Ramachandran plot is an important tool in structural biology to assess the conformational angles of amino acids in protein structures. The most favored combinations of the phi (f) and psi (?) angles were indicated by the red regions on the plot in the Fig. 3. These were the conformations that were sterically allowed and typically correlated to the alpha-helix and beta-sheet secondary structures in SAP\u2019s predicted structure. The presence of multiple residues in these regions predicted that the protein structure was stable and its quality was also appreciable. Adjacent to the red regions, there were yellow areas in the plot, which represented additionally allowed regions. This area corresponded to turns or loops in the protein structure. The white areas represented combinations of f and ? angles that were generally not allowed due to steric hindrance. Specified residues were annotated on the plot, such as \u201cALA + 3 1(A)\u201d and \u201cPASP + 5 1(A)\u201d. While, the results of the given structure of SAP suggested that the majority of the amino acid residues lied in the most favorable regions i.e., 92.7%, whereas, in the additionally allowed region the residues percentage was 6.2% and in the disallowed regions, there were only 0.9% residues which were allocated in this particular zone. Therefore, on the basis of the conclusive results, especially, the number of residues in the most favored regions thus gave an indication of the most stable conformation of the predicted structure of SAP, suggesting its better quality.\n\nFig. 3 Ramachandran plot to assess the structural quality of the predicted 3D model of SAP. The scores of most favored region i.e., 92.7% indicated that the structure is stereochemically stable Full size image\n\nScreening and selection of a potential compound through molecular docking and pharmacokinetics analysis\n\nThe molecular docking analysis was used to identify potential compounds from the selected compounds that could effectively bind with SAP. Initially, the 3D structure of the protein was prepared and incorporated into the analysis to enable precise interactions with different phytochemicals. To evaluate the binding affinities of each ligand-protein complex, docking scores were computed. Lower scores indicated stronger binding affinities. The range of docking energy scores of all the docked complexes varied from -4.7561 kcal/mol. to -7.6327 kcal/mol. These varied docking scores, indicated different levels of interactions with the SAP. While, significant interactions were identified, including van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Deep penetration of certain ligands into the binding pocket resulted in multiple favorable interactions with important residues of amino acids. Comparative analysis of the interactions were made based upon their docking energies because the least energy scores proposed the better docking interactions and vice versa. This perspective highlighted another important fact that the docked complexes with the less docking energy values would be more stable than the rest ones. The Table 2 illustrates the binding energies (kcal/mol.) of each of the interacted compounds including the three approved anti-fungal drugs (Fosmanogepix, Opelconazole and Olorofim) which were included as control during the docking analysis. While, for better graphical representation of these results, R programming based scatter plot was also constructed which segregated the interacted ligands into two categories by creating a threshold value of -7.3 kcal/mol. This plot can be visualized in the Fig. 4. Since, this particular threshold value can ensure a significant level of interactions and binding affinities, therefore, only the docked complexes which exhibited the docking score equal to or lesser than -7.3 kcal/mol. were retained for the next phase of screening while, the rest of complexes were discarded. The compounds which were screened-out during this phase included opelconazole, daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide and naringin. Their respective docking scores can also be visualized in the Fig. 4.\n\nTable 2 The scores of docking/binding energies of all of the incorporated compounds with SAP Full size table\n\nFig. 4 Scatter plot to segregate and screen-out the ligands/compounds on the basis of docking energy scores. A threshold value of -7.3 kcal/mol. was set to segregate the best-docked compounds Full size image\n\nThe second screening phase which was in fact the final phase of selecting a potent compound was through the pharmacokinetics or ADME analysis. Thus, the selected compounds which included opelconazole, daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide and naringin were subjected to ADME investigation by employing the SwissADME server (http://www.swissadme.ch/). This crucial stage incorporated several parameters to evaluate these three compounds including the water solubility, pharmacokinetic properties, CYP450 inhibitor status and most importantly, the Lipinski rule. All of the results of four compounds under considerations suggested that only the daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide followed all of the required pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness attributes. Moreover, it was also noteworthy that daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide not only fulfilled the required drug-likeness properties but also, it exhibited significantly considerable docking score i.e., -7.6327 kcal/mol. which suggested that this compound could be a promising natural compound which could inhibit the pathogenic characteristic of secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP) of C. lusitaniae. It is important to mention here that daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide has not been employed as an anti-fungal drug yet signifying the novelty of work, however, its efficacy has been explored in various other therapeutic settings. Although, only computational techniques have been applied to study this particular domain of daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide which might be of a limited significance but still the findings of this study provides with the direction towards in-vivo and in-vitro validations. While, the results of ADME analysis oriented final scrutiny can be visualized in the Table 3.\n\nTable 3 The results of analysis major drug-likeness attributes of the screened-out compounds for final selection Full size table\n\nAfterwards, different docking representations of the finalized docked complex i.e., SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide were computed to infer the specified amino residues of SAP which were involved in this interaction. The Fig. 5 (a) demonstrates the three dimensional (3D) docking representation of SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide docked complex whereas, the Fig. 5 (b) represents the 2D docking interactions. It can be observed from both of the figures that GLY139, ASP357, THR358, ARG62, ASP278, ASP140, TYR138 and ILE181 were the specified amino acids which were involved in the docking interaction. The latter one also exhibits the respective distances between the interacting receptor atoms and the ligand.\n\nFig. 5 a Three dimensional (3D) docking representation of SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide complex. b Two dimensional (2D) illustration of SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide, showing various types of interactions occurred, along the respective distances between the ligand and the corresponding interacting receptor atoms Full size image\n\nLig-plot analysis of SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide complex\n\nLigplot was used to analyze the intermolecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the docked complex of SAP and daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide. Among the most potent kinds of non-covalent interactions were the hydrogen bonds. In the context of the lig-plot, hydrogen bonds are formed when a hydrogen atom, covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom like nitrogen or oxygen, is also attracted to another electronegative atom from the ligand or protein. In the Fig. 6, the black balls represented carbon atoms form the backbone of the ligand structure, while the red balls (oxygen) and blue balls (nitrogen) indicated functional groups that participate in hydrogen bonding and other interactions. The amino acids Asp101, Asp140, Thr281, Arg262, Thr358, Asp356, and Asp357 were involved in forming these bonds with the ligand (daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide), which suggested that they were the key residues for the ligand\u2019s binding. The SAP formed six hydrogen bonds (H bonds) with the daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide while, the O 2 atoms of the ligand was engaged in a H-bond with the side chain of Arg62, Thr338, Asp357 and Asp356 amino acid of SAP. The formation of these H-bonds was further characterized by the average distances between the corresponding heavy atoms and also, by the percentage of occurrence during simulations. Moreover, in addition to the hydrogen bonding interactions, the ligand was involved in the hydrophobic interactions too. Hydrophobic Interactions occurred between nonpolar molecules or parts of molecules, which tend to avoid contact with water (hydrophobic effect). In the lig-plot, the eyelash-like lines pointing towards the ligand from Thr 281, Asp140, Asp101, Val99, Ilel81, Ile78, Gly280, Ile360 and Gly139 indicated areas where hydrophobic interactions helped to stabilize the ligand within the binding pocket. These interactions were less about direct contact and more about creating an environment where water was excluded, thus favoring the ligand binding. The specific amino acids involved in interactions with the ligand suggested that the protein had a particular binding site that was complementary to the shape and chemical properties of daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide. This specificity was crucial for the biological function of the protein, as it ensures that it interacts with the correct ligand. The hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions depicted in the lig-plot contributed to the stability of the protein\u2013ligand complex. A stable complex is often necessary for the proper biological activity of the protein, such as enzyme catalysis or signal transduction. For researchers in drug design, understanding these interactions provides the insights into how modifications to the ligand could improve its binding affinity or selectivity for the given protein.\n\nFig. 6 LigPlot results to get deep insights regarding the interactions occurred during molecular docking between SAP and daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide Full size image\n\nElaborative pharmacokinetic analysis of the selected compound \u2018daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide\u2019 and its comparative analysis with approved anti-fungal drugs\n\nAfter the docking analysis, three of the phytochemicals were shortlisted and their corresponding ADME characteristics were assessed using SwissADME. Daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide showed the best pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties than the rest of the selected compounds. Given its potential, further exploration of the ADME properties was deemed crucial to unveil its medicinal or drug-like attributes. Some of the key features of this compound are illustrated in Fig. 7, especially with regard to bioavailability radar which showed that the given compound possessed the insaturation and polarity characteristics. This fact indicated that daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide would not only be more reactive but also, it will be more water soluble and would also be excreted out of the body. These properties initially signified that the compound under study had significant drug-like potential.\n\nFig. 7 Bioavailability radar of daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide, showing a degree of insaturation (INSATU) and polarity (POLAR) Full size image\n\nAfterwards, the physicochemical properties of daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide were revealed, exhibiting several distinct characteristics which included that the molecule was large, including 30 heavy atoms, 16 of which were aromatic, and had a molecular weight of 416.38 g/mol. suggesting that this compound was structurally complex. This fact was assured by the score of sp3-hubridized carbons which was 0.29, suggesting it to be a moderately complex molecular structure.\n\nMoreover, daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide possessed nine hydrogen bond acceptors, five hydrogen bond donors, and five rotatable bonds which indicated that significant flexibility and the possibility of intermolecular interactions were present in its molecular structure. Regarding the lipophilicity, an average affinity for lipid environments was indicated by the consensus log P value of 0.63. ESOL log S value of -2.97 and Silicos-IT log S value of -3.28 showed that this property was supported by more effective water solubility. It was predicted that daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide would have moderately less gastrointestinal (GI) absorption and would not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) as well.\n\nFurthermore, daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide was shown to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Analysis of excretion and metabolism provided more informative insights in which it was not predicted that daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide would inhibit any of the key cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), suggesting a decreased risk of drug-drug interactions, mediated by these enzymes. On the other hand, its calculated skin permeability coefficient (log Kp) was -8.36 cm/s, signifying its low skin permeability. In the end, some of the additional relevant features were also examined in this context. It was determined that daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide did not violated the Lipinski's rule-of-five, zero of Ghose's, one of Veber's, one of Egan's, and three of Muegge's. With a bioavailability score of 0.55, modest oral bioavailability was indicated. Notably, the molecule did not show either Brenk or PAINS signals while, its synthetic accessibility score was 5.01, suggesting a very moderate level of synthetic complexity. All of the above explained parameters along their respective results are demonstrated collectively in the Table 4.\n\nTable 4 An elaborative analysis of pharmacokinetics and other drug-likeness characteristics of Daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide including, physicochemical properties, lipophilicity and solubility status, analysis of pharmacokinetics, drug likeness and medicinal chemistry properties Full size table\n\nMoreover, to further authenticate and highlight the significance of the findings of this work, the comparative pharmacokinetics analysis of daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide and some of the market approved traditional anti-fungal drugs is also performed in this study. The Table 4 displays the elaborative drug properties of three approved antifungal drugs (fosmanogepix, opelconazole and olorofim) and daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide. It can be observed that none of the approved drugs completely follow all of the required crucial pharmacokinetics properties. The fosmanogepix exhibited poor water solubility and inhibition against two of the CYP450 isoforms. Similarly, the opelconazole was found to be insoluble in water and showed inhibition against three CYP450 isoforms. Most importantly, it violated the Lipinski rule, which is highly pivotal while estimating the drug perspective of a compound. Furthermore, the olorofim found to be moderately soluble in water and exhibited inhibition against four CYP450 isoforms. While, daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide almost completely followed not only the previously discussed parameters but also other crucial factors which indicates the importance and significance of the findings of this work and daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide, to be a probable anti-fungal phytocompound. The results of this comparative analysis are demonstrated in the Table 5.\n\nTable 5 The comparative analysis of drug properties of fosmanogepix, opelconazole, olorofim and daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide. The overall results affirmed that the compound under study in this work (daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide) followed all of the required parameters Full size table\n\nMolecular dynamics simulations\n\nRoot mean square deviation (RMSD)\n\nComparative RMSD analysis by including the top hits from the phytocompounds library and the reference/marketed approved drugs\n\nIn the RMSD analysis of the three complexes over a 200 ns simulation, each ligand daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide, hesperidin, and naringin displayed distinct interaction stability with the SAP protein. The daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide-SAP complex Fig. 8 (a) exhibited an initial phase of low fluctuations, suggesting a stable binding configuration early on. While minor increases in RMSD occurred mid-simulation, these fluctuations indicate slight conformational adjustments, likely as the ligand adapted within the SAP binding site. Importantly, daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide achieved a more equilibrated and stable interactions until the end of simulations, affirming its suitability as a well-fitted compound for SAP binding. In contrast, the hesperidin-SAP complex Fig. 8 (b) showed higher initial RMSD values, possibly reflecting a less stable initial binding mode. Hesperidin might not achieve the same binding stability as daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide, as seen by significant fluctuations in the mid-simulation phase which suggested larger conformational changes and only partial stabilization by the end of the simulations. Throughout the simulation, the naringin-SAP complex Fig. 8 (c) showed decreased, suggesting a stable binding profile than the hesperidin. The daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide-SAP complex, on the other hand, not only maintained stable interactions but also showed favorable adaptability within the SAP binding pocket, highlighting it as the best-screened compound among the three ligands due to its strong binding affinity and stability with SAP.\n\nFig. 8 The representation of root mean square deviation graphs (a): SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide complex; (b): SAP-hesperidin complex; (c): SAP-naringin complex Full size image\n\nAfterwards, another MD simulation analysis was performed to compare the daidzin 4'0-glucuronide with the approved anti-fungal drugs. These drugs included the fosmanogepix, olorofim and opelconazole. The comparative MD simulation results of all the four complexes displayed varied behavior throughout the 200 ns time frame. Initially, in context of SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide, the RMSD of SAP started at approximately 1.8 \u00c5 and showed a gradual increase, stabilizing around 3.6\u20134.0 \u00c5 after 75 ns. This suggested that the protein underwent initial conformational changes but achieved relative structural stability after this point in the simulation. The fluctuations observed between 100\u2013150 ns likely represented localized adjustments in the protein structure but did not indicate significant instability overall. On the other hand, the ligand daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide exhibited relatively stable RMSD values between 2.0 and 3.5 \u00c5 throughout the simulation, with fewer fluctuations compared to the protein as shown in the Fig. 9 (a). This indicated that the ligand maintained a stable binding conformation within the binding pocket of the SAP protein for the majority of the simulation time. Whereas, in case of SAP-fosmanogepix complex, the RMSD of the protein showed a gradual rise during the first 50 ns of the simulation, stabilizing at around 4.5 \u00c5. This indicated that the protein structure underwent some conformational changes initially but eventually reached equilibrium, with minimal fluctuations beyond the 100 ns mark. The consistent RMSD values after stabilization suggested that the SAP protein maintained its overall structural integrity throughout the simulation. However, the RMSD of the fosmanogepix ligand fluctuated significantly more, compared to the protein. Initially, the ligand RMSD aligned with the protein's fluctuations, suggesting strong interactions. But, after around 100 ns, a notable drop in ligand RMSD was observed, reaching values below 4 \u00c5 which can be observed in Fig. 9 (b). This drop indicated that the ligand either repositioned itself or found a more stable binding mode within the binding pocket of the SAP protein. The reduced RMSD values in the later stages suggested that the ligand was more firmly accommodated within the binding site, possibly achieving a stable binding conformation. On the contrary, SAP-olorifim presented a bit different kind of simulation results. At the start of the simulation, both the SAP protein and the ligand exhibited low RMSD values, indicating that their initial configurations were well-conserved. The protein RMSD increased rapidly within the first 20 ns, reaching around 2.5 \u00c5. This increase was indicative of the protein adapting to the solvent environment and undergoing initial conformational changes. After this adjustment phase, the RMSD stabilizes around 2.5\u20133.0 \u00c5 with slight fluctuations, which suggested that the protein structure remained stable with minimal deviations throughout the simulation. While, the ligand RMSD remained relatively low and stable, fluctuating between 1.0 \u00c5 and 2.5 \u00c5. This indicated that olorofim remained securely bound in the protein\u2019s active site, maintaining a stable conformation with no significant drift away from its binding pocket. Whereas, in case of SAP- opelconazole complex, the protein maintained a fairly stable RMSD throughout the 200 ns trajectory. Initially, the protein RMSD started near 1.5 \u00c5 and fluctuated between 2.4 \u00c5 and 4.8 \u00c5. The rise around 100\u2013175 ns suggested some conformational adjustments. However, the average deviation remained under control, indicating that the protein did not undergo any dramatic conformational changes and remained structurally stable during the simulation. While, the ligand RMSD started at around 1 \u00c5 and displayed a gradual rise, fluctuating between 2 \u00c5 and 7 \u00c5 after the first 50 ns. These fluctuations indicated that the ligand underwent some movement within the binding pocket. Despite this, it did not show signs of complete dissociation, as it stabilized after 150 ns, maintaining an RMSD below 6 \u00c5. The movements observed likely reflect adjustments to optimize binding interactions. These overall results are compiled in the Fig. 9 which suggested that the SAP- daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide complex exhibited superior stability and performance compared to the other three complexes analyzed. Its consistent protein and ligand RMSD values, along with minimal residue fluctuations in key binding regions, underscored its potential as a highly stable interaction. These results suggested that daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide could be a promising candidate for further drug discovery and development targeting SAP.\n\nFig. 9 Illustration of root mean square deviation graphs (a): SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide complex; (b): SAP-fosmanogepix complex; (c): SAP-olorofim complex; (d): SAP-opelconazole complex Full size image\n\nRoot mean square fluctuation (RMSF)\n\nComparative RMSF analysis by including the top hits from the phytocompounds library and the reference/marketed approved drugs\n\nIn the RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation) analysis of SAP with three different ligands, daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide, hesperidin, and naringin, the RMSF plots provided insight into the flexibility and stability of each complex. For daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide (Fig. 10a), the RMSF values demonstrated relatively stable fluctuations with minor peaks, indicating strong binding stability in the SAP active site and limited residue mobility throughout the protein. This implied a consistent interaction between daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide and SAP, suggesting enhanced stability in the complex. Hesperidin (Fig. 10b) showed a few larger fluctuations, particularly in some loop regions, which might suggest slightly less stable interactions compared to daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide. However, the overall RMSF values for hesperidin remained within a reasonable range, implying moderate stability. For naringin (Fig. 10c), there was notable fluctuation at specific residues, reflecting less stability in comparison to daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide and indicating weaker interactions at certain SAP binding sites. In conclusion, daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide demonstrated the most favorable RMSF profile among the three ligands, exhibiting minimal fluctuations and consistent stability in the SAP complex. This overall outcome suggested the daidzin 4\u2019-0-glucuronide to be the most appropriate compound based on the RMSF analysis, aligning with its selection as the most promising screened compound.\n\nFig. 10 The illustration of root mean square fluctuation graphs (a): SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide complex; (b): SAP-hesperidin complex; (c): SAP-naringin complex Full size image\n\nWhile, in the second round of simulations, the RMSF plot (Fig. 11 (a)) shows that the SAP protein has significant fluctuations at the N-terminus, with values reaching as high as 6.4 \u00c5 while simulating with daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide. This suggested that the N-terminal region of the protein was highly flexible throughout the simulation. After residue 50, the fluctuations reduced significantly, remaining below 2.0 \u00c5 for the majority of the residues, indicating a stable and less flexible structure in these regions. Notable peaks around residues 100 and 300 showed increased flexibility, which could correspond to loop regions or areas of the protein that underwent conformational changes. These regions might be important for ligand (daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide) binding or the overall dynamics of the protein. Overall, the majority of the SAP protein appeared to be relatively stable, with only specific regions exhibiting higher flexibility. This suggested that the protein maintained its structural integrity during the simulation, except for the identified flexible regions. Where, in case of SAP-fosmanogepix complex, the residues at the N-terminal and in the range of approximately 50 to 100 showed the highest fluctuations, with values reaching up to 8 \u00c5. These regions likely corresponded to loop regions or surface-exposed residues, which were inherently more flexible compared to the core of the protein. High flexibility in these regions might indicate potential sites for interaction with the ligand (fosmanogepix) or areas of conformational adaptability. The majority of the residues, especially those in the middle and C-terminal regions, exhibited relatively low RMSF values (around 1\u20132 \u00c5). These stable regions are indicative of a well-folded core, where the structure remained rigid during the simulation. These fluctuations can be observed in the Fig. 11 (b). Furthermore, the RMSF map represented a bit different fluctuating fashion in the perspective of SAP-olorofim complex in which certain residues showed prominent peaks, particularly those located around residue indices 100, 180, and 300 (Fig. 11 (c)). These regions exhibited high RMSF values (above 3 \u00c5), suggesting they were more flexible and might correspond to loop regions or surface-exposed areas of the protein. Such flexibility was typical in regions not directly involved in ligand binding or structural stability, allowing these segments to undergo larger conformational changes. However, between these peaks, several regions maintained relatively low RMSF values also, generally below 1.5 \u00c5. These stable regions likely represented the areas involved in secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helices or beta-strands, or regions involved in the binding interactions with the ligand (olorofim). The reduced fluctuation in these areas indicateed that these residues were structurally constrained. Whereas, the SAP-opelconazole complex illustrated different results in this scenario. The majority of the protein residues in this regard exhibited low fluctuations (< 2 \u00c5), indicating rigid and stable regions. Higher fluctuations were observed at the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, with a peak near the N-terminus exceeding 7 \u00c5 (Fig. 11 (d)), which could indicate unstructured or flexible regions.\n\nFig. 11 The representation of root mean square fluctuation graphs (a): SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide complex; (b): SAP-fosmanogepix complex; (c): SAP-olorofim complex; (d): SAP-opelconazole complex Full size image\n\nAfter ensuring the significant structural stability and flexibility of daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide among both of the contexts, the detailed SSE and protein ligand interactions analysis was performed. In these particular analyses, daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide were underwent detailed investigation along the reference compounds (fosmanogepix, olorofim, opelconazole).\n\nSecondary structure elements (SSE)\n\nThe graph in Fig. 12 shows a significant proportion of residues of the SAP protein while simulating with daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide adopting alpha-helical conformations, particularly around residue indices 50\u2013100 and 200\u2013350. The dominance of blue bars in these regions indicated a well-defined alpha-helical structure in these areas, with a high percentage of SSE. While, beta-strands were primarily located around residue indices 0\u201350, 150\u2013200, and 300\u2013350. These regions exhibited more orange bars, which indicated that these sections of the protein favored a beta-strand conformation. The alternation between blue and orange bars throughout the protein reflected a mixture of alpha-helices and beta-strands, indicative of a typical fold. The persistent height of the bars suggested that both the alpha-helices and beta-strands maintained their structure throughout the simulation, showing the structural stability of the protein's secondary elements. This fluctuated behavior of the SAP can be observed in the Fig. 12 (a). Whereas, in case of SAP- fosmanogepix complex, many regions showed persistent alpha-helical structures, particularly around residues 10\u201340, 150\u2013180, and 300\u2013350, where the blue bars remained consistently high, indicating stable helices. Moreover, the beta-strands were also prominently featured, particularly in regions such as 40\u201370 and 200\u2013250, where red bars dominated. These regions reflected the stability of beta-strands, showing minimal transition to other structures. Additionally, there were some mixed or flexible regions where the blue and red bars fluctuated, indicating transitions between secondary structures. For instance, around residues 50\u2013100 and 250\u2013280, the graph showed variation, suggesting these areas underwent conformational changes which can be observed in the Fig. 12 (b). Furthermore, the SSE graph in context of SAP- olorifim complex revealed alternating patterns of alpha-helices and beta-strands throughout the SAP protein structure, with certain regions showing persistent secondary structures. These regions likely contributed to the protein's overall stability during the simulation. Notably, there were well-defined regions of both alpha-helices and beta-strands between residues 0\u201350, 150\u2013200, and 300\u2013350. This dynamic behavior can be visualized in the Fig. 12 (c). These consistent structures indicated that these sections of the protein were particularly stable and played a critical role in maintaining the overall conformation of SAP. In contrast, there were also some of the gaps between the SSE regions, which could correspond to loop regions or flexible areas that underwent more significant conformational fluctuations during the simulation. Afterwards, such dynamic transitions between SSE were also observed in context of SAP-opelconazole complex in which it can be seen that large portions of the SAP protein maintained well-defined alpha-helical structures, with multiple regions showing a high percentage of helicity (near 100% SSE) (Fig. 12 (d)). These continuous regions of alpha-helices indicated significant structural stability in these sections of the protein, essential for maintaining the conformation of SAP. Moreover, there were also several well-preserved beta-strands within the SAP structure, with some regions maintaining a high percentage of beta-strand content. This suggested a stable beta-sheet structure in these areas, further supporting the rigidity of certain regions of the protein.\n\nFig. 12 Secondary structure elements (SSE) graphs (a): SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide complex; (b): SAP-fosmanogepix complex; (c): SAP-olorofim complex; (d): SAP-opelconazole complex Full size image\n\nProtein-ligand contacts\n\nThe graph (Fig. 13 (a)) illustrated the protein-ligand interactions between SAP and daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide over the course of a molecular dynamics simulation. Different types of interactions were depicted, majorly including the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Hydrogen bonds were highly prevalent in several residues, particularly around residues ASP77, SER105, ASP106, ASP135, and ALA179. These regions showed significant and consistent hydrogen bonding throughout the simulation, implying strong and stable interactions between SAP and daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide. While, residues such as TRP108, and ILE181, were notably involved in hydrophobic interactions, suggesting that these regions contributed to the overall binding stability by facilitating nonpolar interactions with the ligand (daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide). Furthermore, in case of SAP-fosmanogepix complex hydrogen bonds were seen frequently for residues like ASN45, ARG68, and LYS_76, with interaction fractions nearing 1.0 or higher. This implied consistent hydrogen bonding throughout the simulation, contributing significantly to the binding stability. Similarly, the hydrophobic interactions were significantly observed for residues such as PHE40, TYR83, and VAL99 where they remained consistent throughout the simulation. These contacts, although less frequent than hydrogen bonds, indicated the importance of non-polar residue regions in maintaining ligand proximity and enhancing the stability. Likewise, several residues showed prominent interactions, such as LEU75, LYS76, ASP77, GLY139 and ALA179, indicating they were involved in significant binding with olorofim. The highest bar (Fig. 13 (c)), corresponding to ALA 180, suggested this residue might play a critical role in ligand binding or stabilization. Other significant residues like ILE 84 and ASP 174 also exhibited frequent and stable interactions. While, the residues such as LYS76, GLY139, and ALA179 exhibit notable hydrogen bonding, crucial for maintaining the opelconazole\u2019s conformation in the active site. Hydrogen bonding was observed to be essential for specific interactions which stabilized the ligand in its bound conformation. Furthermore, the residues such as PHE54, LEU61 ARG62, TYR71, PHE285 and ILE360 demonstrated significant hydrophobic contacts (Fig. 13 (d)), particularly with PHE285 showing the highest fraction (~ 0.8). These hydrophobic interactions indicated that opelconazole bound well within the non-polar pockets of the SAP protein, contributing to the stability of the complex.\n\nFig. 13 The graphical illustration of different types of interactions occurred in docked complexes which majorly include hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (a): SAP-daidzin 4\u2019-O-glucuronide complex; (b): SAP-fosmanogepix complex; (c): SAP-olorofim complex; (d): SAP-opelconazole complex Full size image\n\nCumulative MMGBSA energy analysis\n\nIn this study, MM/GBSA binding energy calculations were performed using Desmond software, focusing on four ligands daidzin4\u2019-O-glucuronide, fosmanogepix, olorofim, and opelconazole, in complex with the SAP protein. For this cumulative analysis, the last 20 ns of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, from 180 to 200 ns, were selected to represent the binding stability and affinity of each ligand. Daidzin4\u2019-O-glucuronide (blue line) showed binding energies close to -65 kcal/mol, with some fluctuations, positioning it as a most stable complex. This result suggested that daidzin4\u2019-O-glucuronide formed a relatively stable complex with SAP. Furthermore, the opelconazole (red line) also demonstrated the favorable binding energy, consistently around -70 kcal/mol. This stability indicates a strong interaction between SAP and opelconazole. Afterwards, olorofim (green line) exhibited binding energies around -50 kcal/mol, indicating moderate stability in its interaction with SAP. The increased fluctuations compared to the previously discussed two ligands may reflect conformational adjustments or weaker interactions. Moreover, the fosmanogepix (orange line) displayed the least favorable binding energies, averaging around -40 kcal/mol. The larger fluctuations indicated a weaker affinity and stability in the SAP-fosmanogepix complex, suggesting that fosmanogepix may be less effective in binding SAP. All of these dynamic fluctuations in the energy levels can be observed in the Fig. 14.",

Without intervention, the flow of plastic into the environment is set to double by 2040.\n\nAmbitious global rules have the power to harmonise regulations and foster transparency. A global treaty can drive the systemic change we need by defining polymers, products and chemicals of concern, mandating disclosure and reporting and setting global standards for design and policy tools such as Extended Producer Responsibility.\n\nFor businesses in particular, a global plastics treaty offers a unified framework to reduce risks, allocate capital effectively and build sustainable supply chains. Technology and software solutions play a critical role in helping businesses operationalise a treaty.\n\nThere is a lot at stake here if we don\u2019t get this right. Without a treaty, we can anticipate a significant increase of plastic pollution and associated human health risks.\n\nHaley Lowry: Progress is happening, but today less than 10% of plastic is recycled globally and 32% of plastic packaging escapes collection systems \u2014 suggesting that existing funding and policy frameworks for the waste management ecosystem are insufficient. We need coordinated global action to change that.\n\nDow fully supports an agreement that will eliminate plastic pollution by creating a socially inclusive, circular economy for plastics that recognises the vital role these materials play in ensuring a low-carbon future.\n\nWith demand for plastic on the rise globally and inadequate waste management systems in many countries, driving more sustainable production and addressing the growing problem of plastic waste are clear priorities.\n\nTruly sustainable production includes leveraging alternative and waste plastic feedstocks, creating products for both sustainability and performance, and embracing lower-emissions production.\n\nAnke Boykin: The challenges of plastic pollution extend beyond any one nation or industry.\n\nSystem-wide global change across infrastructure, policy and business is required to enable a more circular economy for plastic packaging and drive more sustainable packaging innovation.\n\nThis is why PepsiCo has been supportive of an ambitious and effective global agreement to end plastic pollution \u2014 to help level the playing field and drive the systemic change needed to tackle this challenge.\n\nHow will the UN Plastics Treaty create a better environment for business, alongside helping the world's plastic crisis?\n\nAnke Boykin: We believe a UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution has the potential to spur significant progress towards a circular economy for plastic packaging. A treaty that establishes clear global rules, aligned definitions and metrics and agreement on measures to improve packaging design, collection and recycling is good for both governments and business.\n\nAs a business operating globally, harmonised policy across nations will create a level playing field and provide greater regulatory clarity and certainty so we can invest in and scale solutions we know can be applied in different parts of the world.\n\nWe believe the treaty will be most successful if it prioritises collaboration across sectors and the business community is given the opportunity to share our expertise, particularly around improved waste management systems such as well-designed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) based on industry aligned principles.\n\nStephen Jamieson: A UN Plastics Treaty will create a better environment for business by lowering barriers to trade, reducing operational costs, simplifying reporting and boosting economies of scale. In many cases, businesses have already put supporting practices into play to comply with regulations at state, regional and federal levels \u2014 and these differing regulations can be complicated and expensive to manage. Having a consistent global policy unifies the playing field and drives the type of efficiencies outlined above.\n\nFurther, developing metrics, standards and targets within the treaty creates a clear, shared mission for governments and businesses. The availability of data to feed into these targets will be critical, coming from corporate data models that aggregate information on materiality and data providers that determine plastic leakage on a granular scale.\n\nThis two pronged-approach of setting reporting standards and then feeding in appropriate data using open-data models would foster market confidence in circular systems, allowing businesses to scale sustainable practices and foster innovation in product design and circular systems.\n\nHaley Lowry: US$32bn is already invested by the private sector every year to help develop a circular economy. A supportive, clear and consistent global policy framework would stimulate additional funding. To make a real difference, any agreement must create and nurture an environment that promotes innovation and investments at scale, including circularity drivers like sustainable design standards, recycled content mandates, national recycling targets and EPR in national action plans.\n\nSmart policies can trigger an increased volume of plastic waste returning to the production process and de-risk investments in circularity by creating a stable market for those materials. Likewise, a global agreement can increase the available supply of recycled raw materials by encouraging nations to adopt recycling targets.\n\nReturning plastic waste to the circular economy as feedstock is critical to advancing all forms of sustainable production. To achieve our shared ambitions, we must come together to create a circular economy that changes the way the world makes, uses, recycles and re-uses plastics.",

NatureLife Cambodia\n\nFloating fish farms on the Tonle Sap Lake are creating new income opportunities, conserving biodiversity and preserving the area's fragile ecosystem. Ten new floating fish farms are being established, and will support ten fishing families, with the goal of reducing their heavy reliance on natural fish stocks and promote sustainable practices.\n\nThe new farms will complement 13 existing facilities, which were established by NatureLife Cambodia, funded by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), in June 2024. Located in the Toul Neang Sav Plov Loung Protected Area in Kampong Thom province\u2019s Kampong Svay district, their establishment saw community members provided with fish stock, feed and extensive aquaculture training.\n\nSan Sineang, a project manager at NatureLife Cambodia, highlighted how the project integrates conservation principles with community participation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve implemented a nine-point framework to reduce fishing pressures and illegal activities that threaten biodiversity in the region. Additionally, we encourage biodiversity monitoring and promote sustainable practices,\u201d he said.\n\nThe farms not only supply fish to local markets but also help curb overfishing, which poses a significant threat to the lake's biodiversity and ecological balance. Community members contribute 30 per cent of the total costs as part of a co-financing strategy to ensure their active involvement and commitment, according to NatureLife Cambodia.\n\nA women\u2019s enterprise involving 13 households has launched a fish-processing initiative under the brand \u201cTonle Fish\u201d, a biodiversity-friendly smoked fish producer which supplies local and Phnom Penh markets. This initiative is managed by the Toul Neang Sav Plov Loung community, and has received recognition from the Ministry of Environment for its efforts in biodiversity conservation and community engagement.\n\nThe enterprise reinvests 5 per cent of its profits into local conservation efforts, while over 70 per cent of its members and leaders are women, demonstrating the programme\u2019s role in empowering women and fostering leadership.\n\nTonle Fish promotes local fish processing, sustainable practices and clean water use in the Tonle Sap region. These initiatives are critical in communities where 83 per cent of residents live below the poverty line, and 90 per cent depend entirely on fishing for survival.\n\nThe project prioritises sustainable livelihoods, selecting aquaculture and dried fish production as key strategies. With these floating farms, two key fish species were selected: catfish and silver barb, which are ideal for smoked fish production and are easy to raise.\n\nSineang said supported by CEPF, the project is set to run until May, with plans to expand the number of floating farms to include 10 more families, with funding from Oxfam.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has also encouraged studies on sustainable aquaculture practices to reduce reliance on wild fish stocks and curb illegal fishing activities in the Tonle Sap Lake.\n\nThese collaborative efforts underscore the importance of integrating conservation with sustainable development to preserve the Tonle Sap's unique biodiversity and support the livelihoods of its communities.",

            "content": "[Editor\u2019s note: This content was written to highlight a particular event or moment in time. Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nMicrosoft is heavily invested in SAP applications\u2014it uses them extensively to run finance, human resources, global trade, supply chain, and other parts of its $168.1 billion global business. That\u2019s why it was a big deal when Microsoft moved its SAP workload to the cloud and Microsoft Azure.\n\nMoving to the cloud saved us money, but this was really about becoming more agile and innovative. \u2014Krassimir Karamfilov, general manager, Microsoft SAP program, Microsoft Digital\n\nIn early 2018, the company finished moving its entire SAP landscape\u2014an estimated 50 terabytes\u2014to Microsoft Azure. It was at that time, when the last, most important systems were moved over one busy weekend, that the company was able to seize on a new opportunity.\n\n\u201cMoving to the cloud saved us money, but this was really about becoming more agile and innovative,\u201d says Krassimir Karamfilov, general manager of the Microsoft SAP program in Microsoft Digital. \u201cThis allowed our teams to stop worrying about keeping our infrastructure up and running and to focus on innovating without a lot of heartburn. They can now run experiments, learn, and then use those learnings to take us in new directions\u2014and if an experiment doesn\u2019t work? They can easily shut it down and move on to something else.\u201d\n\nMoving from on-premises to Microsoft Azure slashed the Microsoft SAP budget by 20 percent to 25 percent, cost savings that came from fine-tuning usage, snoozing systems at night and on weekends, and by leaving behind old processes that weren\u2019t needed anymore.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 100 percent in the cloud, and since Azure is the trusted cloud provider, our entire SAP landscape is now more secure than ever,\u201d says Karamfilov, explaining that the employees who manage the company\u2019s SAP in many instances were given new tools to work with. \u201cThe shift to the cloud enabled us to start using machine learning and artificial intelligence to look at the data underneath our entire landscape, and to start learning from that.\u201d\n\n\n\nReutter answers questions about the company\u2019s SAP on Microsoft Azure migration and lessons learned along the way.\n\nAt the time, the move to the cloud represented how committed Microsoft was and still is to its partnership with SAP, Karamfilov says. Officially and publicly, SAP has adopted a \u201cmulti-cloud strategy\u201d where it supports all hyperscale cloud providers to enable customers to use their preferred cloud. Also at the time, SAP announced it had selected Microsoft Azure to run many of its internal mission-critical SAP business systems (since then SAP has moved a lot of those internal systems to the cloud on Microsoft Azure).\n\n[Learn how Microsoft uses telemetry and monitoring on its SAP on Microsoft Azure workload. Here\u2019s how Microsoft is examining SAP transactions with Microsoft Azure Anomaly Detector. Find out how Microsoft is optimizing SAP for Microsoft Azure.]\n\nMaking the move to Azure\n\nLooking back at how Microsoft moved its SAP workload to the cloud, the Microsoft SAP team had been thinking about making the move since 2013, but it was only in 2017 that Azure added virtual machine SKUs big enough to handle a Microsoft-sized SAP ERP system, says Hans Reutter, the Microsoft Digital engineering manager who led the cloud migration.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the size, it was the complexity,\u201d Reutter says, giving the example of several independent enterprise-scale purchasing processes needing to come together seamlessly at the point of purchase so the customer has a good buying experience. \u201cAll of these production landscapes were highly dependent on each other because of the traffic that flows back and forth between them.\u201d\n\nWe started with the low-risk stuff\u2014the low-hanging fruit. First we moved the sandbox systems because we knew that there wouldn\u2019t be any impact on our customers if something went wrong. \u2014Hans Reutter, group engineering manager, Microsoft Digital\n\nMicrosoft Azure developed the M-Series specifically to address the enterprise market demand for larger virtual machines capable of running SAP landscapes at companies just like Microsoft.\n\n\u201cWe just happened to be one of the enterprises waiting for the M-Series,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cIt was exactly what we needed to make our move to the cloud.\u201d\n\nWith Azure\u2019s M64 and M128 SKUs in hand, Reutter\u2019s team migrated the company\u2019s largest and most complex SAP systems to Azure over one weekend (the team used smaller virtual machines to move most of the Microsoft landscape over the prior year).\n\nTo understand how they did it, Reutter says think horizontally and vertically.\n\n\u201cWe started with the low-risk stuff\u2014the low-hanging fruit,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cFirst, we moved the sandbox systems because we knew that there wouldn\u2019t be any impact on our customers if something went wrong.\u201d\n\nThat was the base layer. Next came the next least important layer, and the next, and the next. The team worked up layer by layer until it eventually got to the most important production systems. That was the horizontal approach. \u201cIf we missed anything, we found out really quickly\u2014before we got to the really important systems,\u201d Reutter says.\n\nThe team wrote migration scripts, found landmines, and worked out kinks while working in the base layers, which allowed it to get everything down pat by the time things got serious.\n\nNow to the vertical.\n\nThe team also used an end-to-end vertical strategy, migrating a few systems\u2014from development all the way to production\u2014all at once. \u201cWe tested the whole stack to make sure there were no gaps or surprises,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cThis vertical strategy allowed the team to accelerate learning and getting a jump on production processes.\u201d\n\nBy getting it right in both dimensions, they were able to migrate the mission critical systems seamlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to move some small stuff,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cYou want to make sure the crown jewels land in a safe spot.\u201d\n\nAnd while the migration wasn\u2019t without bumps, it went smoothly and the crown jewels were kept safe.\n\nGetting it right at home\n\nJuergen Thomas hears it all the time. If a customer is considering moving his or her SAP systems to Microsoft Azure, they always ask the same question.\n\nThe ask?\n\n\u201cDoes Microsoft run its landscape in Azure?\u201d\n\nThomas, a partner architect who manages a team in Microsoft Azure that helps SAP customers move to the cloud, was happy when he could start answering with a resounding \u201cyes,\u201d and even more importantly, that he also then had a good answer to their inevitable second question, which is \u201chow did you do it?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s proof that the Microsoft Azure platform can carry and sustain such a complex SAP platform on our Azure infrastructure. We talk about it in customer briefings and conferences\u2014it is our poster child. Running our own backend business processes with SAP in Azure is a main differentiator between us and our competitors who don\u2019t run SAP at all, or not in their own clouds. \u2014Juergen Thomas, partner architect, Microsoft Azure\n\n\u201cThen they immediately want to get into the details, which is a good thing,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cIt was very important to be able to say that Microsoft is leading again and is ahead of the mass of companies.\u201d\n\nThomas says the story of moving the Microsoft ERP systems to the cloud has become a key showcase for the Microsoft Azure team because it shows Microsoft Azure can handle the biggest and most complicated SAP instances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s proof that the Microsoft Azure platform can carry and sustain such a complex SAP platform on our Azure infrastructure,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talk about it in customer briefings and conferences\u2014it is our poster child.

            "content": "African organisations are accelerating their investment into cloud computing and data solutions to enhance their capabilities, speed up processes, and establish a foundation for future innovation.\n\nNazia Pillay, Head of Partner Ecosystem for MEA South at SAP, says the growth is fuelled by a growing need among African organisations to improve decision-making and bring greater transparency and efficiency to core business processes. \u201cThe future belongs to data-driven organisations that can maximise the value of their business data by leveraging insights that reveal new efficiencies and revenue opportunities. Organisations throughout the African continent are expanding their use of cloud and data solutions, paving the way for the accelerated adoption of AI and other future-ready technologies.\u201d\n\nInvestment into cloud technologies is forecast to increase sharply over the next few years, with demand for cloud services growing by 25-30% according to some estimates.\n\nIn South Africa, a recent report predicted that the country\u2019s cloud market could surge to more than $6-billion by 2028, tripling in value from $2-billion in 2023.\n\nOptimising ROI \u2018an ongoing challenge\u2019\n\nHowever, says, Ignatius Richards, Business Manager: Financial Planning & Analysis at Decision Inc, many organisations still grapple with understanding the true cost of ownership \u2013 and return on investment \u2013 of their cloud implementations.\n\n\u201cScalability and flexibility are among the top benefits companies seek to unlock when they shift their business processes into cloud environments. But this is dependent on reliable infrastructure. Many companies face significant challenges with forecasting the return on investment of their cloud strategies due to fluctuations in infrastructure quality and network capacity, as well as challenges with unlocking the true value of their business data. \u201d\n\nTo develop a clear picture of ROI and ensure the business enjoys optimal benefits from cloud and data investments, Pillay recommends that companies prioritise a unified data ecosystem, close collaboration with trusted partners, and the adoption of the latest technologies. \u201cCompanies need new strategies to succeed in a world rapidly reshaped by technologies such as cloud and AI. By laying the groundwork now and adopting new processes and best practices, African organisations can establish a powerful foundation for future innovation and growth.\u201d\n\nStrategy 1 \u2013 Build a unified data ecosystem\n\nRichards notes that organisations are generating data at an unprecedented rate, but often from fragmented sources instead of a unified data repository. This is driving the need for technology-led capabilities that turn that data into insights and competitive advantage.\n\n\u201cWith data originating from numerous disparate sources, it is crucial to establish an open ecosystem that allows seamless consolidation into a single data repository, ensuring a unified version of the truth. Within this framework, data must be enriched and transformed into actionable insights that are accessible at all levels of the organisation to enable improved decision-making.\u201d\n\nPillay notes that organisations are increasingly leveraging technology platforms that bring data and analytics, AI, automation and integration together in a single unified environment. \u201cOrganisations leverage SAP Business Technology Platform to innovate faster within the context of their own business, connecting people with data insights to improve decision-making at all levels. But it is all underpinned and dependent on a unified data ecosystem that can deliver insights based on a single source of truth.\u201d\n\nRichards adds: \u201cUtilising a modern data platform like SAP Business Technology Platform to its fullest potential can unlock innovative methods for data processing, automate business processes, and accelerate the use of generative AI to enhance customer experiences.\u201d\n\nStrategy 2 \u2013 Leverage vendor, partner expertise\n\nDigital transformation is in a phase of accelerated growth in Africa, with the market expected to grow from $22.67-billion in 2024 to over $45-billion by 2029 as more organisations seek to streamline their operations and enhance their customer value propositions.\n\n\u201cGiven the multitude of options available in the market, selecting the appropriate data and information landscape technology can be a daunting task,\u201d says Richards. \u201cMany of the concerns around cloud adoption \u2013 including cost implications \u2013 require a certain level of expertise from technology vendors to ensure companies can overcome challenges in their cloud adoption.\u201d\n\nPillay advises that organisations work closely with technology providers and implementation partners to develop a full understanding of cost implications. \u201cBy adopting an approach of ongoing improvement and refinement through continuous value engineering, companies are better positioned to adapt their technology and business strategies to derive optimal value from cloud and data investments.\u201d\n\nShe adds that close collaboration with technology partners can deliver continuous value improvements over extended periods of time. \u201cCompanies benefit from vendor and partner input through the adoption of best practices, sharing of latest insights regarding the impact of new technologies, and access to new releases of core systems and applications. This ensures companies operate on the most powerful and advanced versions of cloud and data solutions, driving improved business outcomes.\u201d\n\nStrategy 3 \u2013 Deploy advanced technologies\n\nIn the era of hyperconnectivity, companies need to look beyond basic adoption of cloud and data solutions to the strategic deployment of advanced technologies.\n\nPillay notes that artificial intelligence is an obvious candidate when companies seek to deploy advanced technologies to derive business value from cloud and data investments. \u201cAI, real-time analytics and automation unlock the full potential of cloud infrastructure, enabling businesses to enhance decision-making, streamline operations, and drive measurable value from their data assets.\u201d\n\nRichards adds: \u201cThe SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) enables organisations to automate business processes, enhance user experiences, and generate new revenue streams through data utilisation, all while maintaining a clean and optimised core system. This platform integrates various technologies, including workflow management, robotic process automation, and advanced analytics, to drive efficiency, innovation, and agility in business operations.\u201d\n\nPillay also notes the impact of initiatives that accelerate the deployment of cloud-based ERP solutions as a viable option for companies seeking to accelerate the value of their cloud and data solutions. \u201cSolutions like SAP S/4HANA Cloud help companies future-proof their business models by running core business processes in an agile operating model. This enables continuous innovation, driving substantial ROI over the short and long term.\u201d",

The group said the SAP project it has been grappling with for the past few years has cost the org about $107 million (ZAR 2 billion) in lost sales in the financial year to 30 September 2024.\n\nThe Spar Group Ltd's Integrated annual report 2024 [PDF] said executive management is successfully addressing the SAP system issues.\n\nAmong other comments on the system, it noted: \"The SAP dashboard lacked the clarity of the previous system, affecting pricing and margin visibility. Manual processes required for this had a negative impact on margins.\"\n\n\"The implementation, which began in February 2023, faced critical challenges such as poor pricing visibility and inefficiencies with the new warehouse management system, which had resulted in an estimated R2 billion in lost sales in the 2023 financial year.\n\n\"We are satisfied with the improvements the dedicated working group has made, particularly in pricing visibility and the transition to a new warehouse management system. The future focus is on enhanced data management practices and using data more effectively, even before the full system rollout. We are confident these measures will drive better performance moving forward,\" it said.\n\nInvestors might welcome the reassurances, yet the sales decline logged for the retailer's 2024 fiscal already exceed the reported implementation costs, estimated at $95 million (ZAR 1.8 billion) by newswire Bloomberg from September 2023.\n\nAt the time, Spar's chief information technology executive Mark Huxtable stood down for personal reasons and South African national information technology executive Brett McDougall stood in to help.\n\nThe project's problems centred around the distribution systems in KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern region of South Africa containing the city of Durban. However, the company\u2019s Annual financial statements 2024 [PDF] maintains it is getting on top of the situation.\n\n\"Significant progress has been made in resolving SAP integration issues, including improving visibility of pricing and subsidies for buyers, as well as addressing warehouse management inefficiencies that increased labour and transport costs through the selection of a new warehouse management system.\n\n\"Whilst interventions to resolve the SAP impacts in the KZN region are well underway, it will take some time for the full effects to be felt and for the overhang on gross margins to be eliminated,\" the report said.\n\nWe have asked Spar Group for comment. \u00ae",

Instead of vendor-imposed upgrades that may not suit customers\u2019 current or even near-future needs, Rimini Street allows enterprises to:\n\nRemain on the stable, operational SAP version they have\n\nHave full support available for up to 15 additional years\n\nReduce SAP annual maintenance fees by up to 50% and save up to 90% in total support costs\n\nFree up budget to fund strategic initiatives like AI, IoT and other emerging technologies\n\nWith third-party support, IT teams can focus on building a solid business case for their next-generation ERP instead of being pressured into a rushed SAP migration. Enterprises are also well-positioned to avoid the grueling and costly upgrade process, the scramble for elusive talent to migrate to S/4HANA and the potential for business disruptions that threaten core services.\n\n\u201cERP migrations are prone to risk and failure \u2014 they take too long, are too expensive and can cause disruptions,\u201d Hays says. \u201cThey\u2019re projects that can make headlines if they go wrong.\u201d\n\nHow Rimini Street helps you innovate on your timetable\n\nWith Rimini Street third-party support as the bridge, SAP customers can also get a leg up on accelerating innovation. Budget allowances not spent on new SAP support and subscriptions can instead be channeled to modernize the rest of the IT tech stack with emerging technologies such as data analytics and artificial intelligence, including generative AI.\n\nWorking with a trusted partner like Rimini Street, enterprises can keep dollars flowing in the right direction, self-funding innovation unencumbered by SAP\u2019s onerous upgrade schedule and fee structure. Korean tire manufacturer, Nexen, is one such business applying this strategy for innovation. Jae-Hoon Jung, information strategy team leader, stated, \u201cOur vision is to stabilize our current SAP platform while we establish strategies and roadmap for utilizing core technologies in AI, big data and cloud. We have an aggressive business goal to meet ahead, and we want to make smart IT decisions on our own timeline, supported by the right partner.\u201d\n\nRimini Street also delivers professional services, Rimini Consult\u00d4, to help clients optimize and modernize around the ECC core without having to migrate to S/4HANA in the cloud or RISE with SAP. For example, core functions such as accounting, payroll and order management can be maintained in SAP ECC with the help of third-party support from Rimini Street. At the same time, the third-party software support leader can help clients design a composable ERP strategy that enables them to innovate around the edges using best-in-class products and technologies in areas like cloud, CRM, HCM, mobile, big data and AI/generative AI.\n\n\u201cWe view Rimini Street as a strategic business partner who is well-positioned and capable in their ability to support and guide us as we take on new challenges for our SAP and other systems,\u201d said Shinya Hidaka, group manager of information systems at santec Holdings Corporation, a photonics manufacturer. They leveraged Rimini Consult for professional services when a merger required a swift split of its SAP systems in addition to ongoing support for those systems.\n\n\u201cInnovation is something you need in order to stay competitive and profitable, and it\u2019s not something you should wait for,\u201d Hays says. \u201cYou need to take back the control and autonomy from SAP to innovate when and where it\u2019s most important to you.\u201d\n\nTaking the ROI-positive path\n\nRimini Street has provided SAP customers around the globe with proven support services that include direct access to expert-level engineers and that are built on best practices developed through years of hands-on experience. Unlike the vendor, Rimini Street maintains SAP customizations at no extra cost as part of its support plans, delivering experienced engineering and quality assurance teams that will build and test fixes before clients release them to production. In addition, tax, legal and regulatory updates are developed and delivered regardless of software version for more than 100 countries and territories around the world.\n\nWith a business-driven, ROI-positive approach, SAP licensees no longer have to march to the beat of SAP\u2019s drum. With full control over their own ERP and cloud migration strategy and roadmap, companies can accelerate their innovation strategy at their own pace and in their chosen direction \u2014 with or without SAP.\n\nTo learn more about how Rimini Street can provide you with new SAP options, visit here .",

SAP is an acronym for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. The company provides cloud-based business software through its flagship enterprise resource planning (ERP) product.\n\nThis package integrates a comprehensive and synergistic range of business software, including accounting, human capital management (HCM), customer relationship management (CRM), project management, and procurement functions onto a single unified platform. The company custom tailors its software to meet the needs of each specific industry with AI and machine learning capabilities into their core applications.\n\nGet SAP alerts: Sign Up\n\nSAP is a leader in the computer and technology sector, competing against multinational enterprise software giants like International Business Machines Co. NYSE: IBM, Microsoft Co. NASDAQ: MSFT, Salesforce Inc. NYSE: CRM and Oracle Co. NYSE: ORCL. Some of their major corporate clients include The Clorox Company NYSE: CLX, eBay Inc. NASDAQ: EBAY, NVIDIA CO NASDAQ: NVDA and Mondelez International Inc. NASDAQ: MDLZ.\n\n30% of Deals in Q3 Involved AI Use Cases\n\nSAP Today SAP SAP $264.04 +8.86 (+3.47%) 52-Week Range $175.08 \u25bc $293.70 Dividend Yield 0.66% P/E Ratio 92.00 Price Target $248.83 Add to Watchlist\n\nThe updraft was certainly evident in its third quarter 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 6% YoY to $1.33, which beat analyst estimates by 2 cents on 9.4% YoY revenues growth to $9.17 billion, which also beat consensus estimates of $9.15 billion. The current cloud backlog rose 25% YoY to $15.38 billion. Cloud ERP Suite revenue rose 34% YoY to $3.67 billion. Cloud revenue rose 25% YoY to $4.35 billion.\n\nThe company has had ongoing cloud transformation transitioning clients for the past four years, and it's hitting its stride driven by AI. Buoyed by Gen AI Hub, nearly 30% of its cloud order entries in the quarter were deals that had AI use cases. SAP hit its goal of 100 AI use cases across its suite. AI consumption by SAP customers more than quadrupled in the quarter. SAP completed its $1.5 billion acquisition of digital adoption platform WalkMe.\n\nSustained Momentum Moving Ahead\n\nSAP expects the momentum to remain steady moving forward. They bumped up their cloud and software revenue forecast by $433 million at the midpoint to $31.93 billion to $32.24 billion. Cloud revenue is expected to be between $18.41 billion to $18.73 billion, maintaining its previous forecast.\n\nWhile SAP doesn't anticipate margin risks in 2025, it is speculative how AI activity may impact gross margins beyond 2025. However, the company believes AI will be margin accretive. The company has been very consistent in 2024 as the AI trend has been unwavering, which points to a strong Q4 2024.\n\nSAP Forms an Ascending Triangle Pattern\n\nAn ascending triangle is comprised of a flat-top upper trendline resistance converging with an ascending (rising) lower trendline support. The breakout occurs when the stock surges through the upper trendline. If the stock collapses under the lower ascending trendline, then the pattern fails as a breakdown forms.\n\nSAP formed the upper flat-top trendline resistance at $242.10 converging with the lower ascending trendline support which commenced around the $219.55 swing low. SAP tested the upper trendline resistance nearly eight times without managing to break out, and the ascending trendline was tested twice. The daily anchored VWAP support is at $236.35. The daily RSI is rising at the 62-band. Fibonacci (Fib) pullback support levels are at $237.30, $231.10, $224.60, and $214.65.\n\nSAP's average consensus price target is $252.35, implying a 0.96% upside and its highest analyst price target sits at $300.00. It has eight analysts' Buy ratings and one Hold rating. The stock has a miniscule 0.11% short interest.\n\nActionable Options Strategies : Bullish investors can consider using cash-secured puts at the Fib pullback support levels to buy the dip. If assigned the shares, then writing covered call at upside Fib levels executes a wheel strategy for income on top of its 0.69% dividend yield.\n\nBefore you consider SAP, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against the other SaaS stocks.\n\nAs 2024 comes to a close, the software-as-a-service or SaaS industry has been shaken up quite a bit. Artificial intelligence has defined the stock market in 2024 and ensured that investors can end in the green despite several sectors such as healthcare, real estate, and industrial performing poorly.\n\nThe age of AI has also affected the SaaS industry. These firms rely on margin-friendly revenue and stable recurring revenue through offering software products to businesses. However, AI offers firms the ability to self-develop software, which means that for SaaS firms, their products might not be as in demand.\n\nTo understand the impact of AI on SaaS stocks, consider two key valuation multiples for this sector. These are the enterprise value to revenue and the Rule of 40. A firm's enterprise value measures its market value and net debt, while the Rule of 40 checks whether a SaaS company is growing its revenue and free cash flows sufficiently. Higher readings for both are preferable, with the Rule of 40 in particular demanding a score greater than 40.\n\nResearch from Volition Capital shows that SaaS multiples have undergone seismic shifts throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the subsequent high interest rate regime, and the current interest rate era. Ahead of the pandemic, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of SaaS firms, i.e. those with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 and a greater than 30% revenue growth rate had a median revenue multiple of 22.9x. The multiple peaked at 42.3x in September 2020 as the booming demand for digital services meant that investors valued the firms more richly compared to their revenue.\n\nThen, as the Federal Reserve started to hike interest rates, the tables turned. Interest rates are key for SaaS stock performance as low rates mean that enterprises have plenty of cash to dole out for their spending. Additionally, higher rates also mean that since investors have more lucrative investment alternatives available, they place a higher premium for future growth. The high interest rates meant that in December 2022, the SaaS revenue multiple for the top firms was 9.2x, or less than four times its 2020 peak. The tail-end of 2022 also marked the start of Wall Street's current AI euphoria. Back then, only the GPU designer whose chips are powering AI or the software company known for Windows had benefited from investor attention.",

            "content": "Spar Group encountered multiple obstacles during the SAP rollout, particularly at its KZN distribution centre.\n\nRetail chain Spar has made significant progress with SAP integration issues that cost the company R1.6 billion.\n\nThis emerged from Spar\u2019s integrated annual report, which reveals that the poor implementation of the SAP system at the KZN distribution centre affected the group\u2019s growth and operational efficiency in the short term.\n\nSpar Group encountered multiple obstacles during the rollout of the SAP software, particularly at its KZN distribution centre, which was the first to adopt the new system in February 2023.\n\nThe transition resulted in various go-live and integration issues, significantly impacting distribution operations in the region.\n\nThese challenges disrupted stock deliveries to retailers\u2019 stores, leading to reduced service levels and a decline in retailer loyalty.\n\nAccording to Spar, in or around October 2021, a member of the company\u2019s board received a whistleblower\u2019s letter containing allegations in relation to the SAP implementation project.\n\nIt revealed that three directors, who have since left the company, ignored the whistleblower\u2019s concerns about the botched rollout.\n\n\u201cSignificant progress has been made in resolving SAP integration issues, including improving visibility of pricing and subsidies for buyers, as well as addressing warehouse management inefficiencies that increased labour and transport costs through the selection of a new warehouse management system,\u201d says the retailer in the integrated report.\n\nIt notes that service levels achieved are currently in excess of 90% with KZN loyalty rates rising from 68.6% in the second quarter of 2024 to 70.9% in fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\u201cThe poor implementation of the SAP system at the KZN distribution centre affected the group\u2019s growth and operational efficiency in the short term. The group is focused on addressing identified gaps to ensure a successful rollout across the rest of the group,\u201d it adds.\n\nSpar points out that its audit committee oversaw the implementation of control improvement plans to address control weaknesses uncovered during the previous financial year, and to remediate the SAP system implementation issues.\n\nAdditionally, the committee will maintain strong oversight of the SAP system, including monitoring its implementation and addressing related performance and integration issues.\n\nIt explains that the group has embarked on a programme to design, build and deploy a SAP template for the South African business.\n\nThe development of the SAP template constitutes the development of an internally generated intangible asset, which will ultimately be split within the South African business between local divisional distribution centres (DCs).\n\nThe unit of account for the purpose of the capitalisation of development costs is a matter of judgement. Each instance of the implementation within the respective DC is considered to be a separate unit of account, says the retailer.\n\nThe quantification for costs allocation to each DC is driven by the licences linked to the SAP project on the date of the DC going live. The capital work in progress amounts are recognised and tested for impairment in South Africa using the discounted cash flows for the SPAR Group separate company.\n\n\u201cWhilst interventions to resolve the SAP impacts in the KZN region are well underway, it will take some time for the full effects to be felt and for the overhang on gross margins to be eliminated; gross profit margin for Spar South Africa, including Spar Tops and Build It, decreased from 8.7% to 8.5%,\u201d it says.",

After a couple of clutch saves by Ersson, Poehling's goal gave the Flyers some breathing room.\n\nPOSTGAME 5 (\"5 Things\" Revisited)\n\n1. Michkov vs. Celebrini: Mackin Celebrini narrowly missed scoring a goal twice in the first period. Michkov had a look from the right circle early in the second period. At 4:22, after a give-and-go with Frost, Michkov had an open scoring chance from the slot. In the third period, a very patient Michkov had a self-generated scoring opportunity. Celebrini had another near goal in the third period.\n\n2. The Couturier line: Head coach John Tortorella decided to break up the team captain's line with Owen Tippett and Travis Konecny. Couturier centered the fourth line. In 14:30 of ice time, Couturier was credited with one hit and won five of 12 faceoffs.\n\n3. Flyers special teams: The Flyers ended an 0-for-17 drought (including the disallowed first period goal) on the power play with Konecny's second period 5-on-4 goal. Overall, the Flyers officially went 1-for-3 on this night. On the penalty kill, the Flyers went 1-for-1.\n\n4. Winning the important faceoffs: The Flyers dodged a bullet in the first period after San Jose nearly scored off a faceoff in the Philly zone. In the second period, Frost's clean faceoff win on the power play started the sequence that ended in Konecny's goal.\n\n5. The F-Troop -- Farabee, Foerster, Frost: Frost came into the game with five points (3g, 2a) in his previous five games. The offside entry by Tippett that caused Frost's goal to be overturned happened well before the goal was scored but the ruling was accurate. In the second period, Frost set up good scoring chances for Michkov and Drysdale. Likewise, while neither Foerster nor Farabee got on the scoresheet in San Jose, they were in the thick of several good opportunities.",

These technologies promise to revolutionise workflows, enhance customer experiences, and drive innovation across sectors such as healthcare, finance, supply chains, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Companies are responding with increased budgets, prioritisation of custom AI applications, and a focus on workforce upskilling to prepare for this AI-driven transformation.\n\nIndustry leaders have underlined the potential of AI in reshaping their operations. Harrick Vin, chief technology officer at TCS, predicts that AI will shift the focus of workflows from task management to driving customer success, fundamentally transforming knowledge work. Similarly, Wipro is investing in industry-specific AI frameworks aimed at solving sector-specific challenges and maximizing returns on AI investments. Sindhu Gangadharan, managing director at SAP Labs, emphasised that generative AI will revolutionise how organisations interact with data, optimise operations, and create unique customer experiences.\n\nAgentic AI and SLMs are emerging as pivotal technologies for 2025. These innovations enable higher levels of autonomy and collaborative decision-making, allowing organisations to manage complex tasks more efficiently. SAP Labs India has already demonstrated the potential of agentic AI through tools like Joule, which streamlines predictive maintenance and supply chain optimisation.\n\nTCS\u2019 Vin highlighted the transformative role of agentic AI in healthcare and finance, promising greater personalisation and efficiency in service delivery. Infosys added that the cost-effectiveness of SLMs makes them ideal for scalable solutions in sectors such as education and agriculture. Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, underscored their commitment to democratising AI for SMEs, ensuring that even smaller businesses can leverage these tools to compete effectively with larger enterprises.\n\nCoforge\u2019s vice president for AI, Deepak Bagchi, elaborated on how agentic AI will drive automation, resource optimisation, and personalised engagement. He pointed to the integration of 23 open-source and licensed large language models (LLMs) within Coforge\u2019s ecosystem, as well as investments in fine-tuned and domain-specific SLMs, as key enablers of this transformation.\n\nEnterprises are making AI an integral part of their digital transformation strategies.

            "content": "While the vision of a paperless workplace has been around for years, the tools to make it a reality are finally within reach. Yet, surprisingly, many organizations are still stuck on a hamster wheel of manual processes, siloed information, and on-premise software.\n\nDrive productivity and efficiency with archiving and document access software Learn more\n\nHow can companies jump off that wheel and truly transform?\n\nAccording to recent IDC research* sponsored by SAP and OpenText, the answer lies in starting with a content management platform that is accessible, integrated, and, above all, comprehensive. The paper highlights that this approach ignites digitalization outcomes that \u201cenable efficiencies and higher quality as teams readily identify and obtain the information they need.\u201d\n\nAdditional reported benefits include fast document migrations, streamlined invoice and finance-related operations, and effective regulatory compliance.\n\nDigitalization Takes a New Turn\n\nResistance to digitalization is more than just an inconvenience; it\u2019s a significant barrier to achieving the resilience, efficiency, and sustainability needed to stay competitive in a dynamic market. However, it is easy to be intimidated by the massive effort required to scan, consolidate, manage, govern, secure, and integrate a vast volume of information, documents, and content to achieve true business digitalization.\n\nSAP enterprise content management (ECM) solutions by OpenText calm these fears, as demonstrated by IDC interviews with current SAP customers. IDC calculates that organizations save an average of US$54,600 per 1 million documents stored in the solutions, totaling $9.29 million on average. These savings directly impact different departments, streamlining workflows and freeing up resources for more strategic tasks.\n\nThe key to this transformation lies in integrating business processes with ECM solutions to drive continuous, efficient, and error-free processes. This integration moves beyond merely digitizing paper-based information to actively using content to work, innovate, and create new content more effectively and with greater impact.\n\nTake, for example, invoice management. Organizations can digitalize and automate the accounts payable process, enabling them to manage and accelerate invoice processing and comply with regional and global regulations. The capture of incoming business documents can also be modernized and automated to extract and process critical information from invoices and related documents, eliminating the need for manual intervention.\n\nManage and accelerate invoice processing and workflows and support compliance with national and international regulations Learn how\n\nQuantitative Benefits of Digital Content Integration\n\nThe advantages of SAP ECM solutions by OpenText extend beyond just financial operations. IDC found that businesses using these solutions achieve a 351% three-year ROI. This is primarily due to the fast and efficient handling of document-related tasks such as intake, processing, and auditing \u2014 all of which are critical components of ECM.\n\nAs a customer shared during the IDC study, one of the standout benefits is streamlined data management: \u201cWe can now look at all types of data in one place with OpenText connected to SAP. It\u2019s all about speed and efficiency of access by having one place to go instead of many, and the ability to take data governance seriously.\u201d\n\nWhat do all these advantages mean to everyday business operations? Here\u2019s what some of the surveyed customers shared.\n\n35% Faster Document Migrations\n\nDocument migration is often one of the most challenging aspects of digital transformation, particularly when transitioning to a cloud ERP system such as the private and public editions of SAP S/4HANA Cloud. However, by integrating ECM solutions with BPM strategies, organizations can experience a 35% reduction in migration time and a 53% boost in efficiency among employees required for the task.\n\nThis efficiency translates to lower costs and a smoother transition. As one customer said: \u201cOne of the most significant impacts has been the automation of invoice approvals, which has drastically reduced processing time and minimized human intervention.\u201d\n\n$5.36 Million Saved in Invoicing and Accounts Payable\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of linking business processes with ECM is the reduction of errors, particularly in areas such as invoicing and accounts payable. Manual processes are prone to mistakes, leading to costly penalties and missed opportunities.\n\nAs an example, by using the AI and machine learning capabilities within the SAP Information Capture Core application by OpenText to automate invoicing and accounts payable tasks, organizations reported a 37% increase in team efficiencies. In addition, they realized a $1.74 million savings in accounts payable process costs and an additional $5.36 million saved in total invoicing and accounts payable.\n\nThese findings suggest that incorporating ECM solutions into business strategies not only improves financial performance, but also enhances overall compliance. By providing secure, centralized access to documents, these solutions support remote work and collaboration, which are increasingly important in today\u2019s globalized business environment. As a result, businesses can maintain high levels of productivity and compliance, regardless of where their employees are located.\n\n25% Faster Payment on Vendor Invoices\n\nAnother benefit highlighted in the IDC research is the 25% acceleration of vendor payments, generating an annual savings of $1.08 million per organization. This acceleration in payment processing directly impacts cash flow, enabling companies to optimize working capital and potentially secure early-payment discounts, while reducing the risk of late-payment penalties.\n\nAs one customer from the IDC study noted, \u201cThe AI and ML functionality integrated has revolutionized our invoicing operations. One of the most significant impacts has been the automation of invoice approvals, which has drastically reduced processing time and minimized human intervention.\u201d\n\nThe improvement in payment speed is driven by the automation and intelligent processing capabilities of SAP ECM solutions by OpenText. By automating invoice data capture, extraction, and validation, these solutions eliminate bottlenecks and errors that typically slow down manual processing while enhancing accuracy and compliance.\n\nThe Full Potential of ECM Unlocked\n\nThe IDC research shows that integrating SAP ECM solutions by OpenText with business processes enabled by SAP S/4HANA Cloud is essential for breaking free from manual processes and outdated systems. With significant ROI, faster document migrations, improved invoice processing, and quicker vendor payments, these solutions drive operational efficiency and financial performance.\n\nExplore the calculated cost savings and business benefits of integrating BPM with SAP enterprise content management solutions by OpenText in the *IDC White Paper, sponsored by SAP and OpenText, \u201cThe Business Value of SAP ECM Solutions by OpenText,\u201d doc #US52389824, July 2024.\n\nLearn more about SAP ECM solutions by OpenText here.\n\nBil Khan is senior director of Global Partner Marketing at SAP.\n\nSign up for the SAP News Center newsletter to get weekly highlights and stories delivered to your inbox each week Subscribe now\n\n*IDC Business Value White Paper, \u201cThe Business Value of SAP ECM Solutions by OpenText ,\u201d commissioned by SAP and OpenText, IDC #US52389824, July 2024",
