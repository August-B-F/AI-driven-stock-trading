You'll also get 3% cash back if you purchase with your Apple Card.* Apple also partners with carriers like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Boost Mobile, which offer enhanced trade-in credit of up to $1,000 if you're looking for a service plan.

Users on a Magenta Max or Go5G Plus plan can get up to $830 off with a trade-in, which still nets the basic iPhone 16 or the new iPhone 16E for free.

Those who have, or switch to, an eligible unlimited plan can exchange their old iPhone (13 Pro or newer) in any condition for up to $1,000 off. That scores you the basic iPhone 16 or 16 Pro for free and drops the 16 Pro Max to less than $6 per month. If you don't have an old phone to trade in, you can grab the iPhone 16 Plus for just $11 per month or the iPhone 16E for $6 per month when you purchase it on an installment plan. Discounts will be applied as bill credits over 36 months. AT&T is also offering a special online-only discount of $200 off with the activation of a new line. Details Up to $1,000 off with trade-in See at AT&T Close\n\nApple iPhone 16 series at Verizon Verizon is offering trade-in and new-line savings on all iPhone 16 models. Just adding a new line on an Unlimited Ultimate plan (or Unlimited Welcome or Plus plans for the basic model) will get you the iPhone 16, 16 Plus or 16 Pro for free and drops the 16 Pro Max down to just $5 per month. If you'll also be trading in an old phone with the activation of a qualifying line, you can save up to $1,000, which still gets you the basic iPhone 16, 16 Plus and 16 Pro for free. Interested in the 16E instead? You can score it for just $5 per month when you get a new line on any plan or grab the basic 128GB model for free with an eligible trade-in and a new Unlimited Welcome, Plus or Ultimate line. Details Save up to $1,020 with new line See at Verizon Close\n\nApple iPhone 16 series at US Cellular US Cellular is offering a chance to grab any iPhone 16 model for free right now. Adding a new line on a qualifying plan will get you the basic iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro or new 16E for free, while the 16 Pro Max requires a new line and a trade-in. If you'd prefer to prepay for the phone at once, you'll get $380 off the basic iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro or 16 Pro Max or $500 off the iPhone 16E with the activation of a new line. Remember to check whether US Cellular services your area.

If you prefer to pay for the phone outright, you won't get a direct discount on the price, but you will get a free year of 5G service. Details Get up to $1,000 off with no trade-in required See at Boost Mobile Close\n\nApple iPhone 16 series at Best Buy Best Buy isn't carrying any unlocked iPhone 16 models right now, but there are some serious savings available if you add a new line and trade in your old phone through AT&T or Verizon. AT&T customers will get up to $830 off the iPhone 16 or up to $1,000 off the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max.

However, you can save up to $500 on the four flagship models with an eligible trade-in when adding a new line or upgrading an existing one. But unlike some other carriers, Xfinity isn't offering enhanced credit, so the age and condition of your device will have a much larger impact on its value. And if you're looking to make the switch from another carrier, Xfinity will give you up to $500 to pay off your current contract. There are also some special offers available for the iPhone 16E. You can get the basic 128GB model for free with an eligible trade-in when adding a new line or save $300 when upgrading an existing line with a trade-in.

One important thing to keep in mind is that most trade-in deals from carriers require you to become a customer, and they often apply to the priciest plan options.\n\nSelect retailers with trade-in programs could offer gift cards toward future purchases instead, so you don't necessarily have to be locked into a contract to take advantage of the savings you can get from parting with your old device. However, those offers may not provide as much of a deal as traditional trade-in offers.\n\nWe first saw the new iPhone 16 models in the demo room at Apple headquarters in California.

In partnership with energy and infrastructure experts from Black & Veatch, Grain is planning to market the 800 MHz spectrum portfolio to utilities, other critical infrastructure industry operators, rural and regional operators, and other enterprises, meeting crucial unfulfilled telecommunications needs.

Following the closing of the transaction, Grain initially intends to make the acquired spectrum portfolio available to U.S. utilities to support mission-critical communications, improve grid resilience, and enhance emergency response capabilities. Black & Veatch, which has experience working with more than 1,300 power utilities, will facilitate discussions with U.S. utilities to enable the implementation and operation of private wireless broadband networks for utilities across the country.\n\n\"As the energy sector undergoes rapid modernization, utilities require reliable and secure communication networks to support grid operations and disaster response,\" said David Grain, Founder & CEO of Grain Management. \"This spectrum investment reinforces our commitment to digital infrastructure that can enable critical industries to operate more efficiently and securely.\"\n\nThe 800 MHz spectrum band is known for its superior propagation properties that enable extensive coverage, reliability, and in-building penetration, making it ideally suited for critical utility applications. Grain believes this spectrum offers utilities a dedicated option to enhance resilience and control over their existing communications infrastructure.\n\n\"This proposed transaction with Grain continues T-Mobile's track record of optimizing our spectrum resources for the benefit of consumers, putting this 800 MHz portfolio in the hands of a nimble private equity investor that can maximize usage of the spectrum, thus contributing to U.S. 5G leadership that is critical to our economy,\" said Dirk Mosa, Senior Vice President, Spectrum, Partnerships and Acquisitions for T-Mobile. \"We have also already deployed most of Grain's 600 MHz portfolio of spectrum that we gained access to through this deal, further enhancing T-Mobile's customer experiences on the nation's leading 5G network in a number of key markets.\"\n\nBlack & Veatch will guide utilities with the end-to-end planning, implementation, and operations of their intended private LTE 5G networks. \"Grain's acquisition and intended mobilization of 800 MHz of spectrum presents an opportunity for utilities to secure and protect their networks and improve efficiency and operational resiliency,\" said Jim Moos, president of Black & Veatch's Technology, Commercial and Industrial sector. \"Our collective goal is to help utilities build and maintain dedicated networks that ensure operational security and reliability.\"\n\nThis acquisition underscores Grain Management's continued focus on investing in essential digital infrastructure assets that support economic growth, technological advancement, and national security.\n\nAbout Grain Management\n\nFounded in 2007, Grain Management is a leading, global investment firm.

What started as a mere handful of vendors offering chicken strips, pizza and burgers at the ballpark has evolved over the decades to include international flavors.\n\n\n\nT-Mobile Park in Seattle is gearing up for the upcoming baseball season with a fresh batch of new food offerings, further cementing its reputation as a culinary destination.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nMalcom Rogel, the Vice President of Mariners Fan Experience, has played a key role in the transformation of the ballpark's food scene. Rogel, who has been with the ball club for 27 years, since the Kingdome days. He explained the main concourse at T-Mobile Park was intentionally engineered as an open space so that hungry fans could order food and still catch a glimpse of action out on the diamond.\n\n\"It was designed to have people constantly doing some loops,\" said Rogel. \"It's been in our DNA from the start. But it's really started to pick up in the last 8-10 years.\"\n\nWhat started as a mere handful of vendors offering chicken strips, pizza and burgers has evolved over the decades to include international flavors, with dishes representing a variety of cultures. One of the most notable changes came in 2017 when T-Mobile Park introduced toasted grasshoppers a bold move that quickly became a fan favorite.\n\n\"They're very salty; they have a salt and lime taste to them,\" said Rogel. \"It's just hilarious.\"\n\nBut the innovations haven't stopped there. This season's new offerings include spicy blue corndogs, a Trident-shaped cup, and even ice cream nachos. Rogel says the team isn't afraid to push the envelope when it comes to new food ideas.\n\nRelated article\n\n\"We have no ego at all,\" said Rogel. \"We\u2019ll copy anyone as long as it\u2019s awesome, good, and different.\"\n\nLocal food has also played a significant role in T-Mobile Park's culinary evolution. One standout example is Moto Pizza, a popular spot born out of a West Seattle basement. Rogel recalls a Mariners engineer raving about the pizza, which eventually made its way to the ballpark.\n\nThis season, the ballpark has also brought in a culinary heavyweight. World-renowned chef, J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt is introducing teriyaki to the stadium for the first time.\n\n\"He's got 1.6 million subscribers on YouTube,\" said Rogel. \"These different chefs come to us and they'll be like, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s something we should do?\u2019\"\n\nThe Source: Information in this story is from the Seattle Mariners and FOX 13 Seattle reporting.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES FROM FOX 13 SEATTLE\n\nTop aide for WA Gov.

            "content": "Arena foodservice employee is latest to charge Culinary Union officials with undermining workers\u2019 rights under federal law\n\nLas Vegas, NV (March 20, 2025) \u2013 Renee Guerrero, an employee of Levy Restaurants, a foodservice provider at Las Vegas\u2019 T-Mobile Arena, has hit Culinary Workers Union Local 226 (a Unite Here affiliate) and her employer with federal charges for illegally deducting full union dues from her paycheck despite her objections to both union membership and dues payments.\n\nGuerrero filed her charges at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) with free legal aid from National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation staff attorneys. The NLRB is the federal agency responsible for enforcing federal labor law, a duty which includes investigating and prosecuting unfair labor practice cases.\n\nUnder federal labor law and Supreme Court precedents like NLRB v. General Motors, all private sector workers have the right to refrain from formal union membership, though union officials oftentimes try to coerce union membership. Federal law also requires union officials to obtain written authorization from a worker before deducting union dues payments directly from their paycheck.\n\nFurther, because Nevada has Right to Work protections for its workers, Culinary Union officials can\u2019t legally force Guerrero or her coworkers to pay any union dues or fees as a condition of keeping their jobs. In states that lack such protections union officials can require workers to pay at least some union dues just to keep their jobs. In all states, union officials must get the written authorization of workers before directly deducting forced dues and fees from a worker\u2019s paycheck.\n\n\u201cI have a right under Nevada\u2019s Right to Work law to stop all payments to Local 226, and yet rather than respect my rights they\u2019re ignoring my requests and forcing me to pay. I don\u2019t think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support, and their actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision,\u201d stated Guerrero.\n\nChallenge to Illegal Dues Seizures Follows Other Employee Cases Against Culinary Union\n\nAccording to Guerrero\u2019s charges against the union, she \u201csubmitted two written letters to the Union in which she resigned her union membership and revoked any dues check-off authorization she may have signed.\u201d However, the charges state, union officials did not honor her membership resignation (if she had ever become a union member in the first place), and also refused to provide any documentation she may have signed in the past authorizing dues deductions.\n\nIn addition to her charge against the union, Guerrero has filed a separate charge against Levy Premium Foodservice Limited Partnership for its role in facilitating the continued deductions.\n\nNational Right to Work Foundation attorneys have a long history of helping workers at Las Vegas casinos and other venues oppose coercive Culinary Union legal maneuvers, including earlier this month in a case for Las Vegas Convention Center worker Rebecca Swank. Swank, an employee of Sodexo, filed similar federal charges against the union and her employer on the grounds they illegally seized full union dues from her paycheck despite her explicit resignation from membership and revocation of dues authorization.\n\n\u201cBetween federal law, and Nevada\u2019s popular Right to Work law workers like Renee Guerrero have a clear right to opt out of all union financial support and stop any union dues deductions,\u201d commented National Right to Work Foundation President Mark Mix. \u201cUnfortunately, Culinary Union officials have a troubling track record of violating the legal rights of the very workers they claim to represent.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to assist Renee in ensuring her legal rights are enforced, and are available to provide free legal assistance to any Nevada workers who want to exercise their right to stop union dues payments,\u201d added Mix.\n\nThe National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation is a nonprofit, charitable organization providing free legal aid to employees whose human or civil rights have been violated by compulsory unionism abuses. The Foundation, which can be contacted toll-free at 1-800-336-3600, assists thousands of employees in about 200 cases nationwide per year.",

            "content": "The two carriers quibbled over T-Mobile\u2019s messaging around its up-and-coming satellite services\n\nT-Mobile won that round, but Verizon's not backing down\n\nVerizon wants everyone to know it\u2019s dead serious about satellite connectivity, announcing a first of its own this week\n\nVerizon and T-Mobile are at it again, and this time, it\u2019s more about what\u2019s above their terrestrial networks than what\u2019s on the ground.\n\nTo be sure, these two have been at each other\u2019s throats for years, primarily because Verizon made a reputation for itself as the carrier with the \u201cbest network\u201d and T-Mobile, long known as a network laggard, set its sights on upending that. Lo and behold, 5G arrived and T-Mobile seized the moment to leapfrog its competitors, claim the 5G network crown and rub it in with endless third-party analyses.\n\nThey both compete aggressively against AT&T, too, but the jabs between T-Mobile and Verizon are especially sharp. Now they\u2019re increasingly ratcheting up the rhetoric when it comes to who offers what and when in terms of satellite-enabled services. It\u2019s getting downright, dare we say, petty?\n\nTo wit: The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the BBB National Programs early Wednesday put out a press release announcing its decision to back T-Mobile\u2019s claim that it\u2019s the first and only wireless provider to partner with Starlink, the satellite service owned by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nThe TL;DR version? NAD\u2019s decision was made in response to a complaint filed by Verizon, which argued that T-Mobile\u2019s online advertising conveys the message that T-Mobile is the \u201cfirst and only\u201d carrier to offer satellite-enabled messaging services on select devices, but it\u2019s misleading because other carriers offer satellite-enabled messaging services. Verizon further argued that T-Mobile\u2019s advertising is misleading because its satellite-enabled messaging services are in beta and not widely available to consumers.\n\nT-Mobile responded that consumers understand that its ads are related to T-Mobile\u2019s partnership with Starlink and aren\u2019t misleading; they\u2019re actually valid because T-Mobile is the first and only U.S. wireless provider to partner with Starlink on direct-to-device (D2D) communications via satellite.\n\nIn the end, NAD sided with T-Mobile, pointing to a Hal Poret survey that T-Mobile had submitted as part of its defense showing consumers don\u2019t think T-Mobile is claiming to be the \u201cfirst or only\u201d provider to offer any type of satellite coverage, as Verizon contended. Rather, consumers understand that T-Mobile is only claiming it\u2019s the first and only U.S. wireless provider hooking up with Starlink to expand mobile coverage.\n\nVerizon's not done here\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. Less than an hour after the NAD decision went out, Verizon put out a press release announcing a \u201csignificant expansion\u201d of its satellite texting capabilities, enabling its customers to become \u201cthe first in the U.S. to send text messages to any other customer device via satellite when outside the reach of terrestrial cellular networks using select Android devices from the series of Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 smartphones.\u201d\n\nBasically, it means that now all Android customers with compatible devices on Verizon\u2019s network can text anyone while using satellite links instead of just reaching out for emergency services, according to a Verizon spokesperson. The service is free to Verizon customers who have qualifying devices and it\u2019s enabled through Verizon\u2019s partnership with Skylo.\n\nSo, T-Mobile apparently wins the argument about being first with a Starlink-based service. Verizon prevails in the texting race with select Android smartphones. And hey, while we know nit-picky details are super-duper important (what do you think we\u2019ve been doing these last several decades?), we\u2019re not at all sure where this is all going.\n\nThat\u2019s why we asked TMF Associates analyst Tim Farrar for his take on all this.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all splitting hairs with these claims,\u201d he said, reminding us that handset maker and marketer extraordinaire Apple was actually the first to offer a satellite service, powered by Globalstar, that allows regular SMS in addition to iMessage. There may be some constraints \u2013 Apple mentions that \u201cnot all carriers support SMS messaging via satellite, and some features may vary\u201d on its support page, but it\u2019s certainly a first.\n\nWhat's EchoStar up to?\n\nFarrar offered another explanation for the recent hoopla from the operators, which is the expectation of a forthcoming announcement from EchoStar. \u201cPart of the motivation from both Verizon and T-Mobile may be to try and get ahead of that,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, speculation was high at the Satellite 2025 conference in Washington, D.C., last week around EchoStar potentially contracting for a low Earth orbit (LEO) direct-to-device (D2D) constellation from satellite manufacturer MDA Space. Such a service could provide broadband connectivity, a topic EchoStar President and CEO Hamid Akhavan talked about during the company\u2019s Q4 conference call.\n\nSo far, we haven\u2019t seen any news from EchoStar on this front, leaving us to read the tea leaves. The presumption is EchoStar would need a strategic partner to provide billions of dollars to fund a significant D2D project and Farrar said it\u2019s hard to think of any possibilities for an EchoStar partner other than Apple.\n\nYet true to form, EchoStar Chairman Charlie Ergen is keeping his cards close to the vest and given his track record as a poker player, it\u2019s entirely possible that it could just all be an enormous bluff, Farrar noted. Either way, we\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for whatever\u2019s in the cards.",

When you\u2019re at a Tuesday night game in April and the wind is whipping through the stadium and you\u2019re somehow still getting rained on in line for the bathroom, you\u2019re basically required to get the biggest bread bowl of clam chowder you can find and submerge yourself in it like a hot tub.

Two scoops of soft serve with crunchy waffle chips and a cup of caramel sauce. There are also sprinkles, which feels extraneous.\n\nValue menu:\n\nIf you\u2019re going to a bunch of games in a row or just minding your finances, there are expanded options on the value menu, where everything is five dollars and under. There are four new items this year, bringing the total to 14 items: Pocky Stix, Jalape\u00f1o Popcorn, Little Bites Mini Muffins and Tostitos-n-Guac Snack Pack all join the lineup, along with returning favorites that include ballpark classics like hot dogs, nachos, peanuts, fountain sodas, and other snacks and sweets.\n\nNow for the part you care about: the value beer. The good: new this year is a 16 oz value craft draft option, with a choice between the pFriem Lager and the Deschutes King Krispy Pilsner for $8. You can find those at Legends Bar (Sec. 135), The Patio (195), and the SODO Sipping Container (135). Also fun: this year there\u2019s a value Michelada\n\nThe bad news is there are no more value gluten-free options, which seriously bums out our staffer Isabelle and everyone else who can\u2019t have gluten. There is an expanded selection of non-alcoholic beers (including Blue Moon and Corona), but as those still have gluten, that doesn\u2019t really help out Isabelle or other beer-intolerant folks who were excited to have a seltzer option. Please consider bringing that back, Mariners!\n\nAll other value beers are canned (12 oz), cost between $5-$7, and are available at sections 116, 136, 141, 149, 221, 243, 319, 328, 329, 330, 341, the Hit it Here Terrace Bar and The Patio at 195. Those beers include: Bale Breaker Pilsner, Shiner Bock, Asahi Japanese Lager (rice-based, if you can do gluten but can\u2019t do traditional beer), M\u00e9tier Double Play, Keystone Light, and Miller High Life.\n\nThere is some good news for gluten-free drinkers: the new Slushietown in the \u2018Pen will feature 20 oz frozen beverages in flavors like Mangonado, regular or basil lemonade, and Pi\u00f1a Colada. The slushies will be part of the pre-game happy hour in the \u2018Pen, which, as a reminder, starts when gates open and goes until an hour before first pitch. Happy hour also includes all the other beers on offer in the \u2018pen, so get yourself down there early, watch some BP, and enjoy some value beverages.\n\nStraying too far from God\u2019s light:\n\nMaybe if I\u2019d been there in person to see these, I would feel differently about them. But as I was scrolling through the promotional materials, these two made me say What? and also No.\n\nThe Tridents Up souvenir cup\n\nThis is a cute idea that looks like a nightmare in practice. It\u2019s the Kanye water bottle tweet writ large. The last thing that I want to do when I go to a game is parent a three-foot tall piece of plastic. Also, how many people are going to try to turn this over to Raise The Trident after a Mariner hits a home run, forgetting there\u2019s anything in it, and shower their neighbors with ice chips and soda flecks, meanwhile losing the one straw in the kingdom that\u2019s long enough to extract liquid from this behemoth. And then I have to remember to bring it back with me each game to justify the 25-dollar price tag? Listen, I already have an emotional support water bottle, it weighs 20 pounds and is an albatross around my neck at all times except when I\u2019m at a sporting event, where it is legally not allowed to accompany me. Absolutely not.\n\nThe What Up Corn Dog\n\nOne thing I have always appreciated about the Mariners is they have not resorted to the food version of clickbait, courting virality with outrageous food items designed to be Instagrammed more than eaten. That ends this year with the Kool-Aid blue What Up corn dog, which looks like deep-fried Papa Smurf after he fell into one of the reactors at Chernobyl. Both the color and the texture of this just look so deeply unpleasant, like a 70s basement rec room rug crossed with wood shop shavings dipped in a coat of Windex. And you know that after it\u2019s done shredding up the roof of your mouth like the feds are knocking, that blue dust is getting all over everyone\u2019s home whites. They better start selling Tide pens at the Walk Off market along with these things. (Also, the name. What Up Dog? Are we being up-dogged? In the year 2025?)\n\nPre- and Post-game:\n\nOfferings around SODO can sometimes be a little spotty post-game, but Hatback Grille and Steelheads Alley are expanding their postgame offerings this year. New this year is the \u201cPostgame Power Hour\u201d at Boxyard after every game. For the first hour after the final out, both establishments will offer 50% off all pizzas and $5 draft beers. You\u2019re going to be sitting in traffic anyway, might as well enjoy some discounted pizza and wait it out.",

These collaborations aim to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into next-generation network hardware, software and architecture, setting new benchmarks in spectral efficiency, network performance and telco innovation.\n\n\u201cNext-generation wireless networks must be fundamentally integrated with AI to seamlessly connect hundreds of billions of phones, sensors, cameras, robots and autonomous vehicles,\u201d NVIDIA stated in a press release. \u201cAI-native wireless networks will provide enhanced services for billions of users and set new standards in spectral efficiency \u2014 the rate at which data can be transmitted over a given bandwidth. They will also offer groundbreaking performance and resource utilization while creating new revenue streams for telecommunications companies.\u201d\n\nExpanding the AI-RAN ecosystem\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s collaborations will be anchored in an AI-native wireless network stack built on the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform, enabling software-defined radio access networks (RANs) on NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure. AI-RAN, a technology that merges AI and RAN workloads on a single platform, represents a significant step towards achieving network energy efficiency goals and realizing AI revenue streams for telecom operators. It is also positioned as a critical step toward fully AI-driven 6G networks.\n\nT-Mobile will expand its AI-RAN Innovation Center, launched with NVIDIA in 2024, to accelerate research into AI-native 6G capabilities. The company sees AI integration as a key factor in delivering the high performance and scalability required for future wireless networks.\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting next step in our efforts to natively integrate AI into the network as we begin the journey to 6G,\u201d said Mike Sievert, CEO of T-Mobile. \u201cWorking with these additional industry leaders will enable the network performance, efficiency, and scale to power the next generation of experiences that customers and businesses expect.\u201d\n\nMITRE to be NVIDIA\u2019s founding research partner\n\nNonprofit R&D organization MITRE will serve as NVIDIA\u2019s founding research partner for 6G and will work on a \u201cground-up redesign\u201d of wireless networks and infrastructure, with an emphasis on utilizing and enabling AI advancements. MITRE will serve as NVIDIA\u2019s founding research partner for 6G.\n\nAs part of this collaboration, MITRE will develop and prototype new AI-driven services and applications for wireless networks. Applications may include integrated sensing and communications, dynamic spectrum sharing and agentic network organization and security.\n\nOf this last application, MITRE Chief Technology Officer Charles Clancy told RCR Wireless News that while 5G network slices, underpinned by software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), offer huge potential for software-defined infrastructure, they are \u201ccumbersome\u201d to manage, and therefore, we\u2019ve yet to seen the sort of real-time, responsiveness in the 5G core we\u2019d hoped for.\n\n\u201cAI agents have the potential to change that dramatically,\u201d Clancy continued. \u201cGiven higher-level guidance on network objectives, they can collaborate to turn the knobs and pull the levers much faster than a human operator. By coupling this with cyber sensors, we can combat threats in real time. By ingesting network metadata they can tune performance dynamically. Linking to x/rApps we can manage RAN infrastructure as well. And all of this can be done through existing 5G network interfaces.\u201d\n\nNVIDIA also working with Cisco, ODC and Booz Allen\n\nAdditionally, NVIDIA shared that Cisco will lead efforts in mobile core and network technology, leveraging its extensive experience in secure infrastructure; ODC will develop AI-native Open RAN software, bridging the gap between 5G and 6G; and Booz Allen Hamilton will focus on AI-RAN algorithms and cybersecurity, conducting performance and security testing for AI-driven wireless platforms.\n\n\u201cNext-generation wireless networks will be revolutionary, and we have an unprecedented opportunity to ensure AI is woven in from the start,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWorking with leaders in the field, we\u2019re building an AI-enhanced 6G network that achieves extreme spectral efficiency.\u201d",

The second test used the test device and Qualcomm\u2019s X85 5G Modem-RF in what the carrier called \u201ca glimpse into the next evolution of 5G Advanced,\u201d and achieved peak speeds of 6.3 Gbps.\n\n\u201cWith 6-Carrier Aggregation, we\u2019re not just adding another feather to our cap\u2014we\u2019re accelerating the future of 5G Advanced,\u201d said Ulf Ewaldsson, president of technology for T-Mobile US. \u201cThis milestone isn\u2019t just about speed; it\u2019s about building a network that delivers exactly what our customers need\u2014unparalleled performance, reliability, and innovation.\u201d\n\nThe carrier said that it leveraged its 2.5 GHz, PCS, AWS and 600 MHz spectrum in the tests.\n\n\u201cThis achievement in collaboration with our long-standing partners, T-Mobile and Qualcomm Technologies, reflects Nokia\u2019s commitment to developing 5G Advanced solutions with a strong focus on the areas that matter the most to our customers.\u201d said Tommi Uitto, President of Mobile Networks at Nokia. \u201cBy combining our Massive MIMO radios, advanced beamforming techniques, high-order Carrier Aggregation, and high-order modulation, we have demonstrated the key building blocks of premium 5G Advanced performance\u2014now successfully validated in a live customer network.\u201d\n\nImage: 123RF\n\n\u201cWe are excited to have played a pivotal role in this achievement, utilizing our Qualcomm X85 Modem-RF to push the boundaries of 5G Advanced downlink speeds,\u201d said Durga Malladi, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Technology Planning and Edge Solutions at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. \u201cThis collaboration with T-Mobile and Nokia highlights our commitment to driving innovation and setting new benchmarks in wireless performance.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile US had also tested 6-CA in sub-6 GHz spectrum in January of this year, in what it said was an industry first. The carrier worked with Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies to conduct the testing in its live production 5G network and the partners were able to achieve download speeds of 3.6 Gbps in sub-6 GHz spectrum.\n\nThe test involved aggregating two channels of 2.5 GHz, two channels of PCS spectrum and two channels of AWS spectrum, according to T-Mobile US, which produced an \u201ceffective 245 MHz of aggregated 5G channels.\u201d\n\nIn November of last year, T-Mobile US tested New Radio Dual Connectivity (5G DC) on its 5G Standalone (SA) network. The new feature allowed the carrier to aggregate 2.5 GHz and millimeter-wave spectrum in order to boost uplink throughput and capacity, reaching peak speeds of 2.2 Gbps.\n\nT-Mobile US had announced in May of 2023 that it was rolling out four component-carrier aggregation across its 5G Standalone network, which it said at the time could achieve peak speeds of 3.3 Gbps. In that case, T-Mobile US relies on two 2.5 GHz channels, one 1.9 GHz channel and one 600 MHz channel. The first device able to access 4CA capabilities was the Samsung Galaxy S23.\n\nThe carrier also touted its testing of five-component-carrier aggregation in sub-6 GHz spectrum Mobile World Congress Barcelona in 2023. In that trial, working with Nokia and Qualcomm, T-Mo aggregated two FDD and three TDD carriers and achieved peak downlink throughput speeds that exceeded 4.2 Gbps.",

Outside the stadiums, the selection improves further, with plenty of great bars and restaurants that beckon to anybody looking to meet up with a group, or just avoid paying $20 for a Bud Light and some loaded fries.\n\nMost game-oriented destinations lie north of the stadiums in Pioneer Square. To the south, in SoDo, sandwiches and pizza balance out the preponderance of fast-food chains. Arriving from the east allows for eating through the Chinatown\u2013International District. The train track tangle that separates the dumplings from the defensive tackles can be a pain, but a wealth of great food awaits, depending on how far you want to walk.\n\nJump to:\n\nPioneer Square / SoDo / Chinatown\n\nPioneer Square\n\nDarkalino's lives inside the new Hometeam shop on Occidental. Image: Chona Kasinger\n\nDarkalino's The former London Plane now holds Marcus Lalario's cafe-retail space, the Home Team, which projects athletic vibes onto its Occidental Square surroundings. The cafe side of that equation is Darkalino's, serving bowls of housemade pasta, hearty focaccia sandwiches, and a drink menu that takes you from espressos to spritzes to cans of Modelo.\n\nFlatstick Pub Technically this is a 21-and-over putt-putt bar, but 30-plus taps of Washington beer, cider, and seltzer also lend themselves well to meeting up before walking to the stadiums. The kitchen serves a fairly standard menu of pub grub and pizza. But the game situation is on point; sneak in a round of duffleboard before kickoff.\n\nSaigon Drip's Bok Bok B*tch, a.k.a a grilled chicken banh mi, a.k.a a very quotable Awkwafina moment from Crazy Rich Asians . Image: Courtesy Saigon Drip Cafe\n\nSaigon Drip Cafe Fast casual and friendly, this (takeout-friendly) Vietnamese spot exceeds expectations all day long. \u201cCroissant mi\u201d breakfast sandwiches come stuffed with a fried egg, maybe some spam, and banh mi fixings; the rest of the day\u2019s menu\u2014pho, banh mi, vermicelli bowls, a happy hour menu\u2014is consistently solid. But it\u2019s especially hard to resist the banh mi drip, a loaded-up brisket sandwich that comes with a sidecar of broth for dipping.\n\nMatsu A sushi restaurant with a meditative temple-like interior might seem a tonal mismatch with the roar inside Lumen. But there\u2019s no shame in pre-gaming with sashimi or a 12th Man roll, filled with avocado and shrimp tempura. Matsu\u2019s huge menu dedicates an entire section to fried things, including karaage and Korean-style wings. This stadium-adjacent spot shares ownership with Momiji and Umi Sake House, as evidenced by the emphasis on drinks and a generous happy hour menu.\n\nAn oyster bar feels like a very PNW pre-game destination. Image: Feed It Creative Taylor Shellfish The state\u2019s largest oyster farmer runs a handful of oyster bars, including this throwback-style room on Occidental Avenue. Freshly shucked oysters are pristine (especially with the selection of Northwest beer) but heartier dishes like fish and chips, geoduck chowder, and smoked oyster dip offer fortification for fall games. Take heed: walk-ins only, and the happy hour menu does not run on game days.\n\nRojo's Mexican Food The entire menu of enormous burritos and petite street-style tacos is entirely vegan\u2014but that\u2019s almost beside the point. Rojo\u2019s makes good use of faux meat in its asada, carnitas (probably the best protein in the house), chick\u2019n, and al pastor. The address on James (the former Il Corvo) is handy for a pre-game meal, though the foil-wrapped burritos can be toted into a Mariners game; it\u2019s also big enough to feed two people.\n\nBar Sosta Hitting up Il Terrazzo Carmine for a fancy meal before a game is overkill, but this sibling bar tones down the formality while keeping the class. The marble tables and birdcage chandeliers make digging into a giant piece of lasagna or splitting a spicy shredded pork pizza among friends feel extra classy. Lean into the elegance by washing it down with a Hemingway daiquiri or glass of Italian bubbles.\n\nDamn the Weather serves sophisticated plates, but also a sturdy burger. Image: Nate Watters Damn the Weather A den of atmospheric old brick offers the happiest medium between pitchers of beer and upscale fare you feel weird eating in a jersey. Damn the Weather is decidedly a cocktail bar with destination-worthy food, but the menu includes plenty of local beer and cider (plus non-alcoholic creations). On the food side, a burger and frites with aioli balance out plates of pan-seared halibut or fettuccine draped in seasonal produce.\n\nGood Bar A striking old building (originally a bank) houses a cocktail haunt that isn\u2019t so much a sports bar as a great bar that happens to be close to sports. Head here if your idea of tailgating involves careful cocktails, a solid whiskey list, and Mediterranean-toned food like pita wraps and grilled halloumi.\n\nPass D Jollof Quick service, a huge and charming space (formerly Altstadt and Somi), and some powerful spiced beef called suya make this Nigerian restaurant an appetizing option. Meat pies and the aptly named puff-puffs\u2014fried dough balls\u2014work better for scarfing down before a game than the signature soups, but there\u2019s always time for jollof rice.\n\nSoDo\n\nSliceBox Pizza This walkup slice counter with a Sonics-worthy green-and-gold paint job is a favorite among Seattle\u2019s pizza cognoscenti. When its business hours align with game schedules, it's also a fantastic antidote to all those stadium beers. A double-decker glass case holds maybe 10 pies by the slice, a mix of crunchy Sicilian-inspired squares and classic New York rounds. You can also order whole pies and salads for takeaway.\n\nThe new Hatback bar complex embraces Seattle\u2019s baseball history\u2026and bar food. Image: Courtesy Hatback Bar & Grille Hatback Bar and Grille and Steelheads Alley The Mariners back this restaurant, taproom, and beer garden complex that faces T-Mobile. The former Pyramid Brewing building now drips with baseball history, honoring Ken Griffey, Jr. and the 1940s-era Seattle Steelheads Negro League team. The interior is both handsome and filled with TVs, pub food leans into local ingredients, and M\u00e9tier Brewing Company founder Rodney Hines is the resident brewer at Steelheads Alley.\n\nPaseo The current ownership of this beloved sandwich shop added a spacious outpost south of the stadiums has a counter service interior built to handle crowds, plus an outdoor space full of picnic tables. Hearty Caribbean sandwiches are deeply compatible with brisk fall game days and tropical cocktails help take the edge off chilly temperatures.\n\nChinatown\n\nChung Chun Rice Hot Dog This tiny spot beneath the Chinatown paifang offers zero seating, but Korean-style corn dogs are about as portable as it gets for a walk to Lumen. These rice-battered beasts come studded with cubes of fried potato, coated in squiggles of crunchy ramen noodles, or wrapped in cheddar. One popular version is essentially a mozzarella stick disguised as a corn dog; another pairs beef dog and cheese inside a squid ink batter. Grab extra napkins.\n\nE-Jae Pak Mor's familiar dishes like khao soi, beef noodle soup, and khao mun gai deserve just as much attention as its signature dumplings. Image: Amber Fouts E-Jae Pak Mor Labor-intensive pak mor dumplings star on the menu at this casual (but stellar) Thai counter across from Uwajimaya. They\u2019re great, but the khao soi and spicy beef noodle soup can also fortify you against the chill of an outdoor stadium seat.\n\nUwajimaya Food Hall Are you a parent looking to stuff your kids with quick, affordable food before braving the major league sportsball chaos? The venerable grocery store\u2019s food court offers tacos, taiyaki, banh mi, and Hawaiian plate lunch, plus a seating area that\u2019s forgiving of noise and crumbs.

Additionally, the company appears to be discouraging store visits, and all these factors combined could make for an unpleasant experience for customers Going to a carrier store to upgrade your phone should be a straightforward process and shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

            "content": "\"Home, sweet home\" has been less of a motto and more of a mockery for Seattle Mariner hitters over the years.\n\nWhatever you choose to blame \u2013 the much-maligned marine layer, the off-kilter batter\u2019s eye, cold weather, or the spirit of Milton Bradley laying a curse upon the outfield \u2013 it\u2019s clear that the Mariners have a Seattle problem.\n\nThe numbers paint a picture, and it's not pretty\n\nIn 2024, the Mariners finished with a sOPS+ of 101 on the road, just above the league average, but a measly home sOPS+ of 86. They struck out 795 times on the road compared to 830 times at home, and hit for a .234 average away from Seattle \u2014 which feels Joe DiMaggio-esque when compared to the .214 average they posted in T-Mobile Park, the worst home average in baseball by a longshot.\n\nIn 2023, the contrast was equally stark. That season, the Mariners finished sixth in MLB in road OPS. But in their own backyard? Just 24th. In 2022, they were eighth on the road compared to 22nd at home. 2021, 17th on the road, dead last at home. You get the idea.\n\nBrandon Pfaadt's 9th, 10th and 11th Ks. pic.twitter.com/9zSjobw14E \u2014 Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) April 28, 2024\n\nOf course, the offensive vortex that is T-Mobile Park doesn\u2019t just go in one direction; certainly Logan Gilbert and company enjoy chewing up 200-plus innings in the most pitcher-friendly ballpark in the league.\n\nBut for a restless fanbase perpetually fed up with the lack of investment in the lineup, hot dogs from Heaven won\u2019t be enough to satisfy their appetite for offense at the ballpark.\n\nThe Mariners offense has a secret weapon\n\nEnter Kevin Seitzer.\n\nThe Mariners\u2019 new hitting coach hopes to come to the rescue, with the mission to manufacture more runs in the Emerald City. Seitzer\u2019s previous stop was as the Atlanta Braves\u2019 hitting coach from 2015-2024, where he mentored young superstars such as Ozzie Albies, Austin Riley, and Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. Seattle will provide Seitzer with a different challenge.\n\nAn article by Mike Petriello of MLB.com explaining that Seattle, not Colorado, is MLB\u2019s most extreme ballpark examines historical grievances of hitting in Seattle, and airs out past lamentations from Ichiro Suzuki, Mike Cameron, Alex Rodriguez, and Edgar Mart\u00ednez about the difficulty of hitting in the ballpark. If those players are complaining, then park factors at T-Mobile start to feel less like an inconvenience and more akin to Sisyphus rolling his rock uphill.\n\nBut in a quote provided via Adam Jude of the Seattle Times, Seitzer shrugged off the difficulty of hitting in Seattle.\n\n\u201cYou have to embrace where you play [your home games],\u201d Seitzer said. \u201cWhen it is the way it is, we\u2019ve just got to focus more on low line drives \u2013 just making solid contact and not worrying about balls that we crush that should be homers and get caught. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it. But as long as we\u2019re squaring balls up, having good at-bats and putting the fat part of the bat on the ball consistently, that\u2019s all you can do.\u201d\n\nEasier said than done, but the Mariners have reason for optimism. Under a new hitting blueprint which began in August, when Dan Wilson took over as manager and Mart\u00ednez took over hitting coach duties, the Mariners resurrected their offense and made a late season push.\n\nMart\u00ednez and Seitzer echo each other in philosophy \u2014 simplify the approach, make contact with low line drives, and spray the ball to all areas of the field. The Mariners had the third-best wRC+ in baseball throughout the final 34 games of last season, and scored the most runs in the American League in that span. At T-Mobile Park, the Mariners\u2019 xwOBA was vaulted from .306 before the leadership change to a .328 xwOBA after it.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to hit in Seattle. It\u2019s also not impossible. And if the Mariners can get around to hitting on March 27 this year instead of August 24, fans will be treated to more than just those free hot dogs on a trip to the ballpark.",

Meanwhile, the driver of the Mercedes remained at the location and cooperated with authorities.Emergency crews from SoCalGas, as well as Los Angeles' Departments of Building and Safety and Water and Power, are assessing the damage. Officials have declared the building a total loss, and demolition is expected in the coming days.According to LAPD Sgt. Cody Derosa, themanager acted quickly to evacuate employees and customers before the collapse. The adjacent dental office was closed at the time, preventing any risk to occupants.Mere days ago, astore in Yonkers, NY, was robbed in broad daylight on March 12, prompting a major police response with 30 to 40 officers swarming the area. The suspect fled, leading to a car chase that ended on Woodycrest Avenue, where police blocked the vehicle and took the suspect into custody without any shots fired.As I said back then, I'm once again thankful for the convenience of handling telco services online, avoiding the need to visit physical stores. With digital options, customers can sign up for plans, order SIM cards, and activate services remotely, making in-person visits increasingly unnecessary. You never know what might happen, right?",

            "content": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Houston had crowded onto the podium inside T-Mobile Center on Saturday night, and the second-ranked Cougars were beginning to celebrate their Big 12 Tournament title, when Emanuel Sharp was handed a championship belt as the tourney MVP.\n\nHe raised it high above his head \u2014 upside down.\n\nIt was just about the only obvious misstep that anyone from Houston made all week.\n\nMilos Uzan poured in 25 points against Arizona in the finale, Sharp added 17 in another brilliant effort, and the Cougars turned up their trademark defense in the final minute to hold on for a 72-64 victory over the Big 12 newcomer.\n\nPlaying without injured big man J'Wan Roberts, the Cougars (30-4) took a 64-62 lead on Uzan's 3-pointer with 5 minutes to go, then suffocated the Wildcats (22-12) down the stretch to avenge a loss to Iowa State in last year's title game.\n\n\"We did a great job of staying together,\" said Sharp, who was joined by Uzan and Big 12 player of the year LJ Cryer on the All-Tournament team. \"That's what coach has been preaching. And that's why I love this team.\"\n\nHouston romped to the regular-season Big 12 title, winning 19 of 20 games in the expanded league. And it was just as dominant in three games in Kansas City, easily beating Colorado and No. 17 BYU before turning back red-hot Arizona for the trophy.\n\n\"We never panic,\" Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. \"A lot of people around us do, but thank God they're not coaches and players. We've been in these bunkers. We've been there when it's tough. We've learned to internalize and almost get independent of everything around us. We get in a bunker and believe in each other and get to work.\"\n\nCaleb Love scored 19 points, Jaden Bradley added 14 and KJ Lewis finished with 11 for the Wildcats, who were trying to replicate what Arizona State did in football this past season: win a Big 12 title in its first year in its new league.\n\n\"It was a tough year. A tough conference. And for us to compete with the best of the best, you know, as far as conferences, I'm proud of my guys,\" Love said. \"I'm just proud we made it this far, and we'll be ready for March Madness.\"\n\nWildcats coach Tommy Lloyd had bristled after their quarterfinal win over No. 9 Texas Tech when it was suggested that the title tilt amounted to a showdown of styles: Arizona's high-scoring offense against Houston's dominant defense.\n\n\"We're not that bad on defense,\" Lloyd countered succinctly.\n\nTurns out the Wildcats are quite good.\n\nThey harried and harrassed Houston's guards wherever they went on the floor, twice holding the Cougars without a point for 5-minute stretches in the first half. The result was a 33-28 lead in the locker room that felt just a little bit bigger.\n\nYet there is a reason that Houston is No. 1 nationally in defensive efficiency.\n\nThe Cougars were still trailing 40-37 when they clamped down on the Wildcats, turning defense into offense and outscoring them 19-6 over the next five minutes. By the time Uzan curled in a bucket with 11:40 to go, Houston had taken a 56-46 lead \u2014 the largest of the entire game for either team.\n\nArizona gamely fought back to take a 62-61 lead, only for the relentless Cougars to regain the lead seconds later, when Uzan dropped his 3-pointer. He scored again on their ensuing possession, and Houston maintained its lead from there.\n\nThe result was its third conference tourney title in five years after the pair it won in the American Athletic Conference.\n\n\"Obviously they've had a great season, and a great couple of seasons, and Coach Sampson deserves a ton of credit. They got us twice this year,\" Lloyd said. \"They won the conference by four or five. They won the conference tournament. At this moment they are the kings of the Big 12. I have nothing but respect for them.\"\n\nInjury Update\n\nRoberts, who sprained his right ankle in the quarterfinals, went through pregame warmups without the walking boot he wore a day earlier. But he had the boot back on as he watched from the bench in the hopes of playing in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNCAA Implications\n\nHouston almost certainly locked up a No. 1 seed on Selection Sunday and will probably begin its NCAA Tournament in Wichita, Kansas. Most expect the Wildcats to land a No. 4 seed after their run to the conference championship game.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season. Sign up here.

I didn\u2019t want to expect it with Luis (Castillo) being the veteran guy, and I thought he\u2019s completely deserving. We have a bunch of guys on our staff that could be Opening Day starters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you always dream of. It\u2019s a really big deal. I don\u2019t take it lightly.\u201d\n\nWilson elected to reward the workhorse and MLB\u2019s leader in innings pitched last season (208.2 IP) for his best year yet, selecting Gilbert over Luis Castillo \u2014 Seattle\u2019s Opening Day starter in 2023 and 2024.\n\nWilson considered the decision \u201cvery tough\u201d and Gilbert didn\u2019t want to step on toes, either. But Castillo was more excited for his teammate than Gilbert was.\n\n\u201cDan told me and for five seconds, probably, I don\u2019t think a word came out,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cI was just taking it in. And Luis was like, \u2018Say something!\u2019 Super excited for me, giving me hugs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the kind of guy (Luis) is. Behind closed doors, (he\u2019s) the same as you see.\u201d\n\nTacoma Rainiers pitcher Logan Gilbert warms up during workouts at Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, Washington, on Tuesday, May 4, 2021.\n\nGilbert, 27, posted a 9-12 record and 3.38 earned run average last season, whiffing a career-high 220 batters with signature sliders and four-seamers. He led all of MLB in innings pitched and WHIP (walks and hits per innings pitched, 0.887), the spark plug of the sport\u2019s best rotation in 2024.\n\n\u201cLogan certainly deserves it,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt was a big smile and a great moment. He\u2019s excited about the opportunity. What a great year he had (in 2024).\n\n\u201cLuis Castillo has carried that torch, deservedly so over the last few years. He makes it a difficult decision. ... The Rock has been The Rock. He\u2019s been so steady, so consistent, and has poured a lot into the young pitchers that we have. He\u2019s the veteran of the staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the changing of that a little bit, but he\u2019s been tremendous about it all.\u201d",

Purchases you make through our links may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\nWhen you're a military family, things change all the time. This can include your phone plan. You could be assigned to a new base and your old service is much weaker Or, in my experience, you can be assigned overseas and your phone service doesn't have a true international plan. T-Mobile aims to take that problem off your plate by offering the Military Essentials plan for military families.\n\nWhether your active duty partner is in a field exercise for two weeks or deployed overseas for a whole year, those quick phone calls and rare chances to FaceTime are so vital and help everyone pass the time apart. T-Mobile's goal is simply to help military families and veterans stay connected.\n\nHere are a few deals that T-Mobile is offering to help families, like mine, feel closer no matter how far apart they are:\n\n1. The T-Mobile Essentials Military Plan\n\n2. The T-Mobile Go5G Military Plan\n\n3. The T-Mobile Go5G Plus Military Plan\n\n4. The T-Mobile Go5G Next Military Plan\n\nWhy should I switch to T-Mobile?\n\nT-Mobile is dedicated to bringing you the best service on the latest devices for the lowest prices, which are even lower with the T-Mobile military discount for active duty, veterans and military spouses. You can save up to 30% on three lines with T-Mobile compared to the same plans with Verizon or AT&T. Plus, you'll be eligible for even more benefits, like T-Mobile's scam shield to block those annoying scam calls, or the Magenta status which provides more discounts to you outside of your phone plan. You're enrolled in T-Mobile's Magenta status on day one, where you can get access to streaming apps, a 15% off discount at Hilton properties and even Tuesday deals like $5 movie tickets.\n\nGet T-Mobile benefits now\n\nCan I bring my device and phone number to T-Mobile?\n\nYes! But, both require a quick check first. You'll need to see if your phone is compatible with the T-Mobile network. Your number will also need to be checked. It is rare when a number cannot be moved over. If it is, you'll simply follow the on-screen instructions during checkout to authorize the transfer. Both can be checked online, over the phone, or by visiting the nearest T-Mobile store.\n\nSave with T-Mobile Military Plans\n\nSTREAMING DEAL: Bundle Disney+ and Hulu streaming services for 72% off for a limited-time this March\n\nPrices were accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.",

T-Mobile's got a deal, but there's a catch\n\nAccording to an internal memo to T-Mobile employees obtained by CNET, some legacy plans (plans that aren't offered to new subscribers but are still available to existing subscribers) will see a $5 per-line increase starting April 2, 2025. Since these legacy plans are retired, it means those subscribers are among the company's most loyal and long-term. T-Mobile blamed the increase on \"rising costs.\"\n\nLegacy plans will see the increase\n\nLegacy plans include offerings like Magenta, Magenta MAX, Magenta 55+, ONE, and Simple Choice, but it's not clear which of these will see the increase. The new rates will not impact current plans like Go5G Next, Go5G Plus, and Essentials.\n\nAlso: The best phones\n\nIf this increase affects you, you'll receive a text from T-Mobile as soon as March 13. \"For the first time in nearly a decade,\" the text reads, \"we're making an update to the price of some of our older monthly service plans.\" If you don't get a notification today, your rates aren't going up.\n\nThere is some good news\n\nJon Freier, president of T-Mobile's consumer group, apparently wrote in the memo that no line that received an increase as part of last year's bump will see another increase this time. If you were affected by the $5 hike last May, you should be unscathed this time.\n\nAll existing plans should stay the same for now.\n\nAlso: Sign up for T-Mobile 5G home internet and get a $300 gift card free\n\nT-Mobile says that if your plan falls under the \"Un-contract Promise,\" which guarantees your rates won't increase, it will pay your final month's recurring service charge if you decide to leave (as long as you let the company know within 60 days).",

Courtesy BYU Photo \u276e \u276f\n\nThere\u2019s a level of play elite teams can reach.\n\nSecond-ranked and No. 1 seed Houston, which looked kind of pedestrian in Thursday\u2019s nine-point quarterfinal win against No. 16 seed Colorado, rose to an elite defensive level in Friday\u2019s semifinals against 17th-ranked and No. 4 seed BYU.\n\nThe blue Cougars, who had won nine straight Big 12 games heading into the semifinals, never even came close to matching that level.\n\nHouston jumped out to a 15-0 lead in the first six minutes of the game and was never challenged, bullying BYU all game long in a 74-54 win at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Mo.\n\n\u201cIt was a poor start by our club and we came out a little flat,\u201d BYU coach Kevin Young said. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure why in a big game like that. We couldn\u2019t throw it in the ocean to start the game. We were 3 of 16 from 3 in the first half and that\u2019s obviously not like us. That really put us in mud.\u201d\n\nNot only did Houston lead for 38 of the game\u2019s 40 minutes, but the red Cougars \u2014 even without injured first team All-Big 12 forward J\u2019Wan Roberts \u2014 held a double-digit advantage for 31:24 of that time. They challenged BYU\u2019s shooters, they got to every rebound and loose ball and showed the kind of toughness that championship basketball demands.\n\nHouston is perhaps the best defensive team in the country and that ability was on full display against BYU, which missed its first nine shots before Dawson Baker finally converted a 3-point play at the 13:16 mark of the first half. At that point the blue Cougars trailed 15-3.\n\nThe closest BYU could get in the first half was seven points, 23-16, with 6:13 to play on a pair of Richie Saunders free throws. But Houston closed the half on an 18-4 run and took a comfortable 41-20 lead at halftime.\n\nIt was the 16th time this season that the red Cougars had held an opponent to under 25 points in the first half, by far the best mark in the country.\n\nKeba Keita came out with some fire to start the second half, dominating both ends of the floor. He scored eight points inside and rebounded hard as BYU trimmed the deficit to 13, 45-32, with 13:43 remaining in the game. But Emanuel Sharp banged in back-to-back 3-pointers to push the lead back up to 19 points and the blue Cougars could get no closer.\n\nIt was a disappointing performance by BYU, who often talked about how much they had grown since losing at Houston 86-55 in early January.\n\n\u201cThe first game we played against them it was all their defense,\u201d Young said. \u201cTonight it felt like we got a lot of shots in the first half we normally get that were good looks that didn\u2019t go down. I don\u2019t want to discredit Houston. They are an amazing team and I learned a lot playing against them. It was a combination of our inability to make open shots and the thing they do really well which is multiple efforts. They take one thing away and you think you\u2019ve got them but they do a great job continuing to play multiple efforts. That\u2019s a credit to their coaching staff to get their team to get that done on a nightly basis.\u201d\n\nKeita tied a season high with 14 points to go along with 12 rebounds. Baker finished with 11 points and Saunders added 10, but BYU was a dismal 6 of 28 (21.4%) from the 3-point line just one day after making 18 triples against Iowa State in the quarterfinals.\n\nBYU\u2019s 54 points was a season low, one less than the 55 it scored the first time it played Houston.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and I always learn in the post-season just how much things get turned up,\u201d Young said. \u201cI told our guys I\u2019ve learned about the urgency that you have to have in post-season play and the level of focus. Everything comes a little bit harder in the post-season. Every pass is more contested, every cut gets chucked a little harder, every block out gets more challenging. You have to understand you need to lock in even more than normally.\u201d\n\nSharp, who was 5 of 7 from the 3-point line, led all scorers with 26 points and backcourt mate L.J. Cryer added 20, making 4 of 11 from beyond the arc.\n\nHouston (29-3) is expected to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and will play Arizona in Saturday\u2019s Big 12 final. The red Cougars have won 25 of their past 26 games, the only loss to Texas Tech by one point in overtime on Feb. 1.\n\nBYU (24-9) will await an NCAA Tournament invitation on Sunday. The blue Cougars are safely in the field but could be seeded anywhere from No. 5 to No. 8, according to most Bracketology reports.\n\nHow BYU will be affected by such a sound thrashing remains to be seen. A poor response would mean another early exit from the NCAA Tournament, a place where the program hasn\u2019t won a first-round game since 2011.",

The shares declined $3.12 (1.2%) during regular trading hours on Friday. After hours on Friday, the stock dropped some more ($1.97 or .77%) to $254.01. What set off the selloff was a downgrade in T-Mobile stock by Citi analyst Michael Rollins who said that the carrier's days of outperforming its rivals might soon be over. Rollins cut T-Mobile to Hold from Buy while keeping his target price of $268 the same. A move to the target would result in a 3% rise in the company's shares.\n\n\n\n\n\nT-Mobile is trading at 23 times its earnings, a 70% premium to the price-earnings ratio that T-Mobile that would make the stock more fairly priced. Rollins says that T-Mobile is trading at a premium to the shares belonging to its rivals which usually means that its price-earnings ratio is higher. For example,is trading at 23 times its earnings, a 70% premium to the price-earnings ratio that AT&T and Verizon are trading at.

As sexy as such an acquisition might be for T-Mobile , Citi's Rollins says that such a pick-up would probably end T-Mobile 's growth and significantly dilute top-line revenue growth. Over the last year, T-Mobile 's shares are up 58.2% which is above the 55.9% rise pulled off by AT&T and the 10.33% gain that Verizon took on. The S&P 500 is up 7.2% over the same time span.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Some T-Mobile customers with older cellphone plans learned yesterday that their bills will see a $5-per-line increase beginning with their April or May bills. This comes after the company raised rates last June on other legacy plans.\n\nAccording to a memo obtained by CNET and written by Jon Freier, president of T-Mobile's consumer group, affected customers were notified on Thursday, March 13, of the rate hike. Only those who received a notice will see the increase. Exactly which plans are rolled into this action remains up in the air.\n\nFreier cites the \"rising costs over the past several years\" as the impetus behind the price push. Other carriers are facing the same headwinds, such as Verizon last December and this January, and AT&T last January and June.\n\nWhich legacy plans are getting the rate hike?\n\nBased on T-Mobile's communication to staff, it's unclear just which customers can expect to see $5 tacked onto their lines on upcoming statements. If you received a notification via text or email, T-Mobile's Plan Pricing Update 5LT page states that the change goes into effect April 2 and includes a few FAQs at the bottom.\n\nPeople who subscribe to T-Mobile's current lineup of plans -- Go5G, Go5G Plus and Go5G Next -- will not see this price change. The increase also does not apply to anyone with the company's Price Lock guarantee or a promotional free line on their account; the memo refers to the number of those unaffected by the increase as in the \"millions of customers.\"\n\nIn a Reddit r/tmobile megathread, customers have been chiming in with which plans they have and whether they received the notification. (In many instances, people say their plans seemed to be unaffected, only to then add something like, \"Edit: Never mind, just got the email.\") Plans mentioned include:\n\nMagenta Max\n\nT-Mobile One and One PlusSimple Choice\n\nSimple Choice\n\nOnePlus Promo Plan\n\nLegacy Sprint plans\n\nSeemingly contrary to T-Mobile's memo, some people report that their free lines are also gaining the $5 charge -- but that's offset by a $5 credit.\n\nAlthough T-Mobile says plans with \"Price Lock\" or the \"Un-contract Promise\" applied are not affected, some customers received the cost increase notification. According to the company's FAQs, the message appears to be that if you don't like the change, you can leave, and T-Mobile will cover some of the costs: \"[S]hould you decide to leave now, we will pay your final month's recurring service charge if you let us know within 60 days.\"\n\nThe Sprint plans were under an agreement in some states to not raise rates for a period of five years, which expires April 1, according to The Mobile Report; these new increases go into effect April 2.\n\nRead more: Our Guide to Switching Cellphone Carriers\n\nThis is the second line increase in a year\n\nEven removing current and free plans from the calculation, the number of affected customers is unknown. Apparently last June's increases were not applied to all legacy plans. Freier says in the memo that T-Mobile is completing the initiative begun last year.\n\nFreier also says that \"no line that received a prior increase will receive an additional adjustment as part of this initiative.\" So if you saw a $5 increase on your older plan last year, this change will not be added on top of that.\n\nThe memo notes that some people \"who had a price adjustment on products other than smartphones may have an adjustment on an older phone plan.\" That would include someone who saw a $2 increase last year on a cellular watch plan, for example. This new price increase wouldn't be added on top of that, but the $5 could be applied to another line on that account.\n\nEven if the rate increase is applied, T-Mobile says all the existing benefits and rate plan types will remain the same.\n\nIn the past, people had the option to contact customer support and push back against T-Mobile's attempt to move them onto newer, higher-priced plans, which ultimately led to the company walking back that strategy. But this increase, like the one last year, is automatically added to the affected accounts.",

At the time, the carrier increased rates by either $2 or $5 per month, depending on the plan. At the time, the increases affected customers on T-Mobile\u2019s Simple Choice Plan (released 2013), T-Mobile One Plan (released 2016), and T-Mobile\u2019s Magenta and Magenta Max plans (released 2019 and 2021, respectively). Some T-Mobile business customers were also affected.\n\nPeople on T-Mobile\u2019s current Go5G, Go5G Plus, and Go5G Next plans, along with those with T-Mobile\u2019s Price Lock guarantee, are unaffected.\n\nT-Mobile justified the price increase by stating that \u201ceven with these small updates, on average, T-Mobile customers pay less.\u201d\n\nWhich T-Mobile plans are affected?\n\nT-Mobile hasn\u2019t stated which plans are affected, so the overall impact remains a mystery. Based on complaints on Reddit, it seems Magenta MAX and T-Mobile ONE plans were primarily affected.\n\nCustomers were apparently directed through text to an FAQ on T-Mobile\u2019s website . The company doesn\u2019t list which plans are affected there either, but it does note that the carrier\u2019s Un-contract Promise is still in effect. Thus, anyone who\u2019s very unhappy about the rate increases has 60 days to notify T-Mobile that they\u2019re leaving, and T-Mobile says it will pay the final month of recurring charges.",

Approximately 76 million T-Mobile customers had their personal data \u2014 including names, addresses, and Social Security Numbers \u2014 compromised in the attack.\n\nAfter years of delays, the payments for that class action lawsuit will begin to reach customers starting in April, according to the settlement administrator.\n\nThose who are eligible to receive a payment should have been notified in 2022. The payment size will vary based on how much time and money a customer lost as a result of the data breach.\n\nThe largest payout is a $25,000 reimbursement, though that is reserved for people who \"spent money trying to avoid or recover from fraud or identity thefts that you believe was fairly traceable to the T-Mobile Data Breach.\"\n\nT-Mobile settled a class action lawsuit for $350 million in 2022. Now, three years later, the company is ready to send out payments to the class members (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nCustomers who didn't claim any out-of-pocket losses may still receive a portion of the settlement, it will just be significantly less than those who did. For example, if you did not claim any losses but could prove you were impacted by the breach, you might receive $25, or even $100 for those who lived in California at the time of the breach.\n\nEven that may be overstating how much money an individual receives, as those are the maximum payouts \u2014 most recipients will get less than even $25.\n\nA major chunk of the $350 million T-Mobile is paying will go to cover attorney fees and administrative expenses.\n\nOnce the legal fees are paid, customers who proved out-of-pocket losses will be prioritized. Once they have all received payments, the remainder of the money will be doled out on a \"pro rata basis\" to everyone else who was a T-Mobile customer at the time.\n\nThe claim submission deadline passed on January 23, 2023. Anyone who didn't file a claim by that date will not be receiving a payment from the class action lawsuit.",

            "content": "Some T-Mobile customers with older cellphone plans learned yesterday that their bills will see a $5-per-line increase beginning with their April or May bills. This comes after the company raised rates last June on other legacy plans.\n\nAccording to a memo obtained by CNET and written by Jon Freier, president of T-Mobile's consumer group, affected customers were notified on Thursday, March 13, of the rate hike. Only those who received a notice will see the increase. Exactly which plans are rolled into this action remains up in the air.\n\nFreier cites the \"rising costs over the past several years\" as the impetus behind the price push. Other carriers are facing the same headwinds, such as Verizon last December and this January, and AT&T last January and June.\n\nWhich legacy plans are getting the rate hike?\n\nBased on T-Mobile's communication to staff, it's unclear just which customers can expect to see $5 tacked onto their lines on upcoming statements. If you received a notification via text or email, T-Mobile's Plan Pricing Update 5LT page states that the change goes into effect April 2 and includes a few FAQs at the bottom.\n\nPeople who subscribe to T-Mobile's current lineup of plans -- Go5G, Go5G Plus and Go5G Next -- will not see this price change. The increase also does not apply to anyone with the company's Price Lock guarantee or a promotional free line on their account; the memo refers to the number of those unaffected by the increase as in the \"millions of customers.\"\n\nIn a Reddit r/tmobile megathread, customers have been chiming in with which plans they have and whether they received the notification. (In many instances, people say their plans seemed to be unaffected, only to then add something like, \"Edit: Never mind, just got the email.\") Plans mentioned include:\n\nMagenta Max\n\nT-Mobile One and One PlusSimple Choice\n\nSimple Choice\n\nOnePlus Promo Plan\n\nLegacy Sprint plans\n\nSeemingly contrary to T-Mobile's memo, some people report that their free lines are also gaining the $5 charge -- but that's offset by a $5 credit.\n\nAlthough T-Mobile says plans with \"Price Lock\" or the \"Un-contract Promise\" applied are not affected, some customers received the cost increase notification. According to the company's FAQs, the message appears to be that if you don't like the change, you can leave, and T-Mobile will cover some of the costs: \"[S]hould you decide to leave now, we will pay your final month's recurring service charge if you let us know within 60 days.\"\n\nThe Sprint plans were under an agreement in some states to not raise rates for a period of five years, which expires April 1, according to The Mobile Report; these new increases go into effect April 2.\n\nRead more: Our Guide to Switching Cellphone Carriers\n\nThis is the second line increase in a year\n\nEven removing current and free plans from the calculation, the number of affected customers is unknown. Apparently last June's increases were not applied to all legacy plans. Freier says in the memo that T-Mobile is completing the initiative begun last year.\n\nFreier also says that \"no line that received a prior increase will receive an additional adjustment as part of this initiative.\" So if you saw a $5 increase on your older plan last year, this change will not be added on top of that.\n\nThe memo notes that some people \"who had a price adjustment on products other than smartphones may have an adjustment on an older phone plan.\" That would include someone who saw a $2 increase last year on a cellular watch plan, for example. This new price increase wouldn't be added on top of that, but the $5 could be applied to another line on that account.\n\nEven if the rate increase is applied, T-Mobile says all the existing benefits and rate plan types will remain the same.\n\nIn the past, people had the option to contact customer support and push back against T-Mobile's attempt to move them onto newer, higher-priced plans, which ultimately led to the company walking back that strategy. But this increase, like the one last year, is automatically added to the affected accounts.",

The company\u2019s acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. It expects low-double-digit net revenue growth in 1Q25.\n\n\n\nThe accelerated adoption of digital and contactless solutions is providing an opportunity for its business to expedite its shift to the digital mode. Strong cash flow supports its growth initiatives and enables shareholder value-boosting efforts through repurchases and dividends. But, its dividend yield is lower than the industry average.\n\n\n\nGrowing operations will likely support a future rebound of MA\u2019s shares. Steep operating expenses might stress its margins in the future. The Zacks analyst expect adjusted operating costs to jump 13% in 2025. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. Also, the stock is overvalued than the industry.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>>)\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+58.0% vs. +41.5%).

Its acquisition strategy has significantly strengthened its position in the wireless industry over the past few years.\n\n\n\nTMUS\u2019 2.5 GHz 5G spectrum delivers superfast speeds and extensive coverage with signals that go through walls and trees. This boosts its competitive edge against companies that provide 5G networks controlled by the mmWave spectrum. Solid growth in free cash flow accentuates efficient capital management.\n\n\n\nHowever, owing to the stock\u2019s premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. Fierce competition is straining profitability. The high debt burden remains a major concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>)\n\n\n\nPetroleo Brasileiro\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-3.1% vs. +1.9%). The company is exposed to significant exposure to the volatile Brazilian real, and currency risk. Having said all of this, Petrobras is still reeling under huge debt burden cannot be overlooked.\n\n\n\nBeing a state-controlled entity, Petrobras also faces political and regulatory uncertainties. As such, Petrobras warrants a cautious stance at the moment. Nevertheless, Brazil's state-run oil and natural gas giant Petrobras is riding high on the back of its impressive portfolio, particularly in the country\u2019s pre-salt reservoirs.\n\n\n\nIt is the operator in most of these areas and holds interests in them ranging from 20% to 100%. This puts Petrobras in an enviable position to maintain an impressive production growth profile for years to come. Meanwhile, Petrobras is investing in renewable diesel and low-carbon projects, though its energy transition lags behind peers.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Petroleo Brasileiro here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Where Food Comes From have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Services - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-5.8% vs. -0.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $59.41million is facing risks which include cattle industry contraction, stagnant core revenue growth, rising SG&A expenses, reliance on Bitcoin-related gains and increasing competition in verification markets. Regulatory shifts and industry cyclicality add uncertainty to long-term growth.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Where Food Comes From maintains a strong gross margin (41.9% in 2024 versus 43.4% in 2023) despite inflationary pressures, supported by bundled verification services and expansion into high-margin sustainability audits.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s recurring revenue model (79.8% of 2024 sales) ensures stability, with high customer retention among more than 17,500 producers. A strong cash flow and a debt-free balance sheet enable strategic reinvestment and share buybacks (273,057 shares repurchased in 2024).

            "content": "Kerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nIf you're a T-Mobile customer, your rates might be on the rise.\n\nAfter announcing a price bump less than a year ago, the mobile carrier is doing it again -- and once again, it's affecting customers on older plans.\n\nAlso: Want free Starlink satellite texting? T-Mobile's got a deal, but there's a catch\n\nAccording to an internal memo to T-Mobile employees obtained by CNET, some legacy plans (plans that aren't offered to new subscribers but are still available to existing subscribers) will see a $5 per-line increase starting April 2, 2025. Since these legacy plans are retired, it means those subscribers are among the company's most loyal and long-term. T-Mobile blamed the increase on \"rising costs.\"\n\nLegacy plans will see the increase\n\nLegacy plans include offerings like Magenta, Magenta MAX, Magenta 55+, ONE, and Simple Choice, but it's not clear which of these will see the increase. The new rates will not impact current plans like Go5G Next, Go5G Plus, and Essentials.\n\nAlso: The best phones\n\nIf this increase affects you, you'll receive a text from T-Mobile as soon as March 13. \"For the first time in nearly a decade,\" the text reads, \"we're making an update to the price of some of our older monthly service plans.\" If you don't get a notification today, your rates aren't going up.\n\nThere is some good news\n\nJon Freier, president of T-Mobile's consumer group, apparently wrote in the memo that no line that received an increase as part of last year's bump will see another increase this time. If you were affected by the $5 hike last May, you should be unscathed this time.\n\nAll existing plans should stay the same for now.\n\nAlso: Sign up for T-Mobile 5G home internet and get a $300 gift card free\n\nT-Mobile says that if your plan falls under the \"Un-contract Promise,\" which guarantees your rates won't increase, it will pay your final month's recurring service charge if you decide to leave (as long as you let the company know within 60 days).",

            "content": "Good news for investors: Telecom stocks aren't as expensive as you might think.\n\nTelecom stocks were in a funk earlier this week, with shares of Verizon (VZ -0.32%), AT&T (T 1.88%), and T-Mobile (TMUS -1.20%) all tumbling on Tuesday, after comments from Verizon chief revenue officer Frank Boulben, given at a Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference, caused telecommunications sectors to freak out just a little bit.\n\nGiven a few days to digest the news, however, investors seem to have concluded today that things aren't quite as bleak as they seem. As of 11 a.m. ET, all three stocks are bouncing back, with Verizon gaining 1.8%, AT&T up 1.9%, and T-Mobile doing best of all with a 2.5% gain.\n\nHow Verizon spooked the market\n\nAs Reuters reported Tuesday, Verizon exec Boulben commented that Verizon is trying to ratchet back promotional activity to shore up its profits, but some of its rivals are going in the other direction, leading to \"elevated ... competitive intensity\" and more price competition in the sector (read: a price war).\n\nVerizon warned that this could lead to \"soft\" wireless subscriber growth for it in Q1 2025. Industry analysts were quick to chime in, predicting that mobile subscriber growth seems to be slowing in general, and warning that if telecoms focus too much on stealing customers from each other, rather than growing the market and adding value generally, this won't be great for profits.\n\nAnd of course, continuing worries about the effects of President Trump's tariffs didn't help matters.\n\nWorries subside\n\nIt's hard to see how raising tariffs on physical goods imports into the U.S., however, is going to have too much of an effect upon U.S. providers of wireless phone services. While tariffs might raise the cost of importing new phones for subscribers, they can presumably use their existing phones just as easily -- and spend the same amount of time talking, texting, and surfing the internet with them, for that matter, all of which generates revenue for AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile just the same as before.\n\nAt the same time, inflation worries seem to be subsiding, with the most recent inflation report coming in cooler than expected, and today's Bureau of Labor Statistics producer price index was flat against January.\n\nInvestors may also be weighing the potential for new forms of telecommunications services, notably direct-to-cell satellite communications from companies such as SpaceX Starlink and AST SpaceMobile, to help grow the telecom business generally. The easier it is to use cellphones, after all, the more likely people are going to be to use them, and to pay for them.\n\nAnd with their plans to use satellites to eliminate cellphone dead zones, Starlink and AST are making this easier than ever before.\n\nMake the call: Which telecom stock would you buy?\n\nAll that really leaves us to do, therefore, as investors, is decide: Which telecom stock should I buy? Are any of them bargains?\n\nLet's take a quick look at the numbers:\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Five-Year Projected Growth Rate Dividend Yield Net Debt AT&T 16.9 1.2% 4.3% $142.5 billion T-Mobile 25.8 20.3% 1.4% $109.5 billion Verizon 10.2 2% 6.4% $167.5 billion\n\nCrunching the numbers, AT&T stands out as probably the most overvalued telecom stock. While expected to outgrow Verizon slightly, AT&T pays an inferior dividend yield and costs significantly more than Verizon.\n\nThat leaves investors with two stocks to choose from. If you're more of a growth investor, T-Mobile will probably appeal to you more with its superior projected growth rate offsetting its relatively high valuation. More conservative, value-oriented and income-desiring investors, on the other hand, may find the cheap P/E ratio and generous dividend yield at Verizon more attractive.\n\nEither way, I have to say that investors who are buying back these stocks today appear to have noticed something sooner than the rest of us: Telecom stocks, as a group, are not overpriced after all. In fact, whether you're a growth investor, a value investor, or a dividend investor, there's very likely a \"right\" telecom stock for you.",

A significant announcement was the multi-year agreement with New York Mobile, which leverages T-Mobile's 5G infrastructure to introduce a premium MVNO service. This emphasizes customer identity and customizability, setting a strong market position. Additionally, T-Mobile's technological advancements, such as the debut of an automated ball-strike system during MLB spring training games using its private 5G network, highlight its innovative edge. The company's robust financial performance, marked by increased revenue and net income, further bolstered investor confidence. In a broader context, technology stocks saw a rally prompted by recent inflation data, which might have indirectly supported T-Mobile's positive momentum. Meanwhile, the overall market has eased by 3.7% in the past week, contrasting with the company's upward trajectory during this period.\n\nClick to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings in T-Mobile US' financial health report.\n\nNasdaqGS:TMUS Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nReady To Venture Into Other Investment Styles? Trump's latest tariffs commencing in March 2025 are putting pressure on the stock market. Discover which defensive stocks and companies with strong pricing power and economic moats are the best positioned to withstand the trade war.\n\nOver the past five years, T-Mobile US has achieved a total shareholder return of 235.61%, a substantial increase. Key factors influencing this growth include the company\u2019s strategic focus on expanding its 5G network capabilities and innovative partnerships. Notably, in March 2021, T-Mobile invested over US$9.3 billion in the FCC's C-Band auction, enhancing mid-band spectrum for superior 5G service. This move aligned with their reputation for robust infrastructure development.\n\nAdditionally, T-Mobile's focus on shareholder value is underscored by consistent dividend payouts, such as the recent dividend of US$0.88 per share declared in March 2025. Another critical development was T-Mobile's addition to the S&P 100 index in March 2021, reflecting broad market confidence. Despite a high Price-To-Earnings Ratio, T-Mobile has maintained accelerated earnings growth, exceeding industry rates, contributing to its long-term rise. This financial performance contrasts with the company's underperformance relative to the Wireless Telecom industry over the past year.\n\nIs T-Mobile US part of your asset mix?

A big Magenta announcement happening this week was already alluded to in a Reddit post that's been mysteriously deleted a few hours after its publication late last night.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat strongly suggests nothing good will come out of this secretive announcement, which is where a source with T-Mobile 's leadership comes in.\n\nShould you brace yourself for a price hike?\n\n\n\n\n\nT-Mobile insider who reached out to us on the condition of anonymity, there's about a 70 percent chance that a price increase will be confirmed tomorrow and come into effect at some point next month. Probably. After all, CEO Mike Sievert himself hinted a little while back that something like this could happen sooner or later . What you may not have realized is just how imminent the move would be following that statement. According to theinsider who reached out to us on the condition of anonymity, there's about a 70 percent chance that a price increase will be confirmed tomorrow and come into effect at some point next month.\n\n\n\nReceive the latest T-Mobile news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\nThis prediction is based on private discussions with several employees, almost all of whom share the feeling that they're being prepared to deal with a massive wave of customer complaints starting Thursday, March 13. The feeling that a new price hike is in the cards is actually nothing new, but the incentives and overtime pay offered across multiple departments this week suggest a storm is brewing essentially as we speak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur source's suspicions were initially raised last year, when they were made privy to a number of internal training documents that mentioned the same date - April 2025. Apparently, the \"Un-carrier\" is only obligated under the terms of its 2020 merger agreement to \"honor certain legacy Sprint plans\" until next month, and if history is any indication, that almost surely means those plans will have their monthly rates increased... in April.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we can't publicly reveal these documents for fear of outing our source (and the source's sources), so you'll just have to trust us when we tell you that they look legit.\n\n\n\n\n\nmay be able to escape T-Mobile 's next price hike if you were not a Sprint subscriber first. Meanwhile, if you asked to be migrated from your Sprint plan to a similar T-Mobile option after the merger or the migration process was done automatically through the The good news in all of this is that yoube able to escape's next price hike if you were not a Sprint subscriber first. Meanwhile, if you asked to be migrated from your Sprint plan to a similaroption after the merger or the migration process was done automatically through the Magenta Complete program , you should probably start saving up.\n\nCan tomorrow's announcement be about something else?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, there is definitely still a chance that T-Mobile will not announce a price increase for anyone... just yet. But the timing of these incentives offered to customer care employees simply fits that April 2025 cutoff date for Magenta Complete plans too nicely for it all to be a coincidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne possibility bandied about by an employee is that T-Mo could pair the price hike news with an announcement of a \"Starlink plan\" of some sort, which would obviously increase the volume of customer care calls even further while potentially reducing the online negativity and bitterness surrounding the operator's latest profit-hungry change.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Starlink access already set to be included in the top-of-the-line Go5G Next plan for free and cost $15 a month on \"any other plan\", it's unclear how such a move would work, but until we hear directly from T-Mobile , we should probably keep all options on the table and rule nothing out (negative or positive).\n\nIf you're a T-Mobile customer who was not impacted by last year's price increases , I may have some bad news for you today. If you were migrated from Sprint toat any point after the two finalized their mega-merger back in 2020, the probability of your monthly costs going up soon are unfortunately extremely high.",

It\u2019s a blow to AT&T and Verizon, which had argued that increased emissions could degrade the performance of their terrestrial networks.\n\nAnd perhaps most intriguing to those watching the wireless vs. Elon Musk spectrum wars, it\u2019s another vote of confidence for the SpaceX owner and billionaire who contributed millions of dollars to President Trump\u2019s campaign and now serves in a unique position overseeing Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nWhat just happened?\n\nIn its opposition to the waiver, AT&T had argued that based on a network performance analysis, the higher power levels would result in an 18% reduction in average network throughput on AT&T\u2019s service. Verizon and EchoStar also opposed the waiver.\n\nIn its analysis, the FCC said SpaceX provided engineering analysis in support of its claim that harmful interference in adjacent bands is unlikely to occur. In addition, T-Mobile provided its own technical analysis in which it concludes the waiver poses a low likelihood of harmful interference.\n\nIf harmful interference occurs, SpaceX must immediately address it or it won\u2019t be able to continue operating under the waiver.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nOf course, everybody is watching to see how much the U.S. government hands over to Elon Musk, who enjoys a unique position next to President Trump.\n\nRelated Carriers prepare for battle to fill US spectrum pipeline\n\nFierce asked Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics, for his take on the latest development.\n\n\u201cElon gets the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Entner said. \u201cThe temporary order says that Starlink will have to adjust if there is an impact. If AT&T and others actually can show that their modeling of an 18% capacity hit on their network is anywhere near that, we\u2019ll find out how strong Elon\u2019s power actually is.\u201d\n\n\n\nZooming out\n\nFierce caught up with T-Mobile Chief Network Officer Ankur Kapoor during Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona last week, so we couldn\u2019t resist connecting the dots here. Our conversation took place before Friday\u2019s FCC decision.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s D2D service is now in beta, where \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of customers signed up for it.\n\n\u201cIt was great because half the customers that signed up for that were actually non-T-Mobile customers,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re getting a lot of interest from our competitors.\u201d\n\nRoughly 500,000 square miles of land mass in United States are not covered by terrestrial networks and the satellite-powered service aims to serve those areas \u2013 for example, hikers in the middle of the woods.\n\n\u201cWe think we can actually solve that customer pain point. The technology needs to advance a lot, but we think we have the best partner in the industry on that with SpaceX,\u201d Kapoor said.\n\nCurrently, they\u2019re offering texting and picture messaging. Eventually, the ambition is to move beyond that, to voice and low-impact data services. But video certainly is not imminent.\n\n\u201cI think we are probably some time away from when you can sit on a non-terrestrial network and watch a YouTube video or a Netflix movie. I hope someday we get there,\u201d he said, suggesting that might be where 6G comes in and terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks are closer entwined.\n\n\u201cBut right now, our focus is mostly on the on the messaging and the voice applications as well as skinny data,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that carriers like T-Mobile maintain that satellites can\u2019t replace terrestrial networks. For example, satellite connectivity isn\u2019t appropriate for serving dense downtown areas with tall buildings that block satellite signals and areas where people tend to gather in high volumes.\n\n\u201cIf you look at how much spectrum we have on our SpaceX service right now, it's a fraction of what we have on the traditional network,\u201d Kapoor noted. \u201cThe capacity is thousands of times less than what we have on the traditional network. But it does great because these are places where a very small number of people go.\u201d",

Class action lawsuits offer groups of people, or 'classes,' a way to band together in court. These suits are often brought by one or a few people who allege a company or other entity has wronged a large group of people. When a suit becomes a class action, it extends to all \"class members,\" or people who may have similar complaints to those who filed the suit. Companies often settle class actions - offering payment to class members who typically waive their right to pursue further legal action by accepting money. These payout agreements frequently include statements by the defendant denying wrongdoing. Companies tend to settle class actions to avoid the costs of further litigation. Pollution, discrimination, or false advertising are a few examples of what can land a class action on a company's doorstep.\n\nThat would include credit monitoring, identity theft, or fraud expenses and potentially up to $25 per hour of lost time.\n\nWITHOUT PROOF\n\nThose who didn't have any documentation when they filed the claim form are only eligible for $25 or $100 if they are a California resident.\n\nAll eligible claimants were also awarded two years of identity protection services via Pango, which includes TransUnion credit monitoring, dark web monitoring, and $1 million in identity theft insurance among several benefits.\n\nRestoration services were also provided for those who specifically suffered identity theft or fraud from the T-Mobile data breach.\n\nMore details and other information can be found on the settlement website.\n\nAmericans should also remain aware of other recent settlements.\n\nFor example, distributions of $5,000 from a \"publishing\" settlement are available to eligible claimants who filed a form by March 9, 2025.\n\nA \"tractor\" settlement is also sending out $1,100 payments from a $31.9 million pot to those who qualify.",

The company has been trying to make users less dependent on in-store purchases and instead pushing to opt for its T-Life app. This transition, however, did not sit well with consumers, who started sharing their frustration over the constant push for the app, and some even warned about switching over amidst the ongoing push. While the attempts by the telecommunications service providers to improve users' experiences did not go as expected, the company did not stop there and is now making it easier for consumers to identify authorized retailers from other third-party retailers.\n\nT-Mobile has now found a way to differentiate independently run stores from authorized retailers to enhance transparency with customers\n\nHave you ever been in a situation where you walked into a store and were unsure if it was an authorized retailer but ended up getting the transaction done regardless? This situation has often left customers with an unpleasant and inconsistent experience. T-Mobile, in the past, had to deal with issues of this category and had to bring changes to the structure by some of the dealers. However, it understands that it could end up in a bigger problem on account of any third-party retailers acting on the company's behalf.\n\nTo improve user experience and avoid any future complications, the carrier provider is taking a major step to draw a line between corporate and third-party stores by requiring authorized retailers to put up a sign in order to indicate the legitimacy of the store. Some of the users did take notice of it and shared about the change on Reddit and other platforms. T-Mobile is not taking the decision lightly, as it warned the stores that they might be shut down if they fail to put up signs that clearly indicate the type of stores.\n\nWhile this might lead to sales of the telecommunication service provider going down, it does reflect its commitment to ensuring that users do not have to go through an ill experience and the standards are maintained so that it does not end up getting into trouble on account of the actions of an independent store. The company had been taking incremental steps previously by announcing, for instance, that the freebies could only be collected from the stores owned by the company. But this step marks a huge leap in its attempts to ensure a consistent store experience and better transparency.\n\nT-Mobile is taking a strict approach and making it easier for customers to tell apart third-party stores from authorized retailers, emphasizing the company's ongoing efforts. However, it is yet to be seen how this step would help the carrier in the short term, whether it would be detrimental to the company's overall sales, or the transparency would help with gaining users' trust and avoiding any future problems.",

            "content": "By Foster Nicholas | Sports Editor\n\nOvercoming a 13-point second-half deficit, No. 2 Baylor women\u2019s basketball had a 3-point look with three seconds left to force overtime in the Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship finals Sunday at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nBut the number three wasn\u2019t lucky for the Bears (27-7), as senior center Aaronette Vonleh\u2019s triple bounced off the front iron, allowing TCU to sink a pair of free throws and run out the clock on their third win over Baylor this season, 64-59.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we were effective at either end of the floor, and I thought we just clipped along,\u201d head coach Nicki Collen said. \u201cTurned into a really good basketball game. I really thought Netty (Aaronette Vonleh) was going to make that three, and we would be playing overtime.\u201d\n\nThe green and gold forced 20 turnovers \u2014 the most the Horned Frogs (31-3) committed in a Big 12 game this year \u2014 but converted them into just 11 points. Vonleh again led the way with 20 points on 8-for-18 shooting with six rebounds. Graduate guard Sarah Andrews (13) and senior guard Yaya Felder (12) also finished with double figures.\n\n\u201cThe biggest takeaway is we have what it takes to play against really good teams and beat them,\u201d Vonleh said. \u201cI think there is this little switch that has to go off in our heads, and we\u2019re going to work toward that. We have what it takes in our locker room to win against anybody, and we just have to believe that.\u201d\n\nPicking up where she left off after a career-high 37-point game in the semifinals, Vonleh scored Baylor\u2019s first points. But the hot start wasn\u2019t indicative of what was in store for her first half, as she shot 1-for-6 in the quarter. The Horned Frogs traded baskets early and doubled up first quarter rebounds to take a 15-11 lead after 10 minutes.\n\nAfter a TCU 3-pointer opened the second quarter, the Bears forced six straight turnovers but only scored two points off of them. Baylor forced 14 turnovers in the first half \u2014 more than the Horned Frogs gave away in the quarterfinals and semifinals. However, due to a lack of scoring and two Madison Connor 3-pointers, Collen called a timeout with the deficit at 26-15 with 3:34 on the clock.\n\nBaylor made just three baskets in the second quarter, allowing the top-seeded Horned Frogs to take a 30-19 lead into halftime. Vonleh and junior forward Bella Fontleroy picked up two fouls early, playing just 10 and eight minutes in the first half, respectively.\n\nFontleroy played only two minutes in the third quarter before picking up two more fouls and returning to the bench. Vonleh, on the other hand, found her groove. The center pinned Sedona Prince in the paint and made her first three second-half buckets, pulling Baylor within seven midway through the third.\n\nFelder scored 10 of her 12 points to close the quarter, but the Bears still trailed 51-43 heading into the fourth. Baylor scored five more points in the third quarter (24) than in the first half (19).\n\n\u201cThis team was great,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe battled back from down at halftime. I\u2019m going to give us a day to hang our head on it. But at 11:59, 12:00 tonight, it\u2019s time to move on and get ready for the NCAA Tournament.\u201d\n\nIn her final Big 12 tournament game, Andrews wasn\u2019t ready to give up without a fight. The graduate guard scored six quick points, and with 3 1/2 minutes left in the game, Vonleh tossed up a layup to tie the game at 57-all. But TCU\u2019s all-conference stars punched back.\n\nPrince, who finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds, converted a layup, and graduate guard Hailey Van Lith extended the lead to four with a blow-by layup with 48 seconds left. Hounded by a double team all night, Van Lith made all 10 of her free throws and finished with 20 points.\n\nAfter a Baylor miss, TCU needed to hold onto the ball to clinch a win, but tight defense forced Van Lith out of bounds, allowing one more opportunity. Back against the wall, Vonleh made a layup with 11 seconds left, and both teams used timeouts. Now forced to foul, Baylor sent Connor to the line, where she made 1-of-2 from the stripe, setting up a three-point game.\n\nDrawing up a play similar to Vonleh\u2019s layup, the post took a pass behind the arc and didn\u2019t hesitate on a straightaway triple. Right on line, her shot grazed off the front of the rim \u2014 just a fraction short of sending the game to overtime. After two more TCU free throws, it was over; the Horned Frogs won their second Big 12 title deciding game over the Bears in one week, 64-59.\n\n\u201cI know analytically, maybe, it looks like I wouldn\u2019t do that, but I think it was the easiest way to get a clean look for three,\u201d Collen said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen Netty make a lot of those. We made her shoot \u2019em in preseason a lot, and I\u2019ve seen her knock down a lot of them.\u201d\n\nThe Bears will eagerly await their March Madness seeding and determine whether they will host the first two rounds in Waco during the NCAA Division I women\u2019s basketball tournament selection show at 7 p.m. on March 16 on ESPN.",

            "content": "Seemingly overnight, we've seen a rise in the 5G home internet takeover. It's become an attractive option for internet customers around the country. One report found that 89% of new broadband subscriptions over the past two years came from just two 5G providers: T-Mobile and Verizon. So when AT&T threw its hat in the ring last year and launched AT&T Internet Air, I was excited -- but quickly disappointed -- to see how it compared.\n\nI have as friendly a testing environment as you\u2019ll ever find for an internet provider. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment, and the list of connected devices I own is shockingly short: just my iPhone SE, Apple TV 4K and MacBook Pro that I use to work from home. That's not much strain to put on a Wi-Fi network, and even so, AT&T Internet Air couldn\u2019t handle it.\n\nThat's why I have a hard time recommending the service to anyone. AT&T\u2019s wireless internet connection consistently delivered download speeds below 10Mbps -- a far cry from the 90 to 300Mbps it advertises. That said, wireless internet speeds are more dependent on location than wired options like cable and fiber, so your experience may be much better than mine was. (Users on AT&T\u2019s sub-reddit reported speeds in the 150 to 300Mbps range.)\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nThere were things I liked about AT&T Internet Air -- namely, the easy setup and useful app -- but that\u2019s like saying I like everything about a car except the fact that it can\u2019t go above 25 miles an hour. Internet providers have one job -- to deliver a fast, reliable connection -- and on that front, AT&T Internet Air was an unequivocal bust.\n\nRead more: The best internet providers for 2025\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nJoe Supan / CNET\n\nSetting up AT&T Internet Air\n\nAll in all, it only took me 11 minutes to set up AT&T Internet Air. It truly couldn\u2019t have been simpler. The box only comes with two items: a gateway device and a power outlet. I followed the instructions in the box, downloaded AT&T\u2019s Smart Home Manager app and scanned the QR code on the device.\n\nThe app suggested that I place the gateway device near a window and facing west if possible. I was able to find a spot that checked both boxes near my desk, where I\u2019d need the strongest internet speeds possible. Once I\u2019d landed on a location, the app ran a quick test and gave me the approval. I was now ready to test out the connection.\n\nAT&T Internet Air speed and reliability\n\nThere\u2019s no way around it: AT&T Internet Air\u2019s speeds were incredibly disappointing and basically unusable for most people. It boils down to the advertised speeds versus the actual speeds you get.\n\nAfter dozens of speed tests throughout the week, it averaged a download speed of 5.86Mbps and 9.87Mbps upload. The highest download speed I got at any point was 10.63Mbps, while upload speeds peaked at 14.38Mbps. At the same time, my $50 Connect More plan through Xfinity -- advertised as 300Mbps download -- returned average speeds of 321/109Mbps.\n\nAT&T Internet Air\u2019s latency was also very high, with an average ping rate of 298ms. That\u2019s bad news if you plan on doing any online gaming, where 40ms or lower is considered ideal.\n\nAT&T says that users typically experience download speeds between 90 and 300Mbps and upload speeds between 8 and 30Mbps. My upload speeds fell within that range, but I never came close to 90Mbps download. The highest I got was 14.38Mbps. (I used Ookla for all of my speed tests, which is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nWireless internet like AT&T Internet Air or T-Mobile Home Internet is inherently more erratic than a wired connection like cable or fiber. Because it transmits data wirelessly from a cellular tower, it\u2019s more vulnerable to network congestion and weather disruption. That\u2019s why router placement is particularly important -- if you don\u2019t have a clear line to the nearest tower, your internet connection will suffer.\n\nBut I did have a clear line. I was able to find a spot for the router right against a window that faced west, just as I was instructed during setup. The problem didn\u2019t seem to be the location of my home, either: AT&T\u2019s coverage map shows the entire city of Seattle blanketed in 5G Plus speeds, which it describes as its fastest tier.\n\nAT&T\u2019s coverage map indicates that I should have been able to access AT&T\u2019s fastest speed tier. AT&T\n\nI tried moving the router to a few different locations over the course of testing, but speeds never improved. In fact, it got even slower when I moved it to another room or away from the window. AT&T recommended calling customer support to help determine the best spot for the device based on where the closest cell tower is.\n\nWireless internet providers like AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon all include a caveat in the fine print that says they may temporarily slow your speeds if the network is congested. That might explain my test results if they were all happening at \u201cinternet rush hour\u201d -- the hours between 7 and 11 p.m. when traffic is highest. But I tested AT&T Internet Air at various times throughout the day and never saw much of a difference.\n\nHow was it using AT&T Internet Air?\n\nIf anyone can get by with slow internet speeds, it\u2019s me. I live alone, and I don\u2019t do any bandwidth-stressing activities like online gaming. I only have three devices connected to the internet: my phone, laptop and streaming device.\n\nBut even with that minimal setup, AT&T Internet Air struggled to pull its weight. Zoom meetings at work were reliably unreliable, to the point where I had to switch back over to my Xfinity connection several times. Working in Google Docs, the connection would routinely drop out, causing me to wait a few seconds before I could continue writing this review.\n\nAT&T Internet Air\u2019s range was basically limited to the room with the router. When I ran speed tests in my bedroom -- one wall away from the router -- my connection slowed to around 1Mbps download and upload.\n\nIt was a frustrating experience, and I found myself switching back over to Xfinity or cellular data on my phone every time I wanted to do something like watch a YouTube video from the group chat or take a FaceTime call.\n\nI don\u2019t need gig speeds -- I probably don\u2019t even really need 100Mbps speeds -- but I do need at least 15Mbps, which is what Netflix recommends for streaming in 4K. Unfortunately, AT&T Internet Air failed to clear even that low bar.\n\nHow does AT&T Internet Air compare to other 5G internet providers?\n\n5G home internet has taken off over the past few years, and AT&T is later to the party than competitors like T-Mobile Home Internet and Verizon 5G Home Internet. In general, using 5G technology for home internet has been an unequivocal success. The latest survey from J.D. Power released over the summer found that customer satisfaction is higher for wireless customers than cable or fiber, even though it received lower performance scores.\n\n\u201cA lot of the concerns I had heard about fixed wireless access were that it's just never going to be as fast as fiber,\u201d Carl Lepper, senior director of the technology, media and telecommunications intelligence practice at J.D. Power, told me at the time.\n\n\u201cBut for a lot of people, affordability trumps that. And it\u2019s not often that you need superfast speeds, depending on how you're using your internet.\u201d\n\n5G home internet often reaches rural households where cable and fiber aren\u2019t available, and it\u2019s a significant step up from the satellite or DSL service that those users are typically stuck with. And because 5G providers are cellphone carriers first and foremost, they offer significant savings when you bundle home internet with a cellphone plan.\n\nProvider Monthly price Advertised download speeds Advertised upload speeds AT&T Internet Air\n\nRead full review $60 ($47 with an eligible AT&T wireless plan) 90-300Mbps 8-30Mbps T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review $50-$70 ($30-$50 with cellphone plan) 87-415Mbps 12-56Mbps Verizon 5G Home Internet\n\nRead full review $50-$70 ($35-$55 with qualifying Verizon 5G mobile plans) 300-1,000Mbps 20-75Mbps Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nThose savings aren\u2019t quite as significant with AT&T as they are with T-Mobile and Verizon, but paying $47 a month for home internet is still a solid deal. If you\u2019re not bundling with a cellphone plan, AT&T Internet Air is on the expensive side, and there\u2019s no guarantee that it will make up for it with faster speeds -- as my week with AT&T showed.\n\nThe final verdict: AT&T Internet Air could still be useful for some\n\nAfter those disappointing results, you might be surprised to learn that I still wouldn\u2019t swear off AT&T Internet Air completely. Other customers have clearly gotten faster speeds than I did -- Reddit users regularly report speeds north of 700Mbps -- and there\u2019s a chance my apartment is just in a particularly bad location for the service.\n\nUnlike T-Mobile Home Internet, there\u2019s no free trial with AT&T Internet Air, so you\u2019ll be out at least $60 if you sign up and find out the speeds aren\u2019t fast enough. I\u2019d still recommend going with T-Mobile or Verizon first if you want to try out 5G home internet, but AT&T Internet is still worth a shot if you\u2019re stuck with limited options.\n\nI Tried AT&T Internet Air for a Week FAQs:\n\nWhat is AT&T Internet Air? AT&T Internet Air is a 5G fixed wireless connection that offers a singular plan. Pricing starts at $60 monthly or $47 if you bundle it with an eligible AT&T wireless plan. In areas where AT&T's faster fiber service is unavailable, this fixed wireless option could be an alternative for some.\n\nIs AT&T Internet Air fast? AT&T Internet Air advertises download speeds of 90 to 300Mbps and upload speeds of 8 to 30Mbps. However, after conducting a dozen speed tests at home, my actual speeds were significantly lower than what was advertised. The highest speed I was able to reach for upload was 14.38Mbps, which is on the lower end of that range. With AT&T Internet Air, I only averaged 5.86Mbps download and 9.87Mbps upload. Compared to other 5G providers, Verizon and T-Mobile advertise much faster speeds, topping out at 415 and 1,000Mbps, respectively. However, it's worth noting that even if you get faster speeds at your home with a 5G fixed wireless connection, your speeds can be temporarily slowed down during network congestion. In addition, AT&T's latency is very high, which can be pretty bad if you're a gamer. The average ping rate that I received at home was 298ms. For online gaming, your ping rate should be 50ms or lower.",

            "content": "by Aaron Baar , Staff Writer, August 30, 2016\n\nThink about how \u2014 and especially where \u2014 you\u2019re using smartphones and tablets. When you\u2019re moving from one place to another, certainly. In \u201csnackable\u201d moments \u2014 such as a coffee shop or grocery-store line \u2014 when you have a minute of idle time. And, sadly, despite the warnings, you\u2019re probably using them in your cars.\n\nVery often, however, you\u2019re probably using your smartphone at home. It\u2019s faster than booting up a traditional computer, and it\u2019s right in the palm of your hand.\n\nIndeed, a recent survey of more than 1,000 adults by Burke for the Local Search Association found that 56% of mobile searches were happening from home. Additionally, 57% of those searchers were looking for \u201cgeneral information,\u201d suggesting they were just beginning to search online.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nYet, a shocking number of companies are still slow to get on the mobile-first, mobile-everywhere bandwagon. A separate audit from the LSA found that of 170,000 small- and medium-sized businesses, nearly half (49%) weren\u2019t mobile-ready. Even among larger brands, 80% don\u2019t have a long-term mobile-strategy, and of them nearly a quarter had no mobile strategy whatsoever, according to Econsultancy/Adobe\u2019s \u201cTaking Advantage of the Mobile Opportunity\u201d report.\n\nThis, despite the fact that Google has been factoring mobile friendliness in its Web site rankings for just over a year. While Google has said 85% of Web sites are now mobile friendly (and that it will soon be removing the \u201cmobile friendly\u201d designation from the results), the numbers above seem to indicate otherwise.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of statistics showing how much more we\u2019re using smartphones and tablets over laptops and desktops. The International Business Times last year noted that 20% of Millennials rely exclusively on tablets and smartphones to access the Internet. ComScore earlier this year said the mobile channel represents 65% of all digital media time.\n\nThese statistics are only going to grow. The time has come to begin thinking about mobile as more than just another part of the marketing mix. With so many consumers using these devices exclusively and in places where they had previously considered using laptops, it\u2019s time for mobile to move into a pace as the primary gateway of consumer contact. Everything \u2014 Web sites, emails, video, and especially search \u2014 need to be more than \u201cmobile-optimized\u201d or \u201cmobile first.\u201d They need to be mobile-primary.",

Ankalaev was much more confident and forward in the second, landing several sharp punches throughout the frame before wobbling \u201cPoatan\u201d along the fence just before the end of the round. The third was close and competitive, featuring no big moments and each man having small success, with Pereira getting back on the low kicks and Ankalaev staying punch-heavy, connecting a few times and just missing with a couple other heaters.\n\nAs we hit the championship rounds, Ankalaev opted to close the distance and clinch with conviction for the first time in the bout, leaning on Pereira along the fence, and continuing to bring the fight to the champion after they were separated, with Pereira showing signs of fatigue. In the fifth, Ankalaev opted to stay in space early and the champion had some success, connecting with a high kick that dazed the challenger and landing enough supplemental strikes to seemingly take the round.\n\nThe duo went the distance and when the scorecards were totalled, it was the challenger that emerged victorious, earning the nod on all three scorecards to dethrone the Brazilian finisher. Ankalaev has now won three straight and extended his unbeaten run to 14 with this victory.\n\nThis was a competitive bout between the top two talents in the division, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see them run it back later in the year.\n\nPrelim Results | Official Scorecards",

While some third-party locations displayed notices inside to inform customers they weren't owned by, others kept users in the dark. This was becoming a problem forSince stores owned byare under the supervision of the company, they are usually better managed and customers often report having a better experience at corporate-owned stores.Third-party locations, on the other hand, are governed by their own policies. Some of them, notably Arch Telecom , have been found to engage in deceptive practices , and this reflects badly on T-Mobile This might be why the company has decided to distance itself from independently-owned locations. If something went wrong, it would be easier for the company to wash its hands of it.Another problem with authorized retailers is that they are generally not as willing as corporate stores to take responsibility when something goes wrong, such as when a customer has a device issue.has been working towards creating a distinction between corporate and third-party stores for months. For instance, in September, it was reported that T-Mobile Tuesdays freebies could only be collected from stores owned and operated by the company . Also, a year ago, it changed the compensation structure for some dealers At the same time, the company is working to educate and encourage its customers to use the T Life app instead of visiting stores, whether corporate or third-party. Aexec had previously said that the company wanted to move most transactions online , making many wonder if it would ultimately scale back its physical presence.A sign making it clear which stores are run independently is going to help customers make informed choices.is said to be pretty strict about the implementation and has warned that stores that don't put up a sign indicating their type would be shut down.It remains to be seen how this is going to go, with one person predicting that it might cause sales to tank.",

The Bears defeated Oklahoma State 84-74 in overtime later Saturday.\n\nWest Virginia (24-7) got two early three-pointers from Kylee Blacksten to aid in a solid start that saw the Mountaineers hold an 11-7 lead.\n\nThat\u2019s when TCU ran off eight straight points, including triples from Donovan Hunter and Hailey Vin Lith.\n\nThe Mountaineers trailed 17-13 after one quarter and were still down four when JJ Quinerly hit a jumper 7:17 before halftime.\n\nTCU then scored 11 straight points, a stretch that saw both Agnes Emma-Nnopu and Madison Conner connect from long range. The Horned Frogs led 34-19 at that point and 40-25 at halftime and entered the break shooting better than 50 percent (15 for 29).\n\nWVU entered the third quarter shooting 9 for 26, but made 8-of-16 shots over the first 10 minutes of the second half, including two treys from Jordan Harrison in the final 2:23 of the frame to cut the Mountaineer deficit to 52-47.\n\nThe Horned Frogs scored the first five points of the fourth, which they began on a 10-3 spurt to create separation.\n\nWVU countered with its own 7-0 run, getting buckets from Kyah Watson, Harrison and Quinerly, the latter of which made it 62-57 with 3:38 left.\n\nConner\u2019s three with 2:46 remaining was perhaps the game\u2019s most pivotal basket, and WVU never got closer than six the rest of the way save for the final margin.\n\n\u201cYou draw off these experiences,\u201d Kellogg said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty throughout the year and these feel like NCAA Tournament-type games. That feels like a Sweet 16, Elite 8-type game. Hopefully we\u2019re fortunate enough to get to that level. But we draw off of this. Our reaction to the big games and against quality competition the last two nights was fantastic. Our team stayed together. Maybe let\u2019s not get down 15 where we have to battle back, but outside of that, proud of the group and we\u2019ll draw from it. We\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nTCU had a 14-4 edge on second-chance points and shot 48 percent (25 for 52) to help overcome the Mountaineers making 8-of-17 threes.\n\nVan Lith had a team-high 19 points, eight assists and six rebounds and teammate Sedona Prince was dominant 18 points and 16 rebounds on 9-for-11 shooting.\n\nConner made five of her team\u2019s 10 threes and added 16 points.\n\nQuinerly led four WVU players in double figures with 20 points. Sydney Shaw scored 11 to go with a team-high seven rebounds, while Blacksten and Harrison added 11 and 10 points, respectively.\n\nThe Mountaineers will next play in the NCAA Tournament and will discover that matchup one week from Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get back home, await the NCAA Tournament,\u201d Kellogg said, \u201cand see if we can\u2019t go make some noise when we find out that assignment.\u201d",

Baskow/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @Left_Eye_Images\n\nFBI director Kash Patel is \u201cdead serious\u201d about contracting with the UFC to help train rank-and-file agents, according to the organization\u2019s president, Dana White.\n\nPatel was in attendance for UFC 313 on Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena and discussed the plan with the head of the Las Vegas-based fighting organization.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead serious about that,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how that starts to come together.\u201d\n\nIn one of his first conference calls with field office supervisors after being confirmed for the job last month, Patel reportedly discussed the potential of partnering with the UFC to help sharpen the combat and conditioning skills of FBI agents.\n\nWhite said he first discussed the idea with Patel several months ago, but few details were offered and he didn\u2019t know the plan was going to become public.\n\n\u201cAfter (that came out), my phone blew up because all these fighters want to be the trainers of the FBI guys now,\u201d said White, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ve got everybody hitting me up.\u201d\n\nPatel sat in an area that was inaccessible to the media and was not available for comment.\n\nThe Las Vegas resident is a longtime friend of prominent MMA manager Ali Abdelaziz, who represents a number of UFC fighters. One of them, Magomed Ankalaev, headlined Saturday\u2019s card, and another, Justin Gaethje, fought in the co-main event. Patel and Abdelaziz sat together at Saturday\u2019s card.\n\nWilling to help\n\nGaethje said last week he was aware of Patel\u2019s idea and wasn\u2019t sure how much assistance he could be, but expressed his willingness to participate.\n\n\u201cI just heard about it while I was training for this fight,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know many details, and I don\u2019t really even know how it would work. But I\u2019d absolutely want to be a part of it in any way I can.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the plan would call for fighters to work with FBI agents or whether the organization would provide access to the UFC Performance Institutes in Las Vegas and abroad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I can do,\u201d Gaethje said. \u201cI don\u2019t think these guys have a lot of hand-to-hand combat in their job. I think if they\u2019re going to learn anything, it would be the mindset. But I\u2019ve never had bullets flying at me, so who knows how I\u2019d handle that. It will be interesting.\u201d\n\nMain event winner\n\nPatel watched a card that saw Ankalaev win the light heavyweight title in the main event by keeping feared striker Alex Pereira on his heels for most of the night en route to a unanimous decision.\n\nAnkalaev, considered the top contender in the division since fighting Jan Blachowicz to a split draw in a forgettable dud of a fight in December 2022, finally got another shot and took advantage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve waited a long, long time, but here is my dream,\u201d Ankalaev said through a translator. \u201cIt\u2019s on my waist.\u201d\n\nThe result was hardly controversial, but it might not have been decisive enough for Ankalaev to move on to other challengers. White said he expects to book a rematch in short order.\n\n\u201cGonna make some adjustments for the rematch, and I\u2019ll be back much better,\u201d said Pereira, who expressed dissatisfaction in Ankalaev\u2019s somewhat conservative game plan. \u201cYou can count on it. Never give up on your dreams.\u201d\n\nAnkalaev, who entered the fight with a perceived massive advantage in the grappling department, neutralized Pereira\u2019s striking the first three rounds by constantly pressuring forward, even though he was light on heavy exchanges. That largely kept Pereira from getting off his explosive power shots.\n\nOnce he had the lead in the fight, Ankalaev grounded out much of the final 10 minutes by pressing Pereira against the cage.\n\n\u201cI kept on moving forward and pressuring him, and he kept running away from me for 20 minutes,\u201d Ankalaev said. \u201cAt the end of the fight, he said he wasn\u2019t sure why the victory when I was pressuring him the entire time. I\u2019m happy for the rematch, but maybe then he can fight for real and not run away the entire time.\u201d\n\nGaethje defeated lightweight contender Rafael Fiziev by unanimous decision in the co-main event, a far more exciting fight than the main event.\n\nThe card brought in a live gate of $10.1 million from a crowd of 18,869, which included controversial social media figure Andrew Tate.\n\nContact Adam Hill at ahill@reviewjournal.com.

An alternative option, Discovery+ Premium, requires subscribing for \u00a330.99/month, which includes additional sports channels.\n\nFor Australian fans, the main card will be available on Kayo Sports PPV or Foxtel Main Event, beginning at 2:00 PM AEDT on Sunday, March 9, for AU$59.95.\n\nThe UFC 313 main card boasts some high-stakes matchups:\n\n\n\nAlex Pereira (c) vs. Magomed Ankalaev \u2013 UFC Light Heavyweight Championship\n\n\n\nJustin Gaethje vs. Rafael Fiziev \u2013 Lightweight Co-Main Event\n\n\n\nJalin Turner vs. Ignacio Bahamondes \u2013 Lightweight\n\n\n\nAmanda Lemos vs. Iasmin Lucindo \u2013 Women\u2019s Strawweight\n\n\n\nKing Green vs. Mauricio Ruffy \u2013 Lightweight\n\n\n\nThe prelim card will showcase fighters including Curtis Blaydes against Rizvan Kuniev, Joshua Van facing Rei Tsuruya, and more exciting matchups.\n\nExpectations are high for the main event, with Alex Pereira\u2019s reputation as one of the toughest athletes solidified through his outstanding record \u2013 comprising nine wins and one loss since his debut in 2021, and boasting impressive stats of five wins and one loss within title fights. With all eyes on the bout, Pereira's rare dual-division championship status marks him as one of the outstanding fighters this sport has seen. According to Sky Bet, he enters as the slight favorite at 5/6 against the marginal 10/11 outsider Ankalaev.\n\nBetting lines for the fight suggest Pereira stands at 11/8 to win by TKO/KO and 13/2 by decision, which reflects his known finishing ability. More intriguingly, via Sky Bet, there's even a boosted bet on Pereira to win by TKO/KO within rounds 1, 2, or 3, increasing to 3/1.\n\nWith the odds reflecting the close nature of this fight, questions arise about how Ankalaev will counter Pereira's elite boxing skills. His notable grappling is both his strength and also tagged as Pereira's potential weakness, opening the door for explosive exchanges and strategic maneuvers inside the octagon.\n\nWill Pereira defend his title successfully, or will Ankalaev upset the odds? The atmosphere leading up to UFC 313 is electric, as fans and pundits alike debate the anticipated outcomes and tactics of both fighters.\n\nUFC 313 promises to be one for the ages, with its stacked fight card filled with formidable competitors, high stakes, and the prospect of history being made on the night of March 8, 2025, as fans tune in from various corners of the globe to witness this monumental clash.\n\nMark your calendars, set your reminders, and prepare for one thrilling night of fight action.",

With this new change, T-Mo is increasing its offer to somewhat match AT&T\u2019s switch and save promotion.\n\nPrior to this change, T-Mo offered up to $650 to switchers via prepaid card, up to two lines. This means that customers who switch can get this amount to pay off their existing carrier. In addition to this, users can get up to $830 off on a new device with a trade.\n\nStarting today, the new switcher offer will give you a rebate of up to $800 per line and up to four lines. So if you are a family of four switching to T-Mobile, you can get $3,200\n\nAnother change that T-Mobile revealed is that customers can now get up to $1000 in bill credits with trade-in. This is an additional $170 on the previous $830 limit on a new device.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that T-Mobile has some pretty interesting offers for device trade-ins. If you would like to know more about the offer, you can visit T-Mobile\u2019s page.\n\nSource: The Mobile Report",

AI Mode also is multimodal, meaning it can understand other types of content besides text. Users can ask follow-up questions.\n\nGoogle said the first users for AI Mode will be Google One AI Premium subscribers. Others can join a waitlist.\n\nT-Mobile Parent to Debut \u2018AI Phone\u2019\n\nDeutsche Telekom, T-Mobile\u2019s parent company, announced Monday (March 3) that it is planning to launch its AI Phone next year.\n\nWith a price tag under $1,000, the device aims to natively incorporate AI, meaning AI will be embedded from the ground up instead of bolted on. The AI Phone will integrate Perplexity\u2019s AI assistant systemwide. It will be accessible from the lock screen or through a double press of the power button.\n\nThe phone\u2019s AI capabilities will let users book taxis, make restaurant reservations, translate in real time, and perform various other functions through voice commands or text input. Deutsche Telekom partnered with Google Cloud AI, ElevenLabs and Picsart to add more capabilities to the device.\n\nThe phone will be unveiled later this year and start shipping in 2026. It will be rolled out in Europe first.\n\nGap Embraces AI Innovation\n\nGap CEO Richard Dickson said during the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday (March 6) that the past year has been spent \u201cfixing the fundamentals\u201d and now the retailer is ready to focus on \u201ccontinuous improvement through innovation.\u201d\n\nGap is pursuing innovations in AI and other areas, he said. The company formed an Office of AI that is focused on AI innovation across its operations.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, we will be developing AI monetization opportunities relative to the consumer experience, product to market, as well as organizational productivity,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cNow, having organized the various ways we can use AI to enable value creation, we\u2019re prepared to mobilize against this framework with intention.\u201d\n\nGap Chief Financial Officer Katrina O\u2019Connell said during the call that the company is using AI to, among other things, \u201ccreate more elevated experiences for our customers with things like personalization.\u201d\n\nAmazon Works on Reasoning Model, AI Agents\n\nAmazon is reportedly developing a new reasoning model under its Nova family of foundation models, Business Insider reported Tuesday (March 4).\n\nThe model could debut as soon as June and aims to be more cost-efficient while performing on par with top AI models in tasks like math and science. It is supposed to be a hybrid reasoning model that combines fast responses with deeper, more complex analysis.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which came out in late February, is a hybrid reasoning model that switches from fast responses to slower, more reasoned replies depending on the task at hand.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon also said Tuesday that it is creating an agentic AI unit at Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThese moves exemplify Amazon\u2019s intensified focus on advancing its AI capabilities, positioning the eCommerce giant as a contender in the AI race.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

The relaxed limit will allow the service to operate at a higher power than before.Section 25.202(k)(1) has established a uniform out-of-band emissions (OOBE) limit of -120 dBW/m2 /MHz to minimize harmful interference to terrestrial services.SpaceX had requested a relaxation of the power flux density (PFD) limit, assuring that it would protect adjacent networks from harmful interference while ensuring a robust set of features forcustomers and first responders.Right now, the direct-to-cell program is in beta and customers can only send texts over satellite . A relaxation in the limit is going to allow SpaceX to offer more features, including 911 emergency calling connectivity in off-the-grid locations.If it continues to comply with section 25.202(k)(1), it will have to take some compensatory measures that will make the network slower and voice service will be delayed by years.and SpaceX's rivals, including AT&T Verizon , and EchoStar had urged the FCC to not grant the waiver request , insisting that the established limit provided an appropriate level of protection for terrestrial networks. They also said that SpaceX failed to prove that a higher PFD level wouldn't disrupt operations. They feared that a relaxed limit would slow down their networks.SpaceX responded by saying if a waiver wasn't granted, it would cut off the only lifeline available to customers during an emergency. It asserted that a one-size-fits-all aggregate PFD limit was burdensome and no company could meet the established threshold without compromising the quality of the service , thereby undermining the FCC's vision.The company also countered's argument by saying that it supported rules that would give it an advantage over companies operating at higher frequencies.chimed in by saying that the -110.6 dBW/m2/MHz PFD level that SpaceX requested would protect adjacent terrestrial frequency bands. It strengthened its argument by stating that it operated in adjacent terrestrial frequency bands and wouldn't support a relaxed limit if it caused harmful interference.",

Another employee now exclusively tells us about how the company has turned a blind eye to a deceptive selling practice.After their complaint fell on deaf others, the employee decided to puton blast by tipping us about the company's dishonest operational practices.Apparently,stores are silently ripping customers off. They overcharge customers who come in to buy phones by bundling the price of insurance and accessories. This means customers are unknowingly getting upsold on accessories and insurance and given the illusion that those were free with the phone.This is deceptive on two levels. Firstly, you are made to pay more for your purchase than you should have. Secondly,tries to win your goodwill by acting as if it gave you an accessory for free, whereas, in reality, it made you pay for it without your knowledge.In some cases, customers end up paying more for accessories (that they never asked for) than the cost of the phone.This is not only happening at third-party retailers, according to the employee. The issue was escalated to the higher-ups atseveral times but despite repeated assurances, no measure has been taken to put an end to the fraudulent practices. It's almost as ifdoesn't mind this stream of revenue.also doesn't seem to care about employee well-being. In some stores with limited resources, employees must be available through the entirety of their nine-hour shift. They have been told that they cannot leave for lunch, which is inhuman, to say the least.Worst of all, employees are discouraged from speaking out about stuff they consider unfair.

However, the push to adopt the change frustrated users and employees, who had to bear the brunt of it. While the telecommunications service provider has been part of many controversies, T-Mobile has now been a victim of a theft ring where merchandise from the carrier's stores across Palm Beach County was stolen, costing over $500,000.\n\nThieves targeted T-Mobile stores, and many valuable items have been stolen, including phones, tablets, and watches\n\nT-Mobile has been targeted by a theft ring, and merchandise worth $500,000 was stolen in Palm Beach County. The stolen items were said to have been later resold by the thieves. To find out about the culprits, T-Mobile launched an internal investigation and secretly placed GPS tracking devices in packages that were suspected to be targeted by thieves.\n\nThe carrier learned about the significant losses incurred at two of its T-Mobile stores in Lake Worth, Florida, where the total damages were massive. A photo released by the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office showed various devices, including iPads, Apple Watches, iPhones, and other devices, scattered around the office. The theft ring began stealing packages in July 2024 that were meant to be delivered to T-Mobile stores in Palm Beach County.\n\nOn October 8th, law enforcement authorities tracked down the stolen devices in California and a UPS hub in Riveria Beach, Florida. The thieves were also said to be working for a cellphone repair shop in Lantana, Florida, called GoalMindStudios. While the shop was apparently a recording studio, it has been used to sell stolen goods.\n\nThe authorities arrested 38-year-old Samuel Drummond while he was attempting to leave the country, along with three others, including Giffton White, Sheldon Brown, and Christopher Palmer. White was a UPS supervisor tasked with delivering stolen packages to the recording studio. Another UPS driver, Brown, took the packages from the shipping facility and handed them over to White and Palmer.\n\nThis situation reminds us that a big carrier like T-Mobile can also fall victim to organized crime and highlights the growing number of similar thefts. Companies should enforce even more internal security measures to ensure losses like these are not incurred.",

The buys are intended to build out the offer of its Advertising Solutions (T-Ads) business.\n\n\n\nBlis, for which T-Mobile paid around $175m in cash, collects location and ap usage data, along with demographic and ownership / lifestyle information to map real-world consumer behaviour, link it with digital, and help clients target advertising. Its cookieless cross-channel targeting services will allow T-Ads to offer a comprehensive, privacy-centric solution for other brands, according to T-Mobile. Vistar offers an advanced out-of-home programmatic platform, and T-Mobile says that together with its own 'unique' customer insights and data, this will seamlessly connect digital messaging to real-world environments, amplifying reach and engagement and improving the measurability of campaigns.\n\n\n\nJP Colaco, SVP and Chief T-Ads Officer comments: 'Acquiring Vistar Media and Blis marks a significant step forward in T-Mobile's strategy to create truly transformative advertising solutions that are built by marketers for marketers. Advertising is at its best when it cultivates deeper, authentic connections between brands and consumers. With the addition of Vistar and Blis, T-Mobile has an incredible opportunity to deliver this experience along the customer journey with privacy-centric solutions that drive targeted, measurable outcomes'.\n\n\n\nBlis CEO Greg Isbister (pictured) says the move marks an exciting new chapter for his company, and 'a significant step forward in our mission to reshape advertising with privacy-first, future-proof technology'. He adds: 'As traditional signals reduce, we're proud to be at the forefront of innovation, ensuring advertisers can continue to reach and engage audiences effectively'.\n\n\n\nBlis was founded in the UK in 2004 and employs more than 300 global employees across fourteen offices in eleven countries.\n\n\n\nWeb sites are at www.t-mobile.com , www.vistarmedia.com and www.blis.com .\n\n\n\n",

Learn more\n\nOur team has extensively tested and researched cellular service providers for our buying guides to the best cell phone plans and the best cheap cell phone plans. For this guide, we've selected the best cell phone plans for seniors that include specific additional considerations.\n\nTwo of the most important features in determining our top pick were helpful elements like senior discounts and physical store availability for in-person support. In that sense, T-Mobile's Essentials Choice 55 plan is the best cell phone plan for seniors overall.\n\nFor a budget option with unlimited calling and texting but limited data for light tasks like web browsing and email, Tello Mobile's Economy plan offers reliable service at an incredibly low monthly price. Lively's Basic plan is also worth considering for relatively affordable, straightforward service with support tailored extensively for older adults, including through low-tech phones.\n\nOur top picks for the best cell phone plans for seniors\n\nBest overall: T-Mobile Essentials Choice 55 - See at T-Mobile\n\nBest budget: Tello Mobile Economy - See at Tello Mobile\n\nBest for senior-centric features: Lively Basic - See at Lively\n\nBest overall\n\nT-Mobile Essentials Choice 55 The Essentials Choice 55 plan by T-Mobile is basically the same thing as the regular Essentials plan with 50GB of premium data and unlimited calling and texting, but with a senior discount. You have to be 55 or older to be eligible for the plan. Check price at T-Mobile What we like Check mark icon A check mark. It indicates a confirmation of your intended interaction.

May still be cost prohibitive despite senior discount\n\ncon icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'. Limited coverage in rural areas\n\nFor its price and value, T-Mobile's Essentials Choice 55 plan is a solid proposition for older adults. It's the top budget pick from a major carrier in our best cell phone plans guide, except it includes a senior discount for those ages 55 and older.\n\nAt $45/month (or $60/month for two lines), the Essentials Choice 55 plan comes with unlimited talk and text and 50GB of fast data. 50GB of data is more than most people need, especially if they use WiFi at home for internet. It's ideal for seniors who regularly use data for browsing the web, making video calls, sending and receiving photos, streaming video and music, and anything else that requires data.\n\nT-Mobile's Essentials Choice 55 plan offers excellent value for seniors and the added benefit of physical store locations for in-person support. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nWe picked T-Mobile over less expensive options that offer similar connectivity and data, like Mint Mobile, because T-Mobile has widespread physical locations that can provide in-person support in addition to getting support online or on the phone.\n\nT-Mobile also offers data plans for smartwatches, which can be an immensely valuable addition. Many smartwatches have fall and accident detection that automatically alerts emergency services and assigned contacts. Those with dedicated data plans can send those alerts if your phone isn't nearby.\n\nT-Mobile's coverage works best in urban and suburban areas. However, it has historically limited coverage in rural areas. You can make sure T-Mobile has the coverage you need by checking its coverage map and asking friends, family, or neighbors in the area or on social networks like Facebook and Nextdoor.\n\nBest budget\n\nTello Economy Tello's Economy plan connects you with unlimited calling, texting, and 2GB of data for an incredibly low $10/month. It's an ideal plan for basic connectivity, like emails, web browsing, and simple apps. Check price at Tello What we like Check mark icon A check mark.

Smartwatch plans only available for Samsung models\n\nThe most affordable plan we recommend for seniors is Tello Mobile's Economy plan, which includes unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of fast data for $10/month. It's an excellent deal for the basics, and it contains enough data for light web browsing, emails, maps, store apps, and so on.\n\nTello has 5GB, 10GB, and unlimited data plans for those who need more internet connectivity. For older adults who don't use any data at all, Tello's Build Your Own Plan lets you build a plan with, on the lowest end, unlimited text, 100 minutes of talk, and no data for just $5/month.\n\nTello offers unlimited talk and text plans for incredible value on T-Mobile's network. Eve Montie/Business Insider\n\nAt the moment, Tello only supports smartwatch plans for Samsung smartwatches, which won't be helpful if you have an Apple Watch. Still, you can use an Apple Watch that's connected to a phone on a Tello plan.\n\nAs we note in our Tello Mobile review, Tello runs on T-Mobile's network, so it has the same coverage, though at deprioritized speeds. It has a solid app and access to customer support over the phone, but it lacks physical locations.\n\nBest for senior-centric features\n\nLively Basic Lively is a senior-centric carrier with low-tech phones that offers specialized customer support and services for older adults. Its Basic plan includes unlimited talk and text and 1GB of data by default, but you can add more data \u00e0 la carte. Check price at Lively What we like Check mark icon A check mark. It indicates a confirmation of your intended interaction. Dedicated customer support and features for seniors\n\nCheck mark icon A check mark.

Only works on two low-tech phones\n\ncon icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'. Extensive health services only available on premium plans\n\nAt $20/month, Lively's Basic plan offers unlimited talk, text, and customer support catered to senior customers, which is more helpful and effective than the standard one-size-fits-all customer support from traditional carriers. Seniors can even ask Lively's customer support questions about their phone, request Lyft rides, and get help finding a phone number.\n\nThe Lively Basic plan comes with 1GB of data as standard, but you can add more. 5GB is an additional $5/month, 10GB is an additional $15/month, and unlimited data is an additional $30/month.\n\nLively runs on Verizon's network, which has the most comprehensive nationwide coverage for urban and rural areas.\n\nLively has customer support and health, medical, and safety features designed for older adults. Lively\n\nLively service is only available through two phones: the Jitterbug Smart4 smartphone and the Jitterbug Flip2 flip phone. These basic phones are designed with older adults in mind, with less clutter and easy access to relevant features and functions. They can be ideal for those with limited tech experience, and the Jitterbug Smart4 is among our best phones for seniors.\n\nHowever, Lively won't be viable if a senior prefers to use one of the best phones with contemporary features or any phone other than the aforementioned Jitterbug models.\n\nLively is part of Best Buy's Health branch, which means you can sign up for Lively service, buy the phones, and get set up or receive in-person support at Best Buy locations.\n\nLively doesn't feature a smartwatch plan, but it offers mobile medical help with its pocketable Mobile2 device and a separate plan. It can be critical to alert and communicate with emergency services and contacts when a Lively phone isn't nearby.\n\nLively also offers health and medical services on its more expensive plans, including its Nurse On-Call feature, where seniors can access a nurse or doctor for medical advice, prescriptions, and prescription refills. It also has an Urgent Response feature to help with emergencies, and when you pair it with Lively's Mobile2 device (for additional monthly costs), it can automatically detect falls. Relevant contacts can be alerted with Lively Link when Urgent Response is used, and they can monitor the phone's battery status, location, and activities.\n\nHow we test cell phone plans for seniors\n\nWe test cell phone plans broadly and for seniors specifically with a mix of general day-to-day use, like making calls, sending messages, and using apps with varying data needs, whether it's web browsing or streaming video. We also conduct data speed tests in various locations that include different networks, like 4G and 5G, as well as varying signal strengths.\n\nWe assess a carrier's wireless performance and consider their plan offerings relative to value for specific use cases, such as older adults who may not frequently use data or smart technology.\n\nWe've tested every major carrier and many MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators) like Mint Mobile and Tello, but we haven't tested them all. Still, we can make confident and definitive assessments of MVNOs based on their features, plans, and value, as their wireless performance is similar, if not identical, to that of their parent network.\n\nWhat to look for in a cell phone plan for seniors\n\nSeniors looking for a phone plan need to make the same considerations as anyone else, including coverage areas, how much data they need, and whether their budget supports a chosen plan.\n\nThough a standard phone plan may serve seniors well, many carriers offer plans specifically for older adults. These plans can be mostly identical to regular plans, with the bonus of including a senior discount or senior-centric features.\n\nAs with any other age group, some older adults are less tech-savvy than others. If that's the case, look for a carrier with a customer service team trained to help older adults who are less comfortable with phones and carriers.\n\nCarriers with physical store locations are also a key factor to consider, as some people may find in-person support more helpful than working through an issue over the phone.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone 16 as our top overall pick, our guide to the best phones for seniors includes low-tech phones that may better serve some older adults.\n\nHowever, we would note that any of the best iPhones and best Android phones include accessibility features like text enlargement and shortcuts that make these high-tech smartphones more convenient and easier for older adults.\n\nSmartwatch data plans could be another important consideration. For example, a cellular-connected smartwatch could alert emergency services in case of a fall or accident if the person doesn't have their phone.",

            "content": "Naoya Inoue\u2019s next two fights are set.\n\nThe Ring has learned that Inoue\u2019s co-promoters, Hideyuki Ohashi and Bob Arum, finalized agreements Thursday for the Japanese superstar to defend his Ring, IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO 122-pound championships against Ramon Cardenas and Murodjon Akhmadaliev during a four-month span in the spring and summer. If Inoue (29-0, 26 KOs) defeats San Antonio\u2019s Cardenas on May 4 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, he will advance to another championship clash with Uzbekistan\u2019s Akhmadaliev on September 14 at a venue to be announced in Tokyo.\n\nCardenas (26-1, 14 KOs) is the WBA\u2019s No. 2, The Ring\u2019s No. 9 and WBO\u2019s No. 10 contender in the 122-pound division, but he is not ranked in the top 15 by the IBF or WBC. Akhmadaliev (13-1, 10 KOs) is the WBA\u2019s interim super bantamweight champion and is ranked No. 2 among The Ring\u2019s junior featherweight contenders.\n\nAkhmadaliev\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, and manager, Vadim Kornilov, agreed with Ohashi Promotions and Arum\u2019s Top Rank Inc. on a step-aside fee and an accompanying purse for Inoue to defend his titles against Akhmadaliev if the four-division champion beats Cardenas. The WBA could\u2019ve stripped Inoue of its 122-pound crown had his team not reached an agreement to face Akhmadaliev if Inoue were to defeat Cardenas.\n\nAkhmadaliev and his handlers have long contended that Inoue is avoiding him. \u201cThe Monster\u201d has scoffed at Akhmadaliev\u2019s claims because Inoue knocked out Filipino southpaw Marlon Tapales (39-4, 20 KOs) in the 10th round of the fight after Tapales upset Akhmadaliev by split decision in April 2023.\n\nInoue, 31, is ranked No. 2 on The Ring\u2019s pound-for-pound list. If Inoue continues to win, he has agreed to make his Riyadh Season debut sometime in December against an opponent to be determined in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nTop Rank and ESPN partnered to air this rare Sunday night tripleheader that will feature Inoue-Cardenas because the following Monday is Cinco de Mayo and the last day of Golden Week in Japan, a period of public holidays. The card headlined by Inoue and Cardenas figures to attract thousands of Japanese and Mexican fans from outside of Las Vegas to the home arena of the NHL\u2019s Golden Knights.\n\nThe Sunday show will also enable Top Rank to avoid competing with a pay-per-view event the previous night, May 3, which will showcase Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez against William Scull in a 12-round fight for Alvarez\u2019s Ring, WBA, WBC and WBO super middleweight titles and Scull\u2019s IBF belt. Mexico\u2019s Alvarez (62-2-2, 39 KOs) and Cuba\u2019s Scull (23-0, 9 KOs) will square off at ANB Arena in Riyadh in a main event that will be officially announced Thursday at a press conference in New York.\n\nCardenas, 29, will be a huge underdog against Inoue. He has won 14 fights in a row since Danny Flores (then 14-9-1) upset him by majority decision in a 10-rounder in April 2017 in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nThe left-handed Akhmadaliev, 30, most recently stopped Mexico\u2019s Ricardo Espinoza (30-5, 25 KOs) in the third round December 14 in Monte Carlo.",

T-Mobile spearheaded this movement with its numerous Un-carrier campaigns, which really changed the industry at the time. While things have certainly cooled over the past few years, that doesn't mean that the competition still isn't fierce.\n\nAT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile are all looking to gain your business, which means they need to offer incentives to make it easier to cancel service with your current provider, and move everything over to a new one. AT&T recently upped the ante by offering $800 per line in order to switch, and now it looks like T-Mobile is also matching the offer.\n\nAn enticing offer for those looking to switch\n\nT-Mobile T-Life app home\n\nThe change was spotted by Android Authority, with details being available directly from the T-Mobile website. Android Authority reports that this could be a silent change for now, since the brand isn't pushing any loud promotions highlighting the new $800 per line change. Previously, the brand only offered $650, so this $150 increase is certainly a big deal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSo if you're an AT&T customer and have been looking for a good reason to switch, now might be a good time to do so. Of course, there are a number of points that need to be fulfilled in order to claim the $800 credit. For example, users will need to port in their number to T-Mobile and sign up for a new line of service.\n\nAdditionally, T-Mobile requires that you trade in the phone that you were using with the previous carrier. And you'll also need to buy a new phone with T-Mobile, and submit details on how your previous device was being paid for. After all of this is done, that's when you can start the process of claiming the $800 credit.\n\nThe only downside is that T-Mobile does not support porting from Verizon or prepaid carriers like Metro or Google Fi. So if you're with those types of carriers, then you won't be able to take advantage of Carrier Freedom. There are a lot of criteria here that need to be satisfied, so make sure that you check and double check every point so that you won't be left empty-handed at the end.\n\nFor the most part, T-Mobile does offer good service at great prices. So it shouldn't be a complete loss if you can't get the Carrier Freedom credit. But the incentive is definitely one that you don't want to lose, so be sure to get everything checked out before you commit.\n\nOr if all of this is too complicated, and you just want to save on your bill, you can always try going with an MVNO. You'll get the same great service as the larger carrier for a better price.",

T-Mobile believes the company\u2019s capabilities will complement its existing ad business, which generates over $1 billion in annual revenue.\n\nT-Mobile CMO Vinayak Hegde said that Blis\u2019 technology evidences the power of addressability in mobile\u2014and is stepping in to provide a viable means of targeting amid widespread signal loss on the open web.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a key addition to our broader suite of adtech partners,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re excited about its potential\u2014not just for T-Mobile\u2019s own campaigns, but for other marketers as well.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile also announced that it closed its acquisition of Vistar Media, a digital out-of-home adtech company, for $600 million, on Feb. 3. Vistar\u2019s programmatic platform lets advertisers buy and measure digital ads across billboards, transit displays, and other out-of-home screens.\n\nTogether, the buys represent \u201ca significant step forward in T-Mobile\u2019s strategy to create truly transformative advertising solutions that are built by marketers for marketers,\u201d JP Colaco, the company\u2019s senior vp and chief T-Ads officer said in a press release. \u201cAdvertising is at its best when it cultivates deeper, authentic connections between brands and consumers. With the addition of Vistar and Blis, T-Mobile has an incredible opportunity to deliver this experience along the customer journey with privacy-centric solutions that drive targeted, measurable outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe company expects the acquisitions to improve revenue by $250 million and lift EBITDA by $75 million this year.\n\nThe developments highlight the mobile carrier\u2019s efforts to expand beyond its core wireless business with a robust adtech practice. Last year, the company launched a retail media business, enabling advertising across its 20,000 in-store screens. Two years before that, T-Mobile snapped up Octopus Interactive, a national network of video screens within Lyft and Uber vehicles.\n\nWith the additions of Blis and Vistar, T-Mobile is scaling the ecosystem it has built to connect advertisers with premium inventory across mobile, in-store, out-of-home, and connected TV screens.\n\n\u201cAs one of the largest advertisers in the U.S., T-Mobile manages complex campaigns across multiple business units and products,\u201d said T-Mobile\u2019s Hegde in a statement. \u201cThat means we need ad solutions that are both consumer-friendly and capable of delivering results at scale.\u201d\n\nBlis CEO Greg Isbister is confident that the partnership will prove its value, saying in a press release: \u201cWith Blis\u2019 advanced omnichannel targeting capabilities alongside T-Mobile\u2019s scale and rich dataset, we\u2019re even better positioned to directly connect advertisers to premium inventory across all screens.\u201d\n\nThe new acquisitions were completed through the T-Mobile Advertising Solutions business.",

Cell towers cannot function without them, potentially cutting off access to 911 and other emergency services.\n\nContreras used his access to the towers to carry out the thefts. He reportedly intended to resell the batteries for as little as $20 each.\n\nThe indictment details charges of felony burglary, criminal trespassing, theft, and trafficking in stolen property. Contreras, employed by a company listed as \u201cParadox Power,\u201d was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on a $50,000 bond.\n\nHowever, according to the Arizona Republic, Contreras was terminated from Northstar Towers in October 2023 and was unemployed at the time of his arrest. He still possessed his Northstar ID badge and company-issued jacket, which he allegedly used to deliver and sell the stolen batteries to Southwest Batteries, a battery specialist in Buckeye. During an interview with the police, Contreras admitted to receiving approximately $20 per battery.\n\nFollowing a search warrant, police recovered about 500 stolen batteries from Southwest Batteries, the records stated.\n\nIf convicted on all charges, including two Class 2 felonies for theft of controlled property and fraudulent schemes, one Class 4 felony for first-degree trafficking stolen property, 12 Class 4 felonies for third-degree burglary and unlawful entry, and 12 Class 5 felonies for criminal trespass, the individual could face up to 12.5 years in prison if the sentences are served concurrently. However, if the court orders consecutive sentences, the prison time could range from 28 to 97.75 years depending on mitigating or aggravating factors and judicial discretion.\n\nAccording to court records, Contreras was previously arrested for burglary, theft, and criminal damage.\n\nMany of the sites were reportedly Crown Castle-managed towers. Crown Castle has the exclusive right to lease and operate the T-Mobile towers until approximately 2040. The $2.4 billion agreement was inked in 2012.\n\nWireless Estimator has submitted a document request to the Phoenix Police Department for additional information regarding the thefts and will provide further details when they become available.",

            "content": "BARCELONA\u2014Amid the flurry of sessions and briefings this week at Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona, RCR Wireless News snagged a few minutes Karri Kuoppamaki, T-Mobile US\u2019 SVP of technology development and strategy.\n\nHere\u2019s what we asked, and how he answered. This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.\n\nRCR: How is the NTN beta going?\n\nKuoppamaki: Things are going well. We\u2019re still in the middle of building the constellation, but we have launched over 500 satellites so far, which is pretty respectable, considering that we only started just over a year ago, launching satellites\u2014that is due to our amazing partner, Starlink, and their ability to do those types of things.\n\n\u2026 We have a large number of customers in beta now, trying it out. We\u2019re getting a lot of good feedback. And I think one of the key learnings, to me at least, has been that it\u2019s not necessarily intuitive for consumers that there is a difference between a satellite service and a terrestrial service.\n\nThey\u2019re not meant to be the same. They serve a different purpose. We have large geographies in the U.S. covered by no one today\u2014the mountains of the wilderness, the national parks and so on\u2014but it is important to be able to provide the basic connectivity. But [people are] also used to using the smartphone the way we use it, and that creates an expectation that it works exactly the same way. And that\u2019s not the intention necessarily, at least initially. That has been visible in some of the feedback.\n\nBut it works like a charm. Once you\u2019re connected to the service itself, you can send and receive messages very quickly. We\u2019re making good progress in looking into the next phase of capabilities, starting with maybe picture messaging, some light data after that. And then eventually our goal is to get to voice as well.\n\nPeople are very appreciative of being able to stay connected while out and about. \u2026 But it also works the other way, and I\u2019ll give you an example in my personal life. My son likes to go hiking in the backcountry. And I always worry, because there are avalanches in the Pacific Northwest. Just knowing that he can send a message to us makes me and my wife less worried, that we know he is okay. And that peace of mind is worth its weight in gold.\n\nRCR: What do you see happening with data center evolution, and how does that relate to the network?\n\nKuoppamaki: I think cloudification is the foundation for everything, and part of our vision for the future is to move away from the way that networks were built in the past, into this fully cloudified, AI-native, multi-purpose horizontal networks that rely on distributed data center architecture.\n\nWe already have a very distributed network as it is, which is a great foundation for doing that. But we\u2019re looking into and building our own cloud capabilities that not only provide services for ourselves and our internal needs, but also then become a platform for AI and associated services and use cases down the road.\n\nThere are multiple different ways of looking at AI: it will help us with our own internal AI workloads, help us with network insights and optimization, and provide services that result in improved customer experience. But eventually, you could also see us\u2014the operator community\u2014being sort of a service provider for AI-related services, at least on the infrastructure side, [for] different enterprises and potentially even consumer use cases down the road, to tap into some of those resources that reside in the data center.\n\nRCR: How is T-Mobile using AI in a network context today?\n\nKuoppamaki: It\u2019s all about customer experience. It\u2019s two things: To get an easier way to get customer experience insights, as well as actions associated with that. \u2026 And then the other way \u2019round is that we can use AI to optimize things for us \u2026 but that is kind of the next phase of that evolution.\n\nBut there\u2019s tremendous potential in harnessing the power of AI to make our lives as engineers a little easier: instead of looking at complex data and trying to find the answer in different documentation and manuals, AI has the power of translating them into something that is easier to understand and easier to translate into, what is the next best action in not just correcting things, but improving things for the benefit of our customers.\n\nAs a company, there\u2019s three things that \u2026 we built and that I\u2019m very proud of, which is the best network, the best value and the best experience. And especially in this best experience part, AI plays a very important role in taking that capability to the next level.\n\nRCR: How is T-Mobile US thinking about Open RAN?\n\nKuoppamaki: We\u2019ve been a believer in open interfaces for many, many years, even before Open RAN started. But the best way forward when Sprint and T-Mobile came together was to integrate the two networks using a more classical architecture, but we do use Open RAN in specific use cases as well. The way I see it is that the next evolutionary step in Open RAN is AI-RAN, which again, will be relying on some of those open interfaces but it is \u2026 more cloud-native and AI-native in nature.\n\nOpen RAN, as a concept, started before AI became a thing, so none of that is baked into Open RAN as it stands today. But AI-RAN has the potential of taking Open RAN to the next level. You probably saw our announcement [in September 2024] of the AI-RAN Innovation Center with Nokia, Ericsson and NVIDIA, and that is certainly part of that story for us down the road. So we are in the midst of that evaluation and development with our partners. It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. It\u2019s not today\u2014but if it all pans out as we expect, that will certainly be an option for our network evolution in the future.\n\nRCR: How is T-Mobile US commercializing network slicing?\n\nKuoppamaki: It all starts with the best network in the nation, the largest 5G network that is Standalone based. Without Standalone, then it is going to be very hard to do well, [and] impossible to do network slicing. We started our Standalone journey in 2020, so we\u2019ve been on that road for a long time\u2014and that, combined with our spectrum assets and how it\u2019s deployed in the network, gives us that great ability to start doing differentiated services for use cases that require that. It\u2019s not just like one size fits all, you can actually do tailored things.\n\nSporting events are a great example of that, we\u2019ve done a lot of proofs-of-concept and we know that there is demand for those types of services. So I think that is something that we will look at commercializing. We\u2019ve also launched T-Priority for first responders, which is network slicing as well \u2026 and then also security, our SaSE-based solution is also something that benefits from slicing, because then you can remove the dependency of having a device-based configuration for that specific use case.\n\nWe have lots of different things under study and being evaluated right now, but again, the whole point is that if we didn\u2019t have the network that we have today and the leadership that we have today, we couldn\u2019t do what we are doing. And I think you will see over the next coming months and years, us really going big on services that rely on network slicing, because that demand is growing.\n\nBut again, technology is complex. You have to educate customers, you have to understand first of all what their needs are so you can map that to specific slice configurations, and then you also to have conversational dialogue with the customer base, so that they understand the benefits of slicing for their specific needs. And those types of discussions are also happening. Our T-Mobile for Business and T-Mobile for Government teams are doing a great job in having conversations and creating a pipeline of new types of services, and on the network side, we have all the building blocks in place. It\u2019s just a question of saying, okay I understand your needs, so let me work on that.",

The deal is said to be worth USD$900m (\u00a3702m). AppLovin now appears to be looking to focus solely on advertising; it recently made a move to court e-commerce advertisers. London-based Tripledot is currently valued at USD$1.4bn (\u00a31m).\n\nGoogle Urges US Gov Not to Force Breakup\n\nGoogle met with President Trump\u2019s government and urged them not to push for a breakup of the company, reports Reuters. Talking of the matter, a Google spokesperson stated: \"We routinely meet with regulators, including with the DOJ to discuss this case. As we've publicly said, we're concerned the current proposals would harm the American economy and national security.\u201d The potential remedies which have been suggested to put an end to Google\u2019s dominion over the sector include making the tech titan divest parts of the company and prohibiting its agreements with other tech giants which make it the default search engine on their devices.\n\nDisney Cuts Jobs Across TV Networks\n\nAn internal memo announced that Disney intends to eliminate around 200 jobs across its ABC and entertainment TV networks in an effort to further reduce annual costs. Most of the cuts will affect New York\u2019s ABC News division. The company has eradicated more than 8,000 roles since 2023. This follows the company\u2019s latest earnings statement revealing a revenue and profit drop in its broadcast and cable TV business.",

That\u2019s because the \u201cun-carrier\u201d is the first in the world to deploy a nationwide 5G standalone (SA) network and it\u2019s getting a lot of attention from attendees near and far during this week\u2019s cellular industry shindig.\n\nNokia kicked things off on Sunday highlighting T-Mobile\u2019s achievements with President of Technology Ulf Ewaldsson \u2013 and the stage was set.\n\nIntroducing XR trials\n\nTo get a better idea of how the 5G SA network will support wearables, T-Mobile is conducting trials with Ericsson and Qualcomm in San Diego. At the center of the trials are AI immersive, lightweight smart glasses powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon tech with Hololight\u2019s XR streaming service.\n\nAccording to Ericsson, these XR trials aim to validate a few things, including network readiness for a seamless XR experience. They\u2019ll also be proving out 5G Advanced features, like network slicing, for its low latency and advanced schedulers.\n\nIt\u2019s not T-Mobile\u2019s first foray with glasses. A couple years back it started selling Ray-Ban glasses to the diehard AR/VR fans. \u201cIt was surprising. I never thought that we\u2019d be selling Ray-Bans, but we sold tens of thousands of those,\u201d Ankur Kapoor, chief network officer at T-Mobile, told Fierce on the sidelines of MWC.\n\n\u201cI think there's lots of consumer eagerness to get to use many of these cool things. These are early adopters,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cThis will only get better from here on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all about 5G SA\n\nThe trials are yet another reminder of T-Mobile\u2019s leadership in 5G SA coverage.\n\nKapoor started as a radio engineer at T-Mobile decades ago, so he\u2019s seen the good times as well as the bad. Twenty years ago, T-Mobile was almost a technology behind everyone else.\n\n\u201cWhen people were doing LTE, we were still doing 3G, back in 2011, 2012. This is what I call our journey from last to first, or last to best,\u201d he said.\n\nThe acquisition of Sprint and the 5G era gave T-Mobile another go of it, allowing it to leapfrog the competition in a lot of ways. Nowadays, there\u2019s a kind of curiosity about how they were able to do it, especially among the many industry professionals attending MWC from geographies all over the world.\n\nKapoor tries to remain humble. \u201cI think everybody wants to understand. Everybody wants to meet with us. They try to understand what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\n\nIt helps that T-Mobile got an early start with its \u201clayer cake\u201d strategy, aggressively rolling out 5G on low-band 600 MHz spectrum and later supercharging that with its 2.5 GHz mid-band spectrum acquired from Sprint, noted Ookla analyst Luke Kehoe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really seen that as kind of a winning strategy in the market,\u201d he told Fierce. \u201cT Mobile really stands out to us as actually a global leader when you look at both reach and performance in that they've identified a balance between very high speed and very far reach.\u201d\n\nWay-back machine\n\nIn some ways, these XR tests are a long timing coming. Neville Ray, the former president of Technology at T-Mobile who left the company in 2023, on more than one occasion shared his enthusiasm for wearables and what might be coming down the pike in the form of smart apparel, biometric devices, AR/VR glasses, headsets and the like.\n\nOf course, that didn\u2019t seem to happen as fast as everybody might have anticipated (Metaverse, anyone?), but that\u2019s par for the course. Who knows? Maybe a few years from now, everybody will be wondering what all the hullaballoo was about AI.\n\nStay up to date on all the news from Mobile World Congress with Fierce Network and FNTV.",

It will be unveiled later this year and start shipping in 2026. The first markets for the AI Phone will be in Europe.\n\nRead more: Perplexity Announces AI-Powered Web Browser Comet\n\nCrowded AI Smartphone Market\n\nDeutsche Telekom is introducing the AI Phone at a time of intense competition in the AI-powered devices market, with major tech companies and telecommunications providers seeking to differentiate themselves.\n\nIn January, Samsung positioned its Galaxy smartphones as \u201cAI companions\u201d that more deeply embed the technology into the device. Its phone can do such things as picking up on nuances in conversations and anticipating people\u2019s needs \u2014 all based on a basket of user information it calls a \u201cpersonal data engine.\u201d\n\nGoogle has continued to add AI features to its Pixel smartphones, such as Gemini Live, an AI chatbot that can engage in free-flowing conversation with the user and helps with tasks. Meanwhile, Apple reportedly might delay a long overdue upgrade to Siri.\n\nSee also: Apple Reportedly Battling Bugs Holding Back Long-Awaited Siri Upgrade\n\nVideo, Audio and Image Capabilities\n\nTo bring additional capabilities to the AI Phone, Deutsche Telekom is partnering with Google Cloud AI, ElevenLabs and Picsart. Their services will be offered starting in the summer.\n\nHere\u2019s what the three partners bring to the AI phone:\n\nGoogle Cloud AI adds video and audio understanding capabilities so users can do things like translate conversations in real time.\n\nElevenLabs can convert prompts, links and documents into multi-speaker podcasts.\n\nPicsart lets users create their own avatars or transforms photos into different artistic styles.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

Ewaldsson said, \"We've gone from number four in our nation to become the leader with our network.\"The executive gave credit for T-Mobile 's network leadership and increased speed and coverage to the $26 billion acquisition of Sprint in 2020.\n\nUlf Ewaldsson, president of technology at T-Mobile , said at a panel on Monday thatis about to take its 5G Advanced technology nationwide. Ewaldsson said, \"We've gone from number four in our nation to become the leader with our network.\"The executive gave credit for's network leadership and increased speed and coverage to the $26 billion acquisition of Sprint in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen T-Mobile first employed its SA 5G network, it used it only for its low-band spectrum. At the time, it improved its 5G coverage by 30%. Ewaldsson said that now T-Mobile is taking SA 5G to the entire network.\n\n\n\n\n\n5G Advanced uses cutting-edge technology to deliver faster data speeds, lower latency, and larger network capacity. Some of the advanced features are possible thanks to T-Mobile 's standalone (SA) 5G network. This network has a 5G core and was never used to disseminate 4G signals. SA 5G networks offer certain technologies unique to these networks. For example, an SA 5G network can be used for network slicing. That's when a carrier creates customized slices of its 5G network for different customers. Each slice has different characteristics demanded by each subscriber.\n\n\n\nAnother important technology that is part of the 5G Advanced experience is Carrier Aggregation. This technology can be explained by imagining a sleepy two-lane road that becomes a six-lane super highway. There is more room for traffic allowing vehicles to move faster and capacity expands. This is how Carrier Aggregation works. Multiple frequency bands are combined increasing the bandwidth resulting in increases in data speeds. Here's a more compelling image. Imagine a pipe that is made wider allowing more data through. That's another way to look at Carrier Aggregation.\n\n\n\nReceive the latest T-Mobile news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\nBy taking all of the cutting-edge technology that is part of 5G Advanced and moving it nationwide, T-Mobile expects to provide improved capacity and coverage from the same network. All of this led Avi Greengart, analyst and president of Techsponential, to say after Ewaldsson's speech, \"It might make the network more efficient. It certainly makes it more buzzwordy.\" Based on T-Mobile 's preference to focus on investors rather than consumers, I'd say that the latter is more important to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of buzzwords, T-Mobile plans on injecting AI into its network. Ewaldsson said, \"The network is holding up better than it's ever done. We have halved the downtime per subscriber by using AI technology.\"\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nT-Mobile is the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, and its popularity is largely due to its network coverage and the wide range of tempting offers available. These range from T-Mobile phone deals for existing customers to trade-in deals for new customers and everything in between.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find the best T-Mobile promotions currently available. Perhaps something in there can save you some money when you make your next smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch purchase. We\u2019ll be sure to keep this page updated regularly with new T-Mobile deals as they become available.\n\nThe best T-Mobile deals\n\nEditor\u2019s note: We will regularly update this list of the best T-Mobile deals as new promotions go live.\n\n1. Get up to $1,000 off the Samsung Galaxy S25 range\n\nHadlee Simons / Android Authority\n\nT-Mobile has some of the best deals on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. There are a range of promotions, depending on whether you\u2019re trading in your old phone, whether you\u2019re a new or existing customer, and which plan you\u2019re on. The summary is that you can save as much as $1,000 if you\u2019re switching up your old device or around $800 if you\u2019re just adding a new line.\n\nFor those adding a new line of service on the Go5G Plus or Go5G Next plans, you\u2019ll get $800 off the latest Samsung flagships. That could land you the base model Galaxy S25 for free.\n\nIf you\u2019re an existing customer on one of those plans, trading in your old device can get you that same credit of $1,000. This sounds fairly standard, but the old device you switch can be one of several eligible devices and can be in any condition.\n\nOther deals for adding various new lines or trade-ins outside the plans referenced above can also save you money on the hot new Galaxy handsets. Hit the button below to peruse them for yourself.\n\n2. Get a free iPhone 16 Pro with trade\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nThe latest Apple flagship was one of the most hotly anticipated devices of 2024, and the iPhone 16 certainly lived up to the hype. This month, customers on the Go5G Next plan who trade in their old device can save up to $1,000 on the range, meaning you can get the iPhone 16 Pro free of charge.\n\nCustomers on a lower plan can save up to $830 on the range by trading in their old devices, but the deals don\u2019t stop there. Nine promotions are available, depending on whether you\u2019re a new or existing customer, the device you have to trade, the plan you want, and so on.\n\nT-Mobile is also offering the new iPhone 16e for free to most customers activating a new line or in exchange for a trade-in to existing customers.\n\n3. Get $1,000 off the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL without a trade\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nThe latest Google devices are some of the finest near-stock Android phones you can buy, and you can save up to $1,000 on the Pixel 9 series without a trade-in. That means the Pixel 9 is free, while the 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold become a whole lot more affordable.\n\nThe caveat to getting the deal is adding a new line on the Go5G Next or Go5G Plus with a 24-month contract. If you\u2019re an existing customer who doesn\u2019t need a new line, you can make the same savings by trading in your current device.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t want to commit to such a lavish plan, other plans can drop the price of the Google handsets by $600, or just trading in your old phone can still knock $500 off the new Pixel devices.\n\n4. Save $800 on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 or Z Flip 6 without a trade\n\nRyan Whitwam / Android Authority Left: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 cover screen, Right: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 cover screen\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 are the kings of the foldable market, and T-Mobile has some sweet deals available for the devices. While many other carriers and retailers require you to trade in your old phone to get substantial discounts on the hotly anticipated foldables, T-Mobile will drop the price by up to $800 just for adding a new line of service.\n\nGiven the retail price, this discount in the form of bill credits allows you to pick up the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for $299.99. The remaining balance to pay on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 drops to $1,099.99. New customers can score this amazing deal by adding a new line on the Go5G Plus or Go5G Next plan. You\u2019ll then receive your $800 rebate over the 24-month contractual period.\n\nExisting customers on these plans can save even more but will need to trade in their current device. If you\u2019re upgrading to one of these stunning new devices, you\u2019re unlikely to need your old phone anymore. Switching up for the new foldable can score you as much as $1,000 off the devices.\n\nCheck out the range of deals via the link below.\n\n5. Try T-Mobile for free for three months (new customers)\n\nT-Mobile is taking advantage of the eSIM revolution to bring you an extraordinary offer. The company has a flagship feature called Network Pass that, impressively, gives you free T-Mobile service for three months. That\u2019s unlimited service, too, with no data caps outside of the usual 50GB throttling limit. Far from being a bare-bones trial, you also have temporary access to certain Magenta Status benefits, such as travel and T-Mobile Tuesdays perks.\n\nThere\u2019s no obvious catch to this deal \u2014 T-Mobile wants to convince you to switch. You can try the service without leaving your current provider, and there are plenty of incentives to be found on this page if you decide to do so.\n\nHit the button below to find out more.\n\n6. Get a phone for free when you switch (new customers)\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nYou can get most of the top flagship phones at substantial discounts, but T-Mobile can also hook you up with a free phone just for signing up for a new line of service. This deal covers plenty of OEMs, and the choice is yours.\n\nAll you have to do is activate a new line, and you\u2019ll get 24 bill credits to chip away at your bill. Unlike some of the offers above, this can be a new line on any plan. Check out more of the T-Mobile free phone options below:\n\nSamsung Galaxy A16 5G \u2014 Free ($228 off)\n\nSamsung Galaxy A15 5G \u2014 Free ($228 off)\n\nMoto G Power 5G (2025) \u2014 Free ($210 off)\n\nMoto G 5G (2025) \u2014 Free ($168 off)\n\nMotorola Edge (2024) \u2014 Free ($300 off)\n\nMoto G Power 5G (2024) \u2014 Free ($198 off) Moto G 5G (2024) \u2014 Free ($168 off)\n\nNokia G310 5G \u2014 Free ($186 off)\n\nT-Mobile Revvl 7 5G \u2014 Free ($200 off)\n\nT-Mobile Revvl 7 Pro 5G \u2014 Free ($250 off)\n\nT-Mobile Revvl 6x 5G \u2014 Free ($200 off)\n\nT-Mobile Revvl 6x Pro 5G \u2014 Free ($230 off)\n\n7. T-Mobile smartwatch deals\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nT-Mobile is currently offering various deals that\u2019ll help you add a smartwatch to your wearable tech collection. If you like the look of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, you can get it for free with a new line of service.\n\nIf Samsung isn\u2019t your ecosystem, you can save $380 on the Google Pixel Watch 3, with some Apple wearables also on offer. As usual, you need to buy the first device through installments over 24 months, and T-Mobile will give you credit over that period.\n\nCheck out the details using the button below.\n\n8. T-Mobile tablet deals\n\nRita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nT-Mobile has a ton of great phones on offer, but there are some tablet deals, too. Like the phone deals, some tablets are far cheaper if you activate a new line of service, and T-Mobile is offering great deals on top tablets, such as 50% off the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus with a new line, free cellular upgrades on the latest Apple iPad range, and more.\n\nHit the button below to check out which tablets are currently on offer.\n\n9. Get Apple TV Plus for free\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nWhen you sign up for the Go5G Plus or Go5G Next plans with T-Mobile, not only will you get any of the free or discounted phones covered above, but you\u2019ll also enjoy Apple TV Plus at no extra cost. The streaming service is home to exclusive Apple originals, such as the Emmy award-winning series Ted Lasso, See, and For All Mankind \u2014 all of which we recommend watching first\n\nThe Apple TV Plus subscription can also be shared between up to five people, which makes for a great addition to using the world\u2019s largest and fastest 5G network. If you choose the Go5G plan, you\u2019ll get six months of the service for free. Hit the button below for more details on this offer.\n\nIf Apple TV Plus isn\u2019t your thing, there are also similar offers available on Netflix and Hulu ad-supported plans.\n\n10. Switch to T-Mobile and get up to $800 back\n\nT-Mobile\n\nT-Mobile is offering extra incentives to help you make the switch from another carrier to T-Mobile. Currently, you can keep your phone and pay no additional costs when you switch from another carrier to T-Mobile.\n\nThis deal also includes up to $800 in the form of a virtual prepaid card to help you pay off any costs that may come with changing carriers. If you\u2019re looking to switch carriers, click on the link below to find out more details.\n\n11. Other options on the T-Mobile network\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great deal on the T-Mobile network that doesn\u2019t necessarily have the T-Mobile name, you can also consider looking into an MVNO. An MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) is a third-party carrier that relies on a major network for coverage. Here are a few of the T-Mobile-based MVNOs that we recommend: Mint Mobile: The MVNO is headed up by Ryan Reynolds. Choose your plan here.\n\nThe MVNO is headed up by Ryan Reynolds.

Perplexity AI will power the assistant, though services from Google Cloud AI, ElevenLabs, and Picsart will eventually be available on the phone as well.\n\nDeutsche Telekom first debuted the AI phone concept at MWC in 2024 and has spent the last year refining it.

            "content": "T-Mobile has announced its plan to compensate customers who were affected by a substantial data breach. The company is set to distribute $350 million to its customers.\n\nWhat Happened: In 2021, T-Mobile suffered a significant data breach that impacted approximately 76 million people. The breach exposed sensitive data such as names, Social Security numbers, and birth dates. The breach was executed by John Binns, an American hacker based in Turkey, who exploited a misconfigured internet-exposed router to infiltrate T-Mobile\u2019s internal network.\n\nAccording to an update on the T-Mobile Data Breach Settlement website, payments to affected customers are expected to commence in April.\n\nCustomers who incurred out-of-pocket losses could claim up to $25,000, while others may receive $25, or $100 for Californians, with no additional steps required for eligible class members.\n\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\n\nThe compensation is a result of a class-action lawsuit that T-Mobile decided to settle rather than dispute in court. Customers who used T-Mobile in 2021 can reach out to the administrator on the settlement\u2019s website or call 1-833-512-2314 for more information.\n\nWhy It Matters: The data breach has significantly impacted T-Mobile\u2019s reputation and customer trust. The company\u2019s decision to compensate its customers is a crucial step towards rebuilding that trust.\n\nHowever, it also highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in protecting customer data.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder for other companies to ensure their networks are secure to prevent similar breaches in the future.\n\nRead Next:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Deutsche Telekom hasn\u2019t said much else about the AI phone hardware, but the images show something of a budget to midrange Android device with thick forehead and chin bezels, as well as a pink sleep / wake button.\n\nDeutsche Telekom plans to launch its AI phone in the second half of this year. And this summer, the company will add some of the AI features from Google Cloud AI, ElevenLabs, and Picsart into the MeinMagenta app, which works with other smartphones.",

            "content": "At Mobile World Congress 2025, T-Mobile, owned by Deutsche Telekom (DT), has announced plans to release an \"AI Phone\" created in collaboration with AI search startup Perplexity, along with contributions from Google Cloud, Picsart, and ElevenLabs.\n\nKey Points\n\nDevice will launch in second half of 2025, with sales beginning in 2026 for under $1,000\n\nPerplexity's assistant will operate from the lock screen, aiming to end the \"confusing app jungle\"\n\nThe partnership represents T-Mobile's strategy to position itself as \"an AI company\"\n\nA separate \"Magenta AI\" app will bring similar features to existing iOS and Android users on T-Mobile\n\nFor years, telecom carriers have watched from the sidelines as Apple and Google built ecosystems that relegated network providers to utility status. Now, T-Mobile seems to think AI might be its way back into the game.\n\n\"We are becoming an AI company,\" said Claudia Nemat, DT board member overseeing technology and innovation, during Monday's press conference. She clarified that while the company isn't building foundational large language models, \"we do the AI agents.\"\n\nThe announcement builds on a partnership between Perplexity and Deutsche Telekom that began in April 2024, following DT's initial discussion of an \"AI Phone\" concept at last year's MWC.\n\nWhat makes this partnership particularly noteworthy is Perplexity's expanded ambitions. \"Perplexity is transitioning from just being an answer machine to an action machine,\" explained Aravind Srinivas, the company's co-founder and CEO. \"It is going to start doing things for you, not just answering questions. It's going to be able to book flights for you, book reservations for you, send emails for you, send messages, place phone calls for you, and all those sorts of things.\"\n\nWhile specifications remain scarce (the concept renders suggest an Android-based device), T-Mobile emphasized that AI will be integrated at the system level, accessible directly from the lock screen. For those not interested in purchasing new hardware, T-Mobile will offer a \"Magenta AI\" app for existing iOS and Android devices \u2013 though you'll need to be one of T-Mobile's 300 million customers to access it.\n\nThe partnership comes at an interesting moment for both companies. Perplexity, despite its innovative approach to AI search, faces formidable competition from deep-pocketed rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, which has integrated its Gemini AI into core search products. For Perplexity, a hardware partnership provides a potential distribution channel that bypasses traditional search entry points.\n\nFor T-Mobile, the AI Phone represents yet another attempt by a telecom to break free from commodity status. \"The days of the confusing app jungle are over,\" Nemat declared, suggesting that T-Mobile sees an opportunity to simplify smartphone experiences through AI.\n\nHistory gives reasons for skepticism. The smartphone market has proven notoriously difficult to crack, with dominant players Apple and Samsung maintaining their positions while even established manufacturers like LG have exited the business altogether. Building competitive hardware isn't easy, and convincing consumers to adopt a carrier-branded device may prove challenging.\n\nStill, the magnetic pull of AI is undeniable. Jon Abrahamson, Chief Product & Digital Officer at Deutsche Telekom, boldly claimed: \"'Magenta AI' stands for amazing, useful, secure AI services. Once used, you will never give it back.\"\n\nWhether this confidence is warranted remains to be seen. What's clear is that as AI capabilities expand beyond simple Q&A toward more proactive assistance, both established telecom giants and cutting-edge startups see an opportunity to reshape how we interact with our devices. T-Mobile's AI Phone may succeed or fail, but it represents a fascinating attempt to use AI to redraw the boundaries between carriers, hardware makers, and software providers that have defined the smartphone era.",

The company has been attempting to make consumers transition to the T life app. The aim is to offer a unified experience for the users and reduce the need for physical store visits. Its recent initiative pushes the app further through the Magenta Welcome system, which is not being met well by both customers and employees. Due to the continued pressure, many users are considering switching carriers, and it seems that the employees have to face the brunt of this.\n\nT-Mobile's push towards utilizing the T Life app for transactions has complicated in-store transactions, leading to many customers walking out\n\nT-Mobile has been pushing for the adoption of the T Life app for quite some time, and to escalate its efforts, it launched a new in-store system called the Magenta Welcome last month. The system allows employees to be linked up with customers through the app, which then helps the staff direct users to use the T Life app. However, the constant emphasis and the ongoing transition are not sitting well with the customers who feel pressured, and the employees do not seem happy about it either.\n\nT-Mobile's goal is to encourage customers to opt for self-service to handle tasks more autonomously and reduce the need for in-store visits. Customers are not particularly exuberated by the constant push and are even considering leaving the carrier. Not only are the customers frustrated by the immense pressure to conform, but they have also expressed that the app is difficult to navigate and has a complicated process for even the simplest of tasks, such as navigating.\n\nEmployees find themselves sandwiched between management and customers as they have to ensure app adoption while dealing with growing customer complaints. It is a tough situation for the staff on both ends. One of the company's employees suggested that the problems that keep coming up are due to the poor execution of the new system. The purpose of the app was to simplify and streamline the customer experience. However, it has led to a cumbersome retail experience that has many customers walking out and not going ahead with their transactions.\n\nInstead of taking notice of the root cause of the problem at hand, T-Mobile adds even more pressure on employees by asking to inform them every time a customer refuses to go ahead with the T Life app for their transaction. The front-line staff is finding it even more difficult to go ahead with the transaction process. T-Mobile needs to pay attention to the frustration of both customers and employees before it ends up losing both.",

A company veteran now gives us insight into what's happening at stores.Last month, in an attempt to increase the usage rate of the app,introduced a new in-store system called Magenta Welcome . This interface connects employees and customers who visit retail locations and it makes it easier for employees to guide you to use T Life.The idea behind it is to give customers the ability to self-serve so that they make fewer store visits. Unfortunately for all stakeholders, it has been a bumpy ride so far.Some customers have previously threatened to leave T-Mobile after being forced to use T Life as they find it challenging to use and claim it doesn't let them do simple tasks such as upgrading to a new phone. Employees are not only having to deal with customer frustration but also have higher-ups breathing down their necks to ensure they are successfully convincing people to download the app.According to someone who has been withfor nearly two decades, the situation is a mess. They attribute it to the way the new system has been implemented.They tell us that the system is not working as intended, which means that instead of streamlining the retail process, it's making things complicated for customers, who often end up walking out as a result. And instead of taking accountability,is blaming employees, who are now required to email their managers to explain why customers are choosing not to upgrade using the T Life app.It's not about the T Life app not working properly alone. Customers often go to stores because they want everything to be taken care of. On top of that,somehow thought it was a good idea to have managers approve some T Life transactions, which sometimes take hours, prolonging the process, and angering customers even more.It's almost as if the whole system was set up to fail. Except, of course, it wasn't. Most employees believe T Life was created to replace them. While that is an issue on its own, what's surprising is thatwas too quick to implement the new system and can't seem to see why it's backfiring.Employees are having to bear the brunt of it. Employees may face corrective actions if a manager takes too long to sign off on a transaction. Similarly, employees are required to provide a detailed explanation every time a customer refuses to use T Life, despite the reason being as clear as day. Many other employees have narrated similar stories, but a few say T Life has made their job easier. Regardless, if most employees and customers are not happy with the app,needs to reconsider this strategy or it may lose customers to confusion.",

            "content": "T-Mobile has announced its plan to compensate customers who were affected by a substantial data breach. The company is set to distribute $350 million to its customers.\n\nWhat Happened: In 2021, T-Mobile suffered a significant data breach that impacted approximately 76 million people. The breach exposed sensitive data such as names, Social Security numbers, and birth dates. The breach was executed by John Binns, an American hacker based in Turkey, who exploited a misconfigured internet-exposed router to infiltrate T-Mobile\u2019s internal network.\n\nAccording to an update on the T-Mobile Data Breach Settlement website, payments to affected customers are expected to commence in April.\n\nCustomers who incurred out-of-pocket losses could claim up to $25,000, while others may receive $25, or $100 for Californians, with no additional steps required for eligible class members.\n\nAlso Read: TD Bank Confirms Data Breach: Account Numbers and Sensitive Customer Info Exposed\n\nThe compensation is a result of a class-action lawsuit that T-Mobile decided to settle rather than dispute in court. Customers who used T-Mobile in 2021 can reach out to the administrator on the settlement\u2019s website or call 1-833-512-2314 for more information.\n\nWhy It Matters: The data breach has significantly impacted T-Mobile\u2019s reputation and customer trust. The company\u2019s decision to compensate its customers is a crucial step towards rebuilding that trust.\n\nHowever, it also highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in protecting customer data.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder for other companies to ensure their networks are secure to prevent similar breaches in the future.\n\nRead Next\n\nBank of America's Sensitive Customer Data Compromised in Third-Party Hack \u2013 Is Your Account Safe?",

            "content": "BARCELONA, Spain--(BUSINESS WIRE)--At Mobile World Congress 2025, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) is introducing a number of new solutions and partnerships to accelerate innovation in networking while advancing its vision of helping telcos launch new services for their enterprise customers to connect the network edge to the cloud.\n\n\u201cThe market inflection that AI presents will have a monumental impact on networking, edge, and data center innovations for the telecommunications industry. With AI opening up new revenue streams, new services, and new capabilities that telcos can provide to their customers, HPE Aruba Networking is continuing our innovation leadership to help service providers build next-generation networks to maximize these AI opportunities,\u201d said Phil Mottram, EVP and general manager, HPE Aruba Networking. \u201cWith service providers facing unprecedented network and service demands, HPE is leading the way in redefining the network's role in delivering business value.\u201d\n\nAt Mobile World Congress 2025, HPE continues to demonstrate its leadership helping providers build next-generation networks for maximizing AI opportunities, while demonstrating its commitment to enabling the growth and success of Open RAN technology and providing infrastructure of choice for telco carriers worldwide.\n\nNew connectivity solutions and infrastructure to meet the evolving needs of demands of enterprise customers across various industries include:\n\nPrecision timing is critical for AI workloads and private 5G experiences\n\nThe new HPE Aruba Networking CX 8325P network switch delivers simplified operations and nanosecond accuracy to enhance performance for high-speed, latency-sensitive applications such as autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, and robotics. The precision timing capabilities of the switch enhance roaming experiences as cellular traffic moves from radio-to-radio at large venue sites such as stadiums, as well as for AI applications, broadcasting, and Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN) deployments.\n\nThe HPE Aruba Networking CX 8325P switch features the industry's first solution to embed precision timing into the network fabric, delivering nanosecond accuracy for mission-critical capabilities such as improved quality of calls, data transactions, and AI workloads between moving cellular traffic.\n\nUnlike other solutions utilizing the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) communication with satellites, HPE Aruba Networking is embedding enterprise and telco PTP support in the network, eliminating the need for a separate timing appliance, while introducing fail-safe redundancy.\n\n\u201cPrivate cellular networking has great promise in its ability to unlock transformative enterprise use cases, including transportation and logistics. However, many of these applications, including modern AI workload support, rely on precise nano-second timing and ultra-low latency profiles,\u201d said Will Townsend, VP & Principal Analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cThe HPE Aruba Networking CX 8325P switch is designed to address these challenges by integrating telco-grade timing into the network fabric as well as provides a single operating system to ease management cross-domain to network edges.\u201d\n\nHPE offers sneak peek at next-generation HPE ProLiant Compute DL110 with Intel Xeon 6\n\nAlso announced at Mobile World Congress is the HPE ProLiant Compute DL110 Gen12, HPE\u2019s next-generation server based on Intel\u2019s powerful new Xeon 6 Granite Rapids-D chipset, which will be on display for the first time in the HPE booth at the conference. Designed specifically for telco deployments at the far edge of networks, the new HPE ProLiant Compute DL110 combines industry-leading compute, thermal performance, and IO density with next-level security.\n\nThe HPE ProLiant Compute DL110 expands the performance, reliability, and scalability required for Open RAN deployments, and illustrates HPE\u2019s commitment to providing telco customers with the ability to modernize their networks with the equipment that best suits their needs.\n\nHPE and T-Mobile unite to deliver network excellence for small businesses\n\nHPE and T-Mobile have joined forces in an innovative partnership to deliver an enterprise-grade, secure, and easy-to-manage networking solution for small businesses at an affordable price. This collaboration introduces an advanced subscription solution that combines the T-Mobile Connected Workspace Program, including the Managed 5G Gateway service with HPE Networking Instant On Switch Series 1830 and HPE Networking Instant On Access Point AP21.\n\nHPE spotlight on innovation at Mobile World Congress booth\n\nAt Mobile World Congress 2025, HPE\u2019s showcase will feature live demos highlighting how HPE can help customers automate operations to reduce costs and speed time to deployment, as well as its vision of the future of wired and wireless connectivity, with new solutions from its edge compute, Private 5G, Wi-Fi, and unified SASE portfolio.\n\nHPE will also provide insight on how customers can prepare their data centers for the demands of AI with the latest turnkey private cloud solutions for AI, discover the power of HPE\u2019s latest servers optimized for telco networks, and generate new revenue through exceptional user experiences with AI-powered campus and branch networking.\n\nDiscover the HPE showcase at booth 3N10, or drop in the HPE meeting center at the Hall 3 VIP entrance.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nRecent HPE News:\n\nAbout Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) is a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze, and act upon data seamlessly. The company innovates across networking, hybrid cloud, and AI to help customers develop new business models, engage in new ways, and increase operational performance.

            "content": "I'm an Android nerd, but it wasn't always that way. If you climb into the Wayback Machine with me, you'll find me using a cheap-feeling, work-provided BlackBerry. When I switched jobs and didn't get to carry one around, I went out and bought one.\n\nIt was a device ahead of its time, and I was hooked. When Android came out, I also bought a T-Mobile G1 and carried two phones around for a while because my BlackBerry Curve was just ... better. They weren't built better; they weren't faster or more efficient, and there were no amazing games. However, BlackBerry was the king of communicating with people because of that keyboard.\n\nAndroid & Chill (Image credit: Future) One of the web's longest-running tech columns, Android & Chill is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.\n\nAndroid eventually caught up in its own way, and I stopped using my trusty old BlackBerry. I did flirt with the marriage of the two with the BlackBerry Priv and KEY2 (such great phones) but had to move on and experience the newer offerings from other companies. That doesn't mean I don't miss that small screen/physical keyboard experience, though, and the new Clicks Keyboard for Android might be the best way to return to what I love.\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to mention that I have a personal relationship with Michael Fisher (Mr. Mobile) and Kevin Michaluk (CrackBerry Kevin), the founders of Clicks. That's not why I want one for my Motorola Razr, though, and I haven't even asked for an early model, so I have to wait until May.\n\nThis is also not a sponsored post, and I do not roll that way; I would never do business with people I know, no matter how much I want their product.\n\nThis is just Jerry being a fanboy about a new product. I want one because I think it's so damn cool and might let me use my phone the way I love to use my phone. At least, I hope it will.\n\nI'm not a big accessories guy. I know that's a bit strange coming from a person who works at a place that tells you about and recommends the best accessories for your phone. I don't even use a case or a screen protector. If you told me I would be excited about a phone case last week, I would have chuckled. I did think the initial Clicks cases were cool, but they were only made for iPhones, which I never plan on buying.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThat's changed now that Clicks announced it is making them for real phones , such as Android phones, the Galaxy S25, the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, and the 2024 Razr Plus. And yes, it works for the Razr \"Minus,\" according to Clicks' website. I'm all in now.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nA physical keyboard is a fast way to polarize Android users. There seems to be no middle ground; you either love them or you think they are stupid, clunky, and old-fashioned. That's a great thing because everyone should figure out what they like and don't like. If you haven't guessed already, I'm in the \"love them\" camp.\n\nI think it's because of the way I use my phone. To me, my phone is the best way to communicate with the people I care about. I message friends and family on three different continents, and to me, the smartphone was the best invention of the 20th century.\n\nI know I can use Gboard to do everything I could do (and more) with a physical keyboard because I'm doing it now. Or I could install another keyboard if I wanted. Trust me when I tell you it's not the same and never can be. That tactile feel of a key under your thumb is something the advancements in haptic feedback will never be able to replicate.\n\n(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)\n\nA Clicks keyboard case on my Moto Razr will also get me to use the front screen more. Right now, it's just a way to see the time and the weather because I'm not going to try using an app on that small screen with my fingers. I know I can do a lot more, but I can't do a lot more. A keyboard extension can change that, and my Razr may turn into the modern-day equivalent of my BlackBerry Curve, running much better software. And if I need the bigger screen, I can flip that sucker open and do whatever I need to do. Heck, even I play games on my phone sometimes.\n\nMost of the two billion Android users aren't going to care or be interested in what Clicks is offering, though I hope the company does well enough to offer the case for even more Android phones. That includes the Pixel 8a because my wife was a BlackBerry fan too, and she loves her little green Pixel.\n\nNow I have to play the waiting game until my order ships. I hope it lives up to my unrealistic expectations or at least brings me closer to what I really want.",

            "content": "Five months ago, iOS 18 began rolling out, and that meant Android and iPhone users could finally text over RCS. Well, most of them. There's a hold up with several smaller carriers, and it seems Apple is to blame.\n\nWhy Does RCS Matter?\n\nBefore we start pointing fingers, let's talk about what RCS actually is and why widespread support for it matters. RCS is essentially the upgraded version of the old SMS standard. It makes classic text messaging feel a lot more like modern instant messenger apps.\n\nRCS features include the ability to see when someone is typing, read reciepts on messages (if they enable it), emote reactions, and much higher quality photos and videos. If you're reading this as an iPhone owner, RCS probably sounds a lot like iMessage\u2013and you'd be right. The cool thing about RCS, though, is you can enjoy those same features with your Android friends, too.\n\nJoe Fedewa / How-To Geek\n\nThat last part is the key to why getting RCS support on as many devices as possible is important. It drastically improves the text messaging experience between iPhones and Android phones, but that's can't happen if iPhone owners on certain carriers can't enable RCS.\n\nU.S. Carriers Without RCS Support on iPhone\n\nApple provides a full list of carrier support and features for the iPhone in various parts of the world. There are over 40 carriers listed for the U.S., and a surprising number of them still lack \"RCS messaging\" as a feature. The big carriers\u2013AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon\u2013all have it, but many of their MVNOs do not. Here are a few of the more popular MVNOs still lacking RCS support on iPhones:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCox Mobile\n\nGoogle Fi Wireless (not listed at all)\n\nMint Mobile\n\nSimple Mobile\n\nTing\n\nUltra Mobile\n\nLast December, an iOS update expanded support for RCS to many smaller carriers, such as Boost Mobile and Visible. But there are people stuck waiting for RCS support to come to their iPhone because of the carrier they use. These carriers, by the way, all have RCS support on Android devices\u2013this is specifically an iPhone problem.\n\nI first noticed this issue when my partner switched from T-Mobile to Google Fi in January. We had been enjoying RCS messaging between her iPhone and my Android phone, but then it suddenly wasn't working anymore. That's when I discovered we weren't the only ones left out in the cold.\n\nWho's Fault is it?\n\nCorbin Davenport / How-To Geek\n\nLet's get down to business. Who should we be blaming this on? Is it Google's fault since they operate Google Fi? Or does Apple have something to do with it? According to Google, it's entirely up to Apple. The company had this to say in a statement to 9to5Google last September:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have been working for a long time to accelerate the adoption of RCS, and are excited that Apple is taking steps to adopt RCS with the launch of iOS 18. At launch, Fi users with an Android phone will be able to communicate over RCS with iPhone users that have RCS interoperability enabled. Only Apple has the ability to enable RCS interoperability for iPhone users on Fi, and our hope is that they will do so in the near future.\"\n\nThat sounds pretty straightforward, but Google is not some pillar of honesty. It's a company like any other. In researching this issue, I found contradictory opinions on the matter, claiming Google (and other MVNOs) have to enable it themselves. But that didn't make much sense to me. Why would Google spend years trying to get Apple to adopt RCS only to leave out their own customers on iPhones?\n\nThe answer is, they wouldn't. This indeed Apple's doing, and it all has to do with carrier bundles. A carrier bundle is essentially a collection of settings and customizations related to a specific carrier. Things like voice mail numbers, MMS and APN settings, tethering, etc. When someone activates a SIM, the iPhone grabs the appropriate bundle to get things working.\n\nSo, what seems to be happening is Apple hasn't included RCS messaging in all its carrier bundles. Google Fi and the other MVNOs that are not directly owned by one of the big three networks are most likely using generic catch-all carrier bundles that don't have RCS messaging. The big carriers and their subsidies have custom carrier bundles.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's why T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile have RCS messaging on iPhone, but Google Fi and Mint Mobile, which use T-Mobile's network, do not. Until these unsupported carriers get their own custom bundles, they're likely stuck without RCS.\n\nIt Might Not Be That Simple\n\nUnfortunately, the situation is not as simple as I'd like to believe. A lot of the information about carrier bundles is not made available to the public. I'm not totally clear on how the relationship with Apple and carriers works, but it's possible Apple is not the only guilty party.\n\nSome people claim that carriers pay to register their custom bundles, and then those are made available to phone vendors, such as Apple. If a carrier does not pay for a custom bundle, it uses a generic one. Google Fi is allegedly one of the carriers that does not pay for a custom profile.\n\nThere are other claims that it has to do with selling iPhones. Some say a carrier needs to sell a certain number of iPhones for Apple to implememnt a custom carrier bundle. Others claim it's just about selling iPhones at all\u2013which Google Fi does not\u2013but Mint Mobile and some of the other MVNOs without RCS support do sell iPhones. It's all very speculative.\n\nAt the end of the day, all we really have is Google's word on the subject, but one thing is certain: this sucks for customers. It's incredibly frustrating that RCS has been available on iPhones for over five months and there are still people who can't use it. Someone needs to fix this ASAP.",

            "content": "Did you finally make the leap from an older phone to a new iPhone 16E or another model? Not only can it seem like a hassle to transfer your data, but you also want to make sure everything gets moved over safely. That way you can explore the new Apple Intelligence features and customize the most important iOS 18 features instead of troubleshooting where your data went sideways.\n\nFortunately, it's easier than ever to shift your data from the phone you have now -- even if it's an Android model -- to a new iPhone.\n\nI'm here to break down the four ways to easily transfer your data from your old phone to your new iPhone, whether you're starting with a new iPhone 16 or a different model replacing your old phone.\n\nIf you're upgrading your current phone to the latest operating system, here's how to download iOS 18, as well as our review of iOS 18. And if it's an iPhone 15 Pro or later, get up to speed on what Apple Intelligence offers.\n\nFor more, explore a bunch of hidden iOS 18 features, and learn everything you can do with iPhone 16's new Camera Button.\n\nRead more: A Billion Pixels a Second: A Rare Look Inside Apple's Secret iPhone 16 Camera Labs\n\n1. Restore from iCloud\n\n\n\nDuring the setup process, you'll be asked if you want to directly transfer apps and information from your old iPhone to your new one using Quick Start. This feature was first rolled out with iOS 12.4, so if it's been several years since you've upgraded phones, it'll be the first time you've seen the option. The easiest and quickest method to set up your new iPhone is to restore from a recent iCloud backup. As you walk through the initial setup process, tap Restore from iCloud Backup, sign in with your Apple Account (previously called Apple ID before iOS 18) and then pick the most recent backup of your old iPhone.\n\nIf the backup is more than a day or two old, take an extra few minutes to create a new backup. To do so, open the Settings app on your old phone, search for iCloud Backup in the Search field at the top of the screen and then click the matching result. Click Back Up Now to update the cloud backup.\n\nOnce that finishes, go back to your new iPhone and select the backup you just created as what you want to use to restore from.\n\nYour phone will then restore your settings and preferences, and you'll be able to start using it in about 15 minutes. It will continue downloading your installed apps in the background.\n\nOnce everything is restored, you'll need to sign back into any accounts you added to your phone, as well as go through your apps and make sure you're still signed in.\n\nYou've got several options when it comes to setting up your new iPhone. James Martin/CNET\n\n2. Apple direct transfer\n\nIf you do not have a recent iCloud backup or your Internet connection is slow, you can transfer everything from iPhone to iPhone, either wirelessly or via cable. When the Quick Start process asks for the source, choose the direct transfer option.\n\nMake sure you have both phones (preferably plugged in and charging to ensure they don't run out of battery), a Wi-Fi connection and enough time for the process to finish -- it could take over an hour. You can speed up that process by connecting both phones using a USB cable, but note that you might need an adapter if your current phone is an iPhone 14 or earlier with a Lightning port. Apple has more details on how to make a wired transfer work.\n\nThe more information you have on your phone, like photos in your camera roll, the longer it will take. When the transfer starts, the phones will show you a time estimate. Every time we've used this tool, that estimate has been accurate within a couple of minutes. It's worth taking the time if you don't use Apple's iCloud service to back up your phone.\n\n3. Use a Mac or PC\n\n\n\nThe method I use with every new iPhone is to restore from an encrypted backup using a Mac or PC. Not only does this process transfer all of your apps, settings and preferences, but it also means you don't have to sign into the countless apps you have on your phone.\n\nBefore you can use this method, you'll need to create an encrypted backup of your current iPhone. I know that may sound intimidating or overly complicated, but it only means you have to check an extra box and enter a password.\n\nOn a Mac, you'll use Finder to back up your old iPhone. We outlined the steps when Apple killed iTunes. Just make sure to check the Encrypt backup box and enter a password you'll remember when prompted. Let your Mac go to work, creating a backup file. It will let you know when it's done.\n\nRestore your data from a backup of your old iPhone using your computer. Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nOn a PC, you'll need to use iTunes (it's not completely dead) to create a backup. That process is explained here. Again, you'll need to make sure the Encrypt backup box is checked and enter a password.\n\nTo restore your new phone, open Finder or iTunes, and connect your phone to your computer. Click Trust when prompted, and then follow the prompts, selecting the backup you just created as what you want to use to restore the phone. You will need to enter the backup's password before the process begins, so make sure you don't forget it.\n\nOnce it's done, your new phone will be an exact copy of your old phone and you won't have to spend any time signing into apps or random accounts.\n\n4. Move to iOS for Android users\n\nApple doesn't have many Android apps listed in Google's Play Store, but Move to iOS is one of them. This free app will connect your Android phone to a new iPhone and allow you to transfer the most important information from one phone to the other.\n\nHere's the entire step-by-step process, as well as some caveats, like the fact that it won't transfer any locally stored music or PDF files.\n\nApple made an Android app called Move to iOS that makes moving your messages, photos, videos and more from an Android phone to an iPhone easy. Patrick Holland/CNET\n\nApple said it has redesigned Move to iOS to make it faster and easier to migrate from your Android phone to your new iPhone. The company goes on to say it has sped up Wi-Fi migration with transfer speeds up to 5GHz, and you can use Wi-Fi on your iPhone to connect to your Android phone. You can also connect your Android phone to your new iPhone with a USB-C or USB-C to Lightning cable to move everything over more quickly, Apple said.\n\nNo matter the process you used to set up your new phone, you're in for excitement and fun as you explore what it can do.\n\nHere is what you can do with the new iPhone 16 camera button and your monthly reminder to clear your iPhone cache.",

This can be inconvenient and annoying when you\u2019re trying to link up with friends or family at the resort, track your vertical, manage your digital ski pass, and post photos and videos from the slopes. However, a new report from leading research firm Opensignal found that T-Mobile, the country\u2019s largest 5G network, has the fastest network with the most consistent quality experience and the best 5G Ikon and Epic ski resorts nationwide.\n\nFindings Of The T-Mobile Report\n\nT-Mobile customers at Ikon and Epic resorts have average overall download speeds that are nearly twice as fast as Verizon and AT&T customers. Download speeds are essential when you\u2019re trying to access your favorite ski apps and view trail maps. These findings mean that skiers and riders can more easily check double black diamond routes before getting off the lift.\n\nT-Mobile customers have the most consistent quality experience at Epic and Ikon ski resorts when you need it. So when you\u2019re trying to coordinate apr\u00e9s-ski hangs, T-Mobile has a more consistent experience with better quality experience.\n\nT-Mobile has the best 5G coverage. From the lodge to the bunny hill and beyond, T-Mobile has the best 5G coverage at Ikon and Epic ski resorts across the country. After all, the benefits of 5G are best experienced in the places you live, work, and play.\n\nThis is all on top of T-Mobile\u2019s already great benefits for travelers on its best plans, including free in-flight Wi-Fi, AAA membership on them for one year, 15% off at Hilton brands worldwide, and free voice and high-speed data in over 210 international destinations with no roaming fees. T-Mobile\u2019s 5G coverage also spans more highway miles than any other carrier, which comes in handy for those weekend ski trips.\n\nPlanning a ski trip can be stressful and overwhelming, and all that much more, when you can\u2019t stay connected and access the apps needed to make the most of your trip. However, T-Mobile, America\u2019s largest and fastest 5G network, makes a ski trip easier than ever.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\n\u201cFirst responders are the backbone of public safety, and they deserve the most advanced 5G technology to support them when lives are on the line,\u201d said Callie Field, President, T-Mobile Business Group. \u201cWith T-Priority, T-Mobile is providing public safety agencies and first responders with the innovative solutions they need to stay prepared, respond faster and protect the communities they serve, empowering them to lead in times of crisis and shape the future of emergency response.\u201d\n\nThe 5G Era of Public Safety Is Here\n\nT-Priority, initially announced at the company\u2019s Capital Markets Day, was purpose-built for the millions of first responders in the U.S., addressing their urgent need for reliable and resilient connectivity. In fact, 64% of first responders cited an unreliable network as their main communications concern in a recent survey. Many are still held back by outdated 4G infrastructure and problems like congestion, insufficient speeds and coverage gaps. To tackle these connectivity barriers, T-Priority offers first responders benefits like:\n\n\n\nMore capacity: 40% more 5G capacity than other providers to help more first responders stay connected to more devices. And this is augmented by T-Mobile\u2019s innovative network slice. The network slice acts like a traffic cop that directs network traffic, ensuring first responders get the best possible experience with up to 5 times the resources of the average user. And in rare times of extreme congestion, it can dynamically dedicate more capacity to first responders.\n\n40% more 5G capacity than other providers to help more first responders stay connected to more devices.

And in rare times of extreme congestion, it can dynamically dedicate more capacity to first responders. Faster speeds: T-Mobile delivers 2.5 times faster speeds on average than other providers for data-intensive communications. And, again, the network slice uplevels this by providing lower latency and faster speeds more consistently with the highest priority across all 5G bands.\n\nT-Mobile delivers 2.5 times faster speeds on average than other providers for data-intensive communications. And, again, the network slice uplevels this by providing lower latency and faster speeds more consistently with the highest priority across all 5G bands. Closing coverage gaps: In addition to operating the nation\u2019s largest 5G network, T-Mobile is launching T-Mobile Starlink later this year\n\nThis is all possible because T-Priority is powered by T-Mobile\u2019s 5G standalone (SA) network \u2014 the most advanced type of 5G network. While most operators initially relied on LTE-based non-standalone technology, T-Mobile was the first provider in the world to deploy a commercial 5G SA core, enabling critical innovations like network slicing. With T-Priority, T-Mobile is providing first responders with a dedicated slice of its 5G SA network to give them more capacity, faster 5G speeds and the highest priority \u2014 reinforcing its leadership in delivering the most advanced, reliable and scalable solutions for public safety. Plus, T-Mobile\u2019s 5G SA offers state of the art security \u2014 helping ensure uninterrupted service even in the face of sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nThe Most Advanced 5G Ecosystem for First Responders\n\nFirst responders rely on a vast ecosystem of purpose-built tools \u2014 from drones and AI-powered applications to deployables that boost coverage in the field. Many of these tools still operate on 4G or, at best, non-standalone 5G.

            "content": "Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nVerizon vs. T-Mobile: Who does 5G home internet better?\n\n5G home internet has been making a lot of noise lately. So, you probably already know that T-Mobile and Verizon are the top players in the game. These two telecom companies dominate the 5G fixed wireless internet space and often compete for customers. But which provider offers an overall better service?\n\nCNET picks T-Mobile Home Internet as the better internet service provider due to its wide availability. You can find coverage in more locations across the country (including rural areas), offering internet connectivity to more people. Verizon 5G home internet has faster speeds but falls short on coverage. In recent years, T-Mobile has also performed better than Verizon when it comes to customer satisfaction. Plus, T-Mobile is usually seen in the top spots for ISP customer satisfaction in the latest 2024 J.D. Power Survey and the 2024 American Customer Satisfaction Index, too.\n\nOffering broadband services in rural areas is important. But in order to maintain competition, T-Mobile Home Internet and Verizon 5G Home Internet must also appeal to urban and suburban customers. T-Mobile has been making headlines by introducing three new plans with faster speeds and some streaming perks that compete with Verizon's perks and streaming add-ons. But keep in mind that overall, the best internet provider for you might be the one that caters to your needs and what's available in your area.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nWe'll give you the key facts on these two providers so you can make an informed decision. We've compiled exhaustive research on speed, pricing, customer care and more to help make that choice easier. Let's dive into the details on Verizon and T-Mobile's home internet plans.\n\nNote: All prices listed on this page reflect available discounts for setting up paperless billing. If you decide not to go with automatic monthly payments, your price will be higher.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet Better coverage and reaches more rural areas Our take - T-Mobile Home Internet is still fairly new on the block, but it's got the widest reach of any fixed wireless internet provider. By utilizing its 4G LTE network and the expanding 5G grid, T-Mobile has aggressively expanded its coverage map and offered its services to more households than Verizon's 5G solution.

That's great news for our phones and other smart gadgets connecting over cellular airwaves. And it could be a game changer for our homes, too. With the potential for near-gigabit speeds over the air that rival cable and fiber internet service providers -- plus the added appeal of straightforward, consumer-friendly terms that ditch data caps, equipment fees and the like -- 5G is shaping up to become one of the most exciting developments in residential internet in years.\n\nT-Mobile\n\n5G signals are extremely convenient -- much more convenient than installing a fiber or cable network -- but the signal doesn't reach everywhere. The first hurdle with 5G home internet service is whether it's available at your address. Though you may get cell service from T-Mobile or Verizon, that doesn't automatically mean you'll get home internet at your address.\n\nVerizon and T-Mobile are the providers doing the most to expand the 5G's availability for home internet use, though the providers recently found a new competitor in AT&T's 5G home internet rollout, AT&T Internet Air. AT&T does not boast the same availability as Verizon or T-Mobile, with a coverage of just 14% of the US, according to the FCC. However, all providers offer dedicated 5G fixed wireless home internet plans that promise fast speeds and simple terms at competitive rates. In some areas, you might even find that your home is serviceable by both Verizon and T-Mobile, as CNET's own Eli Blumenthal discovered in his quest to replace his cable provider.\n\nIf we take a second look at customer satisfaction data, we'll find that 5G internet continues to impress customers, significantly more than wired cable, fiber, DSL or satellite internet services. Time will tell how much 5G stands to disrupt the ISP category. For now, let's continue our look at how Verizon 5G Home and T-Mobile Home Internet match up.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs T-Mobile Home Internet: Plans and pricing\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nAre you tired of deciphering which broadband package to choose out of countless options? Both Verizon and T-Mobile lean into providing a no-strings-attached broadband experience, a welcome relief for many internet users. Each provider offers simplified 5G home internet plans requiring no term agreements, no data caps and no additional monthly equipment fees.\n\nThere are two plan options for Verizon: Verizon 5G Home and Verizon 5G Home Plus. Verizon 5G Home comes with a two-year price guarantee and lower download speeds, while Verizon 5G Home Plus locks in your price for three years, plus higher download speeds and a slew of additional perks, which we'll outline in the perks and promos section below.\n\nT-Mobile now offers three home internet plans, though two of them feature the same speeds. T-Mobile Home Rely Internet costs $50 monthly for speeds ranging between 87 to 318Mbps download and 14-56 upload. T-Mobile Amplified Internet Plus costs $60 for speeds ranging from 133 to 415Mbps download and 12 to 55Mbps upload and T-Mobile All-In Internet costs $70 monthly for the same speeds but with and includes a mesh Wi-Fi router to extend the range of coverage throughout the house and 24/7 \"interactive video support,\" according to T-Mobile's website.\n\nT-Mobile also recently rolled out its Home Internet Backup plan that you can use in the case of power or internet outages or during natural disasters interrupting connectivity. For $20 a month, you get up to 130GB -- which is admittedly, not very much, but this internet option isn't intended for heavy or regular usage. In fact, T-Mobile offers this internet option as a backup to your current internet provider.\n\nWhich is faster?\n\nWhile 5G can reach gigabit download speeds and Verizon advertises its 5G Home Plus plan as maxing out at 1,000Mbps, don't expect those top-end numbers from either provider's home internet product. T-Mobile says on its site that customers can expect \"average download speeds in excess of 100Mbps,\" and that people typically experience ranges from 87 to 318Mbps. Why so relatively low? T-Mobile Home Internet relies on its growing 5G grid and existing 4G LTE network to expedite its availability. So don't expect a pure 5G experience. Still, thanks to upgraded gateway routers, T-Mobile can offer faster speeds on average than previously offered, meaning you could see speeds up to 415Mbps (though probably not consistently). CNET's Amanda Kooser discovered that her speeds were inconsistent after trying out T-Mobile Home Internet at home.\n\n\"During congestion, Home Internet customers may notice speeds lower than other customers due to data prioritization,\" reads the first sentence of T-Mobile Home Internet's general terms. \"Service may be slowed, suspended, terminated, or restricted for misuse, abnormal use, interference with our network or ability to provide quality service to other users.\" In other words, you may experience some slowed internet speeds during peak hours, like after 5 p.m. Unlike with data caps, however, there's no allotment of \"priority data\" and no overage fees for consuming too much data.\n\nOn the other hand, Verizon tells its subscribers to expect average download speeds of around 300Mbps. Verizon's dependence on its Ultra Wideband 5G network (and lesser use of its \"4G LTE backup\") is the main reason for the faster speeds. It uses low-band, midband and millimeter-wave technology to offer speeds that could get as high as 1,000Mbps for some lucky people.\n\nWhich offers the best value?\n\nWhen trying to gauge the best deal for your home, it's essential to look at the cost per Mbps to better understand the actual value.\n\nConsidering the average download speed of 100Mbps for that basic $50 monthly fee, T-Mobile Home Rely Internet rings in at 50 cents per Mbps, comparable to what you might pay for a midrange cable internet plan. If you have a qualifying Go5G Plus or Magenta Max mobile plan, you can trim that to $30 a month or 30 cents per Mbps. T-Mobile Home Amplified Internet comes in at 60 cents comparatively, a steep price without a bundling discount, while T-Mobile All-In Internet rings in at 70 cents.\n\nVerizon 5G Home, which averages 125Mbps, matches that amount at a cost per Mbps of 40 cents. If you choose the Verizon 5G Plus plan, which averages 300Mbps, your monthly bill is $70, but that cost per Mbps goes down to just under 24 cents. Customers with qualifying Verizon mobile plans will get $15 to $25 off the monthly cost of either plan. If you can use that additional discount, it makes Verizon 5G Home -- the regular plan at 28 cents per Mbps and the Plus plan at an even better 15 cents per Mbps -- one of the most affordable out there compared to any cable internet plans by competitors.\n\nWhat about the fine print?\n\nLet's revisit that idea of the no-strings-attached internet experience. Verizon and T-Mobile are eager to get customers to try their 5G home internet offerings, so no hidden fees or taxes are added to the monthly cost. As we mentioned before, there's no contract or data cap. There's also no additional equipment rental fee, installation fee or other trap fees (although T-Mobile does charge a one-time, $35 activation fee), so it's a win-win for both providers and their customers.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet: Who can sign up?\n\nFCC\n\nNeither provider offers a detailed coverage map for its 5G home internet solution. However, considering the list of cities they claim to cover and the total number of households, T-Mobile is clearly in the lead here.\n\nWhile Verizon 5G Home Internet is available to approximately 40 million homes nationwide, T-Mobile Home Internet reaches over 50 million households and serves almost 60% of the US population. In contrast, Verizon's 5G service is now available in more than 2,700 cities, covering only 21% of the country.\n\nOverall, T-Mobile Home Internet has just over six million customers (according to a recent report in the fourth quarter of 2024.), while Verizon's latest earnings report shows that the company has added one million subscribers, putting its subscriber base at just over four million. That's a sizable piece of the broadband pie for both upstart fixed wireless offerings.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet: Deals and promotions\n\nStill not convinced by the straightforward terms both T-Mobile and Verizon put forward? They'll try to sway you with their promotional offers.\n\nFirst, T-Mobile and Verizon are so confident in their 5G home products that each offers to pay off any early termination fees for new customers who break their current ISP contract, up to $500 for Verizon and $750 from T-Mobile.\n\nSecond, they each offer similar discounts for eligible mobile customers. T-Mobile and Verizon will shave off $15 to $25 if you bundle your home internet with eligible mobile plans.\n\nVerizon also offers some solid perks. All Verizon plans include a price lock of up to five years. Depending on which plan you sign up for, you can expect a $100 to $200 Verizon gift card. Verizon also offers customers a free year-long Netflix and Max subscription (with ads).\n\nComparatively, T-Mobile's latest deal for new customers who sign up online is a prepaid Mastercard card worth $300. The All-In Home Internet plan also features Hulu (with ads) plus a Paramount Plus subscription.\n\nBoth Verizon and T-Mobile offer a price lock for internet, with Verizon pledging a five-year price lock for all plans.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet: What do customers think?\n\nWe refer to two of the top customer satisfaction surveys within our ISP reviews -- J.D. Power and the American Customer Satisfaction Index -- and they consistently place T-Mobile and Verizon at the top of their rankings. Verizon 5G scored just 605 points to T-Mobile's 649 in the J.D. Power study. As the national average in that study was 630, T-Mobile performed extremely well.\n\nACSI\n\nOn the other hand, T-Mobile Home Internet impressively led all nonfiber ISPs with 76 out of 100, well above the ACSI industry average of 68 points. But can you guess which provider was right behind it? Verizon 5G Home Internet took second place, scoring 74 points.\n\nAnecdotally, one of our CNET writers tested T-Mobile during its pilot program and preferred it over his previous provider, Xfinity.\n\nSo, which is it?\n\nT-Mobile and Verizon are still aggressively building their 5G networks, so we're closer to the story's beginning than the middle or end, especially regarding 5G fixed wireless internet overall.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet has a slight edge over Verizon 5G Home Internet in availability and customer satisfaction. Adding its 4G LTE network to 5G makes it a much more viable pick, particularly in rural and underserved areas of the country, where it's a compelling alternative to options like satellite or DSL. Verizon 5G Home Internet takes the lead in performance, featuring nearly triple the current download speeds of T-Mobile Home Internet with the addition of more enticing perks and bundles. As such, T-Mobile may have the upper hand now, but Verizon seems poised to provide a higher upside in the immediate future as the best fixed wireless internet in cities where the two overlap.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet FAQs\n\nIs T-Mobile Home Internet better than Verizon 5G Home? It depends on how you define \"better.\" T-Mobile Home Internet is available to more households than Verizon 5G Home Internet, so it's got the edge there. Verizon 5G Home boasts a higher average download speed (300Mbps), so it can claim a win in that category. Ultimately, the product that will be best for you is the one that's available at your address and can provide enough download speed to enable your household to do what it needs to do. Show more\n\nWhich internet service provider has the best 5G coverage? Not to sound like a broken record, but it depends on how you define \"best 5G coverage.\" If you're looking strictly at the number of people covered, T-Mobile Home Internet is the ISP with the best 5G coverage. If you define \"best\" by which provider has the better download speed performance, then the winner is Verizon 5G Home Internet. It has a top end of 300Mbps compared to T-Mobile's 245Mbps. Verizon 5G Home Plus is even better, with a maximum of 1,000Mbps in some areas.\n\nCan you work from home using Verizon 5G Home or T-Mobile Home Internet? Yes. Verizon 5G Home Internet and T-Mobile Home Internet should provide near or above the FCC's broadband speed definition of at least 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload. Both fixed wireless products, in urban and suburban areas, won't give you as many options as some cable and fiber providers. On the flip side, Verizon 5G Home and T-Mobile Home Internet are cheaper (especially with their mobile discounts) and you'll have the opportunity to try them out at very little risk to see if they'll be adequate for your home office needs.

Learn more\n\nSince T-Mobile acquired Mint Mobile in early 2024, it's become easier to differentiate the two entities and their respective offerings, which all run on T-Mobile's nationwide network.\n\nMint Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that offers some of the best cheap cell phone plans with its prepaid options for budget-conscious users or those with more typical and casual needs, like making calls, messaging, and using basic apps. T-Mobile is a major carrier that offers prepaid and postpaid plans with perks and premium features, including prioritized data, for higher prices.\n\nGiven their matching coverage, the choice between Mint Mobile and T-Mobile essentially comes down to your budget and data needs.\n\nMint Mobile (Introductory 3-Month Plans) All of Mint Mobile's three-month plans are discounted for new customers. Starting at just $15/month, you can get discounted rates on plans from 5GB up to unlimited monthly data and gain access to T-Mobile's network for unlimited calls and texts from our favorite MVNO. Check price at Mint Mobile\n\nT-Mobile Plans T-Mobile offers prepaid and postpaid plans that include truly unlimited monthly data, copious hot spot data, and other high-end features, with a larger variety of perks for the more expensive postpaid unlimited plans. Check price at T-Mobile\n\nPlan offerings\n\nMint Mobile and T-Mobile offer prepaid plans. Prepaid plans are often budget-friendly, with fewer premium features than many postpaid plans. Prepaid plans historically provided more flexibility than postpaid plans, like T-Mobile's mainstream plans, as they aren't based on contracts, and users could pay monthly (at the beginning of the month) without incurring early termination fees when canceling or changing plans.\n\nHowever, T-Mobile's postpaid plans are also now paid monthly and no longer based on contracts, so you won't be charged an early termination fee. The major difference is that you pay at the end of the month, and they're usually more expensive due to their premium features.\n\nWhile Mint Mobile's plans are less expensive than T-Mobile's, Mint Mobile's offerings are relatively inflexible as far as prepaid plans go. They require upfront payment for three, six, or 12 months, with the 12-month option being the most cost-effective. You won't get a prorated refund if you want to cancel service or change to a cheaper plan before your current plan's period ends.\n\nTo help you determine whether Mint Mobile is right for you in the long term, the MVNO offers a new customer promotion with discounted prepaid rates on any data plan over three months, starting at $15/month.\n\nMeanwhile, T-Mobile's prepaid offerings are paid monthly and extend more flexibility. Conversely, they're more expensive than Mint Mobile's comparatively inflexible plans.\n\nMint Mobile and T-Mobile Prepaid offer unlimited and less expensive limited data plans, all of which feature standard data subject to deprioritized speeds behind higher-paying T-Mobile customers.\n\nMint Mobile and T-Mobile prepaid plans\n\nPlan Mint Mobile (12 months per line) T-Mobile (1- 4 lines) Features 5GB $15/month N/A Standard data.

Many also include discounts on streaming services.\n\nT-Mobile postpaid plans\n\nT-Mobile postpaid plans 1-5 lines price Premium data Hot spot Other features, perks, and discounts Essentials Saver $50/month, $80/month, $100/month, $100/month, $125/month 50GB Unlimited 3G speed Taxes & fees not included.

Voicemail to text. $5/month watch or tablet line.\n\nPremium features\n\nAs a budget carrier, Mint Mobile offers substantially fewer high-end features than T-Mobile, which includes various advantages and perks to entice customers into paying higher monthly fees, as detailed below.\n\n\"Unlimited\" limits\n\nWhile Mint previously capped its unlimited data plans at 40GB a month, the MVNO now offers truly unlimited data. However, unlimited customers who use more than 35GB of monthly data are subject to deprioritized speeds behind Mint's lower data tiers in contested areas.\n\nT-Mobile's unlimited data plans are also truly unlimited, and data speeds will remain as fast as the network allows. The only exception is customers with standard data (versus premium data) may experience temporarily reduced speeds during times of network congestion (more on that below).\n\nPremium data\n\nOnly T-Mobile's postpaid plans include premium data, which is prioritized over the standard data on Mint Mobile and T-Mobile prepaid plans.\n\nPremium data is as fast as the network allows at all times within your premium data allotment. In contrast, standard data can be temporarily deprioritized and artificially slowed when the network is congested in a given coverage area.\n\nNo doubt, even premium data speeds can be slower than usual depending on signal strength, what kind of network you're connected to, and when the network is congested, but not to the same extent as deprioritized data.\n\nMobile hot spot\n\nMint's and T-Mobile Prepaid's limited data plans offer hot spot data that pulls from your monthly data allotment. However, Mint's unlimited plan and T-Mobile Prepaid's Unlimited Plus plan are limited to 10GB of hot spot data. T-Mobile's Prepaid Unlimited has unlimited hot spot data but at 3G speeds that are likely unusably slow.\n\nT-Mobile's postpaid plans offer much more hot spot data, including up to 50GB with the pricier Go5G Plus and Go5G Next plans. However, the Essentials Saver postpaid plan offers unlimited hot spot data at the same slow 3G speeds as the prepaid Unlimited plan.\n\nSmartwatch connectivity\n\nT-Mobile is your only choice if you want a separate data plan for a data-connected smartwatch. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nMint doesn't offer a plan for smartwatches, while T-Mobile does for prepaid or postpaid customers.\n\nT-Mobile data-connected smartwatch plans start at $12/month. T-Mobile's most expensive Go5G Next postpaid plan reduces the price of a smartwatch plan to $5/month.\n\nFamily or group plans\n\nMint's \"Modern Family\" plan allows group management of plans for up to five lines, but there are no multi-line discounts.\n\nT-Mobile prepaid plans let you add up to four lines with multi-line discounts. The same goes for T-Mobile's postpaid plans, where you can add five lines in an online order or more by calling T-Mobile.\n\nDespite T-Mobile's multi-line discounts, it's worth noting that a multi-line Mint plan is still less expensive than any of T-Mobile's plans. In addition, Mint lets you create family plans with varying data allotments, while T-Mobile doesn't.\n\nOur guide to the best family cell phone plans features both carriers for their high-value, low-cost options.\n\nContracts\n\nThere are no time-based Mint or T-Mobile plan contracts. You can cancel or change plans anytime without incurring early termination fees.\n\nThe only contract you can encounter is if you take advantage of a T-Mobile device deal, like getting four iPhone 16 phones for free with four lines at $25/month or getting the iPhone 15 free. For these device deals, you're committing to at least 24 months with that specific device and an eligible plan. If you break the deal's terms, you need to pay off the remaining balance of the phone based on how many months remain in the 24-month contract.\n\nEssentially, these deals are subsidies for a new phone in exchange for a two-year commitment. They can be worth it if you're sure you'll stay on T-Mobile for at least two years. Otherwise, we recommend buying your phone without a deal if you prefer flexibility.\n\nCoverage\n\nMint Mobile's coverage in the US operates on T-Mobile's network. Mint Mobile\n\nMint Mobile runs on T-Mobile's network, so both have identical coverage in the US. Both have excellent coverage in most cities, most highways, and some suburbs. However, coverage can vary greatly in rural areas.\n\nT-Mobile's map ostensibly differs from Mint's, but the two carriers have the same coverage in the US. T-Mobile\n\nIt's true that Mint's and T-Mobile's coverage maps look different, which is simply proof that coverage maps aren't exactly accurate; as T-Mobile notes in fine print, its map \"approximates anticipated coverage outdoors\" and \"does not guarantee service availability.\"\n\nWhile using coverage maps as a general approximation, you should also figure out whether Mint or T-Mobile has good coverage in your area by asking local friends, family, and neighbors. Expand your survey by asking locals on social media, like Facebook or Nextdoor.\n\nData speeds\n\nMint offers access to T-Mobile's 4G LTE and basic 5G networks with a maximum advertised speed of 357Mbps. That's more than sufficient for data-intensive apps like social media and streaming video and music.\n\nT-Mobile offers its prepaid and postpaid customers access to 4G LTE, basic 5G, and advanced 5G (mmWave and C-band 5G) with a maximum advertised speed of 418Mbps. The only variance is T-Mobile's Essentials Saver plan, which has a maximum advertised speed of 357Mbps.\n\nNote that Mint and T-Mobile Prepaid are subject to temporarily deprioritized data speeds at any time. T-Mobile postpaid customers who exceed their premium data amount are also subject to temporarily deprioritized data.\n\nPerks and discounts\n\nMint has a new customer promotion where you can try any of its three-month plans, even the unlimited plan, for discounted prepaid rates starting at just $15/month, with upfront payments starting at $45/month.\n\nMint also offers deals for its plans if you buy a phone through the MVNO. For example, if you buy the iPhone 16 (the best iPhone for most people) through Mint for $829, you get 12 months of Mint's unlimited plan for $15/month, a 50% discount of $180 off the full $360 cost of a 12-month Unlimited plan. Mint includes the same 12-month unlimited promotion with significant device discounts for some of the best Android phones, including $400 off the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.\n\nT-Mobile Prepaid comes with various perks, including:\n\nT-Mobile Tuesdays offer \"free stuff\" and deals on food, gas, entertainment, and more, which can be claimed in the T-Mobile app.\n\nScam Shield helps identify and block scam calls.\n\nData Maximizer limits video streams to 2.5Mbps, therefore limiting resolution to save data when watching videos on your phone.\n\nCaller ID and WiFi Calling.\n\nT-Mobile postpaid perks vary by plan and can include:\n\nDiscounts on streaming services.\n\nBundled taxes and fees in price.\n\nEnhanced scam protection with Scam Shield Premium.\n\nVoicemail to text.\n\nSmartwatch plan discounts.\n\nCustomer support\n\nMint's mobile app stands out as particularly straightforward and easy to use. Eve Montie/Business Insider\n\nMint has one of the best reputations in the business for customer support, and its app is class-leading for simplicity and user-friendliness. Reaching a customer service representative is quick through the in-app chat function or by phone.\n\nT-Mobile's app is also straightforward with a little more clutter than Mint's, but you can still easily check your account and manage plans. We haven't had a reason to test T-Mobile's customer support yet, so we can't comment on its responsiveness and effectiveness.\n\nWhich should you sign up for?\n\nYour data needs and monthly budget will determine whether Mint Mobile or T-Mobile is the right choice. Eve Montie, Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nMint Mobile and T-Mobile have the same coverage, so that shouldn't be a consideration here as long as you've established that T-Mobile's coverage works for you.\n\nMost people will be happy with Mint for common needs, like making phone calls, messaging, and using basic (rather than intensive) apps over data. The MVNO's low prices are hard to pass up, especially if you know you don't need unlimited data and can opt for a limited data plan. Remember that Mint's best value comes with its 12-month plan options, which are less flexible than T-Mobile Prepaid's month-to-month options but notably more affordable.\n\nT-Mobile's postpaid unlimited plans make more sense for heavy data users who value reliably fast, prioritized speeds from premium data, plenty of hot spot data, and the myriad perks that work to justify the higher costs.",

            "content": "Mint Mobile vs T-Mobile is a question that's no doubt in the minds of many a cell phone user over the past few months, given the incredibly high-profile ads campaign of the former. Both being on the same network makes them directly cross-compatible too - which begs the question, which one's best for you?\n\nOn one side is Mint Mobile, a smaller service that we rank at the very top of our best prepaid phone plans guide. On the other, T-Mobile, a well-established phone plan giant that specializes in offering some of the best unlimited data plans around.\n\nIn short, both are going to appeal to a very different type of user and both have advantages and drawbacks. To help narrow down which is for you, we've put together this direct Mint Mobile vs T-Mobile to see how they stack up when it comes to price, features, speed, and service - including a handy verdict and summary at the bottom of the page.\n\nMint Mobile vs T-Mobile: at a glance\n\nMint Mobile: prepaid plans from $15 per month\n\nMint Mobile is a fantastic prepaid carrier that's been going from strength to strength recently. At Mint, you pay for your plans in allotments of three, six, or twelve months upfront, with the longer plans averaging out as cheaper on average. While you'll have to pay a fair bit upfront, Mint offers four excellent value prepaid plans with great bang for the buck - if you can forgo a few perks and extras, that is. 5GB: $15/mo | 15GB: $20/mo | 20GB: $25/mo | Unl: $30/mo\n\nT-Mobile: unlimited data plans from $34 to $85 per month\n\nT-Mobile specializes in offering feature-laden contract-free unlimited plans that are perfect if you're a heavy user. Starting at $60 a month for a single-line user, you'll be able to cut those per-line prices down by adding multiple's to an account - including getting the third line for free. With HD streaming options, free Netflix accounts, and prioritized 5G data speeds, T-Mobile's a great choice if you're looking to stream a lot of content on the go. Note that as of 2023, the T-Mobile's Magenta plans have been re-branded to \"Go5G\". Overall, the new plans are a little pricier but feature an expanded Mobile Hotspot allowance and more international roaming data.\n\nEssentials: $60/mo | Go5G: $75/mo | Go5G Plus: $90/mo\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Features comparison Row 0 - Cell 0 Mint Mobile T-Mobile Contract length No contract (3 to 12 month plans) No contract (24mo device payments) 5G data Yes (subject to depriotization after 35GB) Yes (usage restrictions on some plans) Video streaming 480p 4K UHD (480p on some plans) Streaming perks No Netflix (w/ Go5G Plus plan) International calling 60 countries Mexico and Canada (Intl. extra) International roaming No Yes (w/ Go5G Plus plan) Mobile hotspotting 10GB cap on unlimited plan Unlimited 3G speed, 50GB max 5G speeds Deprioritization Yes Yes (only after 50GB+ usage) Family plans Yes Yes\n\nPricing\n\nIf you're strictly on a budget, then Mint Mobile is definitely the cheaper of the two options on average. For a single-line user, for example, you'll generally be looking at paying about half ($30 versus $60pm) for Mint Mobile's unlimited data plan versus the similar Essentials Unlimited plan at T-Mobile. You do, however, get a bigger chunk of 'premium' data with the latter - which essentially means your data will stay speedier for longer if you're a heavy user.\n\nKey facts Plan pricing\n\nMint: $15 to $40 per month\n\nT-Mobile: $50 to $100 per month (1-line)\n\nFamily discounts\n\nMint: No (but you pay less upfront)\n\nT-Mobile: Yes (up to 5 lines)\n\n\n\nWhere things start to weigh in T-Mobile's favor is with its excellent family data plan options. Like most major carriers, T-Mobile will give you a discount on each line if you have multiple signed up for one plan. Unlike most major carriers, however, T-Mobile actually throws in the third line for free, which makes its three to four-line options particularly competitive. With three lines on your account, you'll pay just $90 a month for the Essentials plan and $130 for the Go5G plan - the latter of which includes 6 months of Apple TV+ and a free Netflix Standard account.\n\nIt's worth noting here that Mint Mobile does actually have its own family plan, which is a relatively recent addition at the carrier. It's not completely analogous to T-Mobile's as you don't get a per-line discount based on how many lines you add. You do, however, get each line at the cheapest (yearly) rate while only having to pay for three months at a time. It's a handy addition to the carrier's current roster of perks as it can cut down the associated red tape of holding multiple accounts and make the prepaid payments easier to manage.\n\nFeatures, speed and service\n\nAs we've already hinted at, and covered in the comparison table above - T-Mobile offers the most feature-laden plans out of the two carriers, but at a significant cost.\n\nKey facts Plan perks\n\nMint: No\n\nT-Mobile: Netflix, T-Mobile Tuesdays\n\n\n\nFree hotspot\n\nMint: Yes (10GB allowance)\n\nT-Mobile: Yes (up to 50GB allowance)\n\n\n\nInternational roaming\n\nMint: No\n\nT-Mobile: Yes\n\n\n\nInternational calls\n\nMint: free to Can & Mex\n\nT-Mobile: free to Can & Mex\n\n\n\nDepriotization\n\nMint: Yes\n\nT-Mobile: No (plan dependant)\n\n\n\nDepending on the plan you'll be scoring things like a free Netflix account, basic international roaming, and the 'T-Mobile Tuesdays' perks scheme, which gives you access to in-store discounts and giveaways. In comparison, Mint Mobile plans are pretty stripped-down affairs, although you do still get the basics like mobile hotspot allowance and free WiFi calling.\n\nSpeed-wise, both carriers are offering 5G data plans and operating on the greater T-Mobile network. Put simply, both should get comparable speed and service, although it's worth noting that as a prepaid carrier, Mint Mobile is subject to what's called 'deprioritization'. This essentially means that your data speeds may be slowed down if the local area is busy as T-Mobile will always prioritize its own customer's data speeds primarily over those of sub-carriers running on its network. This is a relatively complex issue that may or may not be a big deal depending on your local area. It's also worth noting that some T-Mobile plans are also subject to slower speeds after a certain data allowance is exceeded (50GB on essentials).\n\nIt's also worth noting that as an MVNO Mint Mobile doesn't participate in the large carrier roaming agreements, which can mean worse coverage in areas that aren't specifically covered by T-Mobile network towers. With T-Mobile, if you're in an area with poor coverage the service will essentially 'borrow' coverage from AT&T or Verizon and visa versa.\n\nT-Mobile's nationwide coverage (Image credit: T-Mobile)\n\nWhat about T-Mobile prepaid?\n\nAs well as its more well-known 'postpaid' unlimited plans, T-Mobile also has a number of prepaid plans to check out for those who want a plan on the service, but want to spend a little bit less. The current T-Mobile prepaid plans lineup ranges from a basic 10GB plan for $40 per month to a more premium 'Unlimited Plus' data plan for $60 per month, all of which are available with a multi-line saving (much like the postpaid T-Mobile options).\n\nGenerally speaking, if you're thinking about going prepaid, Mint Mobile looks like the strongest option right now for sheer bang for the buck. Possible deprioritization issues aside, Mint Mobile's basic unlimited plan absolutely smokes the T-Mobile Unlimited Plus plan for outright value. At $30 per month, it's half the price and still features the same mobile hotspot allowance.\n\nThe only scenario where we could see someone opting for a T-Mobile prepaid plan over Mint is if they didn't want to pay for multiple months of data at once. As previously mentioned, Mint Mobile's cheapest average prices can only be had if you buy a whole year of service at once. If you can get past the lump sum upfront, however, Mint is much cheaper in the longer run.\n\nVerdict\n\nBoth Mint Mobile and T-Mobile are absolutely awesome carriers, but they'll definitely each appeal to a different type of user. For those who are really on a budget, and don't mind having just the basics, then Mint Mobile is absolutely the way to go. While T-Mobile is comparatively good value versus the other big carriers (especially with its family plans), you simply can't get the same sort of reasonable data allowances and rock-bottom prices at this carrier versus what Mint offers.\n\nOn the other hand, for those who want a truly unlimited plan, no deprioritization, and HD video streaming, then T-Mobile is going to offer just that. You will, of course, be spending about double for a single-line plan at Mint, but Mint Mobile simply doesn't offer things like unlimited priority data or HD streaming, so it's a fairly easy decision if that's what's important to you.\n\nWhat other carriers should I check out?\n\nT-Mobile as a network has no shortage of excellent sub-carriers (MVNOs) to consider. First up is Metro by T-Mobile, which offers slightly cheaper prepaid plans all around versus its parent company, but still retains a few perks like free music streaming and Amazon Prime membership on the more expensive plans. At a baseline of $40 per month for the 10GB/mo plan, Metro sits somewhere in the middle in regards to value. Boost Mobile is another great choice with plans starting at $25 per month for its excellent basic unlimited plan. Competitively priced versus Mint, Boost also features a basic unlimited data plan for $25 per month, albeit with slightly less mobile hotspot and 5G data allowance versus its competitor.\n\nIf you're looking for more great alternatives, we definitely recommend heading on over to our best cheap cell phone plans guide for an exhaustive list of options.",

            "content": "PRESS RELEASE\n\nBELLEVUE, Wash. \u2014 T-Mobile announced two exciting ways it is reinforcing its commitment to first responder and military customers by introducing two new Essentials plans built just for them. With Essentials First Responder and Essentials Military, the Un-carrier is giving those who serve essential connectivity and the best price for their families compared to blue and red \u2014 all on America\u2019s largest and fastest 5G network. The new Essentials plans are available starting today, Feb. 21.\n\n\u201cWhether serving overseas, responding to emergencies or supporting our communities at home, America\u2019s first responder and military families sacrifice so much,\u201d said Jon Freier, President, T-Mobile Consumer Group. \u201cT-Mobile\u2019s new Essentials plans for Military and First Responders give these heroes what they deserve: hundreds of dollars in savings while getting industry-leading value on the country\u2019s leading 5G network. It\u2019s a small way to give back to those who give us so much.\u201d\n\nEssentials First Responder and Military Plans\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s new Essentials plans offer the best price for first responder and military families compared to AT&T and Verizon. For a family of three, each plan is just $90/month with AutoPay plus taxes and fees \u2014 that\u2019s a savings of nearly 20% each month \u2014 and over $250 annually! \u2014 when switching the whole family to T-Mobile\u2019s Essentials First Responder plan from AT&T\u2019s FirstNet Unlimited. Plus, verified first responder customers have the option to add the nation\u2019s first network slice for first responders for only $7.50/month, giving them priority network access to keep them connected during times of extreme congestion.\n\nThe new First Responder and Military Essentials plans include unlimited talk, text and data, unlimited texting in 215+ countries and destinations worldwide and exclusive benefits just for being customers with Magenta Status. That includes perks from top hotel and car rental brands, concert and movie tickets and access to the nation\u2019s leading 5G network. Plus, those Essentials plan savings get even sweeter with deals to score a free 5G phone on Us with 24 monthly bill credits when joining the Un-carrier.\n\nFirst Responder and Military Customers Get More at T-Mobile\n\nEssentials First Responder and Essentials Military join T-Mobile\u2019s existing Go5G First Responder and Military plans dedicated to these customers, offering more choice and flexibility to suit their needs. Whether it\u2019s just the Essentials (pun intended) or a more perk-packed Go5G First Responder or Military plan with Netflix on Us and free in-flight Wi-Fi, the Un-carrier offers something for everyone. These new plans further demonstrate T-Mobile\u2019s commitment to supporting first responder and military customers \u2014 and their families \u2014 as well as year-round initiatives like hiring 10,000 veterans and military spouses and the Connecting Heroes program, which offers up to $7.7 billion in potential savings through 2030 for first responder agencies.\n\nPlus, with T-Mobile Starlink \u2014 the first and only space-based mobile network in the U.S. \u2014 now in public beta, wireless users across the country (even you, Verizon and AT&T customers) can get access to the largest satellite-to-cell constellation in the U.S. The free beta provides people with critical access to text messaging in the more than 500,000 square miles of the country currently unreached by any carrier\u2019s earth-bound cell towers. More details can be found here.\n\nTo see how the new plans compare to the full lineup of first responder and military offerings at the Un-carrier, check out the chart below:\n\nIt\u2019s Easier than Ever to Switch to the Un-carrier\n\nReady to switch? The Un-carrier is helping people break free from their wireless provider for a limited time. Simply bring an eligible phone and T-Mobile will pay it off up to $800 with a virtual prepaid Mastercard. And switch with confidence knowing that in the event America\u2019s leading 5G network and unbeatable value isn\u2019t for you, T-Mobile will give you $125 back per voice line switched via a virtual prepaid Mastercard if you go back to your old carrier within 30 days.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s new Essentials First Responder and Essentials Military plans are available now.

T-Mobile confirmed to DCD last month that it was the first time T-Priority's first responders have used network slicing.\n\nIn that instance, a 5G slice was enabled directly onto the Los Angeles Fire Department's (LAFD) existing 5G-enabled devices.\n\nNetwork slicing allows operators to create separate and isolated networks for different use cases, while the slice can be tailored for specific use cases.

            "content": "PRESS RELEASE\n\nBELLEVUE, Wash. \u2014 T-Mobile announced two exciting ways it is reinforcing its commitment to first responder and military customers by introducing two new Essentials plans built just for them. With Essentials First Responder and Essentials Military, the Un-carrier is giving those who serve essential connectivity and the best price for their families compared to blue and red \u2014 all on America\u2019s largest and fastest 5G network. The new Essentials plans are available starting today, Feb. 21.\n\n\u201cWhether serving overseas, responding to emergencies or supporting our communities at home, America\u2019s first responder and military families sacrifice so much,\u201d said Jon Freier, President, T-Mobile Consumer Group. \u201cT-Mobile\u2019s new Essentials plans for Military and First Responders give these heroes what they deserve: hundreds of dollars in savings while getting industry-leading value on the country\u2019s leading 5G network. It\u2019s a small way to give back to those who give us so much.\u201d\n\nEssentials First Responder and Military Plans\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s new Essentials plans offer the best price for first responder and military families compared to AT&T and Verizon. For a family of three, each plan is just $90/month with AutoPay plus taxes and fees \u2014 that\u2019s a savings of nearly 20% each month \u2014 and over $250 annually! \u2014 when switching the whole family to T-Mobile\u2019s Essentials First Responder plan from AT&T\u2019s FirstNet Unlimited. Plus, verified first responder customers have the option to add the nation\u2019s first network slice for first responders for only $7.50/month, giving them priority network access to keep them connected during times of extreme congestion.\n\nThe new First Responder and Military Essentials plans include unlimited talk, text and data, unlimited texting in 215+ countries and destinations worldwide and exclusive benefits just for being customers with Magenta Status. That includes perks from top hotel and car rental brands, concert and movie tickets and access to the nation\u2019s leading 5G network. Plus, those Essentials plan savings get even sweeter with deals to score a free 5G phone on Us with 24 monthly bill credits when joining the Un-carrier.\n\nFirst Responder and Military Customers Get More at T-Mobile\n\nEssentials First Responder and Essentials Military join T-Mobile\u2019s existing Go5G First Responder and Military plans dedicated to these customers, offering more choice and flexibility to suit their needs. Whether it\u2019s just the Essentials (pun intended) or a more perk-packed Go5G First Responder or Military plan with Netflix on Us and free in-flight Wi-Fi, the Un-carrier offers something for everyone. These new plans further demonstrate T-Mobile\u2019s commitment to supporting first responder and military customers \u2014 and their families \u2014 as well as year-round initiatives like hiring 10,000 veterans and military spouses and the Connecting Heroes program, which offers up to $7.7 billion in potential savings through 2030 for first responder agencies.\n\nPlus, with T-Mobile Starlink \u2014 the first and only space-based mobile network in the U.S. \u2014 now in public beta, wireless users across the country (even you, Verizon and AT&T customers) can get access to the largest satellite-to-cell constellation in the U.S. The free beta provides people with critical access to text messaging in the more than 500,000 square miles of the country currently unreached by any carrier\u2019s earth-bound cell towers. More details can be found here.\n\nTo see how the new plans compare to the full lineup of first responder and military offerings at the Un-carrier, check out the chart below:\n\nIt\u2019s Easier than Ever to Switch to the Un-carrier\n\nReady to switch? The Un-carrier is helping people break free from their wireless provider for a limited time. Simply bring an eligible phone and T-Mobile will pay it off up to $800 with a virtual prepaid Mastercard. And switch with confidence knowing that in the event America\u2019s leading 5G network and unbeatable value isn\u2019t for you, T-Mobile will give you $125 back per voice line switched via a virtual prepaid Mastercard if you go back to your old carrier within 30 days.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s new Essentials First Responder and Essentials Military plans are available now.

            "content": "At an opening reception during NATE UNITE 2025 in Raleigh, NC, last Monday evening, an American Tower Corp project manager unexpectedly obtained a microphone and brought a lively crowd to silence with a somber announcement: \u201cAn hour ago,\u201d he said, a tower climber fell to his death. His reverent prayer was well received by those in attendance, and news of the fatality quickly spread throughout the industry. However, despite extensive online searches in the following days, no official reports surfaced regarding the incident.\n\nWireless Estimator confirmed on Sunday that Dalton Ray Teater, a 27-year-old tower technician employed by Texas-based RB Telecom Services, LLC, lost his life on February 17, 2025, after falling from a 349-foot guyed tower in Cotton Valley, LA. The incident occurred when he was at approximately the 220-foot level. Details of why he fell will not be known until an OSHA investigation is completed.\n\nIn workplace fatalities, employers are typically advised by legal counsel to refrain from making statements. This cautious approach helps prevent the spread of misinformation that could harm the reputations of the deceased and their employer.\n\nWhen a tower technician dies on a worksite, local or state media outlets usually immediately become aware of the incident, prompting Wireless Estimator to seek further details following their reports. However, Cotton Valley, a small town with a population of just 731, presented unique challenges. Multiple inquiries to the police chief\u2019s Gmail account went unanswered\u2014likely because he was replaced in November following an election, though the town\u2019s website had yet to reflect this change.\n\nA GoFundMe page was established to assist with funeral expenses but provided only minimal details, stating that Teater had \u201ctragically lost his life in a work accident.\u201d\n\nRB Telecom Services was a subcontractor for EasTex Tower, a Longview, TX-based company with a 35-year history and four branch offices, including one in Louisiana. EasTex is one of five companies operating under ONTIVITY.\n\nJustin Huggins, Vice President of National Program Management at ONTIVITY, issued a statement: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the news that an RB Telecom Services employee suffered a fatal fall on February 17, 2025, while performing wireless telecommunications work in Cotton Valley, Louisiana. Our thoughts and condolences go out to the employee\u2019s family and loved ones and all those impacted by this event. Out of respect for the family\u2019s privacy and any investigation that may be performed, we are unable to comment further at this time.\u201d\n\nAn attorney representing RB Telecom Services indicated that further information would be provided once additional details were gathered but has not yet responded to follow-up inquiries.\n\nSources familiar with the incident identified the tower as an American Tower site. However, FCC records show that the structure, built in 2009, is owned by Verizon. It is likely that American Tower is managing the site, given that the company acquired lease rights to 11,324 Verizon towers in 2015 for $5 billion.\n\nDespite multiple requests for information, American Tower has not responded.\n\nAccording to individuals with knowledge of the work being performed, RB Telecom Services was conducting a T-Mobile installation on the tower. Based in Fort Worth, TX, the company holds the necessary licensing to operate in Louisiana.\n\nOSHA\u2019s Baton Rouge Area Office has launched an investigation into the fatality.\n\nTeater is survived by his wife, Kayle Nichole, their two young children, and his parents, Rene\u2019 Williams Teater and Donald Teater.\n\nAlthough the family did not publish an obituary, a service was held on Saturday at Bethel Community Church in Houston, TX.\n\nA spokesperson for the Tower Family Foundation said the organization has reached out to the family to assist with a contribution during their trying times.",

T-Mobile announces that as the official wireless partner of MLB, the Un-carrier is powering the debut of MLB\u2019s automated ball-strike system (ABS) at the major league level for the first time with a private 5G Advanced Network Solution (ANS).\n\nThe 5G-powered ABS system will be featured during spring training games at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida, beginning Feb. 21. T-Mobile also announced that it\u2019s bringing back one of its most popular perks \u2014 free MLB.TV \u2014 for customers starting March 25, just in time for MLB Opening Day.\n\n\u201cAt T-Mobile, every sports and entertainment partnership is about pushing the boundaries of innovation with our industry-leading 5G network and delivering more to our customers,\u201d says Mike Katz, President of Marketing, Strategy and Products, T-Mobile. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing by powering 5G-enabled ABS in Major League Baseball \u2014 demonstrating how our 5G network can support partners like MLB \u2014 in addition to giving our customers a front-row seat to all the baseball action this season with the return of free MLB.TV.\u201d\n\n5G-Powered ABS\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s 5G-powered ABS system will be tested for the first time at the major league level following trials over the last two years at select minor league games and at the All-Star Futures Game during MLB All-Star Week. MLB\u2019s ABS system uses high-speed Hawk-Eye cameras set up around the stadium to triangulate the strike zone above home plate for each player. Once the pitch is thrown, T-Mobile\u2019s private 5G ANS transmits pitch data from the ABS system via 5G-connected devices \u2014 enabling quick and secure pitch location verification.\n\nA private 5G network provides an ultra-reliable, high-speed and low-latency connection, enabling real-time communication with the ABS system as calls are challenged, pitches are analyzed and decisions are relayed to players and fans.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s network also powers the 5G-connected devices used for the ABS system, including:\n\nLaptops MLB officials use to input team lineups to ensure strike zone accuracy for each batter and to relay game and strike zone information to MLB applications.\n\nTablets at the ballpark to provide MLB staff and officials with real-time game video for analysis feedback on the strike zone.\n\nContinued 5G Expansion in MLB Stadiums\n\nT-Mobile has been deploying and expanding its industry-leading 5G network across the country at MLB stadiums. It has rolled out private 5G networks at 27 MLB ballparks to date, with plans to be in every U.S. ballpark before the end of 2025.\n\nFree MLB.TV is Back\n\nOne of T-Mobile\u2019s most-loved customer perks \u2014 a free season-long subscription to MLB.TV (a $149.99 value) \u2014 is back starting March 25 through March 31. Eligible T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Home Internet and Small Business customers can snag a free MLB.TV subscription via T-Mobile Tuesdays in the T-Lifeapp.\n\nMLB.TV delivers both home and away broadcast feeds, with live and on-demand access to every out-of-market regular season game, and every in-market regular season game available on demand. Fans can catch games on their favorite supported devices and enjoy live game DVR controls to pause and rewind the action in HD. Just last season, T-Mobile customers collectively streamed a record-high 58 million hours of live baseball on MLB.TV.\n\nMore Perks with Magenta Status\n\nBeing a T-Mobile customer means getting more: more streaming, more value and more perks from day one. It means enjoying industry-leading benefits the Un-carrier delivers with its value-packed plans and the VIP treatment customers deserve with Magenta Status, all while lighting up America\u2019s largest, fastest 5G network.\n\nT-Mobile customers don\u2019t just get the best entertainment streaming bundle in wireless with Go5G Next, they can also get exclusive benefits and experiences with top hotel and rental car brands, free in-flight Wi-Fi, high-speed data abroad, weekly perks and freebies through T-Mobile Tuesdays and more.\n\nMetro customers can score big savings too, with the best benefits in prepaid \u2014 from weekly deals through T-Mobile Tuesdays to an Amazon Prime membership on Us (valued at $14.99/month) with Metro Flex Plus.",

(NASDAQ:TMUS) stands against other growth stock picks by Warren Buffett.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long been a beacon for value investors looking for high-quality businesses with long-term competitive advantages. Since taking over as CEO of Berkshire six decades ago, the appropriately named \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d has outperformed the broader market.\n\nAs we approach 2025, some of Berkshire\u2019s assets stand out as promising opportunities, combining excellent fundamentals with acceptable values despite the market\u2019s sustained emphasis on technology and growth stocks.\n\nBerkshire\u2019s CEO is a strong believer in portfolio concentration. Buffett\u2019s investment strategy revolves around choosing companies with significant competitive advantages, effective management teams, and the potential to create regular free cash flow. His concept focuses on buying exceptional firms at acceptable costs rather than inferior enterprises at low rates. This strategy has proven successful across numerous market cycles, with Berkshire Hathaway providing compound yearly returns significantly higher than market averages over several decades.\n\nThe \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d concentrates on companies he understands, avoiding complex technologies or models with uncertain earnings potential. He looks for companies with pricing power, great brand awareness, and the ability to preserve or grow market share even during economic downturns. Buffett\u2019s conservative yet effective approach has helped him become one of history\u2019s most successful investors.\n\nFollowing the filing of Berkshire\u2019s 13F on February 14, we now know that 60% ($180 billion) of Buffett\u2019s $299 billion portfolio is concentrated in just four magnificent stocks.\n\nJapanese stock investors are attentively watching Buffett\u2019s letter in the hopes of gaining information that may affect the country\u2019s trading houses. Buffett has previously approved Japanese trading companies, resulting in increased stock value. Market participants will examine his comments for clues about the future of these companies, particularly as they are impacted by decreasing energy prices and pressure from the US government to reduce oil expenses.\n\nAs usual, Buffett\u2019s shareholder letter is expected to provide significant insights not only into Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s performance but also into market trends.\n\nGrowth Stock Portfolio: 12 Stock Picks By Warren Buffett\n\nA customer checking out their new device at a T-Mobile store, illustrating the convenience and accessibility of retail stores.",

            "content": "Published 02-24-25 Submitted by T-Mobile\n\nFirst responders don\u2019t hesitate \u2014 they act. They answer 200 million emergencies a year, making split-second decisions that save lives. Yet even today, too many still face connectivity challenges that slow them down when every moment counts. A recent survey found that 64% of first responders say an unreliable network is their biggest concern. That\u2019s not just frustrating \u2014 it can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nIn 2025, network congestion, coverage gaps and slow speeds shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of real-time communication at the most critical of times. Enter T-Priority, the nation\u2019s first priority 5G network slice built by T-Mobile, and designed specifically for first responders.\n\nT-Priority is the biggest step forward in public safety connectivity in years \u2014 a breakthrough solution built FOR first responders, delivering priority access on a 5G network with more capacity and the most advanced coverage available. Think of the slice like a traffic cop: It\u2019s always directing network traffic to give first responders the best possible experience, with up to five times the network resources of everyone else.\n\nSo, the essential tools that firefighters, paramedics, utility crews and healthcare teams depend on every day \u2014 like smartphones, tablets, thermal imaging and radios \u2014 run on a network that keeps up with them. And as their needs and tools evolve with the latest technology like drones, robots and augmented reality, T-Priority will support them, too.\n\nThis is the power of 5G: raising the bar for public safety, accelerating information-sharing, improving situational awareness, and redefining what\u2019s possible in emergency response.\n\nThis level of network innovation didn\u2019t happen overnight. It has taken years of investment, testing, and industry leadership and partnerships. In 2020, we were the first U.S. operator to commercially launch a 5G standalone (SA) core \u2014 the foundation for advanced solutions like T-Priority. While the other guys are still transitioning from older 4G LTE networks, we\u2019ve already brought 5G SA to first responders who are putting it to work in real emergencies.\n\nDuring the recent wildfires, we activated T-Priority for the Los Angeles Fire Department and provided Wi-Fi routers, hotspots and 5G antennas to keep them connected on the front lines.\n\nUrgent connectivity like this is why more agencies are turning to the Un-carrier. The city of New York \u2014 with the largest police and fire department system in the country, handling 9 million 911 calls a year \u2014 chose T-Mobile as its single carrier to deliver 5G network capabilities. Everything we\u2019ve learned from working with them to build and run a service that can serve New York City is what makes T-Priority ready to support any first responder mission in America. And it\u2019s not just about large agencies. Since 65% of firefighters in the U.S. are volunteers, we\u2019re also bringing the T-Priority network slice to individual first responders, who now have the option to add it to select plans.\n\nWhen lives are on the line, there\u2019s no room for dropped connections or slow response times. T-Priority is a game-changer for public safety. It reflects T-Mobile\u2019s commitment to using our network for good, giving first responders and agencies the full benefits of 5G.\n\nTHIS is what leadership looks like. And we won\u2019t stop pushing the boundaries of connectivity \u2014 especially when it helps save lives and empowers those who risk everything for us every day.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where T-Mobile US, Inc.

Before launching SICM, Kevin Parker played a key role at Deutsche Bank, where he was a member of the Group Executive Committee from 2001 to 2004 and led its asset management division as Global Head from 2004 to 2012. His extensive expertise in sustainable investing and institutional asset management has positioned SICM as a leader in responsible investment strategies.\n\nBeyond his work at SICM, Parker holds several leadership positions in various organizations.

They are compiled in the ascending order of Sustainable Insight Capital Management\u2019s stake in them as of the fourth quarter of 2024. In order to assist readers with more context, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from 1008 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 363.5% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 70\n\nSICM\u2019s Equity Stake: $12.31 Million\n\nHeadquartered in Bellevue, Washington, T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is a leading American wireless network provider and the second-largest carrier in the United States, serving 130 million subscribers as of December 31, 2024. The company serves as a host network for various mobile virtual network operators, reinforcing its presence in the telecommunications market.\n\nSustainable Insight Capital Management owned 55,792 shares of T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) as of Q4 2024, with a total value of $12.31 million, representing 5.38% of Parker\u2019s portfolio. Moreover, the fund increased its stake in the company by 15% during the fourth quarter of 2024, which suggests a positive hedge fund sentiment about the stock. Insider Monkey\u2019s database indicated that 70 hedge funds held stakes in the company as of the end of Q4 2024, with a total value of $2.86 billion, as opposed to 66 funds in Q3.\n\nT-Mobile US, Inc.

The company\u2019s EPS was announced as $2.50, surpassing consensus estimates by $0.12.\n\nThe company has taken a significant step forward in satellite connectivity by launching a beta test for its partnership with SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, allowing users to send SMS messages even in areas without traditional network coverage. The initiative, which T-Mobile was not initially planning to extend to rival carriers, was spurred by Verizon\u2019s recent ad campaign about satellite texting. The company has also leveraged this technology for emergency response, activating satellite coverage during disasters like hurricanes and wildfires to keep affected communities connected. Additionally, the Starlink system will be used to broadcast Wireless Emergency Alerts nationwide, further enhancing public safety. T-Mobile\u2019s push into satellite connectivity strengthens its position as an industry leader, providing a crucial advantage in network reliability and innovation, making it a strong stock choice for investors.\n\nOverall, TMUS ranks 7th on our list of top stocks to buy according to sustainable insight capital management. While we acknowledge the potential for TMUS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Cox is another top choice with widespread availability and high-speed plans, while Verizon 5G Home Internet provides budget-friendly options.\n\nVerizon\u2019s 5G Home Internet starts at just $35 per month for up to 100Mbps for eligible Verizon mobile customers. For faster speeds, Cox delivers up to 2,000Mbps for $150 monthly. However, Quantum Fiber recently matched those speeds -- offering 2,000Mbps with 1,000Mbps uploads for just $95 per month -- making it the top pick for both speed and value.\n\nBest internet in Phoenix in 2025\n\nPhoenix internet providers compared Provider Internet technology Monthly price range Speed range Monthly equipment costs Data cap Contract CNET review score CenturyLink\n\nRead full review DSL/Fiber $55-$75 10-1000Mbps $15 modem None None 6.7 Cox Communications\n\nRead full review Cable $30-$150 100-2,000Mbps $15 (optional) 1.25TB 1-2 years 6.2 Quantum Fiber Fiber $50-$95 500-2,000Mbps (varies by location) None None None 6.7 T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$55 for eligible mobile customers) 81-415Mbps None None None 7.4 Verizon 5G Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$45 with qualifying Verizon 5G mobile plans) 50-250Mbps None None None 7.2 Show more (1 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nOther available internet providers in Phoenix\n\nCenturyLink: Lumen Technologies offers DSL service to nearly every household in the Phoenix area not eligible for Quantum Fiber. Speeds are largely impressive for DSL service, ranging from 60, 80 or 100Mbps in many neighborhoods. As such, CenturyLink is a solid choice for a basic, low-hassle connection, but if you want faster speeds, you'll have to turn to Cox or Verizon.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet: While Verizon's 5G home internet network caters primarily to larger cities, such as Phoenix, T-Mobile focuses more on suburban and rural areas. Starting at $50 per month for speeds ranging from 81 to 415Mbps, T-Mobile is an ideal choice for those living outside the city where satellite or DSL is the only connection available. However, if you're within Phoenix, you'll find faster speeds for roughly the same price as other providers.\n\nTriad Wireless: Local fixed wireless provider Triad Wireless beams internet signals all over the Phoenix area for business, education and residential internet service. Max residential internet speeds can reach 1,000Mbps, which is impressive for a fixed wireless network. Since fixed wireless requires a direct line of sight to a nearby transmitter, you'll need to have a serviceability check before being able to sign up. Call 602-426-0542 or visit the Triad Wireless residential internet page to inquire about serviceability and pricing at your address.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nSatellite internet: Hughesnet and Viasat are always options for home internet, so long as you have a clear view of the southern sky. But satellite is often a last resort for internet, and with Cox, CenturyLink, 5G internet and other choices in Phoenix, the high pricing, high latency and low data allowances of satellite internet are easy to pass on.\n\nCheap internet options in Phoenix\n\nFor a cheap, basic internet connection in Phoenix, consider Verizon 5G Home Internet, with plans starting at $50 monthly. Plus, if you're a Verizon mobile customer, you'll also want to see if you can get a discounted rate of $35 to $45 per month. You can also apply to Cox Communication for its 100Mbps ConnectAssist plan -- which costs $30 per month -- if you're running your household on a tight budget.\n\nWhat\u2019s the cheapest internet plan in Phoenix?

Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers.\n\nPhoenix internet providers, such as Cox Communications, may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Many, however, including Quantum Fiber and Verizon, run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of promotions, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nGetty Images\n\nHow fast is Phoenix broadband?\n\nSpeed test averages indicate that home internet in Phoenix is slower than the rest of Arizona and below the national average. Don't let that discourage you; faster speeds, up to 940Mbps, are available throughout the Phoenix area.\n\nMulti-gig speeds are slowly becoming available in Phoenix, so Cox and Quantum Fiber offer 2,000Mbps plans in the area. However, there's a chance that availability issues may limit most residents to a single gig of speed from Quantum Fiber, Cox or Verizon 5G. While perhaps not as exciting as multi-gig service, that's still plenty of speed for a virtually unlimited number of connected devices.\n\nFastest internet plans in Phoenix Provider Starting price Max download speed Max upload speed Data cap Connection type Quantum Fiber 2 Gig $95 2,000Mbps 2,000Mbps None Fiber Cox Go Beyond Fast\n\nRead full review $150 2,000Mbps 100Mbps 1.25TB Cable Cox Go Super Fast\n\nRead full review $110 1,000Mbps 100Mbps 1.25TB Cable Quantum Fiber Gig $75 940Mbps 940Mbps None Fiber Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nInternet providers in popular cities near Phoenix\n\nSee all results for internet providers in Arizona.\n\nWhat\u2019s a good internet speed?\n\nMost internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics like browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Phoenix\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and also consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as CNET.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nWhat's the final word on internet providers in Phoenix?\n\nQuantum Fiber, Cox and Verizon 5G Home Internet are likely your best internet options in terms of speed and overall value. Quantum Fiber would be my first recommendation due to a fiber connection's reliability and symmetrical download/upload speed capabilities, not to mention its favorable service terms. Cox is also a solid choice for cable internet, especially if you plan to bundle internet and TV, but pricing is a bit high compared to other providers, and you'll have to deal with contracts and a data cap. As for Verizon 5G Home Internet, the value comes down to what speeds are available at your address, but the service is worth checking out if you're looking for an alternative to CenturyLink or Cox.\n\nInternet providers in Phoenix FAQ\n\nWhich is the cheapest internet provider in Phoenix? There are several ways to get low-cost internet in Phoenix. With eligible phone plans, T-Mobile or Verizon mobile customers can get deep discounts on 5G home internet service: $35 per month for either Verizon 5G Home or T-Mobile Home Internet and $30 monthly for Cox ConnectAssist. Show more\n\nWhich internet provider in Phoenix offers the fastest plan? Quantum Fiber offers the fastest plans in Phoenix. For $165, you can get 8,000Mbps symmetrical speeds if its available in your area of Phoenix. For most others, the 2000Mbps plan priced at $95 a month will be the best bet. Show more\n\nDoes Phoenix have fiber internet? Yes. Approximately 18% of Phoenix households are eligible for fiber service, according to FCC data. The largest fiber provider in the Phoenix area is Quantum Fiber. Cox also has a small fiber presence in Phoenix. Show more",

The Golden Knights improved to 15-2-1 against the Pacific Division.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJake DeBrusk scored a goal and Kevin Lankinen stopped 32 of 34 shots for Vancouver, which had a three-game winning streak snapped.\n\nVancouver, outshot 13-5 during a scoreless first period, took a 1-0 lead at the 6:22 mark of the second period when DeBrusk fired in a Kiefer Sherwood pass into an open right side of the net for his 20th goal, the fourth time in his career he hit the 20-goal mark in a season. Sherwood made the pass behind the net and through the crease past Hill, who whiffed trying to sweep the pass away with his stick.\n\nVegas tied it, 1-1, midway through the period when Barbashev snapped a 16-game goal-less drought, tapping in a rebound of a Victor Olofsson deflection from the right doorstep. It was also the 1,000th goal scored in 299 games at T-Mobile Arena for the Golden Knights.\n\nSaad then put Vegas in front 18 seconds into the third period, roofing a wrist shot from the left circle on a rebound of a Zach Whitecloud point shot that bounced straight to him off the back wall.\n\nThe Canucks appeared to tie the game five minutes later when Nils Hoglander fired a sharp-angled shot from the right side of the net that caromed in off Teddy Blueger. However, the goal was quickly disallowed for goalie interference on Blueger, who had collided with Hill and landed behind him in the crease.\n\nVancouver pulled Lankinen for an extra attacker and Hertl sealed the win for Vegas with an empty-netter with 30.8 seconds to go.\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

            "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren has urged the Justice Department to carefully scrutinize Disney\u2019s deal to acquire a controlling stake in Fubo, saying the consolidation presents antitrust concerns.\n\nDisney announced in January that it would merge its Hulu + Live TV service with Fubo and take 70% ownership of the combined company. A few days later, Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery dropped their plans to launch Venu Sports, a combined streaming service.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nIn a letter to the DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division, Warren argued that the Disney-Fubo deal allows the company to \u201cgobble up a competitor\u201d and could lead to higher prices.\n\n\u201cThis proposed acquisition raises significant concerns under antitrust law, would give Disney increased market power and incentives to increase costs for viewers, and should be regarded as another data point in Disney\u2019s history of anticompetitive behavior,\u201d Warren wrote.\n\nWarren also raised alarms about Venu Sports last summer, joining with Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Joaquin Castro to warn that the joint venture would dominate the market for live sports on streaming TV.\n\nFubo sued Disney, Fox, and WBD last year, arguing that the companies were abusing their market power to squeeze a smaller rival and potentially drive it out of business. In May, Fubo joined with DirecTV and DISH Networks to urge Congress to hold hearings on the matter.\n\nA judge granted Fubo\u2019s request for an injunction in August, which blocked Venu from launching.\n\nDisney, Fox and WBD appealed. Last fall, the Biden DOJ filed an amicus brief in support of the injunction, while several Republican members of Congress opposed it, arguing that Venu would add a new offering to a competitive marketplace.\n\nThe litigation was dropped as part of the Disney-Fubo deal.\n\nIn her letter, Warren argued that Disney has effectively circumvented antitrust law by buying out an adversary.\n\n\u201cDisney is already one of the most powerful media companies in the world,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThreatened by Fubo\u2019s lawsuit and in an apparent attempt to keep Fubo from \u2018becoming the next Netflix,\u2019 Disney has proposed a plan to acquire its competitor, and, in the process become an even more powerful force in an already highly-concentrated market.\u201d\n\nFubo and Hulu + Live TV are expected to remain separate offerings, though under one corporate umbrella. Disney is will also introduce a new ESPN streaming service this fall. In an earnings call this month, CEO Bob Iger said that Venu was made \u201credundant\u201d by the emergence of a number of skinny bundles.\n\nWarren addressed her letter to Omeed Assefi, the interim head of the DOJ Antitrust Division, and copied Gail Slater, President Trump\u2019s nominee who is awaiting confirmation to that position.\n\nSlater previously worked as a senior vice president at Fox Corp. and was also registered as an in-house lobbyist at Roku.\n\nIn the letter, Warren noted the previous administration had \u201cpowerfully pushed back\u201d on Disney\u2019s efforts to launch Venu.\n\n\u201cI urge DOJ to continue this work on behalf of viewers by closely scrutinizing this proposed deal and blocking it if it violates antitrust law,\u201d she added.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

            "content": "recently announced two new Essentials plans for first responders and military families, offering them competitive pricing compared to peers like AT&T and Verizon. The company's partnership with New York City aims to enhance public safety using its expansive 5G standalone network. In the last month, the stock rose by 21%, likely influenced by its Q4 2024 financial report, which showed a revenue climb to $21.87 billion, and a dividend declaration. The market saw a general decline, with major indexes ending lower; however, TMUS outperformed, possibly buoyed by its recent initiatives and financial results. The market's general performance was flat last week, with an upward trajectory over the year. Despite the broader market struggles, TMUS's shares stood out likely due to these tactical moves and financial strengths amidst mixed market signals.\n\nNasdaqGS:TMUS Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2025\n\nT-Mobile US has experienced remarkable growth in its total shareholder returns over the last five years, achieving an impressive 197.01% return. This period has showcased substantial earnings growth, averaging 32.6% annually, with an accelerated pace noted in the previous year reaching 36.3%. The company's initiatives to enhance its 5G network have likely bolstered its performance, particularly through collaborations with Ericsson and Nokia, which were established early in this timeframe. Additionally, T-Mobile's proactive approach to expanding its customer offerings, including significant product launches, has contributed to its robust financial standing as it distinguished itself within the wireless telecom industry.\n\nDespite a high level of debt, T-Mobile's financial strategy has included share buybacks totaling over US$4.6 billion in early 2025, reflecting a strong cash position. However, in the past year, TMUS's returns underperformed the industry but still surpassed the US market's return of 20.8%. High-quality earnings and improved profit margins have further supported the company's long-term growth story. As a result, T-Mobile has maintained its position as a key player in the competitive telecom landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

During a live event in New York City, Callie Field, President of T-Mobile Business Group, announced four major moves that take T-Mobile\u2019s support of first responders to the next level: a major agreement with the City of New York to be the single carrier for all its public safety network, partnerships with industry powerhouses including Samsung, Getac and Skydio, exclusive benefits for individual first responders like free access to the T-Priority network slice and a $2 million donation for charitable support to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation.\n\n\u201cFirst responders are the backbone of public safety, and they deserve the most advanced 5G technology to support them when lives are on the line,\" said Callie Field, President, T-Mobile Business Group. \"With T-Priority, T-Mobile is providing public safety agencies and first responders with the innovative solutions they need to stay prepared, respond faster and protect the communities they serve, empowering them to lead in times of crisis and shape the future of emergency response.\u201d\n\nThe 5G Era of Public Safety Is Here\n\nT-Priority, initially announced at the company\u2019s Capital Markets Day, was purpose-built for the millions of first responders in the U.S., addressing their urgent need for reliable and resilient connectivity. In fact, 64% of first responders cited an unreliable network as their main communications concern in a recent survey. Many are still held back by outdated 4G infrastructure and problems like congestion, insufficient speeds and coverage gaps. To tackle these connectivity barriers, T-Priority offers first responders benefits like:\n\nMore capacity: 40% more 5G capacity than other providers to help more first responders stay connected to more devices. And this is augmented by T-Mobile's innovative network slice. The network slice acts like a traffic cop that directs network traffic, ensuring first responders get the best possible experience with up to 5 times the resources of the average user. And in rare times of extreme congestion, it can dynamically dedicate more capacity to first responders.\n\n40% more 5G capacity than other providers to help more first responders stay connected to more devices.

And in rare times of extreme congestion, it can dynamically dedicate more capacity to first responders.

And, again, the network slice uplevels this by providing lower latency and faster speeds more consistently with the highest priority across all 5G bands.\n\nT-Mobile delivers 2.5 times faster speeds on average than other providers for data-intensive communications. And, again, the network slice uplevels this by providing lower latency and faster speeds more consistently with the highest priority across all 5G bands. Closing coverage gaps: In addition to operating the nation\u2019s largest 5G network, T-Mobile is launching T-Mobile Starlink later this year, included at no extra cost for first responder agencies on T-Priority plans. As the first and only space-based mobile network in the U.S., it can help keep people connected in the more than 500,000 square miles of the country unreached by any carrier\u2019s earth-bound cell towers.\n\nThis is all possible because T-Priority is powered by T-Mobile\u2019s 5G standalone (SA) network \u2014 the most advanced type of 5G network. While most operators initially relied on LTE-based non-standalone technology, T-Mobile was the first provider in the world to deploy a commercial 5G SA core, enabling critical innovations like network slicing. With T-Priority, T-Mobile is providing first responders with a dedicated slice of its 5G SA network to give them more capacity, faster 5G speeds and the highest priority \u2014 reinforcing its leadership in delivering the most advanced, reliable and scalable solutions for public safety. Plus, T-Mobile\u2019s 5G SA offers state of the art security \u2014 helping ensure uninterrupted service even in the face of sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nThe Most Advanced 5G Ecosystem for First Responders\n\nFirst responders rely on a vast ecosystem of purpose-built tools \u2014 from drones and AI-powered applications to deployables that boost coverage in the field.

T-Mobile signed a deal to be the lone carrier supporting the City of New York's first responders and its public safety networks. That's a huge deal for T-Mobile .

That's a huge deal for\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent survey, 64% of first responders complained that an unreliable network was their main communications gripe. Some first responders are struggling with outdated 4G networks, congested traffic, slower speeds, and gaps in coverage. That's why it's important to understand how T-Priority works. Using T-Mobile 's standalone (SA) 5G network, T-Priority offers first responders slices of the T-Mobile 5G network allowing the latter to meet any special requirements that the first responders might have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 40% more 5G capacity, T-Priority allows the network to hook up with more devices while offering speeds up to 2.5 times faster than other providers. Using network slicing allows T-Mobile to deliver faster speeds on a more consistent basis while also delivering lower latency. To close network gaps on T-Priority, first responders have access to Starlink which is the satellite-based service that will help them stay connected even when they find themselves located in an area of the country where there is no earth-bound cellular service.\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive the latest T-Mobile news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we've mentioned before, T-Mobile 's standalone 5G network gives the carrier the ability to provide 5G network slices to first responders. We've discussed the difference before and now would be a propitious time to do so again. T-Mobile was the first carrier in the world to employ a standalone network which is simply one that uses a 5G core as opposed to older LTE networks that had 5G built over a 4G core. The latter was done by carriers to quickly offer 5G instead of waiting for an SA 5G network to be built.\n\n\n\n\n\nSA 5G networks provide more capacity, faster speeds, lower latency and certain technological advantages such as network slicing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-Mobile has also arranged for certain tools from top manufacturers to be available and these will support 5G.

On Thursday, the carrier signed a deal with New York City to put its first responders on T-Priority, the fast-lane service for public safety agencies that T-Mobile introduced in September.\n\n\"It\u2019s the ultimate priority on the ultimate network,\" said Callie Field, president of T-Mobile Business Group, at a live-streamed event in NYC.\n\n\u201cSeconds matter, and connectivity matters,\u201d added NYC chief technology officer Matthew Fraser.\n\nT-Priority uses a 5G feature called network slicing. First deployed in August 2023, it gives the devices and communications of police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and other first responders faster connections and higher priority than those of other users on T-Mobile\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cThe slice helps us deliver faster speeds even more consistently,\u201d Field said, including the ability to reassign most of the carrier\u2019s capacity to T-Priority in an emergency.\n\nShe compared that to the 4G footing of FirstNet, the government-backed public-safety network that AT&T operates, saying FirstNet\u2019s LTE Band 14 offers a tenth of T-Priority\u2019s capacity.\n\nAfter this post was published AT&T sent a comment from FirstNet president Scott Agnew upholding that 4G and 5G network as \u201cbuilt exclusively for public safety\u201d and \u201cnot a commercial offering\u2013or even a slice of one\u201d while taking offense to T-Mobile\u2019s comparison.\n\n\u201cInstead of working alongside America\u2019s first responders to give them the network they asked for and deserve, they are using public safety as a marketing gimmick without much to offer in return,\u201d the statement read. \u201cNo connection is more important than one that can help save a life, and as public safety\u2019s partner, FirstNet is in a league of its own.\u201d\n\nIn a network crunch, unprioritized traffic can wind up not getting delivered at all\u2013with results like the San Francisco traffic jams caused by Cruise\u2019s self-driving taxis after a network overload left those autonomous vehicles offline.\n\n(FirstNet itself began as a response to first responders to the 9/11 terrorist attacks struggling to communicate between devices on incompatible networks while public wireless and wired networks crumpled under extreme usage conditions.)\n\nT-Mobile was able to give T-Priority its own network slice in 2020, fulfilling one of 5G\u2019s early promises, because it first launched standalone 5G\u2013meaning its 5G transmitters can directly open a connection with a device instead of using 4G to set that up. AT&T and Verizon have since begun rolling out standalone 5G and network slicing; for example, last February, AT&T announced plans to deploy standalone 5G for FirstNet.\n\nLater this year, T-Mobile will include free T-Mobile Starlink roaming on agencies\u2019 T-Priority plans. That in-testing service that T-Mobile and SpaceX announced in 2022 will be $15 extra on all but T-Mobile\u2019s most expensive consumer plans.\n\nT-Mobile also revealed a new set of device partners for T-Priority, including Samsung, which will ship ruggedized devices for the network, and Skydio, which will equip its public-safety drones for T-Priority.\n\nFinally, individual first responders such as volunteer firefighters will get free access to that T-Priority network slice on their personal devices. That option, usually $7.50 a month, requires the carrier\u2019s Go5G First Responder discounted plans, which itself require annual verification of eligibility, and requires staying on eligible plans. Subscribers to other T-Mobile first-responder discounts, such as an upcoming Essentials plan, will be able to add that separately at the usual $7.50 rate.\n\nEditors\u2019 note: We updated this post with comments from AT&T and additional details from T-Mobile.",

In fact, T-Mobile committed to certain 5G coverage requirements in order to close the Sprint deal.\n\nSpecifically, T-Mobile pledged to deploy 5G service to cover 97% of the American people within three years and to reach 99% of all Americans within six years.\n\nIn a statement provided to Fierce, T-Mobile President of Technology Ulf Ewaldsson acknowledged that improving wireless service in rural America was one of the primary reasons for the merger with Sprint. T-Mobile started its 5G journey with low-band 600 MHz spectrum but bumped it up big time when it acquired Sprint\u2019s treasure trove of mid-band 2.5 GHz spectrum.\n\n\u201cThe results speak for themselves,\u201d Ewaldsson said. \u201cT-Mobile brought home broadband competition that was desperately needed to millions of homes that had few options for high-speed services. And as the Ookla results show, the T-Mobile 5G network is the best option for mobile customers as well.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s more to come. \u201cThis is just the beginning. T-Mobile remains the only major carrier with a nationwide 5G standalone network while our competitors have only deployed in a handful of cities. With its core network, 5G SA is true 5G and paves the way for new services that will be critical for 5G Advanced and 6G. So the fact we\u2019re leading in rural areas on both availability and 5G SA deployments at this stage is a good sign for our future prospects,\" Ewaldsson said.\n\nT-Mobile \u201cleveled up\u201d with Verizon\n\nIndeed, Chetan Sharma, president of Chetan Sharma consulting, said T-Mobile\u2019s low and mid-band coverage has vastly improved coverage in rural areas during the 5G cycle.\n\n\u201cUsers\u2019 perceptions take a long time to change, but T-Mobile seems to have leveled up with Verizon when it comes to network quality, and it is likely to surpass it due to the Starlink announcement as the coverage holes in the network can become a thing of the past,\u201d Sharma told Fierce.\n\nOf course, the \u201cbest coverage\u201d experience depends on where people live, work and play. Not everybody is going to be in areas where T-Mobile has built out 5G coverage. Ookla looked at which states have the lowest available 5G coverage and found that Wyoming earns the distinction as the state with the lowest 5G availability for all three operators.\n\nBased on Ookla\u2019s data, T-Mobile made the most inroads when it comes to Wyoming customers having access to its 5G network, with 59% of users on 5G, followed by AT&T with 29.73% and Verizon at the back of the pack, with a measly 9.8% of users on 5G in the state.\n\nRegister for Fierce Network's free Exploring Revenue Streams with 5G Networking virtual summit, held March 25-26, 2025.

Once again, we\u2019ll be waiting until the last minute before we get a chance to redeem the promotion, as T-Mobile shares that the subscription will be offered through the carrier\u2019s T-Life app on the Tuesday immediately before the regular season gets started: March 25.\n\nMake sure you mark that one down on your calendar because you won\u2019t have long to redeem it: T-Mobile notes that you\u2019ll need to sign up for your free season of MLB.TV before the end of March. Considering that this represents a $150 value, that\u2019s not the sort of freebie you\u2019re going to want to risk missing.\n\nConsidering how T-Mobile Tuesday has been rolling back some of its best money-saving deals over the past few months, we\u2019re pleased to get some reassurance that this one isn\u2019t similarly striking out.

While Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile remain the top players in the U.S., offering good coverage and expanding premium features becomes difficult in far-flung areas. T-Mobile has, however, left the other two big players behind when it comes to its 5G networks in rural areas, and it has achieved this through a number of strategic strategies.\n\nIf you live in a rural area of the U.S., you have nothing to worry about, as T-Mobile has you covered\n\nPeople in remote locations often struggle with limited carrier options and poor signals, but this is about to change. As per a new report by Ookla, T-Mobile seems to be leading when it comes to mobile coverage across the U.S., especially in rural areas. The report highlights how T-Mobile is able to extend reliable coverage to these far-flung areas when networks or services are often compromised through the widespread 5G network it has established.\n\nWhile 5G served to be a game-changer for people in urban areas, rural areas have not been able to reap the benefits of the service. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile were all set to bring better coverage to these areas, but T-Mobile has taken everyone by surprise with its aggressive approach, which has led to the company reaching in a better way and performing greatly in comparison to the competition.\n\nThis has been made possible due to the company's extensive deployment of low-band and mid-band 5G networks offering better coverage and reliability than the rest. Due to this strategic direction, the company has the largest percentage of users on 5G networks in both urban and rural markets. T-Mobile's 5G strategy can be termed methodical, as it leverages the 600MHz low-band spectrum for Extended Range 5G and is able to offer broader coverage as a result.\n\nIt was mainly the Sprint acquisition in 2020 that served as a game-changer, allowing the company to get into the 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum and offer even better speed and service. Due to T-Mobile's Ultra Capacity 5G, the company now covers around 300 million people across the U.S. The telecommunication service provider is not going to stop here as it has an upcoming $4.4 billion acquisition of US cellular spectrum and customers, which would help extend its services to more areas with access to 4.5 million customers and retail stores.\n\nWhile other big players are also determined to escalate their rural efforts, it seems that T-Mobile has a tight grip on 5G dominance with its strategy and ability to manage both speed and range.",

Of course, you can cancel the service at any time between now and February 2026, but you do need to do that manually to avoid paying for something... you may get for free once again from T-Mobile next year.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you call it soccer or football, the spectacle of MLS is certainly not to be missed at the low price of $0, and in case you're wondering exactly what your free Season Pass includes, that would be, well, everything.

Tradition definitely seems to suggest that will be the case , but then again, the operator threw both free MLS Season Passes and MLB.TV subscriptions at its customers back in 2023 while only doing the latter offer last year.\n\n\n\n",

The Apple TV app will stream occasional free games, and every Sunday Night Soccer match will also be available to Apple TV+ subscribers.\n\nComcast Xfinity customers can also watch MLS 360 throughout the season using the new dedicated MLS cable channel, at no extra charge.\n\nFinally, if you own a stadium season ticket for any MLS club, you can also redeem a free subscription for MLS Season Pass. Your club representatives should automatically send out links to redeem that offer.",

Here's how it works\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption T-Mobile teams up with Starlink to eliminate dead zones The new service connects cell phone users to satellites when they are out of range of a cell tower. (Scripps News) Scripps News\n\nQUESTION: Is there any reason I shouldn\u2019t sign up for T-Mobile\u2019s free satellite service if I have Verizon?\n\nANSWER: If you\u2019ve ever been in a remote area with no cell service, you know the limitations of being completely cut off. Whether it\u2019s a backcountry hike, a road trip through the mountains, or an emergency situation, traditional cellular networks leave plenty of gaps in coverage. That\u2019s where satellite texting is starting to change the game.\n\nT-Mobile opens access to all\n\nT-Mobile recently made a big splash by offering satellite texting to users on any wireless network, based on their partnership with Starlink\u2019s Direct-to-Cell satellites.Unlike other providers requiring specific hardware, T-Mobile\u2019s service works with most modern smartphones by using its existing 1.9 GHz spectrum, allowing any phone that supports T-Mobile\u2019s bands to send texts in areas without cellular coverage.\n\nThis offer is free until July 2025, after which T-Mobile subscribers can add it for $15 per month, and non-T-Mobile users can sign up for $20 per month. The service currently supports SMS texting only, which means it can\u2019t be used to send pictures or videos. In the future, they plan on expanding to MMS, voice calls, and data connectivity.\n\nConvenience and security: Here's how a passkey is better than a password\n\nHow it compares to Apple\u2019s satellite texting\n\nApple introduced Emergency SOS via satellite with the iPhone 14, leveraging Globalstar\u2019s satellites. It was limited to emergencies and required you to follow prompts to manually align your phone with a satellite. In iOS 18, Apple expanded it to include regular text messaging, but it\u2019s still exclusive to iPhone 14 or newer users.\n\nApple\u2019s service is currently free for two years after activation, with a yet-to-be-determined long-term pricing for non-emergency satellite texting.\n\nVerizon & AT&T follow suit\n\nVerizon partnered with Skylo to roll out its emergency satellite messaging in 2024, with regular texting expected in 2025. However, this service will only be available on select phones (starting with the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9), as it requires NTN (Non-Terrestrial Network) compatibility.\n\nAT&T, meanwhile, is partnering with AST SpaceMobile, aiming for full satellite-powered voice, text, and data services. Like T-Mobile, AST\u2019s system is designed to function like a normal cellular network without special hardware, but it\u2019s still in the testing phase, with widespread availability expected in late 2025.\n\nWhy T-Mobile\u2019s approach stands out\n\nThe biggest advantage of T-Mobile\u2019s Starlink partnership is that it doesn\u2019t require new hardware or carrier exclusivity. If you have a phone that\u2019s 4 years old or newer, you can likely use the service\u2014regardless of which carrier you currently use. In contrast, Apple\u2019s service is iPhone-only, Verizon\u2019s rollout is device-restricted, and AT&T\u2019s full cellular replacement is still a bit down the road.\n\nDo you need satellite texting?\n\nIf you frequently travel to areas with poor cell coverage, signing up for a free satellite texting service now could be a no-brainer. If you\u2019re a Verizon or AT&T customer who spends all your time in cell coverage areas, you might want to wait for their rollout\u2014especially if you plan on upgrading to a newer compatible device soon.\n\nOne thing is clear: mobile dead zones are disappearing, and satellite connectivity is no longer limited to emergencies with lots of newer capabilities coming soon!\n\nKen Colburn is the founder and CEO of Data Doctors Computer Services, datadoctors.com.

Through a partnership between T-Mobile, SpaceX, and Starlink, a new satellite-to-cell service allows users to send and receive text messages even in areas without traditional network coverage.\n\nIn December 2024, T-Mobile launched a beta program for this satellite-powered messaging service, offering US customers early access at no extra cost. The program is still open for those who want to apply, making it easier than ever to stay connected-no cell towers required.\n\nRead more: T-Mobile Opens Its Starlink Beta, Including to People With AT&T and Verizon\n\nHowever, access is limited during the T-Mobile Starlink beta. If you're a T-Mobile customer living in the US, you must have an optimized phone, like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip 6, iPhone 16 or Google Pixel 9. During the Super Bowl, T-Mobile announced that AT&T, Verizon and other phone carrier customers can also try out T-Mobile Starlink satellite service for free, for a limited time.\n\nIf you're interested in trying out the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service and don't know where to start, here's everything you need to know.\n\nWatch this: Starlink Satellites Are Bringing Internet to Millions. We'll Explain the Pros and Cons 02:38\n\nWhat exactly is the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service and how does it work?\n\nIn August 2022, during a live event, T-Mobile and SpaceX announced Coverage Above and Beyond, a plan for bringing cellphone connectivity everywhere in the US, even in the most remote regions. T-Mobile's wireless network would leverage Starlink's direct-to-cell satellites -- more than 300 of them -- to provide \"near complete coverage\" to all 500,000 square miles in the US that are not covered by cell towers, essentially eliminating dead zones.\n\nIf you're in an area without cell service, like Yosemite National Park or the Grand Canyon, your phone will automatically connect to the nearest T-Mobile Starlink satellite, acting like a floating cellphone tower, to give you service, as long as there's nothing obstructing the connection between your phone and the sky.\n\nThis partnership has been years in the making. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nWhat can you do with the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service?\n\nYou can use the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service to send and receive text messages on your supported phone -- for free. That includes text messages to 911 in case of an emergency. Plans are in place to add support for picture messaging, voice calls, and data soon -- but for most users, it will come at a cost.\n\nEventually, you'll be able to surf the web with Starlink. James Martin/CNET\n\nWho can use the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service?\n\nRight now, you need to meet the following requirements if you want to use the Starlink satellite service on your phone:\n\nYou must be a T-Mobile customer (open to other customers now, too) .

            "content": "While investors may love their dividends, stocks with high yields often come with risks or very limited growth prospects.\n\nBut if one can find a stock with a decent yield that can grow a lot into the future, that's a ticket for superior payouts looking out five, 10, or 20 years or longer.\n\nThe best growth today is found in the tech sector, but most tech companies don't pay a lot in dividends. However, one winning company just announced a massive 35% increase in its payout following its Analyst Day, and analysts see even better things ahead.\n\nT-Mobile is becoming a dividend growth monster\n\nFollowing its Capital Markets Day on Wednesday, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) announced a whopping 35% increase to its dividend. T-Mobile just introduced a dividend to shareholders last year for the first time, and started rather small compared with peers Verizon (NYSE: VZ) and AT&T (NYSE: T). T-Mobile's dividend yield amounted to 1.32% at today's price, but the big increase will bring that to 1.76%. That's still a far cry from Verizon's 6.2% yield or AT&T's 5.1%. However, as one can see, there is much more to a stock's return than its dividend yield:\n\nTMUS 5 Year Total Returns (Daily) Chart\n\nTMUS 5 Year Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts\n\nT-Mobile has achieved a massive 150% gain over the past five years, including dividends. Meanwhile, AT&T has returned only 12% and Verizon shareholders have actually seen a 4% decline, even including dividends.\n\nMoreover, T-Mobile has returned much more to shareholders recently in the form of share repurchases. T-Mobile's shareholder yield, which incorporates dividends and repurchases, totaled 6.11% over the past 12 months, almost as high as AT&T's 6.9% yield.\n\nT-Mobile is best grower of the telecom bunch\n\nThe difference in shareholder returns is attributable to the fact that T-Mobile has outgrown its peers, largely because of its transformation as the industry transitioned to 5G. T-Mobile had formerly been a discount brand that thrived on lower prices, but with an inferior network. However, the acquisition of Sprint in 2020 along with some savvy spectrum purchases actually gave T-Mobile a network advantage as the industry flipped from 4G to 5G.\n\nTMUS EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nTMUS EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nAnd more growth lies ahead\n\nT-Mobile also presented its Capital Markets Day on Wednesday, where it outlined its strategy for continued growth. These include:\n\nMaintaining its network leadership: It's doing so by investing in an AI-powered network, through a collaboration with Nvidia, Ericsson and Nokia. Continuing to take market share: It's focusing on places where it's still underpenetrated, including small and rural towns, business accounts, and roughly 30 of the top 100 metro markets where it's not already the leader. Increasing broadband growth: T-Mobile rolled out its 5G wireless broadband offering just a few years ago, but has already achieved 5.6 million broadband customers to date. By 2028, it sees that growth going to 12 million and then between 12 million and 15 million by 2030. That will be achieved both through wireless and fiber-to-the-home, which is a new initiative for the company. Collaborating on customer service with OpenAI: T-Mobile is partnering with OpenAI on IntentCX, which is an AI-powered predictive platform to better serve customers, anticipate their needs, and solve problems, all while reducing pressure on T-Mobile's customer service. The company hopes the initiative will lower churn even further while also lowering costs.\n\nT-Mobile forecasts that these growth initiatives should lead to 5% service revenue growth, 7% EBITDA growth, and 8% free cash flow growth between 2023 and 2027.\n\nThat would lead the telecom industry, supporting continued dividend growth beyond even the recent increase.\n\nAnalysts raise their targets\n\nIn the wake of Analyst Day, analysts at Evercore raised their price target on T-Mobile to $220, up from $210. The analysts called T-Mobile the most attractive story in the cable and telco industries, raising the target based on a valuation based of 13.4 times 2027 free cash flow.\n\nThat's a premium to the rest of the sector, but T-Mobile's growth as well as the prospect of lower interest rates make its story much more appealing. In addition, T-Mobile said it plans to return another $50 billion to shareholders between 2023 and 2027, even while it reserves another $30 billion for acquisitions and other optionality. Even the newly raised dividend payout would only equate to about $4.1 billion per year in dividends. Therefore, that leaves ample room for more share repurchases and dividend growth well into the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in T-Mobile US right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in T-Mobile US, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and T-Mobile US wasn\u2019t one of them.

Of special interest, though, is the fact that this update also begins Samsung's roll-out to seamless updates, something long overdue on its flagship series.\n\nT-Mobile Galaxy S25 Users Get Patch\n\nAn Android Police report indicates that T-Mobile users are finally getting the update, with build numbers identical to those that initially surfaced in South Korea earlier this week. Samsung's changelog is still cryptic, citing bug fixes, stability enhancements, and feature additions.\n\nOne known patch, however, fixes image banding problems during low-light photography, an issue some users encountered when capturing nighttime shots using the Galaxy S25.\n\nSeamless Updates Finally Land on Samsung Flagships\n\nThe highlight of this update is the rollout of seamless updates. Unlike traditional Samsung updates with long installation durations and device downtime, this new mechanism enables updates to be applied in the background on an unused partition.\n\nUsers have noted that once the update downloaded overnight, the installation itself was almost instant, taking only a brief restart\u2014quite far from the hours-long progress bars and app optimization slowdowns Google's Pixel devices are infamous for.\n\nFaster Software Updates, Long Reboots No More\n\nFor Samsung enthusiasts, the specter of slow updates and long reboots is history\u2014at least for the ones who opt for the Galaxy S25 series. Software updates are now faster and more streamlined using this new approach, putting Samsung in the same league as Google, OnePlus, and other Android makers who have already incorporated this feature.\n\nNot all Samsung phones will enjoy seamless updates, though, according to Forbes. The old models, such as the Galaxy S24, S23, and S22 are already on One UI 6 and will continue to use it until at least April 2025, when Android 15 updates are said to be released by Samsung.\n\nSadly, the older devices will still be dependent on the previous update process, which involves longer install times and device downtime.\n\nWho Receives the Update First?\n\nCurrently, carrier-locked devices, including those on T-Mobile, are getting the update first, and unlocked Galaxy S25 phones are yet to get it. Just like in previous Samsung updates, it might take a few days before everyone has the new software.\n\nFor the time being, S25 owners can look forward to smoother performance, increased security, and more stable cameras, while other Samsung devices are waiting in queue for their turn.\n\nEarly adopters or waiters for a smoother version aside, one thing is certain\u2014Samsung's game of software updates is finally changing.\n\nMeanwhile, a European retail listing hinted at the price increases for each color option of Galaxy S25.",

That's where satellite services like Starlink come in \u2013 and this week T-Mobile started offering it for free (ahead of a paid rollout) in the US on compatible smartphones.\n\nThe network operator has teamed up with SpaceX to launch the \u201cfirst and only space-based mobile network\u201d in the US, bringing cell phone service to remote areas via satellite. Powered by Starlink, it\u2019s set to change the game for mobile users in rural locations. Those users won\u2019t have to wait long to access it, either: the beta trial is already underway and a full rollout is scheduled for July this year.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, access isn\u2019t limited to T-Mobile customers. The carrier has made its new service available to both AT&T and Verizon users as well, provided that their phone supports an eSIM. Want to upgrade your coverage with the groundbreaking satellite-to-cell service? We\u2019ve broken down everything you need to know about T-Mobile Starlink, including how you can get it and how much it costs.\n\nA New Era in Connectivity \u2013 T-Mobile Starlink - YouTube Watch On\n\nWhat is Starlink and how does it work?\n\nStarlink is a subsidiary of Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX\n\nIt operates a constellation of small internet satellites\n\nDirect-to-cell satellites work like cell towers in space\n\nStarlink is a subsidiary of SpaceX, the space exploration company owned by Elon Musk. Starlink owns and operates a constellation of thousands of small satellites. It has been launching these compact satellites into space since 2019. They are used primarily to serve high-speed internet to Starlink customers with a compatible antenna on the ground.\n\nUnlike traditional satellite internet services, Starlink\u2019s satellites circle the planet in a low-Earth orbit. This closer proximity to the Earth\u2019s surface helps to reduce the lag \u2013 or latency \u2013 experienced as data is relayed between a user\u2019s antenna and the orbiting satellite. Because of the high number of Starlink satellites, the system is also able to offer global coverage, reaching areas beyond the scope of standard broadband or fibre optic connectivity. This makes it a particularly useful service in rural locations.\n\nEarly last year, SpaceX started launching Starlink satellites equipped with direct-to-cell capabilities. These satellites have modems on-board which function the same as cellphone towers. No special antenna or other hardware is required to connect to them: they are seen by your smartphone as standard cell towers, albeit up in space.\n\nThis means active users can access Starlink coverage wherever they can see the sky. If a phone supports LTE, it can connect to Starlink\u2019s satellite-based network the same as if it\u2019s a normal terrestrial provider.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

According to T-Mobile, 451 of these satellites have been launched so far. As above, these work like cell towers in space. Wherever you can see the sky, compatible smartphones can connect to T-Mobile Starlink as if it\u2019s a normal mobile network. No additional hardware or antenna is needed.\n\nThat means whenever you\u2019re in an area without cell service, your smartphone will connect automatically to Starlink satellites. T-Mobile reckons that more than 500,000 square miles of the US is currently beyond the reach of any carrier\u2019s standard cell towers. Its new service should eliminate those mobile dead zones, allowing users to stay connected wherever they are in the US.\n\nT-Mobile launched the free public beta test of its Starlink service during the Super Bowl on February 9 2025. It\u2019s open for anyone on any US carrier to sign up, including customers of both Verizon and AT&T. Registered users will be given access on a rolling basis, to provide feedback before the full rollout in summer.\n\nIn July, T-Mobile Starlink will switch to a paid version. It will be included free for anyone on T-Mobile\u2019s Go5G Next plan. Other T-Mobile customers can access it as a paid add-on for $15 a month. Anyone who registers for the beta in February will also be offered an Early Adopter Discount, bringing the price down to $10 a month.\n\nVerizon and AT&T customers will also be able to continue using the T-Mobile Starlink service once it switches to a paid version, as will users of any wireless network with an unlocked eSIM phone. This will cost $20 a month and users will need to activate a second eSIM in their phone to access the network.\n\nAt launch, the service only supports text messaging when connected to the satellite network. T-Mobile states that voice and data will be added soon, although this will require government approval for SpaceX to use the full bandwidth capacity of its satellite constellation.\n\nMark Rober Texts His Dad From a Satellite | T-Mobile - YouTube Watch On\n\nStarlink on iPhone: how do you get it?\n\nT-Mobile Starlink works on most modern smartphones\n\nApple iPhone 14 models and later are supported\n\niPhones need to be running iOS 18.3 to access Starlink\n\nThe only way to get Starlink on an iPhone at present is to sign up to the T-Mobile beta test. To do that, you\u2019ll need to have an iPhone 14, iPhone 15 or iPhone 16. That includes the Plus, Pro & Pro Max variants. You\u2019ll also need to be running iOS version 18.3.\n\nContrary to TikTok rumors, iOS 18.3 does not secretly install Starlink tech on your iPhone. What it does is make the network settings changes necessary to allow your phone to connect to T-Mobile 1900Mhz spectrum.\n\nYou\u2019ll then need to register for the T-Mobile beta. Once you\u2019re approved to participate and you head somewhere outside of standard cellular range, your phone should automatically access network coverage via the Starlink satellite constellation. When it does, you\u2019ll see \u201cSAT\u201d instead of the standard bars in the top right corner of your iPhone.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Apple iPhone users who can access the public beta. According to T-Mobile, Starlink \u201cworks on most smartphones from the last four years.\u201d While no additional hardware or accessory is required to connect to the Starlink network, T-Mobile does state that smartphones need to be \u201csatellite optimized\u201d for users to have the best experience.\n\nT-Mobile says it has worked with both Apple and Google to \u201censure that this experience is integrated directly into their OS.\u201d Whatever phone you have, T-Mobile states that it \u201cneeds to be on the latest software to use T-Mobile Starlink.\u201d\n\nThe official list of supported handsets is as follows:\n\nThis list is expected to grow as public beta testing continues, with more handsets likely to be supported by the time that the T-Mobile Starlink service rolls out for general usage in July. Whether older Apple smartphones, such as the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, will be included isn\u2019t clear.\n\nStarlink Mini: what is Starlink\u2019s backpack-friendly version?\n\nStarlink Mini is a compact antenna kit that connects to SpaceX satellites\n\nThe kit costs $499 / \u00a3399 / AU$599 up-front\n\nIt\u2019s different from T-Mobile\u2019s Starlink service\n\nStarlink Mini is a different way to access the internet via SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite constellation. It\u2019s a portable antenna kit with a built-in Wi-Fi router. It allows you connect to high-speed, low-latency satellite internet almost anywhere in the world with a clear view of the sky.\n\nIt\u2019s different from T-Mobile\u2019s Starlink service. With T-Mobile, users connect to Starlink\u2019s direct-to-cell satellites using their smartphone. The satellites work like standard cell towers. With Starlink Mini, the antenna kit receives signal from SpaceX\u2019s Starlink internet satellites. It then creates a Wi-Fi network at ground level using a built-in router, which other devices can connect to.\n\nThis setup makes it more versatile than the T-Mobile service, as you can connect to the Starlink Mini\u2019s Wi-Fi network on a range of devices, not just your smartphone. What\u2019s more, Starlink Mini supports peak download speeds in excess of 100Mbps.\n\n(Image credit: Starlink)\n\nDesigned to be used on the move, the backpack-friendly Starlink Mini measures 430 x 334 x 79mm and weighs 6.73kg. It ships with a kickstand and power supply, as well as a pipe adapter for pole mounting. Setup is as simple as plugging it in and pointing it at the sky. You can use the Starlink app to find optimal installation locations.\n\nThe Starlink Mini kit costs $499 / \u00a3399 / AU$599 up-front. In addition to the one-off cost of the kit itself, you\u2019ll need take out a Starlink subscription to access roaming internet. There\u2019s a 50GB Roam package for $50 / \u00a350 / AU$80 per month.\n\nAlternatively, you can get the Roam Unlimited package with unlimited data for a monthly cost of $165 / \u00a396 / AU$195. Subscriptions can be paused at any time. Coverage isn\u2019t yet global, but it is offered in more than 100 markets.\n\nRead our in-depth Starlink review\n\nSubaru Starlink: what is it?\n\nSubaru Starlink is a suite of connected in-car services\n\nIt is completely separate form SpaceX\u2019s Starlink system\n\nIt relies on standard cellular connectivity, not satellites\n\nDespite its name, Subaru Starlink has nothing to do with SpaceX satellites. Subaru Starlink is a package of connected in-car services available on most new Subaru vehicles. It includes a suite of safety, security and remote access features, such as automatic collision notifications, enhanced roadside assistance and remote ignition.\n\nIn-car connectivity is via standard cellular networks, rather than satellites. If you\u2019re outside of cell tower range, your vehicle won\u2019t be able to access Subaru Starlink services.\n\nMost supported Subaru vehicles come with a complimentary three-year trial of the system, after which it\u2019s available for an additional fee. There\u2019s no longer a standalone Starlink app, as the features have been rolled into the MySubaru app. The features available vary from model to model.\n\n(Image credit: Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nStarlink price: what\u2019s the monthly cost for Starlink?\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Starlink service starts at $15 per month for T-Mobile customers\n\nUsers of other carriers will be able to use T-Mobile Starlink for $20 a month\n\nA Starlink Mini Roam subscription starts at $50 / \u00a350 / AU$80 per month\n\nThe cost of Starlink depends on how you access it. Once T-Mobile Starlink rolls out to the general public in the US in July, it will be available to T-Mobile customers as an add-on for $15 a month. Users who take out a subscription during the public beta will be entitled to an Early Adopter Discount, bringing the price down to $10 a month.\n\nCustomers of other wireless carriers will be able to access T-Mobile\u2019s direct-to-cell service for $20 a month. There is no up-front cost, but they will need an unlocked smartphone with a spare eSIM slot.\n\nAlternatively, you can access satellite internet with a direct subscription to Starlink. Rather than using a smartphone, you will need to purchase a Starlink antenna kit, then take out a monthly data subscription.\n\nThe cheapest kit is the portable Starlink Mini (see above) which costs $499 / \u00a3399 / AU$599 up-front. The 50GB Roam package costs $50 / \u00a350 / AU$80 per month, while Roam Unlimited is priced at $165 / \u00a396 / AU$19 per month.\n\nIf you want a more permanent solution, the Starlink Standard kit costs $249 / \u00a3299 / AU$549. Residential service costs at $120 / \u00a375 / AU$139 per month for unlimited data.",

            "content": "Q: Is there any reason I shouldn\u2019t sign up for T-Mobile\u2019s free satellite service if I have Verizon?\n\nA: If you\u2019ve ever been in a remote area with no cell service, you know the limitations of being completely cut off. Whether it\u2019s a backcountry hike, a road trip through the mountains, or an emergency situation, traditional cellular networks leave plenty of gaps in coverage. That\u2019s where satellite texting is starting to change the game.\n\nT-Mobile opens access to all\n\n\n\nT-Mobile recently made a big splash by offering satellite texting to users on any wireless network, based on their partnership with Starlink\u2019s Direct-to-Cell satellites.\n\nUnlike other providers requiring specific hardware, T-Mobile\u2019s service works with most modern smartphones by using its existing 1.9 GHz spectrum, allowing any phone that supports T-Mobile\u2019s bands to send texts in areas without cellular coverage.\n\nThis offer is free until July 2025, after which T-Mobile subscribers can add it for $15 per month, and non-T-Mobile users can sign up for $20 per month. The service currently supports SMS texting only, which means it can\u2019t be used to send pictures or videos. In the future, they plan on expanding to MMS, voice calls, and data connectivity.\n\nHow it compares to Apple\u2019s satellite texting?\n\n\n\nApple introduced Emergency SOS via satellite with the iPhone 14, leveraging Globalstar\u2019s satellites. It was limited to emergencies and required you to follow prompts to manually align your phone with a satellite. In iOS 18, Apple expanded it to include regular text messaging, but it\u2019s still exclusive to iPhone 14 or newer users.\n\nApple\u2019s service is currently free for two years after activation, with a yet-to-be-determined long-term pricing for non-emergency satellite texting.\n\nVerizon & AT&T are following suit\n\n\n\nVerizon partnered with Skylo to roll out its emergency satellite messaging in 2024, with regular texting expected in 2025. However, this service will only be available on select phones (starting with the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9), as it requires NTN (Non-Terrestrial Network) compatibility.\n\nAT&T, meanwhile, is partnering with AST SpaceMobile, aiming for full satellite-powered voice, text, and data services. Like T-Mobile, AST\u2019s system is designed to function like a normal cellular network without special hardware, but it\u2019s still in the testing phase, with widespread availability expected in late 2025.\n\nWhy T-Mobile\u2019s approach stands out?\n\n\n\nThe biggest advantage of T-Mobile\u2019s Starlink partnership is that it doesn\u2019t require new hardware or carrier exclusivity. If you have a phone that\u2019s 4 years old or newer, you can likely use the service\u2014regardless of which carrier you currently use. In contrast, Apple\u2019s service is iPhone-only, Verizon\u2019s rollout is device-restricted, and AT&T\u2019s full cellular replacement is still a bit down the road.\n\nDo you need satellite texting?\n\n\n\nIf you frequently travel to areas with poor cell coverage, signing up for a free satellite texting service now could be a no-brainer. If you\u2019re a Verizon or AT&T customer who spends all your time in cell coverage areas, you might want to wait for their rollout\u2014especially if you plan on upgrading to a newer compatible device soon.\n\nOne thing is clear: mobile dead zones are disappearing, and satellite connectivity is no longer limited to emergencies with lots of newer capabilities coming soon!",

The union is afraid that once T-Mobile closes on its acquisition of UScellular assets, competition in markets covered by UScellular will be reduced hurting consumers, workers, and other rural carriers. Consumers, for example, could face higher prices if competition is reduced in certain markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to a technicality, UScellular has been given permission by an appeals court to build a cell tower in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. The carrier argued that the town of Fond du Lac, in denying its permit to build the cell tower, did not follow the rules in doing so. As a result, the wireless provider said that it should receive the permit by default. The appeals court agreed with UScellular.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story started in April 2023 when UScellular made a deal with a landowner and requested a conditional-use permit (CUP) for the property. The town had 90 days to respond. After holding meetings and accepting public comments, the town of Fond du Lac denied UScellular's request following a voice vote. An attorney for the town explained that UScellular \"failed to establish that the new tower was reasonably necessary for the public convenience at that location.\"\n\n\n\nReceive the latest T-Mobile news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\nThe technicality takes place here when UScellular failed to receive the written copy of the town's decision and the written minutes from the town's board meeting failed to appear on the Fond du Lac website. Two weeks after the deadline passed, the carrier said that the application to build the cell tower had been approved by default. But the town failed to hand over a permit and was taken to court by UScellular.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally, a circuit court ruled in favor of Fond du Lac County and said that the carrier knew its request had been denied. As proof, the town pointed out that UScellular titled its filing \"Appeal of Town of Fond du Lac\u2019s Denial of U.S. Cellular Conditional Use Permit.\" But the appeals court saw things a little differently noting that the town had four simple steps it had to take: review the application, make a decision, notify the applicant in writing, and identify the evidence that led to a permit\u2019s rejection. The failure of the town to follow each step, especially the last two, led the court of appeals to overturn the circuit court decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ruling says, \"US Cellular is entitled to approval of its CUP application by operation of law based on [the law\u2019s] plain language. The carrier says that building its own cell tower in\n\n\n\nFond du Lac instead of having to lease space on a competitor's tower will save it $2.4 million. This shouldn't have much impact on the T-Mobile -UScellular deal since the latter will retain ownership of 4,400 cell towers. T-Mobile will lease space on 2,100 of the towers kept by UScellular and will be the anchor tenant on 2,000 of the towers for 15 years.\n\n\n\n",

According to parents, the antennas were hidden from sight, and Rock Church had no plans to disclose their existence to parents.\n\nT-Mobile plans to activate the antennas after Memorial Day when the school session ends, according to a statement from the iglesia.\n\nIn a statement, the church apologized for signing a contract with T-Mobile without informing or consulting parents.\n\nYour tax-deductible gift helps our journalists report the truth and hold Christian leaders and organizations accountable.

It wasn\u2019t until February 2023 that Rock Church and Academy leadership held meetings with parents to discuss concerns and questions, according to the church\u2019s statement.\n\nParents accidentally discovered the antennas\n\nParents allegedly didn\u2019t know about the cell antennas until someone saw the antennas while the school was closed for a holiday break, parent Laura Buckley told the publication The Defender.\n\nThroughout installation, the school and T-Mobile hid the antennas behind tarps, Buckley said. However, during Christmas break in early January 2023, a mother saw the antennas while the tarp was down, Buckley explained.\n\nThe mother snapped a photo, Buckley said, and then people began to find out about the antennas.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not just that the Rock failed to inform parents and staff before signing the contract,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cThey were presumably never going to disclose the antennas at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow they are hidden behind a facade that matches the building,\u201d she added. Buckley has children in third, sixth and eighth grade at the school.\n\nParents urge, \u201cStop the cover up!\u201d\n\nTiffany Fletcher, a mother with a sixth grader at Rock Academy, told The Defender, that the school \u201ctried to be hush-hush\u201d about the matter at a later March 2023 meeting.\n\nThe church said in its statement that it held the March meeting to inform the whole Rock Church congregation. However, Fletcher said the church seemed more concerned about \u201cmanaging its brand,\u201d at the meeting.\n\nConcerned parents then passed out flyers about the antennas at church, Fletcher said. The flyers said, \u201cStop the cover up!\u201d and expressed concern about the lack of parental consent in the issue.\n\nIn March 2023, the church tried to negotiate with T-Mobile to have the antennas removed from its property, according to the church\u2019s statement. The church prohibited T-Mobile from coming on its property to access the antennas.\n\nParents also took action and filed a writ of mandate against the city of San Diego in April 2023. They asked the city to disallow the installation of the antennas at the school. This action is currently on appeal, Fletcher said.\n\nThen in January 2024, T-Mobile sued Rock Church, claiming that the Rock committed a breach of contract when it denied T-Mobile\u2019s access to school grounds, according to court documents.\n\nThey also asked for access to church property to activate the antennas. In April, a judge granted their request.\n\nThe contract with T-Mobile was initially signed to generate more income for the church, Rock Church spokesperson Meiling Nazar told SD News.\n\n\u201cThe Rock Church and Academy decided to lease a portion of its Point Loma campus building roof to T-Mobile for a cell phone antenna to generate additional income for the ministry,\u201d Nazar said. \u201cThe Rock\u2019s congregants and parents expressed concerns about the cell antenna installation, and as a church, we are heartbroken to see how our decision has affected the Rock\u2019s parents and families.\u201d\n\nAntennas\u2019 radiation pose potential health risks\n\nParents are concerned that the cell antennas pose serious health risks for children at the school.\n\n\u201cA cell tower was installed on my children\u2019s school without notice and parents are currently fighting this,\u201d Rock Academy parent Joseph Guilmet told SD News. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the Rock Church would allow this on a school 20 feet above preschoolers if there is even a slight chance of them being exposed to harmful radiation. And why was this done without us even knowing?\u201d\n\nCell phone antennas produce RF waves, a type of non-ionizing radiation, according to the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC). Towers like T-Mobiles typically don\u2019t emit an unsafe level of radiation, the FCC said.\n\nHowever, several independent, peer-reviewed studies found health risks to these wireless waves.\n\nIn 2018, a estudio found that adolescents exposed to higher levels of wireless radiation had delayed fine and gross motor skills, spatial working memory and attention compared with those exposed to lower radiation levels.

However, its availability is limited to certain areas of the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) region, which puts it at a disadvantage against some competitors. Spectrum Internet and T-Mobile Home Internet are strong alternatives.\n\nIf you're looking for a premium amount of speed, you won't find it in Dallas. But that doesn't mean residents of the Texas city are without a range of high-speed options. Such options include AT&T and Frontier, both of which provide their customers with fast fiber connections, and Optimum and Spectrum, which offer reliable cable service.\n\nDallas customers have a range of budget-friendly internet plans to choose from. Astound Broadband stands out with its $20 monthly plan offering impressive 300 Mbps download speeds. However, be aware that the price will rise after the initial promotional period.\n\nBest internet in Dallas, Texas\n\nThere's a lot to love about Dallas, Texas -- the people, the sights, and, on a more personal level, my grandmother's mouthwatering barbecue, which we'd devour whenever my family would visit. But I'm here to talk about broadband, not smoked meat. Thankfully, Dallas has quite a few home internet options, too.\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nOther available internet providers in Dallas\n\nMany other broadband choices exist in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area beyond our top three picks. Some are outside the Dallas city limits but can be found well within the immediate suburbs. Others may only be in small pockets farther away from the city center. In most cases, each provider offers something enticing, even with some glaring issues.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nAstound Broadband : This cable internet provider, known locally as Grande Communications but now part of parent company Astound Broadband, features some of DFW's most compelling and competitive promo rates.

Astound also features some of the steepest price increases in the industry. The Astound Broadband Texas rate card reveals that your 300Mbps plan could rise to $90 per month after your promo period.

In any case, Optimum cable internet service can be mostly found east of Dallas in the Mesquite area, covering Balch Springs, Forney, Rockwall and Terrell.

Satellite internet : Typically, if you live in a big metro area like Dallas, I wouldn't even broach the topic of satellite internet. You're bound to find more reliable connections, faster speeds and cheaper prices than are awaiting you with a satellite internet connection. DFW is a large area, and some on the rural periphery may not have the same options. While Hughesnet and Viasat are steady choices, both feature data restrictions. Starlink, Elon Musk's newer satellite provider on the block, is more intriguing as it features faster speeds and no contracts -- and the Starlink availability map shows availability for the Dallas-Fort Worth area (which wasn't the case in 2023).\n\nTypically, if you live in a big metro area like Dallas, I wouldn't even broach the topic of satellite internet.

Verizon 5G Home Internet: Verizon has been just as ambitious with its 5G home internet product as T-Mobile, although perhaps not quite as aggressive in pursuing rural communities. As such, Verizon fell short of our top list because it might not serve communities on the outskirts of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area as well as T-Mobile can. If you are serviceable for Verizon 5G Home Internet, you'll find faster speeds than T-Mobile (average of 300Mbps to T-Mobile's 72 to 245Mbps) and a similar, straightforward approach for $50-$70 per month, including no data caps, no contracts and no equipment fees. Also, customers can shave $15 to $25 off their monthly bill if they have a qualifying Verizon mobile plan.\n\nValerie Macon/Getty Images\n\nCheap internet options in Dallas\n\nThe average starting price for internet service in Dallas is approximately $46 per month, but a few providers offer plans cheaper than that. The absolute lowest starting price you can find currently belongs to Astound Broadband. It features a 300Mbps plan with a promo price of $20 per month.\n\nResidents in downtown Dallas won't be able to get Astound's cheap internet, but serviceability reaches out to Flower Mound, Frisco, Fairview, Little Elm and McKinney.\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet plan in Dallas?\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nHow to find internet deals and promotions in Dallas\n\nThe best internet deals and top promotions in Dallas depend on what discounts are available during that time. Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers.\n\nDallas internet providers, such as Astound Broadband and Optimum, may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Others, including AT&T, Frontier and Verizon, run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nHow fast is Dallas broadband?\n\nDallas disappoints when you compare its home internet speeds to some of the other top cities in the US. The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan area boasts the country's fourth-largest population, but according to Ookla's most recent reporting, Dallas managed only a 98th-place finish among the 100 most populated cities in the US. That puts it right behind Seattle and just above Detroit and Atlanta. This may seem competitive, but it's well behind other Texas towns such as Austin, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Fort Worth and San Antonio -- all of which made the top 15. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nFastest internet plans in Dallas\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Dallas\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn't end there: We use the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answers to those questions are often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our page on how we test ISPs.\n\nWhat's the final word on internet providers in Dallas?\n\nAs we like to say in our CNET home internet reviews, fiber internet trumps cable broadband almost every time. So if you have access to any of the AT&T Fiber plans -- or, if you're in the suburbs, Frontier Fiber -- that will be your best bet. Cable providers like Spectrum, Astound, and Optimum offer reliable connections and plenty of fast plans to suit just about any household. Be sure to avoid data caps, and if you're serviceable for providers like AT&T or Frontier, ensure you can get their fiber plans and don't have to settle for a slower, spottier DSL connection.\n\nDallas internet provider FAQs\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Dallas? If you're looking for the cheapest service in Dallas, Astound Broadband's option of 300Mbps for $20 per month is the absolute lowest you can pay monthly. Just beware of a steep price jump after the promo period ends. Show more\n\nIs fiber internet service available in Dallas? Yes. Several internet providers offer fiber connections within the greater Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metro area. AT&T and Frontier have the fastest plans, each with 5Gbps and 7 Gbps tiers, respectively, and symmetrical speeds. One thing to note is that each of those ISPs also has DSL plans, so do your homework to ensure you're getting their fiber offering and not DSL. Show more",

Let's look at what makes this internet service provider different. First, T-Mobile only charges $50 to $70 monthly for its plans, a price you can knock down to $35 to $55 by bundling with an eligible mobile plan. On top of that, you don't have to worry about long-term contracts or data caps. The company recently made headlines by introducing three new plans and a slew of perks. Pretty sweet, right?\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet is currently available to over 50 million homes across the US, but many locations and addresses still can't get it. 5G is the marquee player on this bill, but T-Mobile relies on 4G LTE to help expand its home internet service area. That means that of the 5G home internet providers, T-Mobile doesn't offer the fastest speeds on average -- a definite bummer. More on that later.\n\nGetty Images/Tharon Green/CNET\n\nT-Mobile launched 5G Home Internet as a pilot program early in 2021, and we were among the first to give it a hands-on test run. By April 2021, T-Mobile officially announced the launch of its home broadband service nationwide. A short year later, it expanded its availability to 40 million households, and we returned to give it another try. Another of our writers, who has used the service for two years, more recently shared her experience with T-Mobile Home Internet.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nT-Mobile has undergone many changes in its plan offerings. Initially, it only offered a single home internet plan, but in April 2024, T-Mobile announced two new internet plans: the Away plan, which is an option for people on the go, and the T-Mobile Home Internet Plus premium plan. Since then, T-Mobile is now offering three main plans, which come with faster speeds and new streaming perks. More on that in a bit.\n\nOverall, T-Mobile continues to be ecstatic about its 5G home internet offering. The number of subscribers has reached 6.4 million, according to the company's fourth-quarter 2024 report and the Federal Communications Commission included T-Mobile's home internet offering as one of only 11 fixed internet services able to cover over at least 5% of the US population. Further, T-Mobile Home Internet made a splash with the 2024 American Customer Satisfaction Index survey results by coming out in first place in customer satisfaction for all non-fiber internet service providers. Not too shabby.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nNow that the company has established its home broadband offering, will T-Mobile Home Internet prove a viable option to replace your current ISP?\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet plans\n\nT-Mobile offers customers T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet and T-Mobile All-In Internet. These plans feature faster speeds than what the company offered last year but for similar pricing to the Home Internet and Home Internet Plus plans. The speed boost is due to new and upgraded gateway routers, which are included with your service.\n\nThe Amplified and All-In Internet plans offer download speeds of 133 to 415Mbps, whereas the Rely Internet plans are 87 to 318Mbps. These are an upgrade from the 72 to 245Mbps you got from the previous standard plan. In addition, your upload speeds will also look different by plan. The Rely Internet plan offers slightly faster upload speeds of 14 to 56Mbps.\n\nIf your household does a lot of streaming, then T-Mobile's All-In Internet plan might be a good option. The plan includes a free Hulu and Paramount Plus (with ads) subscription. You also get a mesh router to help with coverage throughout the home. In addition, this plan is designed to ensure that customers have unlimited live tech support at all times through Assurant Personal TechPro. Although T-Mobile's standard plan already offered a customer care team aiding tech support for its customers, the All-In Internet plan goes a step further.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet pricing\n\nPlan Monthly price Max speeds Fees and service details T-Mobile Rely Internet\n\nRead full review $50 ($35 for eligible Go5G Plus and Magenta Max customers) 87-318Mbps download, 14-56Mbps upload No equipment fees, data caps or contracts.

These new plans feature relatively similar pricing to that of the standard plans. The premise of 5G home internet is that, unlike typical internet connection types (including coaxial cable lines, fiber-optic internet and digital subscriber lines), you're not reliant on underground constructions and deployments to get you connected. Instead, a fixed wireless internet service provides you with a router that connects to a cellular signal.\n\nT-Mobile\n\nT-Mobile provides its Wi-Fi Gateway device, a combination modem and Wi-Fi 6 router compatible with T-Mobile's 4G LTE and 5G networks. As you can see from the chart, the only variable is the average download and upload speed you'll experience. At the bare minimum, T-Mobile says, all eligible households should see average download speeds of 133 megabits per second. Depending on your location and the placement of the T-Mobile Gateway, you might see download speeds as high as 415Mbps.\n\nShouldn't 5G home internet service be faster?\n\nThe hope and promise of 5G and its capabilities haven't yet been fully realized, at least not by T-Mobile. My CNET colleague Eli Blumenthal has thoroughly detailed the basics of 5G and how not all \"5G\" is the same. In summary, faster 5G speeds come with shorter ranges. The farther the distance, the less speed on the top end.\n\nEnlarge Image T-Mobile utilizes much of its 4G LTE network to expand its availability, so don't expect full 5G capabilities all the time. T-Mobile\n\nFor T-Mobile to hit the road running with availability to over 30 million households at its launch, it leaned on its 4G LTE network as well as its growing 5G network. That's why my CNET colleagues averaged just over 40Mbps download speeds with T-Mobile Home Internet, and some households may get up to just over 100Mbps. Anecdotally, we've heard of some users seeing download speeds as high as 300Mbps. Still, T-Mobile's FAQ section promises customers will \"see typical download speeds between 87-415Mbps.\" While that may be plenty of speed for many folks, it doesn't compare to the higher download speeds you might get with fiber internet or cable plans. At least not yet.\n\nWhere can you get T-Mobile Home Internet?\n\nWhen discussing any ISP, it's always good to begin by answering the fundamental question: Can I get this service? T-Mobile Home Internet is available to around 60% of the country and all 50 states -- making it the most widely available home internet service. By comparison, Verizon's 5G Home Internet service has rolled out in approximately 900 markets but is available to around 40 million homes. In the meantime, T-Mobile is open to signups in over 600 cities but more households, many within rural areas.\n\nCheck the T-Mobile Home Internet eligibility page to determine if your address is serviceable.\n\nWhen will T-Mobile Home Internet get to my area?\n\nAs mentioned, T-Mobile is the most widely available 5G home internet service. Considering that US Census data puts the total number of households in the country at approximately 143 million, about 60% of households remain ineligible for T-Mobile Home Internet.\n\nA T-Mobile spokesperson didn't have specific details on expansion plans but highlighted that more than 10 million households in the current footprint are within rural America. Additionally, there's a focus on expanding access for small towns and communities. For people outside the current availability window, T-Mobile's site mentions that its Ultra Capacity 5G connection is expected \"to reach 300 million Americans by the end of this year.\" Yet, it's worth noting that even if you can access T-Mobile's 5G network, you may not automatically get its 5G home internet service.\n\nT-Mobile also has a Home Internet Lite service, open to anyone within a T-Mobile service area. While that broadens the company's availability footprint, it wouldn't be right to include this as part of T-Mobile Home Internet, as Lite has a 100 to 300GB data cap.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet features no hidden fees (with one exception)\n\nOne of the significant wins for T-Mobile Home Internet is its straightforwardness. There's no pesky small print. ISPs are notorious for their hidden fees and trap pricing -- they try to lure you in with enticing promo prices but then stick you with a larger bill after those terms expire. That's not the case here.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet features no data caps, so you don't have to fear data overage fees. There's no equipment fee for the Gateway device, so you don't have to figure out an additional monthly cost to tack on to your regular bill. It also requires no annual service contracts, so you don't have any early termination fees looming over your head. These are all appealing aspects of this service and make it very enticing to try T-Mobile Home Internet if it's available in your area.\n\nThere is one additional fee you'll have to pay once at the start of your service: a $35 \"device connection charge,\" similar to the activation fee you pay with many ISPs.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet perks and promos\n\nIn addition to its new plans, T-Mobile is sweetening the pot with a slew of perks to draw in potential customers.\n\nFirst, customers with eligible Go5G Plus and Magenta Max plans can save $15 monthly. Second, new customers can get a $200 virtual gift card for switching to T-Mobile Home Internet and a free Blink smart security package. Lastly, home internet customers can participate in T-Mobile Tuesdays, the company's weekly discount and free perks promotion.\n\nT-Mobile also runs a \"Worry-free Test Drive\" promotion, during which customers can try the service for 15 days with a money-back guarantee.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet vs. competitors\n\nFor the second year in a row, T-Mobile Home Internet was the highest-rated non-fiber ISP. ACSI\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet hit the ground running in 2023 when it debuted at the top of the American Customer Satisfaction Index's survey of nonfiber internet service providers. It scored 73 out of 100 points, well ahead of the category's 66-point average. Even more impressive is that it improved that score by 4% in 2024, still topping the ACSI chart, although Verizon 5G Home Internet was hot on its heels in second place.\n\nRegarding availability, T-Mobile is also ahead of its 5G home internet competitors, AT&T Internet Air, Starry and Verizon. Starry is available in five major metropolitan areas: Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington, D.C. Verizon is available in more cities than T-Mobile (currently 900) but is behind T-Mobile's total households covered.\n\nStarry and Verizon have the upper hand on average download speeds. Starry customers typically see consistent download speeds of 200Mbps, and Verizon's 5G Home Internet plans average around 300Mbps. What Starry and Verizon have given up regarding widespread availability, they currently make up for in the average speeds they deliver.\n\nAll the 5G home internet providers share freedom from all the hidden fees and pricing games that many cable and fiber ISPs play. With 5G, the monthly rate is the monthly rate. There are no equipment rental charges, data caps or binding annual contracts.\n\nWhat's the bottom line on T-Mobile Home Internet?\n\nRegarding 5G, we're much closer to the beginning than the end of where everything will shake out. If it's speed you're after, T-Mobile's 5G home internet service might not impress if you have other cable and fiber internet providers available at your address. If you're in a rural or less developed area where DSL or satellite was your only previous option, T-Mobile will feel lightning fast by comparison. As one CNET early adopter of T-Mobile Home Internet noted, \"Imperfection is a lot more tolerable when you're paying less than half what you were before.\"\n\nOverall, T-Mobile has positioned itself as a viable option in the home internet space, making it an intriguing player to watch as it expands its 5G infrastructure. If nothing else, since it demands no contract commitment, it's an opportunity to try a different option and maybe even use it as leverage to negotiate with your current internet service provider. Hopefully, the more options we have as consumers, our internet service will improve in the long run.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet FAQ\n\nAre there data caps with T-Mobile Home Internet? No. T-Mobile Home Internet features unlimited data. Customers will not have any potential data overage fees or charges hanging over their heads. If you use T-Mobile Home Internet you could find your service slowed in cases where the company prioritizes its mobile users over its fixed wireless service. Show more\n\nDoes T-Mobile Home Internet come with a router? Yes. Your router is included in your monthly bill for whichever plan you choose. One of the appealing aspects of T-Mobile Home Internet is that its monthly fee -- $50 to $70 a month (or $35 to $55 monthly for eligible Go5G Plus and Magenta Max mobile customers) -- includes a 5G Gateway (a modem/router combo device). The T-Mobile equipment lease is included in the one fee, and all that's required is that you return the device when you end service with T-Mobile. T-Mobile's new plans, Rely Internet, Amplified Internet and All-In Internet, feature faster routers. Show more",

Fast-forward more than a decade and a Sprint takeover later, and ironically, T-Mo now leads Ma Bell in terms of customer figures, which mind you, are still rising at a healthy pace\n\n\n\n\n\nT-Mobile may have become too big, too fast, AT&T seems to be mounting a silent comeback of sorts, with not just steady network improvements, but as well. But in many ways, it looks likemay have become too big, too fast, falling in the same profit-obsessed traps it used to accuse \"Dumb and Dumber\" of intentionally setting up for their subscribers. Relegated to an underdog status, meanwhile,seems to be mounting a silent comeback of sorts, with not just steady network improvements, but T-Mobile-style deals as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T has failed or avoided to tout its achievements very loudly. Well, I believe the carrier deserves great praise for its This has actually been going on for a while now, but for some reason,has failed or avoided to tout its achievements very loudly. Well, I believe the carrier deserves great praise for its latest \"RootMetrics US State of the Mobile Union\" win , not to mention its evolution over time in these particular measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon was this report's overall victor AT&T single-handedly triumphed when the data from no less than three million tests conducted in the second half of last year was gathered. was this report's overall victor back in the first half of 2024 , and after statistically tying Big Red for the gold medal position during the final six months of 2023 single-handedly triumphed when the data from no less than three million tests conducted in the second half of last year was gathered.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's clearly a lot of (super-reliable) data that makes this victory incredibly significant for the carrier, not to mention very meaningful from the perspective of a lot of everyday mobile consumers across the country.\n\nSo, wait, is AT&T better than T-Mobile or not?\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, in these measurements, it certainly is, especially when you consider its network reliability, speed, data, call, and text crowns compared to T-Mobile 's tally of... zero RootMetrics trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, this is not the be-all and end-all analytics firm out there, and I'd be incredibly superficial in my research if I simply ignored Opensignal's equally scientific and equally reliable findings from just last month . In that study, based on billions (with a \"b\") of daily tests performed between September and November 2024, T-Mo crushed its competition, taking home all five \"overall experience\" awards, as well as possibly the single most important \"5G experience\" title.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm definitely in no position to debate whose methodology makes more sense and which of these two companies you should trust more (as I personally find them both highly trustworthy), but what I can say is that even Opensignal's measurements prove AT&T 's network is improving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T is doing something right from both speed and availability standpoints, making slow but steady progress as far as both its 5G signal and mobile network as a whole are concerned. That's easily noticeable if you look closely at the January 2024 and July 2024 reports and compare all the numbers with the ones from last month. Clearly,is doing something right from both speed and availability standpoints, making slow but steady progress as far as both its 5G signal and mobile network as a whole are concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T as a better carrier than T-Mobile . Like it or not, much of the anecdotal evidence available on social media and places like Reddit suggests more T-Mo users are happy with their coverage, speeds, and prices (even after AT&T or Verizon customers. And that's something a lot of folks tend to value a whole lot more than some cold hard numbers. Before you go there, by the way, I'd like to acknowledge the obvious fact that network performance tests don't always align with real-life user experiences... which is precisely why I'm so reluctant to labelas a better carrier than. Like it or not, much of the anecdotal evidence available on social media and places like Reddit suggests more T-Mo users are happy with their coverage, speeds, and prices (even after all those recent hikes ) thanorcustomers. And that's something a lot of folks tend to value a whole lot more than some cold hard numbers.\n\nHave you noticed how much noise T-Mobile tends to make about every... single... award the \"Un-carrier\" receives from analytics companies like Opensignal, RootMetrics, and Umlaut? If you're not paying close enough attention to these types of things (which is probably true for most \"regular\" mobile users and casual tech industry followers), you might get the impression thatandare never victorious in any network experience comparisons and battles against their arch-rival (and each other).",

The best part about this update deal is that it apparently doesn\u2019t require you to change or upgrade your plans or add a new line. A qualifying trade-in is needed, though, and that would net you a great discount on your next phone.\n\nReddit user awashbu12 claims to be a T-Mobile store-in-store employee, and they\u2019ve shared that the company has introduced two Valentine\u2019s Day iPhone promos: If you are on Magenta Max, Go5G Plus, or Next plans, you can get $830 off a new iPhone.\n\nYou can get $500 off a new iPhone on other postpaid plans such as Magenta, Go5G, One, Simple Choice, and Essentials. As mentioned, you apparently don\u2019t need to change or upgrade your plans or add a new line. The promo can net you Costco and Sam\u2019s Club gift cards, which makes the deal even sweeter.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a catch, this does need a qualifying trade-in for the full amount. Reddit user desterpot has shared the full list of Eligible Trade-in Devices for the iPhone 16 Valentine\u2019s Day Promo:\n\nWith the above devices, you can get the full amount as a discount, while phones older than this will get you half the discount. You will get the discounted amount back as bill credits over the next 24 months. The iPhone 14 Pro appears missing from the list, but Reddit comments mention it could be an error.\n\nFurther, special segmented plans like Military, First Responder, and 55 Plus under Magenta Max, Go5G Plus, and Go5G Next get $630 off, while other military plans get $500 off. The offer is also said to be available at corporate-owned T-Mobile retail stores, though the alleged employee is unaware of other channels. You can also upgrade a maximum of four lines with this deal.\n\nThe iPhone 16 starts at $799, while the iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999. With the maximum discount, you can get the iPhone 16 for free while paying just $170 and taxes for the 16 Pro.\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted T-Mobile to confirm this promo and to learn how long this lasts. If you are on an older phone and are itching to get your hands on the latest iPhone, a trip to your local T-Mobile corporate retail store might just be worth it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an Android-equivalent offer, Reddit user desterpot mentions a similar offer for Samsung and Pixels for $500 off.

If you no longer want to worry about not being connected, keep reading to get all the details about T-Mobile Starlink, plus the benefits of satellite coverage.\n\nWhat is T-Mobile Starlink?\n\nT Mobile\u2019s Starlink program is a partnership between T-Mobile and Space X to provide satellite-based internet services. According to a press release from T-Mobile, it\u2019s \u201ca direct-to-cell satellite service that will help eliminate dead zones by providing coverage for the 500,000 square miles of land in the United States not covered by earth-bound cell towers.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile will use SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite network, consisting of a constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. \u201cT-Mobile Starlink is the first major low-earth orbit constellation in the world paired with terrestrial cellular spectrum, making the phone in your pocket work in areas of the U.S. that have never, and probably never will, have ground-based coverage,\u201d said Mike Katz, president of marketing, strategy and products at T-Mobile, in the press release\n\nHe adds, \u201cIt\u2019s a truly groundbreaking engineering breakthrough and means that we are one step closer to helping T-Mobile customers have confidence that, no matter where they are, if they can see the sky, they will be covered by T-Mobile.\u201d\n\nEntertainment Astronauts Stuck in Space: How Do They Communicate With Their Families? It has been confirmed that the two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stuck at the International Space Station (ISS) since early June 2024 are confirmed to remain in space until 2025, and return home on SpaceX. Their original eight-day journey has extended to over two months and will not end until [\u2026]\n\nHow does satellite texting work?\n\nAs part of the beta, participants can send short message service (SMS) messages when outside, even in places considered dead zones.\n\n\u201cThe apparent main benefit is the ability to stay connected practically anywhere you go,\u201d says Mason Miller, senior communications specialist at T-Mobile. \u201cNo more worried loved ones when they don\u2019t hear back from you, plus emergency alerts always make it through, even if you aren\u2019t connected to the terrestrial network.\n\nAnother perk? You don\u2019t have to be connected to cell towers on Earth. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially building cell towers in space that cover areas Earth towers can\u2019t,\u201d adds Miller.\n\nMore details regarding the beta testing\n\nThe beta service for T-Mobile\u2019s Starlink is free and will be available to all T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon customers until July. T-Mobile will start charging after that. It\u2019ll be part of their most expensive Go5G Next plan and available as an add-on to other plans for $15 per month per line. However, as part of a special, T-Mobile users who are using the service now will be able to lock in a lower rate of $10 per month per line.\n\nFor other network users, the Starlink service will be priced at $20 per month per line. While they don\u2019t need to switch to T-Mobile, they must have an unlocked compatible device that supports eSims ( a digital SIM card built into the device).\n\nYou can register to be added to the beta program here.\n\nWhat does T-Mobile Starlink mean for technology?\n\nImages By Tang Ming Tung\n\nT-Mobile Starlink is the only space-based network in the US that automatically connects to devices you already have, explains Miller. The carrier hopes to roll out satellite voice and data support in the future.\n\n\u201cWhile satellite comms aren\u2019t necessarily new, we\u2019re eliminating the need to buy more expensive gear/devices that up until now have been the only way to stay connected when off the grid,\u201d says Miller. \u201cThis is because we\u2019re making it work with smartphones already in your pocket\u2013and most modern smartphones from the last four years and newer can tap into the service.\u201d",

Responses from 17,331 customers who use any of three purchase conduits \u2014 phone calls, visits to the carrier\u2019s store, or digital channels such as a website or mobile app \u2014 were used to determine the results.\n\nThe study ranked T-Mobile No. 1 among mobile network operators, with a score of 832. This is the 15th consecutive volume for the carrier. AT&T (scored 815) and Verizon Wireless (scored 809) placed second and third. The average score in this segment was 819.\n\nSpectrum Mobile ranked No. 1 among full-service mobile virtual network operators, with a score of 855.

Power\u2019s study shows that overall satisfaction with the mobile retail experience fell 8 points from the previous study\u2019s volume, landing at 827 on a 1,000-point scale.\n\nThe researcher said the drop in satisfaction is largely due to a decline in how respondents scored cost and promotions: only 34% of customers studied thought their wireless service had improved in value. Interestingly, satisfaction increased significantly (by 203 points) among customers who view their plans and features as easy to understand, J.D. Power said.\n\nCarl Lepper, senior director of technology, media and telecom at J.D. Power, noted, \u201cAs plans seem to be getting more complicated and challenging, wireless providers should take the customer experience to another level of service.\n\n\u201cBy taking time with customers, being patient and explaining new phone technologies or any changes they are making to an account, customers will have a better understanding of their billing and feel more satisfied with their service.\u201d\n\nThe J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Wireless Customer Care Study, released earlier this month, said that mobile customers are showing increased dissatisfaction with their online and in-store experiences for the first time in a couple of years.",

Finally, if you're \"all-in\" on Magenta's 5G Home Internet service, you can cough up $55 a month and get all the above perks and benefits, as well as 24/7 tech support, Hulu, and Paramount+ access.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose are some very competitive prices, so it's definitely no wonder that T-Mo has been able to massively increase its subscriber numbers of late, a trend that I fully expect to continue, especially after the introduction of this improved new sign-up deal. The $200 deal, by the way, is explicitly flagged as a \"limited-time\" affair, and with no expiration date in sight, it's probably wise to not waste any time and embrace T-Mobile 's increasingly popular and universally praised 5G Home Internet service if you've been sitting on the fence for some reason.\n\nhad a lot to celebrate when it released its financial report for the final quarter of last year and 2024 as a whole a couple of weeks ago, with one of the \"Un-carrier's\" greatest achievements probably being a boost of a whopping 1.7 million in High Speed Internet customers.",

Through a partnership between T-Mobile, SpaceX, and Starlink, a new satellite-to-cell service allows users to send and receive text messages even in areas without traditional network coverage.\n\nIn December 2024, T-Mobile launched a beta program for this satellite-powered messaging service, offering US customers early access at no extra cost. The program is still open for those who want to apply, making it easier than ever to stay connected-no cell towers required.\n\nRead more: T-Mobile Opens Its Starlink Beta, Including to People With AT&T and Verizon\n\nHowever, access is limited during the T-Mobile Starlink beta.

We'll Explain the Pros and Cons 02:38\n\nWhat exactly is the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service and how does it work?\n\nIn August 2022, during a live event, T-Mobile and SpaceX announced Coverage Above and Beyond, a plan for bringing cellphone connectivity everywhere in the US, even in the most remote regions. T-Mobile's wireless network would leverage Starlink's direct-to-cell satellites -- more than 300 of them -- to provide \"near complete coverage\" to all 500,000 square miles in the US that are not covered by cell towers, essentially eliminating dead zones.\n\nIf you're in an area without cell service, like Yosemite National Park or the Grand Canyon, your phone will automatically connect to the nearest T-Mobile Starlink satellite, acting like a floating cellphone tower, to give you service, as long as there's nothing obstructing the connection between your phone and the sky.\n\nThis partnership has been years in the making. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nWhat can you do with the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service?\n\nYou can use the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service to send and receive text messages on your supported phone -- for free. That includes text messages to 911 in case of an emergency. Plans are in place to add support for picture messaging, voice calls, and data soon -- but for most users, it will come at a cost.\n\nEventually, you'll be able to surf the web with Starlink.

A new rumor claims the company is preparing to conduct a Type Allocation Code (TAC) audit of customer plans soon.\n\nAs you may or may not know, every phone has a unique 15-digit number known as its International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). This number can be found in several places, such as the SIM tray, battery, or even on the phone\u2019s box. With this identifier, the network has everything it needs to know about your device, including the device type, brand, model, and color. On top of revealing the identity of your device, the IMEI can also be used to verify if your device is compatible with the network and if it\u2019s authorized to be used with that plan.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how this relates to TAC, these are the first eight digits of an IMEI. It is used to identify the device manufacturer and the model. With the TAC, T-Mobile can tell if you\u2019re using an improper device on a plan and act accordingly. However, the Un-carrier hasn\u2019t really gone down the route of enforcing device type and plan by TAC up to now.\n\nAccording to The Mobile Report, this status quo may soon change. The outlet claims an inside source within T-Mobile has told them the company is getting ready to audit customer plans to ensure every device\u2019s TAC is authorized to be used with the plan it\u2019s using. So if a discrepancy is spotted, the user may have their service disrupted on that device. It\u2019s alleged that this audit will be done on a majority of, if not all, plans.\n\nNo information is available on when this audit may start, but it\u2019s said that it could happen soon. The outlet says the rumor is pointing to sometime in Q2.\n\nAndroid Authority has reached out to T-Mobile for comment on the rumor.

The team is headed by G. Michael Sievert, who serves as the company's President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director.

The company recently reported annual revenue representing a slight decline compared to the previous year. Despite the decrease in revenue, T-Mobile reduced its operating expenses. The company's net income has experienced a slight decline recently as well.\n\nT-Mobile operates in the highly competitive radiotelephone communication industry. The telecommunications sector is characterized by rapid technological advancements, evolving consumer preferences, and intense competition among major players.

The company continues to invest in expanding its network infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, to enhance coverage and improve service quality. Additionally, T-Mobile is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for 5G connectivity, offering faster speeds and unlocking new possibilities for customers and businesses.\n\nT-Mobile has also pursued strategic acquisitions to fuel its growth. For instance, the company completed its merger with Sprint Corporation, further strengthening its market position and enabling synergies in network expansion and cost savings. Moreover, T-Mobile has the potential to explore new business segments, such as Internet of Things (IoT) solutions and enterprise services, to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nT-Mobile faces certain risks and challenges in the dynamic telecommunications industry. The evolving nature of consumer preferences and technological advancements pose risks in terms of maintaining a competitive edge and adapting to changing market dynamics. Regulatory changes and compliance requirements can also impact the company's operations and profitability.\n\nAdditionally, T-Mobile operates in a capital-intensive industry, requiring substantial investments in network infrastructure and spectrum licenses. This reliance on capital expenditures can strain the company's financial resources and cash flow generation. T-Mobile must carefully manage its debt levels and effectively allocate resources to sustain its growth trajectory.",

This massive fishing expedition demonstrates that they are desperately seeking any factual basis for their provably false claims. They will find none.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that Freedman represents Wallace, as does Crisis PR chief Melissa Nathan, who is a fellow defendant in many of these suits.\n\nAt the heart of this portion of the allegations, both Lively\u2019s strategic December 20 sexual harassment and retaliation complaint against Baldoni and her subsequent New Year\u2019s Eve formal court filing, is that the high priced Nathan was retained by Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios to blunt any attack the actress may have made against him over conduct on IEWU. To that, Nathan\u2019s TAG firm is alleged to have worked with Wallace (called Jed in some already public texts and other correspondence from Nathan and her team) to actually execute the online smear of Lively, that went after her reputation and derailed the summer 2024 launch of a new Lively product line.\n\nNathan and fellow publicist Jennifer Abel admit they planned a potential defense of their client, but they never had to push the button because an organic hate-on against Lively occurred anyway.\n\nWith the role and reach of Texas-based Wallace under the microscope even more of late, the attempt to dive deeper into his affairs, at the keyboard and otherwise could be significant. In the overlap of Lively\u2019s likely to be amended NYE-filed sexual harassment and retaliation suit against Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, execs and PR team and Baldoni\u2019s now amended January 16 $400 million defamation and extortion suit against Lively, Reynolds and their publicist Leslie Sloane, Wallace could be the inflection point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith an amended complaint and so-called timeline posted on its own website on the last day of January by Team Baldoni, that\u2019s at least what Team Blake are saying.\n\n\u201cIn their internal private messages that Baldoni\u2019s team never expected anyone would see, they bragged that thanks to Jed\u2019s work they saw a shift in the narrative to putting a spotlight on Blake and laughed at how sad it was that people so easily want to hate on a woman,\u201d a spokesperson for Lively and Reynolds said to Deadline this afternoon. \u201cWe look forward to investigating more about Jed Wallace\u2019s entire business model and what else he was doing to distract from the very real sexual harassment and retaliation claims made by Ms. Lively. We are delighted to be able to start discovery on it.\u201d\n\nWith multiple lawsuits, including a $7 million defamation action launched last week against Lively by alleged online smear campaign mastermind Wallace at play, Baldoni and Lively and Reynolds are currently set to go to trial on March 29, 2026 in New York.\n\nvia: Deadline\n\nAdvertisement",

            "content": "T-Mobile Starlink Beta Launches Nationwide\n\n\n\nby Clarence Oxford\n\n\n\nLos Angeles CA (SPX) Feb 12, 2025\n\n\n\nDuring one of the nation's most-watched sporting events, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) introduced its latest innovation in wireless connectivity-T-Mobile Starlink. Now available in public beta, this cutting-edge service, developed in partnership with Starlink, leverages advanced satellite-to-mobile technology to provide coverage in more than 500,000 square miles of the U.S. that lack traditional cellular reception. This area is nearly double the size of Texas, offering expanded access where cell towers are absent.\n\nT-Mobile Starlink operates through specially designed satellites featuring Direct-to-Cell technology, orbiting over 200 miles above Earth at speeds exceeding 17,000 mph. Currently, the service supports text messaging, with future plans to integrate picture messaging, data, and voice calls. This innovation aims to bridge connectivity gaps, ensuring mobile coverage in remote locations, often referred to as dead zones.\n\n\"T-Mobile Starlink is the first and only space-based mobile network in the U.S. that automatically connects to your phone so you can be connected even where no cellular network reaches. It's a massive technical achievement and an absolute game changer for ALL wireless users,\" stated Mike Sievert, President and CEO of T-Mobile. \"We're still in the early days-I don't want to overhype the experience during a beta test-but we're officially putting 'no bars' on notice. Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.\"\n\nSeamless Connectivity Without Additional Hardware\n\nOne of the key advantages of T-Mobile Starlink is its effortless integration with existing smartphones. When a user moves beyond conventional cellular coverage, their device automatically transitions to the Starlink satellite network. No manual switching or additional equipment is required. Standard text messages, including group texts and reactions, continue to function as usual. The service is compatible with most smartphones released in the past four years, eliminating the need for specialized hardware.\n\nAdditionally, T-Mobile Starlink ensures that users receive Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs), further enhancing safety measures. This satellite-based alert system delivers crucial warnings and emergency notifications to anyone within range of a T-Mobile Starlink satellite, including those in isolated areas affected by natural disasters or severe weather conditions.\n\nBeta Testing and Pricing Structure\n\nThe T-Mobile Starlink beta phase is free through July, after which it will be integrated at no extra cost into T-Mobile's Go5G Next plans, including Go5G Next 55+. Business customers on Go5G Business Next and first responders on T-Priority plans will also receive the service without additional charges. For customers on other plans, T-Mobile Starlink can be added for $15 per month per line.\n\nFor a limited time, customers registering for the beta can secure an Early Adopter Discount, reducing the monthly cost to $10 per line, a 33% savings off the standard rate.\n\nExpanded Access for All Carriers\n\nRecognizing that connectivity is essential for everyone, T-Mobile is also offering Verizon and AT&T customers the opportunity to try out Starlink's satellite service. During the beta period, users from these carriers can send and receive text messages via T-Mobile Starlink for free. Once the service officially launches in July, it will be available for $20 per month per line for non-T-Mobile customers.\n\nJoin the T-Mobile Starlink Beta\n\nT-Mobile encourages individuals, businesses, and first responders across all carriers to participate in the beta phase. This phased rollout allows the company to refine service performance ahead of its full-scale launch in July. Those interested in signing up can find more details and registration links on T-Mobile's website.\n\nGlobal Expansion and Industry Collaboration\n\nAs T-Mobile and Starlink push forward in their mission to eliminate mobile dead zones, they welcome international wireless providers to join their satellite-to-mobile initiative. Several major carriers, including KDDI (Japan), Telstra (Australia), Optus (Australia), One NZ (New Zealand), Salt (Switzerland), Entel (Chile and Peru), Rogers (Canada), and Kyivstar (Ukraine), have already signed on to the initiative, helping expand this technology worldwide.\n\nFor more insights into the technical collaboration between T-Mobile and SpaceX, additional details are available from Ulf Ewaldsson, President of Technology at T-Mobile.\n\nRelated Links\n\nT-Mobile\n\nThe latest information about the Commercial Satellite Industry\n\n",

The NantStudios team in Los Angeles ingested more than 10 minutes of ultra-high definition, immersive sequences, telemetry and driver animation data from Radiant Images' capture teams in Las Vegas into a real-time pipeline, via MeetMo's advanced collaboration platform. The resulting render generated more than 20,000 4K frames for each pass, which were then transferred via T-Mobile's 5G network back to Las Vegas for seamless integration into the interactive app.\n\nThis groundbreaking project showcases unmatched efficiency and paves the way for content creators to reach their audiences beyond traditional formats.\n\n\"By powering remote production with blazing-fast data transfers and providing low latency that's needed for live video production, this collaboration broke new ground for immersive fan engagement,\" said Chris Melus, VP of Product Management, T-Mobile Business Group. \"Partnering with MeetMo, Radiant Images and NantStudios, we showcased how 5G technology can transform live events, offering Las Vegas Grand Prix spectators an unparalleled experience.\"\n\nJim Chabin, President of the Advanced Imaging Society, praised the collaboration: \"The Las Vegas Grand Prix F1 demonstrates the transformative power of combining cutting-edge technologies with creative vision.

This enabled remote camera control, instant footage reviews, and immediate post-processing, significantly reducing production time and resources. Seamless AR Integration: In partnership with NantStudios and utilizing Unreal Engine, virtual and real-world elements were seamlessly merged. Augmented reality overlays delivered real-time data\u2014such as the drivers steering wheel controls, dashboard metrics, and telemetry\u2014transmitted via 5G, elevating the immersive experience.

            "content": "T-Mobile's new Starlink offering makes satellite phones mainstream\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption T-Mobile teams up with Starlink to eliminate dead zones The new service connects cell phone users to satellites when they are out of range of a cell tower. (Scripps News) Scripps News\n\nThe recent Super Bowl brought with it lots of surprises and, once again, a few of them came from the very pricey ads shown during the broadcast. One of the most intriguing was T-Mobile\u2019s spot describing free satellite smartphone service available to customers of any major wireless carrier, including AT&T and Verizon (as well as T-Mobile, of course).\n\nIn other words, T-Mobile \u2014 in conjunction with satellite provider Starlink \u2014 is essentially introducing satellite service when you\u2019re in an area without traditional cellular service to just about anyone in the US with a mobile phone that\u2019s not more than about 4 years old.\n\nThere is, not surprisingly, some fine print to the offer, however.\n\nMost importantly, you have to sign up for the limited number of spots that T-Mobile is making available for the free trial beta test. If you do get in, you\u2019ll have access to free text messaging, location sharing and 911 emergency text services through June in remote \u201cdead zones\u201d that don\u2019t have traditional cellular service. After the commercial service launches in July, you\u2019ll pay $15 a month if you\u2019re an existing T-Mobile customer (only $10/month if you sign up for the beta in February) or $20 a month if you\u2019re with AT&T or Verizon. For customers of T-Mobile\u2019s high-end Go5G Next plan (priced at $105/month), the satellite service will be bundled for free.\n\nMore Starlink news: Apple iPhone to support Starlink direct-to-cell coverage in US\n\nNote that AT&T and Verizon customers do not have to change their existing cellular plans, nor will it change how and where those work. This T-Mobile service will essentially sit on top of those services and only kick in when needed \u2014 when you\u2019re off the grid.\n\nAs mentioned, the initial service will be limited to basic text messages and location info, but voice calls, texts with images and data support for a certain number of applications are being developed. Don\u2019t expect to be able to do bandwidth-heavy things like stream YouTube or Netflix videos from a remote mountaintop \u2014 at least not for a while. Instead, you\u2019ll likely be able to run things like messaging apps, mapping apps and other low data rate applications as data support is enabled.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe way the service works is once you go outside of traditional cellular network range, your phone essentially switches over to a new satellite network powered by the 450 or so Starlink satellites you may have noticed flying overhead over the last few months. (No, those long strings of lights way up in the sky are not UFOs\u2026)\n\nPart of the reason why T-Mobile can make this offer to AT&T and Verizon customers is that the satellite network \u2014 technically called a non-terrestrial network, or NTN \u2014 is completely different and independent from existing cellular networks that each of the carriers maintain. As a result, it\u2019s the same process to switch over to it, regardless of your primary cellular carrier.\n\nWhen you do connect, you\u2019ll get a text message from T-Mobile saying you\u2019re connected to the satellite network and a new connection icon at the top of your phone\u2019s screen. Once you do, you\u2019ll be able to both send and receive basic text messages. When you get back into regular coverage, you\u2019ll switch back to your normal cellular service.\n\nBehind the scenes, what\u2019s happening is that the Starlink satellites make a connection with a chip inside your phone called a modem. Many modern phones incorporate circuitry within them that can communicate directly with satellites and the Starlink satelllites also can connect to some older phones that don\u2019t have satellite-specific modems.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think about, but yes, thanks to these modem chips from companies like Qualcomm and MediaTek that control connections to cell towers, the smartphone in your pocket also can connect directly with low earth orbiting (LEO) satellites flying 17,500 miles an hour located 340 miles up in the air \u2014 as long as your phone has direct sight of the sky.\n\nGiven that incredible distance, basic physics will explain that the signals being exchanged with satellites are only a tiny fraction as strong as those used for regular cellular networks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to do more data intensive applications and why satellite service won\u2019t ever replace traditional cellular networks but instead serve as a supplement to them.\n\nThe complete list of phones that have the necessary software to work with the service can be found here, but it basically includes all iPhones from the iPhone 14 onward, all Samsung Galaxy phones from the A14 and S21 onward, the Z Flip and Z Fold 3 and forward, the new Google Pixel 9s, and the 2024 versions of the Motorola razr, edge and moto g phones.\n\nT-Mobile customers will not have to make any configuration changes on their phones for the service to work. For people on AT&T or Verizon, you\u2019ll have to have an unlocked phone with the latest software updates and create an eSIM profile (not as hard as it sounds) with a new number that T-Mobile will provide to use as part of this service. Thankfully, once that\u2019s set up, the phone will automatically switch back and forth between your regular number and profile and the new one when it switches to the satellite connection. In other words, using the service should be completely seamless.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that this new T-Mobile/Starlink offering is different than some of the other satellite-based services that have already been introduced to the market. So, Apple\u2019s Satellite service, for example, will still be available for those who have signed up for it, but it connects to a different set of satellites (Globalstar in Apple\u2019s case) and, over time, may have a different set of capabilities and prices. In theory, you could sign up for both satellite services on a single iPhone, but it won\u2019t make much sense to do so.\n\nIn addition, both AT&T and Verizon made announcements last year and previewed some of their own satellite offerings being done in conjunction with other satellite providers (AST SpaceMobile and Skylo, respectively). Neither of them are widely available yet, however, so it remains to be seen how they will compare.\n\nProviding connectivity in areas where it\u2019s never been available before will be incredibly useful for a lot of people, as well as reassuring for their family members. Of course, it also means it\u2019s getting harder and harder to be truly disconnected for those who want to do so, but that\u2019s a topic for another day.\n\nRegardless, this new satellite service represents a very impressive accomplishment from T-Mobile and Starlink and highlights how far mobile technology has come. As with the early days of cellular, it\u2019s bound to seem like magic at first, but will soon be very normal.\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Bob O'Donnell is the president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, a market research and consulting firm.

            "content": "Analysts praised T-Mobile's Starlink free beta trial offer for Verizon and AT&T customers\n\nT-Mobile is clearly relishing its time-to-market advantage in the satellite messaging wars\n\nThe down side? It could backfire on T-Mo once the free trial for customers ends\n\nGo big or go home. That\u2019s the mantra behind T-Mobile\u2019s Super Bowl 2025 ad inviting customers of rival carriers to try out its T-Mobile Starlink texting service for free.\n\n\n\nForget that we\u2019ve known about T-Mobile\u2019s deal with Starlink for over two years now. Nevermind that rivals AT&T and Verizon are pursuing their own direct-to-device (D2D) satellite services. T-Mobile\u2019s first-to-market advantage and bold, in-your-face marketing are getting all the glory.\n\n\n\n\u201cT-Mobile did this to cause maximum disruption and to get access to other carriers\u2019 customers in a legal way and in a qualified way,\u201d said long-time wireless industry analyst and Recon Analytics founder Roger Entner. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty smart.\u201d\n\n\n\nNew Street Research financial analyst Jonathan Chaplin said it\u2019s the first marketing innovation along the lines of the earlier \u201cun-carrier\u201d moves that we\u2019ve seen in years.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt works as a marketing stunt,\u201d Chaplin wrote in a note for investors after the Super Bowl commercial aired on Sunday. \u201cIt will remind consumers that T-Mobile \u2026 still has some sass. Customers of Verizon and AT&T will be prompted to ask \u2018what have you done for me lately?\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated The D2D satellite push takes off\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Super Bowl ad also scored points as the most engaging. EDO ranked Sunday\u2019s ads based on how effective they were in driving consumer behaviors, such as website visits and brand searches. T-Mobile\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Connected\u201d ad grabbed the No. 1 spot for generating 12.6 times as much engagement as the median Super Bowl LIX ad, putting it one notch ahead of the RAM commercial starring (one of our fave actors) Glen Powell.\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s ad ended with a directive to go to the T-Mobile website to sign up for the beta \u2013 which is free until July \u2013 and it only takes a few seconds. That\u2019s where the marketing shrewdness comes in: T-Mobile creates a list of leads of well-qualified potential customers and it knows exactly how to reach them.\n\n\n\nWhen signing up for the beta, the consumer serves up their phone number and agrees to receive offers \u2013 ostensibly via email and text, said 556 Ventures principal analyst Bill Ho.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a good switcher lead generation since T-Mobile\u2019s beta period is free,\u201d Ho told Fierce. \u201cWith their phone number, T-Mobile knows which carrier the prospective customer is on. Beyond the beta period and if non-T-Mobile customers stay on this service, these people are growth subscribers providing recurring revenue.\u201d\n\nName your price\n\nT-Mobile is also finding out how much consumers are willing to pay for a service they can essentially get for free via Apple\u2019s Emergency SOS text service powered by Globalstar. Granted, T-Mobile's service eventually will be more robust, but until now, carriers haven't typically charged for a D2D service.\n\n\n\nT-Mobile will provide T-Mobile Starlink service for no extra cost on its Go5G Next plans, which start at $85/month for one line. T-Mobile customers on other plans can add the service for $15/month per line (or $10 per line for beta-stage adoptees). Verizon and AT&T customers can get T-Mobile Starlink text messaging for free until July, then pay $20/month per line.\n\n\n\nEntner\u2019s firm conducted a survey of more than 6,000 respondents and found that roughly one-third say they\u2019re willing to pay for a satellite D2D service, although he cautions there can be a wide gap between what people say they would do versus what they actually end up doing. More than one in five consumers who want satellite-based communication said they would be willing to switch providers for it.\n\n\n\nWhat they want most from a D2D service is access to text messaging, followed by connecting to the internet and voice calls \u2013 primarily when doing outdoor activities like hiking or to simply getting access (when outside, with a direct line of sight to the sky) in dead zones that aren\u2019t covered by terrestrial networks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey want to call. They want to text. They want to use this for streaming,\u201d Entner said.\n\nThe eventual promise of satellite is that it can do everything terrestrial cellular service can. But that\u2019s where the risk comes in.\n\nIf people think they can do everything \u2013 like send multimedia messages with photos and video \u2013 and they can\u2019t, they\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed. The TV commercial that ran during the Super Bowl gave the impression these things could be done, but they\u2019re in the future \u2013 T-Mobile\u2019s D2D service starts with just texting. Picture messaging, data and voice calls are \u201ccoming later,\u201d according to T-Mobile.\n\n\n\nIf consumers expect the moon and they\u2019re only getting a slice, they may very well remember when it comes time to renew service or recommend a carrier. As mobile carriers know all too well, perceptions stick for a long time.\n\nFor example, \u201cVerizon gets positive scores for network and negative ones for price when we know that the difference between them and other networks isn\u2019t as big as it used to be and that they have become a lot more affordable,\u201d Entner said.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cT-Mobile continues to get dinged for network and it got a lot better. They get a positive halo for price, and they have now become the most expensive on one and two lines,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of these things linger.\u201d\n\nThe not-so-flattering coverage gaps\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s already getting some flack from customers who feel they\u2019re getting ripped off.\n\n\n\n\u201cT-Mo is charging even its own customers at least $10 per month after July. That basically means T-Mobile is charging extra because it has huge coverage gaps despite licensing its spectrum exclusively and nationwide,\u201d said Michael Calabrese, director of the Wireless Future program at the consumer advocacy group Open Technology Institute at New America.\n\n\u201cPerhaps T-Mobile\u2019s next step will be to decommission half of their cell towers in rural areas, so that they can make even more money charging consumers extra for texting in areas where they haven\u2019t deployed or have weak signals,\u201d Calabrese told Fierce. \u201cThey also don\u2019t seem to disclose that Apple is offering the same two-way texting service free indefinitely on its latest iPhone.\"\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s no denying that T-Mobile\u2019s time-to-market advantage is huge. Verizon currently offers a free but limited-in-scope satellite messaging service via its partnership with Skylo, and that\u2019s for select Android devices. Both Verizon and AT&T are investors in AST SpaceMobile, which has launched five satellites so far and last month received Special Temporary Authority (STA) to test services over the United States. It\u2019s still in the early stages.\n\nBy comparison, the T-Mobile Starlink service is powered by more than 450 satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), with more being added with every successful Starlink launch, according to a T-Mobile spokesperson.\n\n\n\nIf excitement grows in the T-Mobile user base, early adopters, at a minimum, will feed into its average revenue per unit (ARPU)/average revenue per account (ARPA) metrics with their $10/monthly fees, Ho noted. These kinds of fees are a welcome addition for the carriers struggling to reap returns on their 5G investments.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see if AT&T and Verizon launch with similar pricing,\u201d Chaplin concluded. \u201cWe suspect they will.\u201d",

This included three new phone models -- the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, all of which are available for purchase now.\n\nAlso: I replaced my iPhone 16 Pro with the Galaxy S25 Ultra - and there's a clear winner\n\nThankfully, you won't have to spend a pretty penny to get your hands on the latest Galaxy S25 models, with promotional offers and prices available from major mobile carriers -- including T-Mobile. Plus, we're still seeing several offers on all three of the new Galaxy S25 smartphones, even a few weeks after their initial launch.\n\nSo what are the best T-Mobile offers on the new Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup? Our pick is snagging the Galaxy S25+ for free (or receive up to $1,000 off any phone in the series) when trading in any eligible device in any condition on T-Mobile's Go5G Next plan. This limited-time offer means you'll get a new Galaxy phone no matter what condition your eligible device trade-in is in. As a person who never turns in their phone in \"good\" condition -- that's a good deal.\n\nPlus, new and existing customers can also take advantage of similar offers for a limited time, including getting the Galaxy S25+ for free (or up to $1,000 off on any phone in the series) when trading in any eligible device in working condition on T-Mobile's Go5G Plus plan.\n\nIf you're eyeing the base model Galaxy S25 -- don't fret. You can also get one for free (or up to $800 off any phone in the series) if you add a line on a Go5G Plus/Next plan or if you trade in an eligible device in working condition and add a line on a Go5G plan (or most other plans).\n\nAlso: I've used every Samsung Galaxy S25 model - and the one I love most isn't the Ultra\n\nThe majority of customers can score up to $500 off any phone in the Galaxy S25 series when trading in an eligible device in working condition on Go5G or most plans, too. Keep in mind that all of these offers are available via 24 monthly bill credits (plus tax).\n\nBusiness customers can also swipe up lingering Galaxy S25 offers, like grabbing the Samsung Galaxy S25 for free with a trade in of any eligible device in any condition on T-Mobiles Business Unlimited Advanced Plan when purchased online.\n\nCurious what the newest Galaxy S25 series breaks down to a month?

Don't get me wrong, I go into the woods so I don't have to communicate with the outside world. It's a nice reprieve for my headspace.\n\nBut getting into trouble, either breaking a bone, falling off a dirt bike, popping a tire, or exploding a snowmobile, takes all the fun out of having zero reception. That's why I carry my Garmin inReach whenever I leave the house for some far-flung adventure in the woods.\n\nYet, while Garmin's had a stranglehold on the backcountry communications industry for years, more and more upstarts and big players are entering the satellite communications game. You've got folks like Zoleo and Spot, as well as Apple launching its own satellite communications through its newer iPhones. And now, Garmin has another competitor thanks to the new joint venture of T-Mobile and Elon Musk's Starlink satellite company.\n\nThe woods are about to have service and I'm not sure how I feel about it.\n\nThe partnership, called T-Mobile Starlink, will start with a public Beta test, as in you can opt into the test to play around and essentially debug the system before it widely goes live. When that day arrives, however, T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T customers will all have access to the new system, meaning it won't strictly be for T-Mobile customers.\n\nAccording to T-Mobile, the new system will cover \"more than 500,000 square miles\" of country that previously didn't have any cell service, i.e. the woods, national parks, forest service land, and Bureau of Land Management acreage. All the places we as powersports lovers love to go.\n\n\"T-Mobile Starlink is the first and only space-based mobile network in the US that automatically connects to your phone so you can be connected even where no cellular network reaches,\" says Mike Sievert, T-Mobile's President and CEO, adding, \"It\u2019s a massive technical achievement and an absolute game changer for ALL wireless users. We\u2019re still in the early days \u2014 I don\u2019t want to overhype the experience during a beta test \u2014 but we\u2019re officially putting \u2018no bars\u2019 on notice. Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, T-Mobile Starlink will automatically connect to the nearest satellite when service is no longer available, which is different than Apple's service where you have to manually connect to one, or switch on your Garmin or Zoleo. So long as you have you phone in your pocket and it's on, it'll do it for you, meaning no drop in service once service is dropped. Likewise, T-Mobile Starlink will broadcast Wireless Emergency Alerts nationwide to every compatible device, no matter the service or reception, i.e. during disasters like hurricanes or wildfires.\n\nT-Mobile says that the beta will be free from now until July, which at that point will begin to be including at no extra cost to those on the company's Go5G Next plan, Go5G Business Next, and first responder T-Priority plans. All customers, however, will then be able to add the service for an extre $15 a month per line. And, to be honest, none of that sounds all that bad. So long as it works.\n\nWhere I see an issue, however, is with the hardware.\n\nPhoto by: Garmin\n\nSo I'm hard on device and gear. I often joke I'm an engineer's edge-case scenario, i.e. the type of person that'd use their knife as a crowbar or my phone as a hammer. I don't\u2014at least not lately\u2014but it's illustrative of the fact I want my gear to be about as tough as can possibly be. And through all my years exploring the woods, driving UTVs and ATVs, riding dirt bikes, motorcycles, and snowmobiles, and out hiking around looking for big game, well, I've broken my fair share of phones. In fact, I just replaced my iPhone two weeks ago because I broke the back case.\n\nWhat I mean by this little sidequest is that T-Mobile Starlink still relies on a person's phone and, at present, phones aren't designed to take a hit and keep working. They're designed to shatter, break, and be replaced because that's the world we live in. Conspicuous consumption, FTW! For me, though, I still think something like a Garmin inReach is the way to go if you're banking your continued health and safety on a communication device. I'll have my phone, sure, but again, phones break.\n\nAnd after running my new inReach over with my truck, ATV, and Can-Am Maverick, along with throwing it into the mud, dirt, and a alpine stream, as well as falling down a few hills, I know my Garmin inReach will work.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

But here\u2019s where things get even more interesting \u2013 AT&T and Verizon customers can get in on the action too, paying $20 per month per line to tap into T-Mobile\u2019s cellular Starlink service.\n\nNo extra equipment is needed; no fancy satellite phone, no clunky external hardware \u2013 just a compatible smartphone. If a phone loses connection to a cell tower, it will automatically switch to Starlink\u2019s satellite signal, keeping users connected by text even in the middle of nowhere. No manual toggling, no extra steps \u2013 just coverage.\n\nREAD NEXT Starlink strengthens in Europe as satellite investments pay off\n\nHow it works: Satellite connectivity without the hassle\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Starlink-powered service turns any compatible smartphone into a satellite phone, albeit one with limited functinality. Phones will need a compatible eSIM to get coverage in areas where traditional cell towers don\u2019t reach. Most smartphones from the last four years \u2013 including the iPhone 14 and later, Samsung Galaxy S21 and later, and Pixel models \u2013 will work with the service. T-Mobile is to publish a full list of supported devices, and that list will keep expanding as more models are certified.\n\nAccording to Clint Patterson, T-Mobile\u2019s SVP of Marketing, users will simply add a second eSIM to their phones, allowing them to receive satellite-based SMS messages when they\u2019re outside traditional coverage areas; no special setup \u2013 just texting as usual, even in places where a regular network would leave users stranded.\n\nT-Mobile Starlink will also support wireless emergency alerts (WEAs) so people in remote locations, like hikers or those caught in extreme weather events, will still receive important, potentially life-saving messages. The satellite-based WEA service ensures that emergency alerts reach users even beyond standard cellular coverage, as long as they are in range of a T-Mobile Starlink satellite.\n\nA free beta test before the official launch\n\nBefore its official launch in July, T-Mobile is gradually rolling out a beta programme. Initially, select T-Mobile customers with newer iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, and Pixel devices were invited to take part, but the company is now opening the beta to anyone on any wireless carrier \u2013 including AT&T and Verizon customers. Beta testers will be enrolled over time to help T-Mobile refine the service\u2019s details and operations.\n\nFor now, satellite connectivity is limited to SMS-based messaging, but voice calls and data support are on the roadmap \u2013 pending regulatory approvals.\n\nPricing: Early adopters to get a discount\n\nWhen the service officially launches in July, T-Mobile\u2019s business customers, first responders, and select premium plan holders will also get Starlink access at no additional cost.\n\nFor everyone else, the pricing will be:\n\nT-Mobile customers: $15/month per line (free on Go5G Next)\n\nAT&T and Verizon customers: $20/month per line\n\nThe price might be steep for people who rarely venture into dead zones, but T-Mobile is sweetening the deal for early adopters: Anyone who signs up before the end of February gets a $10/month per line discount, bringing the price down by a third.\n\nT-Mobile takes on AT&T and Verizon in the satellite race\n\nWhile AT&T and Verizon are working on their own satellite solutions through AST SpaceMobile and Skylo, neither service is yet ready for mass-market consumers. T-Mobile and SpaceX have 400 satellites beaming coverage to unmodified smartphones \u2013 and they\u2019re launching more space hardware to boost signal quality.\n\nLast year, SpaceX received FCC approval to operate T-Mobile\u2019s cellular Starlink service, allowing it to use T-Mobile\u2019s 1900MHz spectrum to offer connectivity to supported devices. Major smartphone brands have received FCC certification to work with Starlink\u2019s network, so phones running on other carriers\u2019 services can connect to the satellites.\n\nT-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert calls this a game changer for mobile coverage. \u201cT-Mobile Starlink is the first and only space-based mobile network in the US that automatically connects to your phone so you can be connected even where no cellular network reaches,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early days \u2013 I don\u2019t want to overhype the experience during a beta test \u2013 but we\u2019re officially putting \u2018no bars\u2019 on notice. Dead zones, your days are numbered.\u201d\n\nThe future of satellite connectivity\n\nRight now, the service is focused on text messaging, but T-Mobile and SpaceX aim to bring voice calls and data coverage to satellite-connected smartphones.\n\nFor now, though, the beta programme is live, and anyone an the US can sign up.\n\nLooking to revamp your digital transformation strategy?\n\nLearn more about Digital Transformation Week taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

            "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EDO, the TV outcomes company, today released its annual ranking of all national Super Bowl LIX ads, awarding brands like T-Mobile, RAM, and Liquid Death with the most engaging spots of the night. For a decade, EDO has scored every Super Bowl ad from pre-kick to post-game based on how effective each spot is at driving consumer behaviors \u2014 such as website visits and brand searches \u2014 immediately after the airing.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Super Bowl advertisers were more diverse than in years past, proving that relevance, authenticity, and differentiation continue to be the way to win on advertising\u2019s biggest stage,\u201d said Kevin Krim, President & CEO of EDO. \u201cWith a wide range of brand categories represented in our top 10, the results show that the investment was well worth it for products that aligned with consumer priorities. Beyond game-day impact, we will continue to see the lasting halo effect of Super Bowl ads, driving sustained engagement and business outcomes well past the final whistle.\u201d\n\nMOST ENGAGING SUPER BOWL LIX ADS\n\nAccording to EDO\u2019s predictive TV outcomes data, the top 10 Super Bowl ads that drove the greatest consumer engagement include:\n\n\"Consumer priorities may be evolving, but audiences continue to gravitate toward practicality and real-world utility over novelty,\" said Laura Grover, SVP, Head of Client Solutions, EDO. \"This year's Super Bowl made that clear\u2014practical tech outperformed generative AI, health-conscious messaging resonated more than ever, and in auto, a single brand dominated by seizing the lane left open by competitors. These trends reinforce that brands can win in the Big Game when they align with real consumer value while taking bold, strategic positions. The Super Bowl isn't just a branding exercise\u2014it's one of the most powerful advertising moments of the year to move the needle on business performance.\"\n\nBIG GAME TRENDS\n\nSuper Bowl LIX may have been a blowout, but brands kept up the entertainment during ad breaks. Whether they were introducing game-changing new technologies, tugging at our heartstrings with inspiring stories, or offering new ways to stay healthy, advertisers left it all on the field to make an impact on our industry\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nKey ad trends from this year\u2019s Big Game lineup include:\n\nViewers Choose Practical Tech Over GenAI: Whether they were advertising buzzy new products (like Google Pixel, OpenAI, Salesforce) or merely theorizing about them (Coca-Cola), ads featuring generative AI were less effective than the average Super Bowl ad at delivering consumer engagement. Instead, viewers were captivated by the very tangible offer of free, satellite-powered wireless service powered by Starlink and T-Mobile \u2014 an exciting partnership that drove greater engagement than any other Super Bowl LIX ad and 1,163% as much impact as the average spot. Health-Curious Ads Drive Massive Engagement: Throughout the night, consumers demonstrated a keen intent to be healthier, whether that meant losing weight with the new GLP-1 drugs offered by Hims & Hers or enjoying low-calorie drink choices from the likes of Poppi and Cirkul. Flavored sparkling and still water brand Liquid Death was the most impactful of the group, which was 704% more effective than the average Super Bowl LIX ad. Stellantis Claims Auto Spotlight After Rivals Back Out: Ads from auto brands are usually a Super Bowl staple, but they were conspicuously absent this year. With the spotlight all to themselves, Stellantis-owned brands Jeep and RAM triumphed. Both placed ads in our top 10 for TV outcomes, with RAM\u2019s Glen Powell-as-Goldilocks spot generating 748% more engagement than the average Super Bowl ad and Jeep\u2019s Harrison Ford-led ode to freedom outperforming the benchmark by 537%. Women\u2019s Empowerment Inspires Consumers to Act: A number of ads won the Big Game by celebrating women\u2019s empowerment, and consumers were responsive. Nike returned to the Super Bowl for the first time in 27 years with a who\u2019s who of women athletes and a voice-over from recent Grammy winner Doechii. Lay\u2019s told an inspiring story of a young girl farming potatoes for its chips. And Novartis shed light on the need for greater awareness of breast cancer. All three outperformed the average Super Bowl advertiser, led by Lay\u2019s ad, which was 33% more effective than the benchmark.\n\nEDO\u2019s complete performance ranking of Super Bowl LIX ads can be found at EDO.com/SuperBowl. Learn how Super Bowl advertisers across categories stacked up against their competitors with EDO\u2019s Share of Engagement charts across Alcohol, CPG Food, Pharma, Restaurants, and 10+ other brand categories.\n\nHow we rank the ads\n\nFor the 10th consecutive year, EDO has scored every Big Game ad based on incremental online engagement for an advertised brand or product immediately following an individual ad\u2019s airing.

            "content": "T-Mobile went big promoting its direct-to-cell partnership with SpaceX\u2019s Starlink constellation in a Super Bowl ad on Sunday night. The mobile network operator revealed details about the Starlink service, including the pricing structure and compatibility for U.S. customers with Verizon and AT&T service and even iPhones.\n\nT-Mobile and SpaceX have been working together since 2022 to enable everyday cell phones to send messages outside of cellular network coverage via satellite. SpaceX has launched more than 300 specially configured Starlink satellites that make this type of connectivity possible. The service is currently in a free beta program, and full service is set to launch in July.\n\nIn the Super Bowl ad, T-Mobile put out an invitation for customers on any wireless carrier to join the free beta program. This is possible through digital sim cards, called eSIMs, T-Mobile said in a statement to Via Satellite.\n\n\u201cFor a non T-Mobile customer to get T-Mobile Starlink service, they just need an unlocked phone with an eSIM. Because an eSIM is digital, it\u2019s now possible for a wireless user to switch between two different wireless provider services on the same phone,\u201d T-Mobile explained.\n\nWhen the Starlink full service is operational, it will be included in the cost of T-Mobile\u2019s premium plan Go5G Next, and will be available as an add-on for other plans for $15 per month. There\u2019s currently an early adopter discount to lower the price to $10 per month. For non-T-Mobile subscribers, it will cost $20 per month.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s now out in the open that iPhones are included in the beta program. In late January, Bloomberg first reported that Apple had been working with SpaceX and T-Mobile to have support for iPhones with the service.\n\nT-Mobile now lists the iPhone 14 and later models among the list of approved devices for the Starlink service. It also includes the Google Pixel 9, Motorola 2024, Samsung Galaxy models, and REVVL 7.\n\nApple was the first to make direct-to-device service available widespread, through its work with Globalstar that debuted with the iPhone 14, but until now it was a question whether iPhone users with T-Mobile service would have access to the Starlink connectivity as well.\n\nThe T-Mobile beta program begins with just text messaging support, but the company plans to expand service to picture messaging, data services, and voice calling in the future.\n\nWireless carriers are amping up their promotion of direct-to-device capabilities. Verizon aired an ad during the Grammys that featured astronaut Buzz Aldrin touting its capabilities.",

            "content": "T-Mobile just did a huge favor for Globalstar and AST stocks.\n\nIf you caught last night's football game, perhaps you noticed the multiple advertisements run by T-Mobile US (TMUS -1.20%) touting the company's offer to let anyone in the U.S. -- not just its own customers -- participate in its new direct-to-cell (DTC) collaboration with SpaceX's Starlink service.\n\nWell, investors noticed the commercials as well. And thanks to them, T-Mobile stock is up 3% through 10:50 a.m. ET in Nasdaq trading on Monday. What's truly curious, though, is that at the same time as T-Mobile stock is inching higher, shares of a pair of satellite communications company stocks, AST SpaceMobile (ASTS 7.77%) and Globalstar (GSAT -0.42%), are doing much, much better.\n\nIn fact, AST's gain today is an astounding 23%, and Globalstar stock is up a solid 11.3%, both multiples of the gain that T-Mobile stock is enjoying.\n\nT-Mobile's cosmic commercial\n\nAs the one-minute commercial unfolded, a voiceover pointed out how, across the U.S., some 500,000 square miles of terrain are \"unreachable by cellphone.\" To solve this problem, T-Mobile says it has partnered with Starlink to launch \"hundreds\" of DTC satellites, thus creating -- and this is key -- \"the only space network that automatically connects to the phone you already have.\"\n\nIs the claim accurate? It depends on how you read it.\n\nIn a press release this morning, T-Mobile confirmed that beta service with Starlink DTC satellite cellphone service has already begun. And to familiarize customers with the concept of using off-the-shelf cellphones (i.e., not satellite phones) to call other off-the-shelf cellphones without the use of cellphone towers, T-Mobile is allowing anyone with a cellphone in the U.S. sign up for the service for free through July 2025, whether or not they're customers of T-Mobile.\n\nAfter that, service will be restricted to T-Mobile customers, and included in the cost of the company's \"Go5G Next\" and similar plans (and available as an add-on to customers of other T-Mobile plans).\n\nWhat this means for T-Mobile -- and for everybody else\n\nStill, you might imagine that claim would upset shareholders of Globalstar and AST SpaceMobile, which are also planning to offer their own DTC services to their own partners' customers. Globalstar is partnered with Apple after all, and AST is paired with AT&T and Verizon -- none of which three stocks is moving very much at all today.\n\nIn contrast, stocks of the providers of DTC services, Globalstar and AST, are moving quite a lot.\n\nWhy is that? Well, contrary to what you might think after reading T-Mobile's press release, Globalstar does already offer emergency text service to owners of Apple smartphones. It's just perhaps not a \"space network\" as T-Mobile is defining it, if you need to own a specific brand of cellphone to access it. And AST is only awaiting the go-ahead from the Federal Communications Service before AT&T and Verizon will be able to run their own commercials touting beta service for DTC calls through their own networks.\n\nIn other words, from one perspective, T-Mobile's ad may look like an attempt to steal customers away from AT&T and Verizon by offering a service that they don't have (yet). And over the next six months, I think that may in fact be what happens. Looked at another way, though, T-Mobile's ad is sort of free advertising for Globalstar and AST, promoting services that they offer too, or are about to start offering soon.\n\nSo while not clear and distinct positives for these other space stocks, investors seem to agree that this development is positive enough to make both Globalstar and AST stocks more valuable today, too.",

Services like WhatsApp, some mapping and trail apps, and the ability to send photos could be ready when the beta testing ends in July, T-Mobile\u2019s head of marketing told The Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that point, T-Mobile users will have to pay $15 per month for the Starlink service, although that fee will drop to $10 per month if they participate in the beta test during February. Customers paying for the company\u2019s pricey Go5G Next plan will get the service for free.

Motorola\u2019s (LNVGY) 2024 and newer models are also compatible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpaceX has a number of partners in other nations, such as KDDI in Japan and Telstra in Australia, and worked with AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) to launch nationwide coverage in New Zealand in late December. In October, Kyivstar said it would work with Starlink to provide \u201cuninterrupted\u201d service in Ukraine.\n\nVerizon and AT&T are also working with AST SpaceMobile to launch rival services. On Jan. 30, AST SpaceMobile said the FCC had approved it to begin testing its service.",

And then the second eSIM can connect whenever the user loses coverage.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert stated the service is a \u201cmassive technical achievement and absolute game changer for all wireless users\u201d.\n\nThe test covers 500,000 square miles across the US in remote or rural areas which lack coverage. It offers SMS, with data, voice and picture messaging to follow.\n\nMessages are sent and received the same way as a traditional network.\n\nT-Mobile noted the service works on most smartphones from the past four years and is \u201cnot limited to a few smartphones or operating systems\u201d.\n\nIt explained the beta service is free until July, at which point it will be included at no additional cost for subscribers of its Go5G Next plan, or $15 per month for each line for customers without premium plans.\n\nBusiness customers on the Go 5G Business Next plan will also get the service for free, as will first responder agencies on T-Priority subscriptions.\n\nAT&T and Verizon users will pay $20 per month, according to T-Mobile\u2019s representative.\n\nT-Mobile and SpaceX will also enable Wireless Emergency Alerts across the US when users come within range and have a compatible device.\n\nSimilar to a D2D SOS messaging service by Skylo Technologies and Verizon launched on Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 smartphones, the T-Mobile offering automatically connects to a satellite when a user is out of range of a cell tower.\n\nSpace.com reports Starlink has about 7,000 birds in orbit.\n\nWhile the beta test has been underway for several weeks, the companies made a splashy announcement in a 60-second advert during the National Football League\u2019s Super Bowl.\n\nCNBC reported on 7 February such adverts can cost up to $8 million.\n\nT-Mobile and SpaceX announced the service in August 2022, but delays followed as the Federal Communications Commission needed to grant Starlink conditional approval.\n\nCompetition\n\nTMF Associates analyst Tim Farrar told MWL the test with T-Mobile \u201ccontinues SpaceX\u2019s aggressive moves to undermine the business case for competing satellite projects\u201d.\n\nHe noted Elon Musk-owned SpaceX may be seeking to \u201cfront run whatever Apple has planned for its new D2D constellation\u201d.\n\nMusk revealed in 2024 Starlink had been committed exclusively to T-Mobile in the US for a year, after which the D2D service would be opened to other operators in the country.\n\nApple teamed with T-Mobile US and SpaceX to add support for Starlink\u2019s D2D offering on its iPhones after a recent iOS software update.",

            "content": "Late last year, T-Mobile said it was getting ready to start beta testing SpaceX's Starlink service. It appears the program is ready for takeoff, with the carrier expected to announce during the Super Bowl that it's begun letting users access satellite service.\n\nAs part of the beta, people in the program will be able to send SMS text messages when they're outdoors, even in areas where they don't normally get T-Mobile's terrestrial coverage. The beta service will be free and open to all T-Mobile postpaid users until July, with the carrier also making it available for free during this time to AT&T and Verizon customers.\n\nIn July, the carrier plans to begin charging for the service. It'll be included as part of T-Mobile's priciest Go5G Next plan and available as an add-on to its other plans for $15 per month, per line. T-Mobile users signing up for the service this month will be able to lock in a discounted rate of $10 per month, per line as part of an \"early adopter\" deal.\n\nAT&T and Verizon users will be able to continue using the service for $20 per month, per line. Those users won't need to switch to T-Mobile to add Starlink service but will need an unlocked compatible device that supports eSIMs.\n\nT-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon users interested in signing up for the beta can do so at T-Mobile's website, with the carrier planning to add users to the new service on a first come, first served rolling basis. As it goes through the list, it'll reach back out with instructions when users who sign up for the beta are able to join.\n\nThe carrier wasn't planning on offering satellite coverage to AT&T and Verizon users but says it was moved to do so after seeing Verizon's latest ad that features astronaut Buzz Aldrin touting satellite texting on its network. The ad has already racked up over 8 million views on YouTube.\n\nClint Patterson, senior vice president of marketing at T-Mobile, tells CNET that when it came to supporting rival carriers \"candidly, this was not part of our original plan for the Super Bowl.\"\n\n\"When we saw Verizon's latest ad, advertising something that you can't do on Verizon's network, we felt like we needed to act.\"\n\nT-Mobile says that it and Starlink have more than 450 satellites currently in orbit that \"provide coverage to 500,000 square miles of terrain inaccessible by terrestrial networks.\"\n\nPatterson said T-Mobile has already added \"tens of thousands\" of users into the beta.\n\nThe carrier notes it's been working with SpaceX and device manufacturers on optimizing smartphones to be able to connect to the new service, with the goal being that as long as you have a view of the sky, you should be able to stay connected.\n\nT-Mobile says it's been working with manufacturers to \"ensure the vast majority of T-Mobile phones released in the last four years will work with T-Mobile Starlink,\" including the iPhone 14 and Galaxy S21.\n\nCoverage in emergencies\n\nT-Mobile and SpaceX first announced their partnership back in 2022 and have more recently used the technology to keep people informed and connected during natural disasters. The two companies previously turned on the service in response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene last year and this month enabled it for people dealing with the Los Angeles fires.\n\nIn emergency situations, the company may make the service available to all, regardless of plan, according to Mike Katz, president of marketing, strategy and products at T-Mobile. \"In times of emergency, you kind of have to put down your competitive guards and realize that there's things more important ... and that people that are affected by these tragedies need help,\" he said. \"So that will always be our guiding principle on those things.\"\n\nAs part of its deployment in response to the Los Angeles fires, the carrier only opened up the Starlink support to users with most Android phones and older iPhone models prior to the iPhone 14 series. Those with an iPhone 14 or newer phone were instead pushed to use Apple's satellite service, which the iPhone maker offers with Globalstar.\n\nWith the beta and full launch, T-Mobile will support more-recent devices across both Android and iOS. The carrier isn't providing a list of compatible devices, but Katz notes that the phones available for the beta \"will be the fewest number of eligible devices, and literally, like probably weekly, it will expand.\"\n\n\"All newer devices at some point are going to be included in it,\" Katz said, adding that the carrier will be notifying customers when their phone is compatible for the beta.\n\nT-Mobile said that as part of the opening of this new beta service, it'll also be able to use the Starlink constellation to be able to broadcast Wireless Emergency Alerts from government and local officials nationwide to anyone, regardless of whether they have T-Mobile or a different provider.\n\nStarting with texting, data coming this year\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nThough T-Mobile and SpaceX's initial Starlink service will focus on texting, the plan is to add support for voice and data, something that could help the carrier's offering stand out from what's bundled in from device makers.\n\nPatterson said that though the carrier is starting with SMS texting in the beta, it plans to offer data services over satellite \"later this year\" and voice services, like calling, in the future.\n\nApple's satellite solution allows for sending messages to emergency services and, with iOS 18, regular iMessages over satellite. Google recently introduced an emergency satellite messaging option in partnership with provider Skylo for its Pixel 9 series of phones; it's just for emergency messages.\n\nApple and Google currently don't charge for their satellite messaging services, though both have hinted they may add a fee for the feature down the line.\n\nKatz said that as T-Mobile works through the beta and toward a commercial launch, phones will know how to handle conflicts between differing satellite services, with the first option being the carrier's service rather than one from a manufacturer. \"The phones are all designed to search for the carrier network first and then go to the other one,\" he said. \"And this is an extension of the carrier network.\"",

Now in public beta, this breakthrough service, developed in partnership with Starlink, uses straight-out-of-a-sci-fi-movie satellite and mobile communications technology to help keep people connected \u2014 even you, Verizon and AT&T customers \u2014 in the more than 500,000 square miles of the country unreached by any carrier\u2019s earth-bound cell towers. That\u2019s nearly the size of two Texases!\n\nT-Mobile Starlink Beta Takes Off. T-Mobile Starlink is solving wireless\u2019 biggest pain point \u2014 mobile dead zones. T-Mobile Starlink is the first and only space-based mobile network in the U.S. that automatically connects to your phone in areas no cellular network reaches. The beta is now open for absolutely everyone \u2014 yes, even Verizon and AT&T customers \u2014 to register for free access until July. (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nT-Mobile Starlink uses specially configured satellites with Direct-to-Cell capabilities orbiting the Earth 200+ miles up in space and traveling at over 17,000 miles per hour to deliver cell phone signals \u2014 text messages for now with picture messages, data and voice calls coming later \u2014 to and from locations traditional cell towers can\u2019t reach (aka mobile dead zones).\n\n\u201cT-Mobile Starlink is the first and only space-based mobile network in the US that automatically connects to your phone so you can be connected even where no cellular network reaches. It\u2019s a massive technical achievement and an absolute game changer for ALL wireless users,\u201d said Mike Sievert, President and CEO, T-Mobile. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early days \u2014 I don\u2019t want to overhype the experience during a beta test \u2014 but we\u2019re officially putting \u2018no bars\u2019 on notice. Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.\u201d\n\nIf you can see the sky, you\u2019re connected\n\nThe beauty of the service is its simplicity: users don\u2019t need to do anything out of the ordinary. When a user\u2019s cell phone gets out of range of a cell tower, the phone automatically connects to the T-Mobile Starlink network. No need to manually connect. Messages are sent and received just as they are today on a traditional network, even group texts and reactions. And it works on most smartphones from the last four years. It\u2019s not limited to a few smartphones or operating systems.\n\nAnd to double down on keeping all people connected, T-Mobile Starlink also broadcasts Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) nationwide to anyone in range of the signal and with a compatible device.\n\nSatellite-based WEA service helps ensure everyone \u2014 even outside of terrestrial coverage, as long as they are in range of a T-Mobile Starlink satellite \u2014 can receive critical, potentially life-saving messages directly to their phone. Whether in remote areas like hiking trails or in areas impacted by severe weather or by natural disasters, more people now have access to the WEA broadcast when they need it most.\n\nThe beta is free until July at which point T-Mobile Starlink will be included at no extra cost on Go5G Next (including variations like Go5G Next 55+), T-Mobile\u2019s best plan. Business customers will also get T-Mobile Starlink at no extra cost on Go5G Business Next, first responder agencies on T-Priority plans and other select premium rate plans. T-Mobile customers on any other plan can add the service for $15 /month per line.\n\nThrough February, T-Mobile customers who have registered for the beta can secure a $10 /month per line Early Adopter Discount, 33% off the full price.\n\nAT&T and Verizon customers hate dead zones, too\n\nWhen your service is amazing and different, you want as many people to try it as possible. T-Mobile is giving AT&T and Verizon customers the opportunity to try out T-Mobile Starlink satellite service on their existing phones. With T-Mobile Starlink, every compatible smartphone can turn into a satellite phone \u2014 no fancy equipment needed. During the beta period, Verizon and AT&T customers can experience T-Mobile Starlink text messaging for free, and once the service launches in July, it will be available for $20 /month per line.\n\nT-Mobile Starlink Beta Registration\n\nThe beta phase gives T-Mobile the means to test the service gradually before launching in July to the hundreds of millions of wireless users who can benefit from our vision of nearly ubiquitous coverage.\n\nEveryone on any carrier \u2014 including businesses and first responders \u2014 can sign up for the beta. Users will be enrolled on an ongoing basis to help test the system and provide feedback before launching in July.\n\nMore details and consumer registration can be found here.\n\nBusinesses and first responder agencies can register here.\n\nA Vision for Universal Coverage\n\nAs T-Mobile and Starlink continue to work towards eliminating mobile deadzones, the companies welcome wireless providers from around the world to join their growing alliance, which aims to provide reciprocal roaming for all participating carriers. So far, KDDI ( Japan ), Telstra ( Australia ), Optus ( Australia ), One NZ ( New Zealand ), Salt ( Switzerland ), Entel ( Chile & Peru ), Rogers ( Canada ) and Kyivstar ( Ukraine ) are among the providers that have signed on to join the cause and launch satellite-to-mobile technology.

            "content": "T-Mobile just dialed back its connection to celebrities in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe telecommunications giant ran a 60-second commercial in the first quarter during Fox\u2019s broadcast of Super Bowl LIX that was bereft of the marketer\u2019s usual touches. Rather than tap actor Bradley Cooper and his mother, the song-and-dance antics of Zach Braff and Donad Faison, or cameos from John Travolta, Dolly Parton or Jason Momoa, as it has for the past two years, T-Mobile talked up technology.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s new offering, now rolling out to the public, relies on a partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to offer satellite connections for so-called \u201cdead zones\u201d across the U.S. The company says the service makes it possible to get text messages now, with pictures, data and voice calls soon to come \u2014 even if traditional cell reception is not available in a specific area. T-Mobile says in the commercial that it will allow Verizon and AT&T customers to use the service for free for now without changing carriers.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cAnybody that\u2019s ever had a cell phone has experienced this problem, and this solution solves it,\u201d says Mike Katz, president of marketing, strategy, and products at T-Mobile, during a recent interview. As such, he says, this year \u201cwe felt like the service should be the star\u201d rather than a celebrity or group of famous faces.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s decision to highlight the emerging technology is likely to set off a new wave of competition within its sector. Both AT&T and Verizon have pursued similar capabilities, with Verizon re-introducing its long-absent \u201cTest Man\u201d character in a commercial that ran during CBS\u2019 telecast of the Grammys a week ago. In that spot, astronaut Buzz Aldrin sets out to conquer dead zones across the globe, sending texts to the character, played by Paul Marcarelli, who is getting messages in space. T-Mobile has in recent months quarreled with both competitors over claims they have made in ads and promotional copy about their ability to offer the technology.\n\n\u201cWe actually saw that Verizon commercial and felt bad. A reasonable consumer would see that commercial and expect they could go to Verizon\u2019s web site and sign up for it. You can\u2019t,\u201d says Katz, who adds: \u201cThe only service that exists from an American wireless company is the one that T-Mobile is announcing on the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s good reason all three companies are pursuing the technology. The mobile satellite services market is projected to total $7.46 billion in 2030, according to Mordor Intelligence, a market-research firm, compared with $5.29 billion in 2025.\n\nT-Mobile is likely to tap celebrities in other commercials. In a separate campaign that has been running for several weeks, Snoop Dogg, Patrick Mahomes and influencer Kai Cenat pitch the idea of trading in old iPhones for a new iPhone 16 Pro and discounts on monthly wireless bills.\n\nThe company sees such personalities as partners, says Katz. \u201cWe don\u2019t use an agency at all. I work with a film production company that mostly makes feature films that does all of our ads. All of the people that are in our spots are friends of T-Mobile,\u201d says Katz, referring to Panay Films. \u201cThese guys are close partners with us. and don\u2019t just show up and read scripts on the day that we shoot. They actually help us create the concepts.\u201d\n\nThe alliance with Starlink, which provides broadband to rural and remote areas all around the globe, may surprise audiences. The company is a division of Musk\u2019s SpaceX, and Musk has managed to insert himself into President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to narrow the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cIf you want to solve this problem\u201d of getting connectivity to remote areas, says Katz, \u201cit requires a very large constellation of satellites, and Starlink is the only one in the world that can deliver on that.\u201d He adds that Starlink \u201chad more launches last year than the rest of the world combined.\u201d\n\nNo doubt, T-Mobile will apply all the usual tests of advertising effectiveness to its new service that it does to its usual array of stars. If the new offering rates high in measures like recall and likability, perhaps it will return to the Big Game next year.",

People can\u2019t send emergency text messages or share important milestones, like having a baby or riding a bicycle for the first time.\n\n\u201cIf you can see the sky, you\u2019re already connected,\u201d a narrator says. T-Mobile worked with agency Panay Films on the ad.\n\nThe ad prompts people to the telco\u2019s website to sign up for a beta version of T-Mobile Starlink.\n\nBeta launching at the Super Bowl\n\nT-Mobile is using the Super Bowl\u2014the biggest sporting event and advertising stage of the year\u2014to launch what will initially be a small program in beta.\n\nThe telco said that the goal of the beta program is to test the service before it\u2019s rolled out to millions of subscribers this summer.\n\nThose using the beta service do not need to be T-Mobile customers; it\u2019s available to AT&T and Verizon customers for free through July.\n\nAfter July, T-Mobile Starlink will be included on T-Mobile Go5G and Go5G Business Next plans. T-Mobile subscribers who are not on either of these plans can add the service for $15 a month per line. AT&T and Verizon subscribers can pay $20 to access the program after the trial ends in July.\n\nThe ad marks a significant shift in T-Mobile\u2019s creative approach. The brand\u2019s Big Game ads have long relied on celebrities, like 2024\u2019s spot with Jason Momoa. Zach Braff and Donald Faison have also been longtime spokesmen for T-Mobile.\n\nJohn Travolta, Bradley Cooper, Dolly Parton, and Miley Cyrus have also appeared in Super Bowl ads for T-Mobile in recent years.",

T-Mobile engineers will be on-site and emergency response teams will be at both the NCICC and the Wireless Command Center (WCC) at the stadium to provide real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.\n\nRapid Deployment Network Vehicles\n\nT-Mobile has deployed numerous assets to provide additional coverage as needed such as our SatCOLTs (Satellite Cell on Light Truck) and COWs (Cell on Wheels), including our largest-ever XL COW, a 32-ft configurable mobile unit delivering over a one-mile radius of connectivity that has been strategically stationed near the Riverwalk to provide extra capacity where it\u2019s needed most.\n\nSmart, Resilient Network for Public Safety\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s award-winning 5G network is engineered for reliability, overlapping coverage and rapid response \u2014 critical for major events. In early February, T-Mobile made permanent upgrades and temporary capacity enhancements inside and around the stadium including upgraded indoor distributed antenna systems (iDAS) for Ultra Capacity 5G while watching the game and upgraded macro cell sites that will provide 5G download speeds up to 920 Mbps in areas just outside the stadium.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s modern network uses data, AI and technology 24/7 to quickly respond and recover. T-Mobile\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d Self-Optimizing Network (SON) automatically adjusts to \u201cheal\u201d coverage gaps and antennas automatically tilt to expand coverage when and where needed. Backup power systems and redundant data routes keep communications running during outages or high-demand periods.\n\nPriority Connectivity for First Responders\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s T-Priority provides first responders on eligible plans with the highest priority connectivity even in the most congested conditions, a service that has been offered to agencies supporting the game free of charge for 30 days. Built on T-Mobile\u2019s 5G Standalone Core, T-Priority provides lower latency and faster speeds more consistently, with the highest priority across all 5G bands.\n\nGame Changing Support for Major Events\n\nT-Mobile has a proven track record of supporting first responders and public safety operations at major events, including the Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix, the MLB All-Star Week and disaster response efforts nationwide. For football\u2019s main event, T-Mobile is providing the same reliable support to ensure first responders can focus on keeping the game, the city and the fans safe.\n\n# # #\n\n*T-Priority features will be available for eligible emergency response organizations on select plans. Capable device required. Performance baseline commits available network resources to help maintain threshold throughput, even in times of congestion. See 5G device, coverage and access details at T-Mobile.com. Speeds differ by location; typical on-device download speeds on T-Mobile\u2019s nationwide 5G network are 89\u2013418 Mbps with peaks over 1Gbps; typical upload speeds are 6\u201331 Mbps.",

            "content": "Albuquerque, New Mexico. Home of green chiles, over 300 days of sunshine, the International Balloon Fiesta... and achingly slow internet. Home internet was a two-horse race in Albuquerque for years: CenturyLink DSL and Xfinity cable. I spent decades on DSL, watching my internet speed tests march slowly up to a maximum of 20 megabits per second. Friends with faster Xfinity bemoaned the company\u2019s customer service, data caps and prices, so I stubbornly stuck with CenturyLink. One day in late 2022, a T-Mobile Home Internet gateway arrived at my house. After that, I finally called to cancel CenturyLink.\n\nHere's why I switched to T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nI went with T-Mobile for several reasons. DSL was too slow. My next-door neighbor got T-Mobile Home Internet and raved about it. Coincidentally, CenturyLink wanted to charge me $200 to replace my old router with a newer one. I said, \"Nope,\" and changed to 5G home internet.\n\nMy home internet life has improved in my post-DSL world, but it\u2019s not all roses and happy dances. If you\u2019re looking for a TL;DR, here you go: I\u2019m still on T-Mobile Home Internet and will probably stick with it until I can give Verizon 5G Home Internet a try or until fiber finally shows up on my block. My experience with 5G home internet is specific to my circumstances, so your journey with the same service may differ. Here are things I like about my 5G home internet and the elements that may drive me to switch to another internet service provider someday.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nWhat I love about T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nI will sing the praises of T-Mobile Home Internet before I air my grievances. The service's best features are its simplicity and ease of use and it represents an upgrade over outdated DSL.\n\nThe price is right\n\nWith CenturyLink, I was paying $45 per month for downloads up to 20Mbps. With T-Mobile, my monthly bill is a straight $50. That\u2019s a sweet spot for me regarding home internet pricing. I was willing to pay a little more than CenturyLink for a higher standard of service, but my bargain-hunting mindset would balk at anything higher. I would consider Verizon 5G Home Internet for the same price, but the rival service is unavailable at my address.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nI expect fiber to arrive someday, but I\u2019ll scrutinize the pricing before I make a change. The two providers most likely to service my address are Ezee Fiber ($69 per month for a gig) and Vexus Fiber ($40 per month for 500Mbps or $50 per month for a gig). Vexus raises rates after the first year. I\u2019ll weigh my ingrained frugality against fiber performance when the time comes.\n\nIt\u2019s faster than DSL\n\nThat might seem like faint praise, but T-Mobile provides me vastly better speeds than I was getting from DSL. My best speed test results net top download speeds of 200Mbps, 10 times what I got on a good day with DSL. Speeds can be variable thanks to network congestion and placement of the gateway device. I have some speed complaints, but we'll talk about that later.\n\nTerms are simple\n\nI don\u2019t like complexity when it comes to broadband plans. I don\u2019t want to calculate equipment rental fees or figure out overage penalties for exceeding a data cap. I especially don\u2019t want to be tied into a contract. I just want home internet and to be free to try another ISP. T-Mobile ticks the simplicity box. There are no gear fees, data caps or contracts.\n\nIt\u2019s mom-approved\n\nMy mother lives six blocks away from me. She also had CenturyLink DSL. I ran a speed test on her desktop computer and the best she could get was about 12Mbps. That\u2019s not a typo. That\u2019s the reality for some DSL customers. She was paying over $60 per month and was frustrated every time she tried to call to discuss her bill. No problem, Mom. We canceled her DSL and got her signed up with T-Mobile. She found a nice perch for the gateway in a front window near her computer. With a strong signal, she can regularly pull down speeds from 100-200Mbps, which is plenty good for her low-key browsing and streaming needs. The only downside is she gets text messages about school closings to her gateway, a leftover from whoever used her gateway\u2019s phone number before her. It\u2019s a minor annoyance, and I don\u2019t have the same problem.\n\nGateways are easy\n\nT-Mobile provides a free gateway device that melds the features of a modem and a router. I have a silver Nokia gateway that\u2019s semi-affectionately referred to as the \u201ctrash can.\u201d The top-mounted display is a mild annoyance due to its awkward location, and it gets hot but works. T-Mobile now has newer models. My mother has a Sagemcom device with a front-mounted display resembling a more refined trash can. The newest gateway is sleeker and looks like an Apple product. I had no issues setting up my Nokia gateway and my mother\u2019s Sagemcom. We were online within minutes and found the gateways to be stable, with no crashes or other hiccups to report. The Wi-Fi works well, reaching the corners of our vintage homes with respectable speeds.\n\nWhy it's not all good stuff with T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet has a lot going for it, but it\u2019s not my dream broadband service. Here are a few areas where it stumbles.\n\nIt\u2019s not faster than cable or fiber\n\nXfinity offers cable speeds up to 1,200Mbps at my home. Fiber from Vexus Fiber, Quantum Fiber and Ezee Fiber is slowly spreading across Albuquerque, but it\u2019s not in my historic neighborhood yet. Fiber customers can access symmetrical gig speeds, of which I\u2019m incredibly envious. T-Mobile Home Internet offers typical speeds of 87-415Mbps, vastly below offerings from the local cable and fiber ISPs. The good news is I\u2019m not a gamer (let\u2019s ignore my Nintendo Wii obsession), so I just need enough oomph to surf and stream. I wouldn\u2019t mind zippier downloads and uploads for when I\u2019m moving big music, video and image files around.\n\nStrong signals may be elusive\n\nTwo lights are better than none? Amanda Kooser\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s 5G internet service is subject to the same pitfalls you encounter with phone service. Sometimes, you\u2019re in a place with a weak signal. Sometimes, that place is your own home. My neighbor, the first person I knew who got on board with 5G home internet, gets a strong signal on the west side of her house. Next door, the best I can get is a fair signal, which works out to two bars out of five on the gateway\u2019s scale. That means I\u2019m missing out on the top speeds the service is capable of.\n\nSpeeds can vary wildly\n\nMy T-Mobile Home Internet speed is like the Albuquerque weather. Wait five minutes, and it'll change. I just ran an internet speed test and got 16.7Mbps. That's slow enough to give me unwelcome flashbacks to my DSL days. A few minutes later, I'm at 94.6Mbps. Sometimes, I get over 100Mbps. Usually, I'm sitting around 80Mbps. My speed tests are all over the map. Some of this may be due to the 1939 construction materials of my home and my inability to dial in a good placement for the gateway to get a better signal. My CNET colleague Eli Blumenthal also encountered speed issues when testing the service in 2022. When CNET's Joe Supan tried AT&T Internet Air, he also struggled with maintaining decent speeds, so the issue may be more endemic to fixed wireless service than specific to T-Mobile Home Internet.\n\nWindow placement is awkward\n\nSometimes getting a strong signal can require a balancing act. Amanda Kooser\n\nT-Mobile recommends placing your gateway \u201cclose to a window or high up on an upper floor or bookshelf.\u201d When I had DSL, my router sat in my home office on a nifty little custom shelf. It was unobtrusive and out of the way. My T-Mobile gateway has visited every single window in my house in my search for a strong signal. It\u2019s now in my living room with the silver \u201ctrash can\u201d perched on a windowsill. I still get solid Wi-Fi coverage around my home, but a piece of internet equipment sitting in my window isn\u2019t my ideal home decor.\n\nParting thoughts on my T-Mobile Home Internet experience\n\nThinking about dipping your toes into T-Mobile Home Internet? Consider if it\u2019s an upgrade over your current service. If you\u2019re crawling along with DSL, it could be a smart move. If you need consistent and super-fast speeds, especially for gaming, then look to cable or fiber. I\u2019m not a T-Mobile phone customer, but mobile users can bundle with eligible phone plans to get extra savings on home internet. That could be enough to tip price-conscious shoppers over to the 5G internet service.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of experimentation with 5G home internet. You don\u2019t know how well it will work for you until you try it, so take advantage of T-Mobile\u2019s 15-day money-back trial. I\u2019m not in love with my home internet, but at least I like it, and that\u2019s a better relationship than I had with DSL.",

Additionally, T-Mobile is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for 5G connectivity, offering faster speeds and unlocking new possibilities for customers and businesses.\n\nT-Mobile has also pursued strategic acquisitions to fuel its growth. For instance, the company completed its merger with Sprint Corporation, further strengthening its market position and enabling synergies in network expansion and cost savings. Moreover, T-Mobile has the potential to explore new business segments, such as Internet of Things (IoT) solutions and enterprise services, to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nT-Mobile faces certain risks and challenges in the dynamic telecommunications industry. The evolving nature of consumer preferences and technological advancements pose risks in terms of maintaining a competitive edge and adapting to changing market dynamics. Regulatory changes and compliance requirements can also impact the company's operations and profitability.\n\nAdditionally, T-Mobile operates in a capital-intensive industry, requiring substantial investments in network infrastructure and spectrum licenses. This reliance on capital expenditures can strain the company's financial resources and cash flow generation. T-Mobile must carefully manage its debt levels and effectively allocate resources to sustain its growth trajectory.",

But the expected growth could be hampered by ongoing trade wars.\n\nThe Technavio report noted that smartphone growth over the last several years and into the future has been aided by several technological factors, including an improved broadband infrastructure to help ensure more reliable connectivity, the availability of affordable handsets for those who can\u2019t afford the latest, most advanced models, and the introduction of the 5G network, gadgets, and chips, which all provide faster data rates than their predecessors.\n\n\u201cPremium-class phones with advanced features like cloud storage, content subscription, and high-speed network access are in high demand,\u201d Technavio noted.\n\n\u201cDisposable cash is a key factor for mobile phone users looking for entertainment, networking, and improved telecom infrastructure. Operating systems like Android and iOS, with application developers creating social media, utility, lifestyle applications in C++ and Java, fuel innovation. In-app purchases and subscriptions to courses further enhance user experience.\n\nIn addition to ongoing trade wars, the Technavio report said that the smartphone market will contend with other challenges like lengthening product lifecycle and security and privacy concerns. The more expensive the phones become \u2014 even the affordable ones \u2014 the longer consumers tend to wait before upgrading.\n\nAs the Technavio report cites, a better broadband infrastructure, increased capabilities, and increased speeds are helping to drive smartphone market growth. A recent Ookla report found that T-Mobile was the fastest mobile provider in the U.S. across all technologies combined \u2014 and specifically for 5G \u2014 in the second half of last year.\n\nThe carrier had the Fastest Mobile Network, with a Speed Score of 222.63. It topped the charts for median download speed at 212.77 Mbps, far surpassing AT&T\u2019s 95.08 Mbps and Verizon Wireless\u2019 86.23 Mbps.

            "content": "Starlink satellites now work with iPhone, but the change has caused confusion and concern. Here's what the feature means, how it works, and how you can disable it if you so choose.\n\nThe recent iOS 18.3 update contained a number of new features for iPhone users. We saw new Unity wallpapers, improvements to Visual Intelligence to recognize plants and animals, and plenty of bug fixes.\n\nBut there was one change in this update that got a fair bit of attention \u2014 support for Starlink satellites.\n\nThere's been a lot of misconceptions about what changed here.\n\nWhat Starlink support means for iPhone users\n\nSatellite support works on all flavors of iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16. It's been around for a few years, but Starlink support specifically is new.\n\niOS 18.3 brought plenty of new features and fixes\n\nEssentially, select users can rely on Starlink satellites when outside of cellular range. Great for off the grid situations, as well as emergencies.\n\nThe satellites connect via the band 25 1900MHz spectrum, which has been supported on the iPhone. The way this works differs from Apple's existing satellite support we've seen for a while.\n\nApple already offers Emergency SOS, Find My support, roadside assistance, and messages via satellite with those supported models.\n\nThese all use that satellite connectivity when outside of cell connection to send limited texts or receive assistance. It works well with a big caveat - you must be in visible range of the satellite.\n\nStarlink versus Globalstar\n\nApple partnered with Globalstar for its satellite feature It was founded, in part, by Qualcomm and is now owned 20% by Apple itself.\n\nSatellite support is great for emergencies. Source: Pexels\n\nApple says you must have a clear view of the sky and the horizon to use its satellite features. Plus, hlls, mountains, trees, and other foliage can interfere or slow it down the data.\n\nAgain, you have to actually hold your iPhone towards the sky without anything blocking your view for the satellite to connect and work. Not exactly convenient, but still comes in clutch in an emergency.\n\nTrying to connect to satellites can be tough in certain locations\n\nComparably, Starlink has many more satellites available to connect to. This allows a bit more freedom when connecting.\n\nFor example, you can leave your iPhone in your pocket or bag and still connect to the satellites to receive messages. Your iPhone automatically switches to this when cell range is gone, keeping you connected.\n\nThat's already more convenient than the emergency-centric offerings Apple directly touts.\n\nRight now, this Starlink satellite connectivity is for sending messages, though it is reportedly set to expand to phone calls and data in the future.\n\nThat could be huge.\n\nApple didn't partner with Starlink\n\nLet's be perfectly clear about this.\n\nThis is a partnership between T-Mobile and Starlink. Apple did not partner with Starlink.\n\nApple didn't even mention this in the release notes to iOS 18.3. It isn't an iPhone feature, but a T-Mobile network feature.\n\nIt first rolled out in beta with select Samsung devices, then surprisingly added iPhones to the list of compatible devices. At the moment, this feature is limited to US-based T-Mobile users who have been accepted into the beta.\n\nStarlink support means your iPhone can stay in your pocket and still connect, with voice and data coming in the future\n\nThat means it's not available on all iPhones. Not even all T-Mobile iPhones, at least not yet.\n\nHow to disable Starlink support on iPhone\n\nWe won't get into the discussion on Starlink owner, Elon Musk. Whether you like him or loathe him, the iOS 18.3 update brings many benefits, including security updates.\n\nTesting satellite support with the built-in demo\n\nWhile we understand people's hesitancy to update, for fear of giving Musk access to data, the fear is unfounded. Starlink support can quickly be disabled or reenabled in the future.\n\nHow to disable Starlink satellite support on iPhone\n\nIf your carrier doesn't yet have their own satellite option, you won't see this listed in your settings.\n\nOpen the Settings app on your iPhone after updating to iOS 18.3\n\napp on your iPhone after updating to iOS 18.3 Visit Cellular > T-Mobile (or other carriers if added in the future)\n\nToggle off satellite support\n\nThis isn't a permanent kill switch and certainly no reason to stop upgrading or downgrade devices. Starlink has access to the same data that any other ISP has access to, assuming the traffic goes through their domain name servers.\n\nIf it doesn't, then they don't know a thing.\n\nWe'll leave it to you on what makes the most sense, but at least you're armed with all the data.",

            "content": "When I was testing the TCL 50 XL for my phone review, I was disappointed to find that the Android phone ships with the T-Mobile Play feed preinstalled alongside Google Discover. It clutters up the screen with an additional feed of stories that I don't need. It's also not clear how to make the feed go away, unlike other preinstalled apps that can be deleted from the Android app drawer. This feed isn't limited to this TCL phone though, as the feed occasionally comes alongside several phones that the carrier sells. In this case, the TCL 50 XL is a T-Mobile carrier exclusive, so it's not surprising to see this extra branded boost attached.\n\nTo be fair, T-Mobile isn't alone in this practice of preinstalling apps and content. Verizon and AT&T have long packaged their own apps onto phones sold by the carriers, a practice often referred to as \"bloatware\" because of how these preinstalled applications are not actively requested by customers buying the phone. Even worse, at times they are impossible to uninstall, making it seem like you are stuck with the application.\n\nRead More: T-Mobile Raises Rates on Select Legacy Plans, Here's the Deal\n\nT-Mobile Play is one of these applications that aren't easily uninstalled, but by tinkering in the Settings menu, you can disable and hide the Play feed. This will let you use your phone with a little bit less T-Mobile branding and free up your Google Discover feed to only show articles and videos recommended by that service's algorithm. Because frankly, having only one algorithmically generated news service on your Android phone is enough.\n\nThis solution isn't new -- I found it on a OnePlus subreddit page first posted several years ago. Still, I was able to successfully remove the T-Mobile Play feed from the TCL 50 XL using these steps. A T-Mobile representative did not return a comment when asked if there is another method for turning this feed off.\n\nBut so much for the backstory. Here's how to banish the T-Mobile Play feed:\n\nFirst, open your Settings app, and head to the Applications list. This might be labeled Apps on your phone.\n\nThe T-Mobile Play app is listed in the Applications list. Mike Sorrentino/CNET\n\nScroll down to the T-Mobile Play app, and select it.\n\nYou'll get the option to Disable the T-Mobile Play app. Mike Sorrentino/CNET\n\nOn the corresponding page, you'll next want to tap the Disable option.\n\nA submenu will come up confirming that you want to disable the app. Mike Sorrentino/CNET\n\nAfter selecting Disable, a submenu will pop up confirming that you want to disable the app. You'll then tap Disable App to confirm. To finalize the change, you'll want to turn your phone off and on again, or have it reboot from your power menu.\n\nThe Google Discover feed, now free from the T-Mobile Play feed. Mike Sorrentino/CNET\n\nAfter the phone reboots, you'll now see the Google Discover feed on its own, and completely untangled from the T-Mobile Play feed. If you decide later you've changed your mind, you can repeat these steps to enable the feed again, and it will appear after another reset.",

If you\u2019re looking to get your hands on a free 5G phone without a big catch, T-Mobile seems to have a new promotion that lets you get a budget Android phone for free, with no trade-in or new lines required.\n\nAccording to The Mobile Report, citing internal sources, customers on T-Mobile postpaid plans can buy one of these 5G budget phones and get credited the phone\u2019s value over 24 months of bill credits: Motorola: Moto G 5G (2024)\n\nMoto G Stylus 5G (2024)\n\nSamsung: Galaxy A16 5G\n\nGalaxy A15 5G\n\nGalaxy A14 5G\n\nT-Mobile: REVVL 6x 5G The report says you don\u2019t need to trade in an older device or activate a new line. The only condition for this offer is that you can only get it at T-Mobile kiosks in Walmart. Any postpaid consumer plan that can finance devices is said to be eligible unless they are special accounts like business accounts, etc. The promotion is internally called \u201cWalmart Smartphone ID250040,\u201d in case you need to assist the rep in locating the promotion.\n\nAs is usual with such bill credit offers, you won\u2019t be able to pay the phone off early without losing the remainder of the credits. The report also warns that third-party stores can be problematic with accounts, and an in-store rep working at Walmart could be even more so, so you\u2019ll have to be vigilant with your account. Not all Walmart stores offer T-Mobile devices, either, so you will have to check before you head to your local Walmart for a free phone.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to T-Mobile for more information on this promotion, including a confirmation. We\u2019ll update this article when we learn more.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com .

From there, the carrier decided to make T-Life an all-encompassing app for T-Mobile services and support, adding account management and chat help.\n\nBy the summer of last year, the T-Mobile and T-Life apps were essentially duplicates of one another, and some consolidation was in order. The original app that launched in 2012 became unlisted on the Play Store by November of 2024. At the time, a T-Mobile spokesperson told Android Central that people with the legacy T-Mobile app would be able to continue to use it.\n\nThat is, until now. The old app is useless now, and users need to download the new one if they'd like to continue accessing T-Mobile features and account management services from their smartphone.\n\n\"Customers can download the T-Life app \u2014 a one-stop-shop for all things T-Mobile where they can easily manage their account, upgrade their device, connect with Care and more,\" a T-Mobile spokesperson said of the T-Life app back in November 2024.",

In the commercial, T-Mobile advertises that \u201cfamilies can save 20% vs. the other big guys\u201d with T-Mobile wireless service.\n\nThough the panel supported the carrier\u2019s claim, in its decision, NAD recommended that T-Mobile discontinue or modify the challenged advertising because, as the advertisement currently is worded, it isn\u2019t clear which companies are the object of comparison. A modified message could avoid conveying the message that customers can save 20% compared to Spectrum Mobile in the first year of service.\n\nWhile Charter argued that its Spectrum Mobile should be considered among the \u201cbig guys\u201d along with Verizon and AT&T, the National Advertising Review Board (NARB) panel disagreed. The panel determined that consumers would not consider Spectrum Mobile, with its smaller market share, to be in that category.\n\nAdditionally, the panel determined that the claim that consumers could, but not necessarily would, save 20% versus Spectrum Mobile is valid. The panel noted the availability of a \u201csavings calculator\u201d on T-Mobile\u2019s website that allows consumers to calculate possible savings.\n\nIn a statement about the ruling, T-Mobile stated that it \u201cappreciates the panel\u2019s careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments\u201d and \u201cremains a strong supporter of the self-regulation process.\u201d\n\nThe decision marked a change in fortunes for T-Mobile in such cases. In mid-January, NAD ruled that T-Mobile\u2019s \u201cHolidays are Coming in Hot\u201d commercial \u2014 in which the carrier promised prospective customers monthly savings of 20% compared to AT&T and Verizon \u2014 was unclear whether the T-Mobile claim included third-party streaming services.\n\nAnd, in a case similar to the one ruled on this week, NAD ruled that in two 30-second T-Mobile commercials claiming T-Mobile subscribers \u201csave on every plan vs. the other big guys\u201d was misleading.",

Known for its customer-focused \u201cUn-carrier\u201d strategy, the company emphasizes simple pricing and innovative features. Following its 2020 merger with Sprint, T-Mobile expanded its 5G network and subscriber base, solidifying its competitive position and its market cap currently stands at $270.9 billion.\n\nShares of TMUS have significantly outpaced the broader market over the past year. The stock has gained 49.6% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 22.6%. In 2025, TMUS stock is up 9.8%, compared to SPX\u2019s 3.1% returns on a YTD basis.\n\nTMUS has also easily outshined the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund (XLC). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 30.4% over the past year and is up 5.9% in 2025, lagging behind TMUS\u2019 robust returns.\n\nOver the past year, T-Mobile has outpaced the broader market due to its 5G leadership, strong subscriber growth, cost synergies from the 2020-Sprint merger, resilient business model, and solid financial performance, including revenue growth and share buybacks.\n\nOn Jan. 29, T-Mobile shares jumped 6.3% following the release of its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings. The company reported EPS of $2.57, surpassing analyst expectations of $2.29 and marking a 54% year-over-year increase. Quarterly revenue reached $21.9 billion, beating the forecasted $21.3 billion. T-Mobile's strong performance was highlighted by 1.9 million postpaid net customer additions, reflecting solid operational execution and sustained customer growth.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect T-Mobile\u2019s EPS to grow 7.4% to $10.37 on a diluted basis. Moreover, it beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 27 analysts covering TMUS stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 16 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, two \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d eight \u201cHolds,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is less bullish than two months ago when the stock had 18 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings.\n\nOn Feb. 3, Barclays PLC (BCS) analyst Kannan Venkateshwar raised T-Mobile's price target to $250 from $230, maintaining an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating. The analyst highlighted that T-Mobile's performance in the quarter reinforces a preference for telecom stocks over cable stocks.\n\nThe mean price target of $255.20 represents a 3.5% premium to TMUS\u2019 current price levels. The Street-high price target of $280 suggests an upside potential of 15.5%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

That's because a Spectrum customer would not achieve the 20% savings claimed by T-Mobile because of a special promotion Spectrum is running that lowers a customer's price during his first year with the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nT-Mobile 's claim that \"Families can save 20% vs. the other big guys\" with T-Mobile wireless service is supported by the evidence.

The Review Board panel said that consumers would not call Spectrum Mobile, with its smaller market share, \"one of the big guys\" in mobile.

Customers will need to use the new T-Life app to access their accounts, make payments, and take advantage of promotions like the popular T-Mobile Tuesdays. The core functionality of the app remains the same as the old T-Mobile app, but it has been rebranded, and multiple features consolidated in the new app.\n\nTo be fair, we saw this coming back in November. At that time, there were two apps running side-by-side: the T-Mobile app and the T-Life app. Then the carrier removed the older T-Mobile app from the Play Store, but it still worked for anyone who already had it on their device. Not so anymore. The app is now completely dead.\n\nThere's no purpose now in keeping the old T-Mobile app on your phone. It doesn't work. There will be no more updates for it. All it is doing is taking up space.\n\nThe physical stores are also gone\n\nT-Mobile's push to become digital-only has raised some eyebrows. The company began shuttering most of its physical stores and all of its kiosks back in 2023, laying off hundreds of people in a massive restructuring. At the time, the company said it wanted to meet customers where they were, which wasn't at the money-losing physical stores.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn their place, T-Mobile launched several signature stores in key markets, designed to wow customers, and upgraded its existing Experience Stores. The company also partnered with third-party retailers to push T-Mobile services in what it calls \"express stores.\" But other than that, a customer's entire relationship with the carrier will be online, through the T-Life app.\n\nThis is the end of an era for T-Mobile, which used to style itself the \"un-carrier.\" While the switch to digital-only has been gradual, this final step makes it clear that if you want to manage your T-Mobile account, there's only one app that matters now.\n\nT-Life\n\nT-Mobile USA\n\nLIFESTYLE\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.7\n\nDownload",

( ) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Teresa Taylor, the Lead Independent Director recently netted about US$1.9m selling shares at an average price of US$236. Probably the most concerning element of the whole transaction is that the disposal amounted to 66% of their entire holding.\n\nT-Mobile US Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Raul Claure, sold US$547m worth of shares at a price of US$180 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$242. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 44% of Raul Claure's holding.\n\nIn total, T-Mobile US insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that T-Mobile US insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$1.0b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About T-Mobile US Insiders?\n\nThe stark truth for T-Mobile US is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. On the plus side, T-Mobile US makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing T-Mobile US.

            "content": "The best Metro by T-Mobile phones offer some decent choices for T-Mobile's pre-paid carrier. You can go for a top notch handset or budget-friendly option, all of which are guaranteed to work on the network. And with so many deals happening throughout the year, you can always expect big savings no matter what phone you end up getting.\n\nMetro's performance is comparable to parent network T-Mobile's, making Metro the best performing prepaid carrier we tested. It is definitely one of the best prepaid options on the market.\n\nMany of the same phones offered by the likes of T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon are available through Metro by T-Mobile, like the latest Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max. In fact, they're some of the best phones you can buy right now. Many new models are often offered right at launch, too.\n\nHere are the best phones Metro offers right now.\n\nThe best Metro by T-Mobile phones\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nSamsung has followed up last year mid-range champ in the Galaxy A54 with the Galaxy A55, but sadly it's not coming stateside. Instead, we get access to the Galaxy A35. Nevertheless, the A35 features a healthy set of rear cameras featuring the same 50MP lens that Samsung used for the pricier Galaxy S24 flagship. That helps the Galaxy A35 take pictures that measure up well against most camera phones, particularly budget models.\n\nThe Exynos 1380 chipset powering the Galaxy A35 doesn't turn in blazing performance, but it manages to deliver fluid results navigating around the interface, which helps too that it's packing a 120Hz display refresh rate. Speaking of its display, the Super AMOLED panel delivers outstanding viewing angles and rich colors that make video watching such an entertaining experience. Add all those features together, and you get quite a value-packed phone for under $500.\n\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy A35 hands-on review.\n\niPhone SE 2022 back of phone (Image credit: Future)\n\nThe iPhone SE is the cheapest iPhone Apple offers, and it packs stellar performance for a very easy-to-stomach $429 price. Buyers receive an A15 Bionic CPU \u2014 the very same one that debuted with the iPhone 13 \u2014 as well as a 12-megapixel camera system that benefits from the company's latest computational photography tricks. (Well, except for Night mode.)\n\nThe iPhone SE surely doesn't have the best battery life of any iPhone, given its relatively tiny battery. You'll probably want to spend an extra $50 and upgrade to 128GB of storage as well, if you can. But for the price, the SE's premium features \u2014 like wireless charging and water resistance \u2014 make it well worth a look for Metro by T-Mobile customers, especially since it supports sub-6GHz and C-band 5G.\n\nRead our full iPhone SE (2022) review.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe Moto G Power 5G (2024) is a reminder that 5G phones don't have to break the bank. Coming in at $299 \u2014 a shockingly low price for a device that can connect with T-Mobile's 5G network \u2014 the Moto G Power 5G(2024) is one of the best bangs for your buck.\n\nWhat's really impressive about this phone is that you can expect long battery life \u2014 over 13 hours on our test, which is better than what the average phone gets. The cameras perform okay in daylight, though it can be a struggle under low light. And you also get a 6.7-inch LCD display on the Moto G Power (2024). There are definitely compromises, but this is the best 5G value on Metro.\n\nRead our full Moto G Power 5G (2024) review.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\n4. iPhone 16 Pro Max Another big leap from Apple Our expert review: Specifications Display: 6.9-inch OLED (2868 x 1320) CPU: A18 Pro RAM: N/A Storage / Expandable: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB / No Rear camera: 48MP main (f/1.78), 48MP ultrawide (f2.2), 12MP telephoto w/ 5x zoom (f/2.8) Front camera: 12MP TrueDepth (f/1.9) Weight: 8 ounces Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 17:38 Today's Best Deals View at Visible (Black) View at Verizon View at Mint Mobile (256GB) Reasons to buy + Biggest screen yet + Obscene battery life + Handy Camera Control + Impressive Audio Mix for videos + Much improved Siri + Promising Apple Intelligence features Reasons to avoid - larger design makes it harder to use in one hand - Same slow charging speeds (again) - Apple Intelligence a work in progress\n\nApple\u2019s latest and greatest smartphone, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, wowed people everywhere with just how impressive it is. It\u2019s even bigger, more beautiful than ever before, and it does everything you could possibly want it to do. Apple refreshed the ultrawide camera, making it much more equipped for low light and macro photography. Battery life hits a new reocrd for any iPhone and the performance is incredibly impressive.\n\nNew this year is a Camera Control button that better gives shutterbugs more control with the camera, along with new Apple Intelligence features that transforms the way it's used for everything.\n\nIf anything, the biggest complaint you could leverage against the iPhone 16 Pro Max is that it's still expensive. Otherwise, you have a very good device here and it\u2019s by far one of the best devices that Metro has to offer.\n\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max reviews.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n5. iPhone 16 Still a great option Our expert review: Specifications Display: 6.1-inch OLED (2556 x 1179) CPU: A18 Bionic RAM: N/A Storage / Expandable: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB / No Rear cameras: 48MP (f/1.6), 12MP (f/2.2) Front camera: 12MP (f/1.9) Weight: 6 ounces Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 13:19 Today's Best Deals View at AT&T Mobility (128GB) View at AT&T Mobility (128GB) Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Stylish design with bold colors + Powerful A18 chip performance + Improved ultrawide camera for macro photography + Spatial photo and video support Reasons to avoid - -60Hz refresh rate is dated - Apple Intelligence features not really innovative\n\nIt's the iPhone 16 is the all-around phone for everyone. Apple's standard iPhone delivers a fantastic camera experience in a compact design. That's partly due to how it shares a similar main camera to the iPhone 16 Pro, delivering sharp details and good low light performance. It's also incredibly snappy thanks to the powerful A18 processor.\n\nOther highlights include a brighter 6.1-inch display and a smaller notch up top so you get more screen real estate. The biggest improvement is battery life, as we saw about 13.4 hours of endurance, which is an improvement of over 1.5 hours from the iPhone 15. Add in a base 128GB of storage for your $799 and you can\u2019t go wrong with this iPhone.\n\nRead our full iPhone 16 review.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n6. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Samsung\u2019s killer value Our expert review: Specifications Display: 6.7-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) CPU: Exynos 2400e RAM: 8GB Storage / Expandable: 128GB, 256GB / No Rear camera: 50MP main (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), 8MP telephoto (f/2.2) with 3x optical zoom Front camera: 10MP (f/2.4) Weight: 7.51 ounces Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 11:25 Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (256GB) View at Samsung View at Verizon Reasons to buy + Robust software experience + A lot more brilliant looking screen + Outstanding value + 7 years of software support Reasons to avoid - Battery life could be better - Weak selfie camera\n\nIf the latest Galaxy S flagships at Metro are too much for your budget, the carrier does offer the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, a lower-cost version of some earlier Galaxy S models. You get a beautiful and much larger 6.7-inch 120Hz display, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 CPU, and great camera performance with the triple lens setup.\n\nOne complaint about the Galaxy S24 FE is that the front selfie camera performance is a bit underwhelming, but the triple camera arrangement. The phone also feels rather heavy and doesn\u2019t feel as premium as some other phones, but that's a compromise that's more than acceptable given what you get for your money.\n\nRead our full Galaxy S24 FE review .\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWho says foldable phones can't be cheap? Metro by T-Mobile takes the already affordable Motorola Razr 2024 and discounts it down by even more. Since it's a flip-style phone, it does things you can't do with a traditional slate smartphone \u2014 like being able to take selfies hands-free by folding it in half.\n\nEven more impressive is that the cameras are quite good, especially for a foldable, since it does decent with low light. And even though it's a slim phone, it offers outstanding long battery life that can easily get you through the day.\n\nRead our full Razr 2024 review.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n8. iPhone 12 An older iPhone for less Our expert review: Specifications Display: 6.1-inch OLED (2532 x 1170) CPU: A14 Bionic RAM: 4GB Storage / Expandable: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB / No Rear cameras: 12MP (f/1.6), 12MP (f/2.4) Front camera: 12MP (f/2.4) Weight: 5.78 ounces Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 8:25 Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Stella dual camera performance + Fast A14 Bionic performance + Slim, compact design Reasons to avoid - 64GB starting storage option - Lack optical zoom\n\nThe iPhone 12 is the best new iPhone for those looking for an affordable option. For $629, you get improved cameras across the board with better low-light performance (thanks to Photonic Engine), and speedy graphics processing courtesy of the A14 Bionic chip.\n\nWhile the overall design remains similar to the previous model, it's subtle changes make it easy to handle one handed. The only thing we wish Apple offered is a 120Hz display at this price, but overall the iPhone 12 is a winner.\n\nRead our full iPhone 12 review.\n\nHow to choose the best Metro by T-Mobile phone for you\n\nWhile we regularly update our best Metro by T-Mobile phones page with the carrier's most compelling deals, you'll want to check the network's smartphones store page for the latest and greatest offers \u2014 especially if you're interested in switching from a rival carrier. Metro, like all wireless providers, offers the best discounts for new customers who bring their numbers over with them.\n\nOtherwise, Metro offers a complete range of devices across all prices, so prospective buyers should consider those most critical smartphone features \u2014 like battery life, performance and camera quality \u2014 when choosing a new handset. Cheaper models, like the Galaxy A20 and Moto G7 Power, tend to prioritize battery life above those other factors. In other words, if longevity on a charge is all you need, you could be in an ideal position to save.\n\nHowever, if premium specs, design and a great camera are really important to you, it's a better idea to look to one of the iPhones or Samsung Galaxy S devices on this list. They are more expensive, but their capabilities far outshine those of the less-expensive models Metro offers. They'll also likely last you a few more years and are sure to be supported with more frequent software updates going forward.\n\nHow we test smartphones\n\nIn order for a smartphone to make our best phone list, it needs to excel on several tests that we run on every handset. We perform some of these tests in our labs and some in the real world.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, we rely on such synthetic benchmarks as Geekbench 5 and 3DMark to measure graphics performance. These tests allow us to compare performance across iPhones and Android devices. We also run a real-world video transcoding test on each phone using the Adobe Premiere Rush app and time the result. (We unfortunately have to skip this test on some phones due to app compatibility issues, but we attempt this benchmark with each device we get in to review.)\n\nTo measure the quality of a phone's display, we perform lab tests to determine the brightness of the panel (in nits), as well as how colorful each screen is (DCI-P3 color gamut). In these cases, higher numbers are better. We also measure color accuracy of each panel with a Delta-E rating, where lower numbers are better and score of 0 is perfect.\n\nOne of the most important tests we run is the Tom's Guide battery test. We run a web surfing test over 5G (or 4G if the phone doesn't have 5G support) at 150 nits of screen brightness until the battery gives out. In general, a phone that lasts 10 hours or more is good, and anything above 11 hours makes our list of the best phone battery life.\n\nLast but not least, we take the best phones out in the field to take photos outdoors, indoors and at night in low light to see how they perform versus their closest competitors. We take shots of landscapes, food, portraits and more, and also allow you to be the judge with side-by-side comparisons in our reviews.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Tells Viewers To Not Trust Billionaires & Discusses These 11 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) stands against other stocks Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the potential impact on Wall Street from President Trump\u2019s potential actions against Denmark, Panama, and South Africa. Amongst other actions, the President has vowed to make Denmark\u2019s Greenland territory a part of the US and threatened to cut funding to South Africa over allegations of land confiscations.\n\nCramer believes that the \u201cstreet sells\u201d in response to these actions. He stated \u201cThat\u2019s what happens. I\u2019m not in any hurry to buy anything. We just were at a high. We had some big turmoil in tech as it was. We got a lot of quarters this week.\u201d However, while the absolute near-term outlook might be uncertain, all sectors aren\u2019t bad. According to Cramer \u201cThe only stuff I would think about buying are the drugs, medical device. Because their business, for the most part, not made in China, not made in Mexico. So those are the ones.\u201d\n\nOne outcome that was clear from the November election campaigns was that President Trump differs significantly from President Biden when it comes to policy. However, he might continue one aspect of the previous administration. Cramer shared that when it comes to drug prices \u201cRemember, the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act], under Biden, they did lower the prices. I think that\u2019s something that President Trump would continue to do.\u201d He also believes that \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a canard, the drug companies charge a lot here.\u201d\n\nOne interesting discussion during the show surrounded hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones\u2018 comments about the general economic climate being \u201cprecarious.\u201d Cramer took issue with Jones\u2019 word choice. He started by outlining \u201cI want to point out that once again, we have billionaires on. And billionaires always say it\u2019s incredibly precarious.\u201d As a result, Cramer pointed out that \u201cPeople at home therefore sell and they miss great opportunities to buy because they hear that it\u2019s really precarious from someone who\u2019s a billionaire so therefore it is.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC TV host urged people to keep investing as \u201cyou can\u2019t make money listening to a billionaire because they already have made money.\u201d When asked whether his advice meant that he was encouraging stock buying at a time when markets were dipping he replied \u201cNo, look I\u2019m not saying to buy. I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s a very tough word, precarious makes it sound like that we are in a systemic moment. I save that for 2007, 2008 when we were precarious.\u201d",

AT&T T plans to return $20 billion in dividends and $20 billion in repurchases from 2025-2027.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s US stock surged over 46% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV and the Vanguard Growth ETF VUG.\n\nPrice Action: TMUS stock traded higher by 0.23% to $237.80 premarket at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nPhoto by viewimage on Shutterstock",

            "content": "AST SpaceMobile announced a landmark agreement with Ligado Networks last month that will provide AST 40 MHz of L-band Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) spectrum across the US and Canada, as well as an additional 5 MHz of spectrum in the US.\n\nWorth ~$7B ($550M upfront + $80M annually for 80 years), the deal places the value of the spectrum at roughly $2M per MHz per year.\n\nMSS spectrum 101: Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) is the service designation for two-way comms between satellites and terrestrial platforms in motion (think handheld devices or terminals mounted on vehicles).\n\nHistorically, L-/S-band MSS spectrum was primarily used for handheld satellite phones and low-speed internet on moving platforms such as airplanes and ships. However, the high costs and subpar internet quality limited the widespread adoption of those services. In recent years, this narrative has shifted as MSS spectrum found new applications in enabling direct-to-device (D2D) satellite connectivity.\n\nDirect-to-device: Advances in technology now allow unmodified smartphones to connect directly with satellites, delivering service in areas without terrestrial cellular coverage. The proximity of L-/S-band MSS spectrum to terrestrial cellular bands means many smartphones can enable satellite connectivity through a simple firmware update, significantly lowering barriers to adoption.\n\nIn March 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) introduced a groundbreaking rule permitting terrestrial spectrum in the 1850\u20132000 MHz band to be used for Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS). This regulatory change enabled SpaceX to leverage T-Mobile\u2019s terrestrial spectrum to provide cellular connectivity in the US from space.\n\nUS L-/S-band MSS Allocations Overview\n\n1525-1559 MHz : Globally allocated for space-to-Earth (downlink) MSS operations. Inmarsat and Ligado hold spectrum rights in this band.\n\n: Globally allocated for space-to-Earth (downlink) MSS operations. 1610-1660.5 MHz : Globally allocated for Earth-to-space (uplink) MSS operations, with secondary space-to-Earth (downlink) allocation in portions of the band. Iridium and Globalstar hold spectrum rights in the lower portion of the band, while Inmarsat and Ligado hold spectrum rights in the upper portion.\n\n: Globally allocated for Earth-to-space (uplink) MSS operations, with secondary space-to-Earth (downlink) allocation in portions of the band. 1850-2000 MHz : Newly allocated MSS band only in the US, on a secondary basis, to support cellular Supplement Coverage from Space (SCS). The upper end of the band (1980-2000 MHz) is globally allocated for MSS operations. Currently, only SpaceX through its partnership with T-mobile has been authorized to commercially use this band by the FCC.\n\n: Newly allocated MSS band only in the US, on a secondary basis, to support cellular Supplement Coverage from Space (SCS). The upper end of the band (1980-2000 MHz) is globally allocated for MSS operations. 2000-2020 MHz : Allocated for Earth-to-space (uplink) MSS operations in the US, with the 2000-2010 MHz portion globally allocated. Echostar (through its subsidiaries) holds spectrum rights for this band.\n\n: Allocated for Earth-to-space (uplink) MSS operations in the US, with the 2000-2010 MHz portion globally allocated. 2180-2200 MHz : Globally allocated for space-to-Earth (downlink) MSS operations.

Skylo : The Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) service operator has partnered with MSS providers and chipset manufacturers to offer direct-to-device connectivity to a wide range of smartphones across the world. Echostar, Ligado, and Inmarsat are among the satellite partners, while Qualcomm, Samsung, MediaTek, and Sony are among the chipset partners.\n\n: The Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) service operator has partnered with MSS providers and chipset manufacturers to offer direct-to-device connectivity to a wide range of smartphones across the world. Echostar, Ligado, and Inmarsat are among the satellite partners, while Qualcomm, Samsung, MediaTek, and Sony are among the chipset partners. Iridium/Qualcomm (terminated): The partnership between the two companies that aimed to bring satellite-enabled features to Android phones was terminated in November 2023. Qualcomm shifted its focus to a standards-based approach for satellite connectivity versus Iridium\u2019s proprietary solution. Starting in 2024, Iridium also shifted to an open-standards approach through Project Stardust.\n\nNew Entrants Seeking Their Own Spectrum Allocations\n\nNew entrants seeking access to MSS spectrum face strong opposition from incumbents such as Globalstar, Iridium, and Echostar, which are focused on protecting their spectrum rights.\n\nSpaceX : While the FCC dismissed its application for MSS spectrum, the company has launched its D2D service through a partnership with T-Mobile in the US. SpaceX has similar partnerships with cellular carriers across the world, such as Rogers in Canada and One NZ in New Zealand.\n\n: While the FCC dismissed its application for MSS spectrum, the company has launched its D2D service through a partnership with T-Mobile in the US.

AST SpaceMobile : The company has applied for MSS spectrum to enable D2D communications but has not received FCC approval. In the interim, it is moving forward with its plans through the partnership with AT&T and Verizon. The company recently received a special temporary authorization from the FCC to begin testing D2D service using the first five BlueBird satellites launched in September. Pending regulatory approval, AST\u2019s long-term MSS spectrum lease agreement with Ligado will support the expansion of its service both domestically and internationally.\n\n: The company has applied for MSS spectrum to enable D2D communications but has not received FCC approval.

Kepler Communications : Kepler filed an MSS application in 2021 but recently pivoted to focus on optical relay communication services. However, the original MSS application remains under FCC review, and the company may continue pursuing its MSS plans, given the high value of the spectrum and its early application date.\n\n: Kepler filed an MSS application in 2021 but recently pivoted to focus on optical relay communication services.

Sateliot IoT Service: The Spanish startup applied in 2023 for MSS spectrum in the US to provide IoT narrowband satellite services, joining the growing list of companies seeking MSS spectrum access.\n\nSpaceX D2D: A Two-Way Approach\n\nSpaceX was the first company to receive regulatory approval for direct-to-device services using terrestrial spectrum through its partnership with T-Mobile. This collaboration enables users in the US to send messages via Starlink D2D services in areas lacking terrestrial cellular coverage.\n\nWhile this partnership jump-starts SpaceX\u2019s D2D ambitions, the company\u2019s long-term vision is to operate using its own non-terrestrial Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) spectrum. However, on March 26, 2024, the FCC dismissed SpaceX\u2019s application for MSS spectrum, citing the need for a new rulemaking process to assess whether a new system could coexist with incumbent networks.\n\nIn response, SpaceX filed a petition for rulemaking, urging the Commission to revise its licensing and spectrum-sharing framework for \u201cBig LEO\u201d non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) MSS systems operating in the 1610\u20131617.775 MHz and 2483.5\u20132500 MHz bands.\n\nThere are several advantages to securing non-terrestrial MSS spectrum over use of costly terrestrial spectrum:\n\nCost efficiency : Terrestrial spectrum is auctioned at high prices, often costing billions of dollars for just a few MHz. In contrast, non-terrestrial MSS spectrum involves relatively modest regulatory fees compared to terrestrial spectrum, making it a more cost-effective solution.\n\n: Terrestrial spectrum is auctioned at high prices, often costing billions of dollars for just a few MHz.

Global harmonization: Non-terrestrial MSS spectrum is largely harmonized worldwide, enabling more seamless global expansion.\n\nFinal thoughts: The rise of direct-to-device applications has breathed new life into MSS spectrum, making it a valuable asset for incumbents and highly sought after by new entrants. Regulations must balance protecting existing systems with enabling new ones to deliver much-needed supplemental coverage from space. SpaceX has once again paved the way, and in the coming years, many more operators will introduce D2D satellite-enabled services to the market.",

Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nA proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.\n\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nThis totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.\n\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: T-Mobile (TMUS)\n\nFounded in 1994 and headquartered in Bellevue, WA, T-Mobile US, Inc. is a national wireless service provider. The company offers its services under the T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile and Sprint brands. T-Mobile, through its subsidiaries, provides wireless services for branded postpaid and prepaid, and wholesale customers.\n\nTMUS is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nMomentum investors should take note of this Computer and Technology stock. TMUS has a Momentum Style Score of A, and shares are up 11.7% over the past four weeks.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, four analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.07 to $10.37 per share. TMUS boasts an average earnings surprise of 11.9%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, TMUS should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in T-Mobile US, Inc.

Until that happens, all Verizon (and I'm not basing that prediction entirely on my hunch, mind you, as AST SpaceMobile recently revealed that its still-nascent satellite constellation is likely to reach the scale \"required for continuous coverage of the US, Europe, and Japan\" either \"this year or the next.\" Translation -in 2026. Until that happens, all(and AT&T ) can do is test the technology for limited periods of time in certain parts of the country, which doesn't sound like the ideal setup for true, palpable innovation for the masses.\n\nWill Verizon and AT&T eventually catch up to T-Mobile?\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon and AT&T are still struggling to make up for the ground they lost by believing in the large-scale impact of mmWave tech or simply not doing enough to Maybe... and maybe not.

Some people are likely wondering the same thing when it comes to whether T-Mobile will stay true to Samsung's 5G network gear once it acquires UScellular's assets.\n\nSamsung this week is celebrating the fact that it supplied 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) and virtualized Radio Access Network (vRAN) solutions to support UScellular\u2019s fixed wireless access and mobile traffic in the Mid-Atlantic region. UScellular launched FWA in several markets in the area last November, and it\u2019s done pretty well for itself with FWA in general.\n\nBut how long that Samsung equipment stays within UScellular\u2019s network is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nT-Mobile agreed in May 2024 to buy most of UScellular\u2019s wireless operations for $4.4 billion, but that deal doesn\u2019t include the 28 and 39 GHz spectrum that UScellular is using for this Samsung mmWave rollout. T-Mobile's acquisition of certain UScellular assets hasn\u2019t yet closed and UScellular is required to run its business as usual until it\u2019s a done deal.\n\nNotably, T-Mobile doesn\u2019t use Samsung network infrastructure gear in its own network, begging the question of what will happen once the deal closes.\n\nT-Mobile didn\u2019t respond to Fierce\u2019s inquiry about what it plans to do with the Samsung gear post-transaction. Last fall, T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer John Saw told Fierce that the operator is happy with Ericsson and Nokia and wasn\u2019t looking to switch vendors.\n\nUScellular declined to comment. Ditto for Samsung, which said it couldn\u2019t comment on the duration of its contract with UScellular or how much the contract is worth. UScellular\u2019s markets in the Mid-Atlantic region include Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and a small part of Maryland.\n\nRelated UScellular eyes FWA for first 5G SA use case\n\nUScellular launched FWA using mmWave spectrum several years ago. That deployment used infrastructure from Nokia and Ericsson. The operator also uses low and mid-band spectrum for FWA.\n\nSurvival odds?\n\nAsked about the longevity of Samsung\u2019s gear in UScellular\u2019s network after it\u2019s acquired by T-Mobile, analyst Earl Lum of EJL Wireless Research gave it low odds of survival.\n\n\u201cI would say the likelihood would be high that the Samsung gear gets ripped out,\u201d Lum told Fierce.\n\nLum, who famously anticipated AT&T would boot Nokia in 2023, predicted last year that T-Mobile will ditch Nokia due to a multitude of technical issues, which he detailed in a LinkedIn piece. That hasn\u2019t happened, but Lum isn\u2019t backing away from his original thesis, suggesting it may be delayed by financial considerations that rival Ericsson could be making.\n\nAs for Samsung, it boasts No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier (by subscribers) Verizon as a 5G vRAN customer, so it\u2019s doing pretty well for itself. Still, Samsung executives last year outlined their plans to focus on Tier 2 and 3 North American operators, including those looking to add FWA to their offerings.\n\nOne of Samsung's claims to fame is the ability to offer end-to-end solutions \u2013 from infrastructure to handsets. Lum at the time concluded that itself represents \u201ca great opportunity\u201d for Samsung in the U.S.\n\n\n\nWho knows? Maybe Samsung will come back with an answer song all its own. Stranger things have happened.",

            "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nZacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nVGM Score\n\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.\n\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nYou want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.\n\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: T-Mobile (TMUS)\n\nFounded in 1994 and headquartered in Bellevue, WA, T-Mobile US, Inc. is a national wireless service provider. The company offers its services under the T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile and Sprint brands. T-Mobile, through its subsidiaries, provides wireless services for branded postpaid and prepaid, and wholesale customers.\n\nTMUS is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nAdditionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. TMUS has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 7.4% for the current fiscal year.\n\nFour analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.07 to $10.37 per share. TMUS also boasts an average earnings surprise of 11.9%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, TMUS should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in T-Mobile US, Inc.

            "content": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 4, 2025 \u2013 Charter Communications is asking federal judges to block a former executive from working his new job at fiber provider Metronet.\n\nThe company told the Delaware District Court that Preshanth Myla, Charter\u2019s former vice president of IT device activation, was violating stock option agreements and a Connecticut trade secrets law by working as Metronet\u2019s chief information officer. T-Mobile is in the process of acquiring Metronet via a joint venture with an investment firm.\n\nMyla left Charter in October 2024 and joined Metronet in December.\n\n\u201cMyla\u2019s move will give Metronet and T-Mobile immediate, unfair competitive advantages as Myla leverages his expertise (i.e., Charter\u2019s trade secrets) in optimizing the interoperability of traditional internet services with cellular services to compete with Charter,\u201d the company wrote in an emergency motion.\n\nCharter is effectively worried T-Mobile will get access to its trade secrets around convergence, the popular industry practice of offering mobile and fixed broadband together in an effort to get customers to stick around longer. Charter is a cable giant with more than 30 million broadband subscribers and operates a mobile service through a deal with Verizon, which the company announced Tuesday just reached 10 million subscribers.\n\nOn the company\u2019s earnings call last week, Charter CEO Chris Winfrey said the company sees \u201cmuch lower churn\u201d among converged customers, with CFO Jessica Fischer adding the company saw better revenue from those customers as well.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s pending acquisition of Metronet and another regional fiber provider, Lumos, is in part a bid to get in on convergence, as Charter sees it. The partnership with Metronet will \u201cundoubtedly leverage Myla's expertise in optimizing the interoperability of traditional internet services with mobile offerings,\u201d Charter argued.\n\nT-Mobile ended 2024 with more than 6.4 million broadband subscribers, largely offered with excess capacity on its 5G network for now, and more than 122 million mobile customers.\n\nCharter argued Myla was barred by more than 15 stock option agreements from working for a competitor for at least a year. Myla, for his part, sought to have the case dismissed, or at least transferred. He argued that the agreements were so overbroad they violated state law in Colorado, where he lives and worked for Charter, and thus can\u2019t be enforced.\n\nThe company had filed a complaint seeking to keep Myla out of his new job earlier in January, but followed up on Jan. 24 with an emergency motion to immediately block Myla from working for Metronet after he fought the case.\n\nMyla will have to file a response to Charter\u2019s emergency motion by Feb. 7, and Charter will have to respond to Myla\u2019s motion to dismiss by the same day.",

Like Mint Mobile and some other mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), Tello operates using T-Mobile's nationwide network but features a distinct set of plans geared toward low-data users, students, or those looking to save a few extra dollars each month.\n\nTello's singular Build Your Own plan meets a niche that many big-budget carriers tend to avoid: an essentially pay-what-you-use system meant specifically for people who aren't on their phones much, like grandparents, kids, or anyone who is most often connected to WiFi and doesn't use a lot of data. Tello's customizable plan provides exactly the right amount of data at the lowest possible rate for these users, making it one of the best cell phone plans for seniors on a budget and one of the best cheap cell phone plans overall.\n\nUltimately, you get what you pay for with Tello, as the MVNO comes with barebones benefits. There aren't discounts for multiple lines like you might see on a traditional family plan, for example, and you have to pay extra for features like international roaming.\n\nWe've tested Tello's coverage, data reliability, and speeds to see how the service fared through routine use. We've also considered the pros and cons of Tello's various plans so you can judge whether the carrier will work for you.\n\nTello Mobile (Build Your Own Plan) Backed by T-Mobile's network, Tello's unique Build Your Own plan allows you to customize your data and voice minutes to your specific needs and offers a low base price of $5/month.

Not ideal for high-data users\n\nPlan offerings and flexibility\n\nTello Mobile's strength lies in its wide variety of plan options, including a range of pre-designed plans and the opportunity to create your own custom plan.\n\nTello's month-to-month payment structure is also a key benefit for flexibility, as the MVNO allows you to switch between plans or data and minute allotments each month without penalty.\n\nAll of Tello's plans include unlimited texts, and you can choose an unlimited minutes option for calls or add prepaid minutes or data to your account using Tello's Pay As You Go credit. The Pay As You Go minutes are the lone method for international roaming, and they're also a good option if you have a minutes-only plan and want the option of data usage if you need it. Your credits will last 90 days.\n\nBelow are the specifics of each Tello premade plan and its customizable \"Build Your Own\" option.\n\nPlan Monthly data Talk & Text Monthly price Economy 2GB Unlimited $10 Value 5GB Unlimited $14 Smart 10GB Unlimited $19 Data Unlimited (speed capped after 35GB) Unlimited $25 ($15/month for the first three months with a limited-time discount) Build Your Own No data*, 1GB, 2GB, 5GB, 10GB, 15GB, or Unlimited* Unlimited text, varied minutes options (no minutes or the choice of 100, 300, 500, or unlimited minutes) Varied (ranging from $5 to $25)\n\n*In a Build Your Own plan, you can't combine the \"No data\" option with a \"No minutes\" option; you'll have to pair \"No data\" with at least 100 minutes.\n\nEach Tello plan features a designated allotment of data each month before your data speeds are throttled to 2G from 4G LTE/5G. Any additional data you use that month will be free of charge (though at essentially unusable speeds). Even the nominally \"unlimited\" data plan has this threshold, with data speeds slowing to 2G after you use 35GB of high-speed data. You won't be able to stream video or perform standard functions easily at 2G. Still, if you regularly watch videos over data, Tello probably isn't meant for you, regardless.\n\nTello's family plan page features a version of the Build Your Own Plan customization directed specifically at families looking to differentiate individual lines on one account. While there are no discounts for adding multiple lines to an existing plan (apart from a lack of additional setup cost), Tello's customizable offerings are among the best family cell phone plans for budget value, as each line can be given its own data and minutes allotment at very low costs. It's also important to note that each line will have its own billing cycle, and each will be billed separately on the day the plan was activated rather than on a single billing date for the entire account.\n\nThe prices with Tello's plans, which cost as low as $5/month, are impressive, but the accompanying low data and low minutes can be difficult to navigate for some users, even with unlimited texts. If you want the lowest possible price with the Build Your Own plan, you'll have to choose between minimum data (and zero minutes) and minimum minutes (with zero data).\n\nIf you're a frequent social media user, tend to browse off of WiFi, or use health apps that often require data to operate, you'll likely use the low data cap quickly and be stuck with 2G speeds for the rest of the month. However, you could save serious money if you don't use your phone much or are always connected to WiFi.\n\nCoverage area\n\nSince Tello Mobile uses T-Mobile's nationwide network, its coverage area is the same. If T-Mobile works well in your area, Tello likely will, too.\n\nSome areas in the western United States have less consistent coverage with T-Mobile, so you might have spottier coverage if you live in a more rural area out west. Our testing area in New York City had consistently good coverage through the service, and in general, major urban centers are well-covered by T-Mobile (and, by extension, its various MVNOs, Tello included).\n\nYou can check your coverage area by entering your address or viewing the coverage map on Tello's website.\n\nT-Mobile provides Tello's coverage, so if T-Mobile adequately covers your area, you should have reliable coverage with Tello. Tello Mobile\n\nThe downside is that with more users comes more network traffic, and T-Mobile prioritizes their top-paying customers over the lower-budget carriers that use their network, like Tello and Mint Mobile. In high-traffic instances, Tello users will experience slower data speeds until congestion decreases. Thus, they may be more likely to encounter slow connections than 4G LTE or 5G, even if their high-speed data allotment is not yet used up.\n\nSee our Mint Mobile review and Mint Mobile vs. Tello guide for discrepancies between the two T-Mobile-backed MVNOs.\n\nService reliability and speeds\n\nWhile Tello's access to T-Mobile's expansive network means that customers will likely be covered throughout much of the US, your data speeds may vary depending on your location.\n\nIn our testing experience, we've had no issues sending and receiving texts, making audio and video calls, and using social media apps while connected via 4G LTE or 5G through Tello, which is a good sign for an MVNO operating in a major metropolitan area like New York City. We noted that the audio quality of phone and video calls wasn't the best and would cut out occasionally, both on standard phone calls and WiFi calls. However, we had no undelivered texts or dropped calls, even when we only had a few bars of service to work with.\n\nWe tested Tello's nominal \"unlimited\" plan, which offers high-speed data (subject to deprioritization) up to 35GB each month. Tello's mobile app (pictured) indicates your monthly data usage and lets you easily customize or add to your plan. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nDuring our testing, we used Tello's \"Data\" plan, which is their unlimited data and minutes plan option. We only used about 2GB of data throughout the week, which is far less than the plan's 35GB data cap (after which data speeds would have slowed to 2G rather than 4G LTE or 5G). Even calculating a month's usage would put me under the data cap. Granted, we were connected via WiFi the vast majority of the time. Our usage would have skyrocketed if we had relied solely on hot spot data.\n\nWith that in mind, Tello customers can use their mobile device as a hot spot with no additional charge, a perk many carriers will charge extra for. That said, your hot spot data will come from your monthly data pool or a separate 5GB limit if you use an \"Unlimited\" plan.\n\nWhile connected to a Tello hot spot, we could browse online and watch YouTube videos easily, but we found that it struggled to stream 4K videos on Netflix, for instance. This issue wasn't necessarily surprising, as we used a hot spot rather than a stable WiFi connection. If you rely on hot spots in your preferred places of work outside the home and office or stream video frequently over data, your data allowance will be spent quickly. However, this perk is not to be overlooked if you only use a hot spot occasionally.\n\nTello also supports WiFi calling through the My Tello app, which you might skim over as a prospective user but can be a key feature for areas where T-Mobile's coverage is spotty or congested. If T-Mobile doesn't adequately cover the areas you frequent, you might consider another budget carrier like Visible Wireless, which uses Verizon's network and may provide more coverage where you need it. See our Visible Wireless review and Tello vs. Visible guide for further comparison between the budget carriers.\n\nUS Mobile is another worthy budget alternative that uniquely allows you to periodically switch between the networks of T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T and includes options with prioritized premium data. Read our US Mobile review for more information.\n\nCustomer support\n\nWith Tello, your initial setup will be minimal. You'll either order an eSIM online or receive a SIM card in the mail and use an accompanying QR code to set up your account in the My Tello app, which provides a little bit more setup information and a basic walkthrough of the app's functions. Then, you're set to begin your wireless service.\n\nSince Tello is an online-only company, there are customer support channels available through the app and by phone only (with no option to visit a brick-and-mortar store for assistance), but the 24/7 chat feature is responsive and can answer most of the basic questions you might have on setup.\n\nAfter choosing your Tello plan, you can activate an eSIM or receive a SIM card in the mail and proceed to set up your service. Eve Montie/Business Insider\n\nYou can also use the app to make calls over a WiFi connection, connect with the shop to purchase a new phone, or manage your plan preferences. The shop notably only provides phones that are mostly older or refurbished, which reflects Tello's baseline principle of affordability and accessibility for its customer base.\n\nIf you have a newer phone, it will most likely be compatible with Tello, but you should double-check its compatibility on Tello's website using your phone's IMEI number (which you can find by dialing *#06# or checking your phone settings).\n\nShould you sign up for Tello Mobile?\n\nTello Mobile is the most affordable phone carrier we recommend for limited data. Eve Montie/Business Insider\n\nTello Mobile's low-cost, low-data plans could be a huge money saver for the right use case. While Verizon-backed carriers like Visible Wireless outperform its benefits, data, and overall coverage, Tello's plan customization, flexibility, and pricing make it one of the most cost-effective MVNOs on the market.\n\nWe've been surprised by how well Tello has served us during our testing, especially as we tend to use more data while out in New York City. We expected to hit data deprioritization quickly by using video calls and social media and figured a service that costs as little as Tello's couldn't be all that effective.\n\nIn reality, we were adequately served by Tello's coverage and speeds, which are deprioritized behind the higher-paying customers on T-Mobile's network. However, using the service gave us pause in moments when we might usually reach for a phone. Lower data limits can be cumbersome, but there's undoubtedly some benefit to being able to disconnect from your device and be more present in the moment, even if it's simply so that you don't meet your data cap. And texts and calls work perfectly well, so the basics are covered in a pinch even if you do hit your data max.\n\nTello's plans can be as cheap as $5/month; even the highest-cost plan for \"unlimited\" data is just $25/month. However, the latter isn't typically the best deal for an unlimited plan (though it currently features a discounted $15/month rate for the first three months), as your high-speed allotment is capped at 35GB and subject to deprioritization at any time. In contrast, the Visible Wireless base plan offers truly unlimited data (also subject to deprioritization) for $25/month, and the Unlimited Starter plan on US Mobile offers 35GB of prioritized data for $25/month through its Verizon-backed network.\n\nHowever, the cost and customization options make Tello's Build Your Own plan one of the best cell phone plans for its remarkable budget value. It's a potential steal for those who don't use much data each month and don't want to pay for anything more than they use.\n\nTello's Economy and Value plans are both less than $15/month, and while their data allowances are 2GB and 5GB, respectively, both include unlimited talk and text. For many users, that data will run out quickly. But if you're someone who's most often connected via WiFi, if you don't use your phone much at all, if you're traveling to the US and need a phone for the duration of your stay, or if you're a student who's paying for their own phone plan for the first time, these plans could be a perfect fit.\n\nUltimately, Tello is a carrier we'd primarily recommend to limited-data users. Data hogs, video streamers, and those frequently traveling internationally from the US need not apply.\n\nFAQs\n\nWho owns Tello Mobile?\n\nTello Mobile is owned by the international telecommunications company KeepCalling.\n\nWhich network does Tello Mobile use?\n\nTello operates using T-Mobile's cellular network in the US, meaning its coverage area is the same as that of T-Mobile. However, in congested locations, T-Mobile users will be prioritized for data speed over Tello users.\n\nDeprioritization occurs with any MVNO (unless the carrier explicitly offers prioritized data for a higher price), as it's typically part of the deal with using a larger carrier's cell towers while keeping prices low for customers.",

Total service revenues rose 6% year over year to $16.9 billion for the fourth quarter and 5% year over year to $66.2 billion for fiscal 2024 as a whole.\n\nThe company added a record net 903,000 postpaid phone customers, Mike Sievert, president and CEO, said on the fourth quarter earnings call last week. The company also reported its lowest ever total postpaid churn.\n\nMore than 50 million people downloaded the T-Life app in 2024, topping the network provider\u2019s goal of 40 million, according to Sievert.

The company also spent a portion of 2024 pushing existing Samsung Messages users over to Google Messages.\n\nNow, though, it seems the company has had a change of heart.\n\nOn the Galaxy S25 series, the Samsung Messages app supports RCS. We\u2019ve been able to test this, as pictured below, via an unlocked Galaxy S25 Ultra running on T-Mobile\u2019s network, with messages immediately being sent via RCS to our Verizon test number. T-Mobile switched to relying on Google\u2019s services for RCS in 2023. Jeff Springer of SammyGurus spotted the same on his unlocked Galaxy S25 Ultra running on Verizon\u2019s network, and noted a pop-up that confirms this is using Google\u2019s implementation of RCS rather than a carrier.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nSamsung Messages shut down RCS messaging last month for some US carriers.\n\nThis is very surprising given Samsung\u2019s clear move away from its own Messages app. Samsung Messages is not pre-loaded on the Galaxy S25 series, and is instead only available for download via the Galaxy Store.\n\nFurther adding to the confusion, Samsung issued a statement to Android Authority in January around the prioritization of Google Messages, and directly highlighted Google\u2019s app in an ad campaign last year.\n\nWith the close collaboration between Google and Samsung, we have opted to migrate all services to Google Messages and are sunsetting Samsung Messages. It\u2019s no longer available in the PlayStore; however, those who chose to utilize Samsung Messages are still able to do so. We believe that the added functionality of RCS messaging on Google Messages creates an enhanced user experience for both Android-to-Android messaging and across platforms.\n\nFor those who prefer Samsung Messages to Google\u2019s offering, this is certainly great news. But it remains a confusing change to the trend we\u2019ve been seeing for the past few years.\n\nMore on RCS:\n\nFollow Ben: Twitter/X, Threads, Bluesky, and Instagram",

Now, the iPhone is set to receive yet another significant satellite-based feature.\n\nMark Gurman for Bloomberg News:\n\n\u200e\n\nWith the new iOS 18.3 update, Apple will begin supporting third-party satellite networks that are managed by cellular carriers. That will get underway in the US with T-Mobile US Inc.\u2019s rollout of SpaceX\u2019s Starlink service.

Though the Starlink service is just offered by T-Mobile, AT&T Inc. has been working with AST SpaceMobile Inc. on its own satellite offering.

The company is determined to change its damaged reputation and has provided major aid through its satellite communication service, which was launched in Los Angeles during the wildfires. But it has again raised eyeballs for its attempts to keep a two-page letter private that could expose the company's exploitation of minority-owned third-party retailer stores.\n\nT-Mobile is reportedly trying to keep away a letter that contains some damaging information against the company\n\nWhile T-Mobile is not new to controversies, much has been said about the company's sales practices, wherein many employees quit because the company's changing values did not align with their morals. Now, T-Mobile is said to be attempting to conceal a two-page letter in an ongoing lawsuit that has the company accused of collaborating with Arch Telecom, one of the third-largest authorized retailers, to shut down minority-owned T-Mobile stores without compensation via PhoneArena.\n\nThe letter is said to be from T-Mobile's Senior Director for Authorized Retailers, Codey Welker, to Arch Telecom. It is dated August 4, 2022, and has information that could significantly damage T-Mobile's defense in the ongoing lawsuit, which is why the company is trying to hide non-confidential information from the public about the store closures. While the company is attempting to keep the letter away from sight, plaintiffs are arguing that it is, in fact, a piece of key evidence in the case, and the company is trying to conceal public and unclassified details about the store closures.\n\nThe case is titled 170 East v. T-Mobile (Case No. 610050-23) and is currently being heard in New York State Supreme Nassau County. The plaintiffs are said to be the third-party T-Mobile stores focused on catering to small communities. As per the documents submitted in the court, Arch Telecom director is said to be acting on behalf of T-Mobile, gave the minority store owners two options to choose from:\n\nThe option of either giving the store to Arch Telecom or simply being forced to close.\n\nT-Mobile is also said to have misguided the store owners and had them undergo renovation by not telling them about the sub-dealer program coming to an end. Arch Telecom then provided the plaintiffs with a store closure date, leaving little choice for the owners of the minority stores, who then felt pressured to sell them off to Arch at a lower price. It is yet to be seen how the case develops, but companies should be vigilant about being involved in such controversies that can heavily impact brand image.",

Learn more\n\nThe best family cell phone plans help groups manage data usage and payments for several lines under a single account. If your family (or group of friends) wants to stick to a major carrier, a family plan is also a convenient way to reduce monthly bills.\n\nOverall, Verizon's myPlan is the top option among the best family cell phone plans in our testing. It lets you add varying plans that fit individual needs under one account, and Verizon has the most extensive nationwide coverage. On the opposite end of the budget spectrum, Tello Mobile's Build Your Own Plan is a worthwhile option with customizable limited-data plans that start at an astonishing $5/month.\n\nOur top picks for the best family cell phone plans\n\nBest overall: Verizon myPlan - See at Verizon\n\nBest value from a major carrier: T-Mobile Essentials Plan - See at T-Mobile\n\nBest budget: Mint Mobile 15GB Plans - See at Mint Mobile\n\nBest true budget: Tello Mobile Build Your Own Plan - See at Tello Mobile\n\nBest overall\n\nVerizon myPlan Thanks to significant multi-line discounts, Verizon's unlimited myPlan options constitute our top pick for families, especially for larger groups of four or more.

This feature means the account won't be hamstrung by any user's needs, which gives families the potential to pay less if any user has demanding needs.\n\nFor example, one user who needs a lot of mobile hot spot data can opt for Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan, while another user with basic needs can run on the less expensive Unlimited Welcome plan.\n\nHere's a price breakdown using a four-line account with varying plans as an example (including auto-pay discounts):\n\nLine 1: Unlimited Ultimate for $55/month\n\nUnlimited Ultimate for $55/month Line 2: Unlimited Plus for $45/month\n\nUnlimited Plus for $45/month Lines 3: Unlimited Welcome for $30/month\n\nUnlimited Welcome for $30/month Line 4: Unlimited Welcome for $30/month\n\nUnlimited Welcome for $30/month Total: $160/month before taxes and fees.\n\nNote that you'll save more by adding additional friends or family to your plan, as the cost per line is higher with fewer lines.\n\nVerizon's myPlan offers the best combination of coverage, intra-account plan flexibility, and perks for a family plan from a major carrier. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nEven if all the lines in an account run on the same plan, we favor Verizon as a premium carrier option due to its extensive coverage and excellent perks, like streaming service discounts. Indeed, our top overall pick for the best cell phone plan is Verizon's Unlimited Plus plan for its generous unlimited amount of premium data unaffected by network congestion.\n\nWhile multi-line discounts can considerably reduce a monthly bill, Verizon is still among the more expensive options. If Verizon is pricier than your budget allows, we recommend more value-forward options below.\n\nBest value from a major carrier\n\nT-Mobile Essentials Plan T-Mobile\u2019s Essentials plan is the most affordable premium plan among the major carriers. It\u2019s a downright bargain with four or five lines on a single plan and includes 50GB of premium monthly data per line before T-Mobile slows down your data speeds. Just note that Essentials users may experience slower speeds than higher-paying T-Mobile customers during network congestion. Check price at T-Mobile What we like Check mark icon A check mark.

Data speeds are slower than pricier plans during congestion\n\ncon icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'. 3G mobile hotspot speeds are limiting\n\nThe family plan with the best value among major carriers is undoubtedly T-Mobile's Essentials plan. It offers a generous 50GB of premium data per line for a price other major carriers can't match. It's especially tempting for accounts with three lines or more, as T-Mobile periodically runs promotions, like a third line for free or a four-line offer for outstanding value.\n\nBelow is a pricing breakdown of T-Mobile's Essentials plan on a per-line basis, starting with at least two lines, including T-Mobile's auto-pay and Essentials Saver or other current discounts for the lowest prices:\n\n2 lines: $80/month ($40/line)\n\n$80/month ($40/line) 3 lines: $90/month ($30/line)\n\n$90/month ($30/line) 4 lines: $100/month ($25/line)\n\n$100/month ($25/line) 5 lines: $120/month ($24/line)\n\nT-Mobile's urban coverage and multi-line pricing are exceptional. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nWhile T-Mobile's coverage is competitive with or even superior to Verizon in cities, towns, and highways, its coverage drops quickly further away from populated areas, as T-Mobile's rural coverage is lacking compared to other major carriers. You should check that T-Mobile adequately covers your family through the network's coverage map and anecdotal experience from local friends, neighbors, or online forums.\n\nEven if T-Mobile's value is tempting, the savings are not worth it if the network doesn't cover the areas you frequent well enough. If T-Mobile does cover you, but your family can get by with relatively limited or deprioritized data, there are also a few worthwhile budget carriers backed by T-Mobile that we recommend below.\n\nBest budget\n\nMint Mobile 15GB Plans Mint Mobile's 15GB data plans can be all you need if you don't usually use more than 15GB of monthly data and if T-Mobile's coverage works for you. The 12-month package offers the best value, but unfortunately, it locks you in for a year. However, new customers can try the carrier for three months at low rates, starting at $15/month. Check price at Mint Mobile What we like Check mark icon A check mark. It indicates a confirmation of your intended interaction.

No multi-line discounts\n\nIt's hard to beat T-Mobile's Essentials plan for value in a family plan with multiple lines, at least if several lines require unlimited data. However, Mint Mobile allows you to spend less under certain circumstances.\n\nMint Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) owned by T-Mobile that piggybacks on T-Mobile's infrastructure and network. It offers the same coverage area as T-Mobile, with data subject to deprioritization behind the higher-paying customers of its parent company.\n\nMint Mobile's Modern Family Plan allows you to select and manage varying plans within an account but doesn't offer multi-line discounts like major carriers. Still, you can spend significantly less than T-Mobile at certain data tiers. For a comprehensive comparison, see our guide to Mint Mobile vs. T-Mobile.\n\nMint Mobile's Modern Family Plan can offer significant savings for several lines with limited data. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nFor smaller families of two, Mint Mobile offers unlimited data for $30/month on each line (or $25/month with a limited-time discount) compared to T-Mobile's Essentials Saver price of $40/month each. Families of two can save even more with Mint Mobile's 20GB, 15GB, or 5GB plans.\n\nFor families of three to five, you'll need to pick limited data plans to see any real savings over T-Mobile's Essentials. Namely, Mint Mobile's 15GB tier offers the best value and makes the most sense on average, but you can get decent savings with an even mix of its limited data plans.\n\nNotably, Mint Mobile's lowest prices come with its 12-month plans. A prepaid annual plan is inflexible compared to T-Mobile's offerings, which are paid monthly and let you change carriers with no early termination fees if the service doesn't work out for you.\n\nHowever, Mint Mobile has an exceptional introductory promotion for new customers, which constitutes our top pick among the best cheap cell phone plans; it offers the carrier's three-month plans at discounted rates, starting at $15/month.\n\nBeyond its savings, Mint Mobile has an excellent app and website for easily managing your account and lines or seeking customer support. It stands out among the supporting platforms of other carriers for its user-friendliness.\n\nRead our full Mint Mobile review.\n\nBest true budget\n\nTello Mobile (Build Your Own Plan) Backed by T-Mobile's network, Tello's unique Build Your Own plan allows you to customize your data and voice minutes to your specific needs and offers a low base price of $5/month.

Not ideal for high-data users\n\nTello Mobile, another MVNO on T-Mobile's network, lets you manage up to four exceptionally inexpensive lines under a single account.\n\nAs we note in our Mint Mobile vs. Tello guide, Tello's low minimum costs make it an even better \"true budget\" option than Mint Mobile for the least expensive access to T-Mobile's network.\n\nTello's Build Your Own Plan lets each line in a family plan pay for what it needs and ditch what it doesn't, which can lead to outrageously low monthly bills as low as $5/month for a line.\n\nTello is the cheapest worthwhile option for group or individual cell service. Eve Montie/Business Insider\n\nFor example, if you don't talk on the phone much but use a decent amount of data, you can opt for a plan with 100 voice minutes and unlimited data for $25/month. That's the lowest price for unlimited data in this guide. Each family member can also fine-tune their own line for data based on their anticipated usage.\n\nTello's Build Your Own Plan can also be a good option for families with younger kids, as data limits could be used in addition to on-device parental controls to limit online activity.\n\nRead our full Tello Mobile review.\n\nHow we test family cell phone plans\n\nIn addition to the standardized testing we implement to select the best cell phone plans overall, our testing procedure for family plans involves examining each carrier's best features for multi-line groups and then breaking down options by their suitability for family use and value.\n\nWe also assess family-centric carrier options based on long-term and varied personal experiences from our staff, including the author and others, for plan management, customer service, and overall value.\n\nWhat to look for in a family cell phone plan\n\nCoverage is the one constant feature you need to look for in a family cell phone plan. An otherwise perfect plan for you and your family won't make sense if its backing carrier doesn't adequately service your area and the places you visit often. It won't matter that you're saving money if you can't use data or make reliable phone calls due to limited coverage.\n\nBeyond that, the best family cell phone plan offers the data you need while fitting your budget. Major carriers tend to lower monthly costs when adding more lines to a single account. Sometimes, those multi-line savings can be so good that you'd consider a major carrier when you hadn't before.\n\nBudget-oriented MVNOs typically do not lower the monthly cost for multiple lines in an account. However, their single-line prices are often already the equivalent of or a better value than major carriers' multi-line deals.\n\nAnother important aspect is the ability to individually manage each line on the account, whether through a website or mobile app. Luckily, nearly every carrier offers account management per line, but the ease of use of carriers' supporting platforms varies widely.",

Speaking in Etobicoke, Ford accused Musk of being part of a team that aims to \"destroy families, incomes, destroy businesses.\"\n\nOntario\u2019s procurement budget totals $30 billion annually, and Ford stated that American companies will be blocked from receiving government contracts until the tariffs are repealed. \"U.S.-based businesses will now lose out on tens of billions of dollars in new revenues. They only have President Trump to blame,\" Ford said.\n\nAccording to CBC, Ford has faced previous criticism over the Starlink contract, with Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie calling for its cancellation last week. Crombie argued the province should have prioritized Canadian providers from the start. Opposition leaders, including NDP Leader Marit Stiles and Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, also welcomed the decision, though they questioned why the contract was awarded to Musk's company in the first place.\n\nAlso Read: Mexico ETF Faces Volatility Despite Temporary Tariff Reprieve\n\nWhy It Matters: Ontario's decision to retaliate against the U.S. tariffs with procurement restrictions signals a deepening trade rift between Canada and its largest trading partner. The move could have major financial implications for American businesses that rely on provincial contracts, CBC reports.\n\nMusk responded with \"Oh well\" on X, the platform he owns.\n\nWhile Ford defended the original contract by stating that only two providers, Starlink and Xplore Inc., met Ontario's technical requirements, he now says a Canadian alternative must be pursued. He insisted the province has not paid Starlink anything yet and suggested legal action may be unnecessary to exit the deal.\n\nThe controversy comes as Starlink expands its footprint in Canada, now serving approximately 400,000 subscribers. Meanwhile, the satellite provider is also making headlines in the U.S. after teaming up with Apple Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. to introduce Starlink-powered texting on iPhones, initially in a limited beta test.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage created using photos from Shutterstock.",

The judges scored the bout 115-111, 115-111, and 118-108 in favor of Benavidez, who added the WBA (Regular) light heavyweight title to his WBC interim belt.\n\nThe event drew an announced attendance of 12,109 at T-Mobile arena.\n\nThat attendance was the biggest of Benavidez\u2019s career. The Phoenix-born 28-year old calls Vegas his fighting home.\n\n\u201cI am a Las Vegas fighter,\u201d he told LVSportsBiz.com earlier in the week.\n\nHe made it clear at the post-fight press conference that his future remains stateside, specifically in Nevada, despite growing Saudi interest in his career. Check the LVSportsBiz.com interview with Benavidez.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, my fan base is here in Las Vegas. \u201cI would love to go over there and fight, but this is my market right here. We just sold out T-Mobile Arena, my dream come true. I wanna take it back to this market \u2018cause I\u2019ve worked elevan years. This is my first time having a freaking crowd like this. I want to stay here.\u201d\n\nHis comments came in response to increasing speculation about his involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s growing influence in boxing.\n\nTurki Alalshikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Entertainment Authority and a major force behind the Kingdom\u2019s high-profile boxing events, has been openly assembling a wish list of top-tier fighters for 2025.\n\nHowever, Benavidez was notably absent from Alalshikh\u2019s initial poster of names.\n\nWhen asked by LVSportsBiz.com about being left off the list, Benavidez didn\u2019t express concern, though Alalshikh did extend an olive branch after the fight. Alalshikh\u2019s digital boxing publication, The Ring, reported that he wants to match the winner of the Artur Beterbiev vs. Dmitry Bivol rematch with the Benavidez-Morrell winner.\n\nWe just sold out T-Mobile Arena, my dream come true. \u2014 David Benavidez\n\nAs a result, Alalshikh invited Benavidez to be ringside for Bivol vs. Beterbiev on February 22 in Saudi Arabia, setting the stage for a potential undisputed light heavyweight showdown.\n\nBenavidez\u2019s marketing future remains a hot topic. He\u2019s young, in his prime, has a huge Mexican and U.S. fan base. All could make him a priority for future U.S. mega-events, particularly in venues like T-Mobile Arena or neighboring MGM Grand Garden Arena. However, the lure of massive paydays in Saudi Arabia will likely continue to be part of the conversation.\n\nFor now, Benavidez remains focused on his next move. With his name firmly in the mix for a potential undisputed title fight, the decision on whether to take his talents abroad or continue to build his legacy in Las Vegas could shape the next phase of his career.",

My heart goes out to Mr. Foster's family as they navigate this profound and unbearable loss.\u201d\n\nThen on Friday, January 31, Arthur McCaden learned his fate for killing a store employee in Canton.\n\nFabian Sanchez Gonzalez, 23, was shot to death during an April 2023 attempted robbery at the T-Mobile on Boston Street.\n\nMcCaden, now 19, and his younger brother were alsoconnected to several other robberies that month spanning from Baltimore to New Jersey.\n\nWhile McCaden pleaded guilty to Gonzalez's murder, his brother's case was tried at the juvenile level, leaving his status unclear.\n\nMcCaden's dad is serving life in prison as well for an unrelated deadly quintuple shooting in 2021.",

From a surprising partnership with SpaceX and T-Mobile to bring Starlink satellite texting to iPhones, to CEO Tim Cook\u2019s praise for China\u2019s DeepSeek, the tech giant has been making headlines. Amidst these developments, Apple also navigated tariff concerns, delivered better-than-expected results, and released an urgent security fix for iOS. Let\u2019s dive into the details.\n\nApple Teams Up with SpaceX and T-Mobile for Starlink Satellite Texting\n\nIn an unexpected move, Apple has collaborated with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to integrate Starlink satellite texting capabilities into iPhones. The new feature is part of the latest iPhone software update, iOS 18.3, and T-Mobile has initiated a limited beta test for some iPhone users to experience the Starlink service. Read the full article here.\n\nTim Cook Lauds China\u2019s DeepSeek\n\nDuring Apple\u2019s first-quarter earnings call, CEO Cook praised DeepSeek, a China-based AI startup. The conversation revolved around the perception that Cupertino is benefiting from lower compute costs and how changes in the cost landscape could impact Apple\u2019s margins. Read the full article here.\n\nApple\u2019s Stance on Trump\u2019s Tariff Policies\n\nIn the same earnings call, Cook was questioned about the potential impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies on Apple. Cook remained tight-lipped, stating, \"We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that.\" This comes as Apple navigates a complex global market, where tariffs could significantly impact its supply chain and pricing strategies. Read the full article here.\n\nApple\u2019s Better-Than-Expected Results\n\nApple delivered better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, with revenue of $124.3 billion, slightly exceeding analyst estimates.

(L.E. Baskow/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @Left_Eye_Images\n\nDavid Benavidez and his team celebrate their win over David Morrell Jr. after 12 rounds of their WBC and WBA title fight at the T-Mobile Arena on Thursday, Jan. 30, 2025, in Las Vegas. (L.E. Baskow/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @Left_Eye_Images\n\nDavid Benavidez knows no matter how many titles he collects, one of the first questions after each of his victories is going to be about another star boxer.\n\nThe news conference following his unanimous-decision victory over previously-unbeaten David Morrell at T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night was no exception.\n\nSo, will Benavidez finally get the fight against Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez that he has been chasing for years?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Benavidez said. \u201cYou guys keep asking me about that fight and I know as much as you guys do. I would love that fight. I\u2019d love to fight Canelo. It would be a massive, massive fight. But he says he has other things and that I\u2019m being too mean in the way I approach him, so I guess I have to work on my attitude.\u201d\n\nThe 28-year-old Benavidez (30-0) has long claimed Alvarez simply won\u2019t accept the challenge. Benavidez, a Las Vegas resident, said last week on a podcast the most recent offer to Alvarez was $70 million plus a share of the back end on pay-per-view sales.\n\nIt has yet to be accepted, which is enough in Benavidez\u2019s mind to convince him the fight won\u2019t happen. He\u2019ll likely have to come up with a different plan instead.\n\nThat probably means facing the winner of the Feb. 22 rematch between Dmitry Bivol and Artur Beterbiev to unify all the light heavyweight belts.\n\nBenavidez indicated he may accept an invitation to attend the fight in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to go,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now I just want a break because I\u2019ve been training four and a half months preparing for this fight. But I\u2019d love to go over there and I\u2019d love to fight either of those guys. It\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. I feel like every fight I take is going to be the hardest fight until the next one and that\u2019s how it should be because we should be going up in competition and taking on the best of the best. If you look at my track record, I have a really good resume. Every fighter has been better than the previous one. I\u2019m happy I get to show what level I\u2019m on and continue to progress in my career.\u201d\n\nWhile Benavidez said he wouldn\u2019t mind the trip to Saudi Arabia, he was far less enthusiastic about the prospect of fighting there.\n\nBenavidez said he\u2019s been working to build his fan base his entire career. He was rewarded Saturday in his adopted hometown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Las Vegas fighter and my fan base is here,\u201d Benavidez said. \u201cI would love to go over there and fight, but this is my market and I feel like we\u2019re doing really well. It\u2019s a dream come true to me and I want to take advantage of this market because I\u2019ve worked 11 years for this and that\u2019s my first time having a crowd like that, so I want to stay here. And I think the fight would be even bigger here, to be honest.\u201d\n\nBenavidez feels he rewarded those fans with a good show Saturday, even beyond just the action-packed battle against Morrell.\n\nHe helped contribute to an intriguing, yet somewhat contrived, buildup to the fight with some explosive news conference moments. But he also talked some trash in the ring, taunted Morrell a bit and even spoke into the camera between rounds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having fun in these fights and this is really my passion,\u201d Benavidez said. \u201cI\u2019ve evolved not only as a fighter, but I\u2019ve been able to speak better through the years. I\u2019m just having fun with this and becoming my own character. I feel like I\u2019m going to be the face of boxing soon and I can really take over the sport, especially with performances like this.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t run from anybody. We\u2019re going toe-to-toe the whole fight. I give the people what they want to see.\u201d\n\nUnless they want to see him fight Alvarez. That doesn\u2019t appear likely. So Benavidez said he\u2019s going to keep it simple.\n\n\u201cI think I showed what level I\u2019m on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to keep putting on great fights, calling out the best fighters and taking them on in big arenas like this.\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m made for.\u201d\n\nContact Adam Hill at ahill@reviewjournal.com.

Also, AST SpaceMobiles had previously said it would need between 45 to 60 satellites to provide continuous service, and it's a long way off from that target at the moment.and SpaceX were granted the STA in November and their beta program has only now kicked off. According tousers, there are holes in the service, but when it works, it works well.andhaven't shared a timeline for the launch of the satellite service, but another AST SpaceMobile partner might serve as a proxy.AST SpaceMobile has teamed up with many carriers around the world, including the UK's Vodafone, which just this week made a video call using BlueBird satellites .

This groundbreaking move, celebrated as part of the collaboration between T-Mobile, SpaceX, and Apple, promises to change how users communicate, particularly when standard cellular networks falter.\n\nBack in December, T-Mobile announced its partnership with SpaceX, indicating plans to leverage Starlink's satellite technology. Just recently, T-Mobile began inviting select customers to participate in the beta testing program, initially limited to specific Samsung devices. Following the release of Apple\u2019s iOS 18.3, this program expanded to include iPhones, and now, reports indicate access for certain Google Pixel devices as well.\n\n\"Apple just opened iPhone doors to Starlink\u2019s satellite network, giving users an alternative to their Globalstar service for off-grid communication,\" noted Mario Nawfal, founder of IBC Group, highlighting the significance of this development. Users with compatible devices can expect to receive specific notifications\u2014T-Mobile sends messages stating, \"You\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere.\"\n\nFor those curious about participating, compatibility is key. Samsung users can register if they own models such as the Galaxy S24 series, or the newest Google Pixel devices. Importantly, all iPhones compatible with iOS 18.3 are eligible. Interested customers are encouraged to visit T-Mobile\u2019s Starlink webpage, where they can register by providing their personal details. The program continues to grow, with T-Mobile committed to widening access and accepting more users soon.\n\nDespite the exciting premise, users should note the current limitations. At this stage, T-Mobile's beta testing focuses solely on text messaging\u2014meaning no voice calls or data services are available yet. Elon Musk emphasized the future potential of Starlink services, tweeting, \"Medium resolution images, music & audio podcasts should work with the current generation Starlink direct-to-phone constellation.\" While these exciting features are on the horizon, users will have to rely on basic SMS functionality for now. This feature stands to be particularly beneficial for those who find themselves without cell service or Wi-Fi, allowing them to reach out via text when it matters most.\n\nThis isn't T-Mobile\u2019s first foray with satellite technology. Apple has offered satellite connectivity since 2022 with its Emergency SOS feature integrated with the iPhone 14. This service allowed users access to emergency services when no cell network is available. The current collaboration, though, expands capabilities by leveraging Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink. Unlike Apple\u2019s previous technology, which required users to point their phones to the sky for connection, Starlink's approach aims to allow users to connect to satellites automatically\u2014simply by being outside with no other network available.\n\n\"If you have T-Mobile, and either an iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, or Google Pixel device, you now have access to Starlink\u2014potentially,\" shared Tom's Guide, reinforcing the growing sense of excitement surrounding satellite connectivity. Notably, though the service currently only allows for text messaging, the potential for expansive communication options\u2014particularly during emergencies\u2014marks this project as both practical and urgent.\n\nThe future of mobile communications may be forever changed with this technology. Not only does it promise reliable contact during crises, but it also showcases the impressive synergy between technology giants like T-Mobile, SpaceX, and Apple, continually pushing the boundaries of connectivity.\n\nTelecommunications history has witnessed many shifts, but T-Mobile\u2019s Starlink beta extension could be one of the most influential yet. Consider this: how many times have you found yourself outside of service and unable to reach loved ones or emergency services? This innovation aims to bridge those gaps, providing safety and accessibility when it\u2019s most needed. By fusing smartphone capabilities with satellite technology, T-Mobile is set to not only revamp how we stay connected but also redefine what connectivity means for the future.",

Azcentral Sports\n\nDavid Benavidez might have danced the Ali Shuffle in the ring a little too soon, as he was knocked down in the 11th round by David Morrell.\n\nBut Morrell, already far behind on the scorecards, took a shot at Benavidez after the bell to end the round and was deducted a point, canceling out his knockdown. It was only the second time Benavidez had ever been knocked down in 30 fights.\n\nBenavidez was just too powerful, even though Morrell took the fight the full 12 rounds. The Phoenix native earned a unanimous decision and took Morrell's WBA light heavyweight title belt.\n\n\"I was prepared for everything,\" Benavidez said in the ring. \"I thought it'd be harder.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy, but Benavidez did what he does so well: He walked down his opponent and bludgeoned Morrell with body shots and assorted uppercuts. Morrell had an answer early for the punches but was eventually worn down and unable to respond enough to make it a closer fight.\n\nMorrell (11-1) won't get a rematch right away. Benavidez (30-0) remains the WBC interim light heavyweight champ and has the WBA belt, so he has a path to a title fight awaiting him. The winner of Artur Beterbiev vs. Dmitry Bivol for Beterbiev's four light heavyweight belts might be next for Benavidez in a potential bout for the undisputed crown.\n\nShould that fight not be made, Benavidez's stated Plan B is a fight against Gilberto \"Zurdo\" Ramirez for his cruiserweight title. An all-Mexican war between those two could be a big draw later this year.\n\nBenavidez continues to silence his detractors. He's not very flashy but he finds motivation against every opponent and takes it out on them in the ring. His defense was on display as well on Saturday, as many Morrell punches were blocked.\n\nDavid Benavidez attempted to avoid the prefight gloves bump with David Morrell, illustrating the bad blood between the two.\n\nThat was just the start of an entertaining fight between two skilled light heavyweights, and the crowd in Las Vegas thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nWhen Benavidez connected with fast combinations, Morrell had an answer. He also showboated in the ring, while Benavidez, intent on breaking his opponent's face (as he proclaimed), took the fight to Morrell and backed him up.\n\nThe fourth round saw both fighters take hard shots in the same exchange. The crowd was on its feet in appreciation as the fight moved toward the middle rounds.\n\nBenavidez appeared to have landed more shots that had more of an impact through five rounds. But Morrell succeeded in moving Benavidez against the ropes.\n\nIt wasn't going to be easy to follow the kind of effort Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz and Angel Fierro gave to the thousands at T-Mobile Arena and many more on pay-per-view. Stephen Fulton and Brandon Figueroa didn't deliver the fireworks from the previous fight, but Fulton was in control enough to take Figueroa's WBC featherweight title.\n\nFulton, in denim boxing trunks and Timberland-style boots, outclassed Figueroa in a fight that drew boos and jeers from the crowd several times for its lack of action. Fulton won a unanimous decision and improved to 23-1.\n\n\"I feel like he kind of slowed down when he went up to 126 pounds,\" Fulton said of Figueroa.\n\nFulton was the craftier fighter who didn't overpower Figueroa but he kept him off balance often. Figueroa's two career losses are to Fulton.\n\nWith a WBC special belt on the line called the Aztec Warrior belt, two hard-charging Mexican bombers might have stolen the show two fights before the main event.\n\nBoxing fans love Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz because he never stops coming forward to throw and sometimes take punches. His opponent, Angel Fierro, was just as willing to trade blows, and the crowd inside T-Mobile Arena was on its feet from the start of the fight.\n\nIt wasn't a bloodbath, but it was a slugfest. Cruz, coming off the loss of his junior welterweight title belt, rocked Fierro with numerous body shots but Fierro took them. In the end, both ended the fight on their feet with Cruz the winner via unanimous decision.\n\nFierro landed his own shots to Cruz, who made himself susceptible to punches because he was so dead set on being aggressive. Fierro landed more shots against Cruz than any opponent ever has.\n\nBy the end of the eighth round, the two fighters had combined to throw more than 1,000 punches.\n\nStrategy was thrown out the window, and somewhere from up above, the late Arturo Gatti, once labeled \"the ultimate blood and guts warrior,\" must have loved what he was watching.\n\nHow both fighters refused to go down made their efforts even more impressive.\n\nCruz lost his advantage as the fight wore on. He appeared to get tired in the second half of the fight while Fierro raised his punch count. But Cruz came away with the meaningful belt in a fight that no one really lost -- and the fans won.\n\nCruz shared his belt with Fierro in a classy gesture, and tipped his hat to him. Fierro said he hopes Cruz gives him a rematch.\n\nCasa Grande's Jes\u00fas \"Mono\" Ramos worked the body for round after round, and it paid off in a win over Jeison Rosario in the first fight of the David Benavidez-David Morrell Jr. main card Saturday in Las Vegas.\n\nFighting up at middleweight for perhaps just one time before an expected move back to super welterweight, Ramos looked calm and measured in landing shot after shot and breaking down Rosario. With the crowd chanting \"Mono! Mono!\" Ramos picked his spots effectively and was barely hurt.\n\nIn between the sixth and seventh rounds, Morrell walked into T-Mobile Arena to little reaction from the crowd in the building.\n\nRamos (22-1-0) spoke of having to make a statement in this fight, and did so with a knockdown with about 30 seconds left in the seventh round.\n\nIt came from two hooks to the head of Rosario. Then a four-punch combination from body to head led to the fight being stopped in the eighth, Ramos landing 164 power shots to 40 for Rosario.\n\nRamos continued his return ascent to major contender status after his first loss three fights ago.\n\n\"I was hoping to get a knockout instead of a TKO, but anything works,\" Ramos said on the broadcast. \"I want to go back to 154 and fight the best in the 154-pound division.\"\n\nArgentina's Mirco Cuello knocked down Christian Olivo twice in the 10th and final round, rallying for a TKO after being knocked down in the second round.\n\nCuello (15-0) landed a pair of body shots that forced Olivo down on one knee, and the referee stopped the fight before the final bell. Olivo was stunned with the decision; the featherweight was a big underdog who led on all three judges' scorecards going into the final round.\n\nThe main card gets under way around 6 p.m. MST. Details on how to watch and more are below.\n\nPhoenix boxing and the state of Arizona is in the win column on Saturday, hours before David Benavidez faces David Morrell Jr. in a main event at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nPhoenix-reared Jose Benavidez Jr., 32, won via technical knockout over Danny Rosenberger, a fifth-round stoppage for his first win since August 2023. Once a promising prospect and contender in the welterweight division, Benavidez's career took a turn after a gunshot wound years ago, but he hasn't let it end his career.\n\nBenavidez (29-3-1), the older brother of David Benavidez, fighting at middleweight, put the fight away in the fifth round, walking down Rosenberger with combinations and jabs. A powerful left hand rocked Rosenberger and brought the fight stoppage, with Benavidez winning every round.\n\nWhile Rosenberger (20-10-4) isn't a high-caliber opponent based on his previous fights, Benavidez's losses have come to stars in the sport; Terence Crawford, Jermall Charlo and Danny Garcia.\n\nTwo more Arizonans to come. First, Casa Grande's Jes\u00fas Ramos as part of the main card, then later tonight, David Benavidez.\n\nThe four-fight main card, headlined by David Benavidez vs. David Morrell Jr., can be purchased through Prime Video pay-per-view. Casa Grande, Arizona's Jes\u00fas Ramos faces Jeison Rosario in the lead-up to the main event. Two preliminary fights will stream on Prime Video for free ahead of the pay-per-view (no membership needed), and Phoenix-raised Jos\u00e9 Benavidez Jr., older brother of David, returns to the ring for the first time in 14 months in a non-televised bout.\n\nThe fight can also be purchased via DISH Network, and PPV.com, which does not require a subscription.

            "content": "Friday, January 31, 2025\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS), as well as a micro-cap stock The Eastern Co. (EML). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market open and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\n\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> December PCE Steady with Expectations; Plenty of Mixed Q4 Earnings\n\n\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+96.7% vs. +73.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\n\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partner across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\n\n\nThe Zack\u2019s analyst expect NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 50.5% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the U.S.-China tech war remain major concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-0.5% vs. +1%). The company\u2019s sales in the MedTech segment have slowed down due to headwinds in Asia-Pacific markets like China and competitive pressure in some categories. The launch of Stelara generics is expected to significantly erode the drug\u2019s sales in 2025. The uncertainty around its talc lawsuits remains.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, J&J beat Q4 estimates for earnings and sales. Its Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.\n\n\n\nJ&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and has been on an acquisition spree lately, which has strengthened its pipeline. J&J has also made strong progress toward resolving the talc litigation.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+46.6% vs. +27.6%). The company reported impressive fourth-quarter 2024 results, with both the bottom and top lines surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company is benefiting from solid demand for postpaid services.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, the company added 6.1 million postpaid net customers while postpaid net account additions were 1.1 million, both metrics being the best in the industry. Solid growth in free cash flow accentuates efficient capital management and implies that the company is well-positioned to invest in growth initiatives and pay debt and dividends.\n\n\n\nHowever, owing to the stock\u2019s premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. Fierce competition is straining profitability. A high debt burden remains a concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Eastern have outperformed the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry over the past year (+17% vs. +12.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $171.52 million demonstrates robust revenue growth, with net sales rising 6% year over year to $206.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, fueled by demand for truck mirror assemblies and transport packaging. Its 13% backlog growth highlights strong future sales potential. Gross margins improved to 25.2%.\n\n\n\nPortfolio realignment, including divesting Big 3 Mold, focuses resources on high-growth segments. The \u201cOne Eastern\u201d strategy enhances efficiency, supported by investments in Mexico and China for competitive scalability. Eastern\u2019s 337th consecutive dividend exemplifies financial stability and shareholder focus.\n\n\n\nHowever, challenges include a 54% drop in operating cash flow, rising SG&A expenses, elevated capital intensity, and inventory pressures. Debt increased to $41.5 million with rising leverage, amplifying interest rate risks. Geopolitical challenges further weigh on financial flexibility.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Eastern here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), The Boeing Co. (BA) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC).\n\n\n\nMark Vickery\n\nSenior Editor\n\n\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

This message claims that users can message from \u201cvirtually anywhere\u201d, and the only requirement is that you have the correct hardware and up-to-date software.\n\nThe correct hardware, of course, being satellite-capable hardware \u2014 something that the Pixel 9 does include. It\u2019s unclear what software version is needed to access this feature, though since Android 15 includes satellite support that certainly couldn\u2019t hurt. Not that I imagine there are many Pixel 9 owners that haven\u2019t upgraded to Android 15 already.\n\nSo far it isn\u2019t clear what kind of connectivity will be available to Pixel 9 owners. Elon Musk previously tweeted that the \u201ccurrent generation Starlink direct-to-phone constellation\u201d supports medium resolution images, music & audio podcasts. However T-Mobile\u2019s beta page specifies that the service is currently only available for text messaging \u2014 with voice and data coverage planned for some point in the future. So don\u2019t expect much more than basic SMS-style texting for now.\n\nT-Mobile doesn\u2019t have a definitive list of devices that are eligible for the beta, though it has confirmed that the beta test is free.\n\nDespite this, spaces are apparently limited and will be available to a \u201csmaller number of T-Mobile postpaid customers\u201d with the appropriate phones.

The upside is that it\u2019s not limited to T-Mobile customers, but the downside is that this is an emergency feature \u2014 and can\u2019t be used to text your mom when there\u2019s no cell signal. However Apple\u2019s recent Messages via Satellite feature does let you send non-emergency messages, which is worth bearing in mind as well.\n\nNeither of these features utilize Starlink infrastructure either, if that\u2019s something that matters to you.\n\nIn any case it is a good thing to see that satellite communication is on the upswing, even if it is restricted to the most basic kinds of messaging. These are features that can (and have) saved lives, and the easier they are to access the better.",

PCMag said this week that the program is expanding to iPhones using the iOS 18.3 operating system. That news was confirmed in a story in USA Today and elsewhere.\n\nRegistration for the T-Mobile program began in mid December. At the time, the carrier said the T-Mobile Starlink service would provide coverage of the 500,000 square miles of the United States outside the range of cell towers.\n\nStarlink has more than 300 direct-to-cell-capability satellites in orbit. Earlier versions of the T-Mobile Starlink system were turned on during hurricanes Helene and Milton. First responders are being prioritized during the beta.\n\nStarlink, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, appears to have ambitious plans. In November Starlink partnered with MetTel on an SD-WAN offering. The month before, it began offering connectivity to some Beechcraft and Cessna planes.\n\nIn addition to the Starlink partnership, T-Mobile has been having a good month.

After taking off 2024, T-Mobile and Apple are bringing back the \u201cMLS Season Pass On Us\u201d promotion that gets you the entire MLS season through Apple TV for free.\n\nThis perk first launched to kick off the 2023 season when Apple bought the majority of the TV rights for MLS to show all matches through Apple TV. Buying the MLS Season Pass would normally cost you $99, but T-Mobile was offering it as a freebie for customers in the same way they give customers free MLB TV. It was awesome for soccer fans, but in 2024 they oddly did not offer it again.\n\nWe\u2019ll forgive them for now, as the 2025 season has brought it back. Free MLS Season Pass is yours once again.\n\nTo claim, you\u2019ll head into the T-Life app on February 18, which makes this a part of T-Mobile Tuesdays. It\u2019ll show up as a perk to claim, and I\u2019d imagine there will be a couple of extra steps in order to attach it to your Apple TV account. Yes, you\u2019ll need an Apple TV account and a way to watch Apple TV.\n\nIn the terms, T-Mobile mentions that you\u2019ll need an Apple account with a payment on file in order to claim, and that \u201cUpon the end of the 2025 MLS season, [the] subscription automatically renews for the 2026 MLS season for the then-current annual price.\u201d You will need to make sure to cancel before you get charged.\n\nT-Mobile did say that this freebie is for both T-Mobile and Metro customers. Again, February 18 is the day you\u2019ll first be able to claim. Yes, that means you will miss the first couple of matches from the week prior (on 2/11 and 2/14). However, the bulk of the season really kicks off on the 18th.\n\n// T-Mobile",

A: Peter Osvaldik, CFO, explained that the growth is driven by both customer growth and ARPA (Average Revenue Per Account) growth. The wholesale revenue decline is slowing, and they expect continued deepening of customer relationships to drive ARPA growth. The company delivered over 3% ARPA growth in 2024 and expects similar growth in 2025.\n\nQ: How is T-Mobile addressing the potential slowdown in subscriber growth, and what gives you confidence in your guidance? A: CEO Mike Sievert highlighted that T-Mobile is gaining share across various markets, including top 100 markets, smaller markets, and rural areas. The company is also experiencing strong growth in T-Mobile for Business. The combination of best network, best value, and best experiences is driving this growth, leading to an increased guidance for subscriber additions.\n\nQ: What is the strategy behind the Vistar acquisition, and how does it fit into T-Mobile's advertising ambitions? A: Mike Katz, President of Marketing, Innovation, and Experience, explained that Vistar's technology platform combined with T-Mobile's customer intelligence can transform the out-of-home advertising industry by bringing measurability and impact. This aligns with T-Mobile's ambition to become a leading advertising support service.\n\nQ: How is T-Mobile planning to leverage its fiber and high-speed wireless products in the broadband market? A: CEO Mike Sievert stated that the focus is on taking market share rather than just market growth. T-Mobile has adjusted its pricing to compete for price-sensitive customers while also achieving broadband ARPA growth. The company sees opportunities to deepen ARPU with associated services over time.\n\nQ: What is T-Mobile's approach to wholesale opportunities and managing fixed wireless demand in high-utilization areas? A: Mike Sievert explained that T-Mobile looks for wholesale partners who can target audiences better than T-Mobile's existing brands. The company aims for attractive returns on network capacity. For fixed wireless, T-Mobile uses an algorithm to ensure sectors have excess capacity before approving broadband applicants, avoiding congestion issues.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

Previously, SpaceX\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, confirmed that the beta would be live on January 27. In short, the Starlink cellular beta is now underway. Although T-Mobile currently allows its customers to use satellite texting for free, it seems some customers will have to pay down the line.\n\nT-Mobile wants its customers on low-tier plans to pay for satellite texting\n\nYesterday, folks over at PCMag reported some details about T-Mobile\u2019s plans for the satellite service going forward. During an earnings call, T-Mobile\u2019s president and CEO shared that the company will introduce the satellite service as a paid subscription. It\u2019s worth noting that the smartphone carrier is not planning to charge all of its customers.\n\nThe CEO says that customers on expensive T-Mobile plans won\u2019t have to pay a penny to use the service. However, those subscribed to low-tier plans will have to spend extra to add the service as a paid add-on. Not to mention, switching to an expensive plan would automatically get them to use the feature for free.\n\nT-Mobile customers using last year\u2019s Galaxy S24 series and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 already have this option available on their devices. In fact, Apple has also added the satellite texting feature with the release of iOS 18.3 for select iPhone users.\n\nSupport for voice, data, and video calls will also be coming down the line\n\nNot to forget, T-Mobile is the first US telecom company to offer satellite messaging. But it won\u2019t be the last, as Verizon and AT&T are also working actively to bring a feature to their customers. T-Mobile, on the other hand, is hoping that many customers are looking forward to it, given that the service would keep them communicating even in cellular dead zones. Currently, the Starlink-powered satellite service only supports texting. T-Mobile says that support for video calls, voice, and data will also arrive in the future.",

He expects the it will drive T-Mobile subscribers to select more premium tariffs to access the features.\n\n\u201cThis will be something that our customers on our most value-packed plans will be able to benefit from, and so that\u2019s an area that we\u2019ll monetise,\u201d he explained.\n\nThere is also an opportunity to offer the D2D service a la carte to customers that don\u2019t have the premium tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe see things coming together pretty quickly, so that\u2019s really exciting,\u201d he said.\n\nSievert stated he doesn\u2019t foresee the D2D service being offered in rural areas for home broadband, due in part because Starlink is already providing broadband in some areas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak for them, but they have more demand for their service than capacity right now, and so they can sell everything they have available without any help from us,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cThey are launching a lot, and so those curves may cross at some point, and we\u2019d be delighted to be their partner.\u201d\n\nIt emerged early this week that T-Mobile\u2019s beta test also added support for a limited number of iPhones, after previously only providing compatibility for certain Samsung devices.\n\nQ4 metrics\n\nSievert and his executive team had plenty to brag about during the earnings call, including the addition of 903,000 post-paid phone subscribers, which topped rivals AT&T and Verizon.\n\nSievert stated T-Mobile is rapidly gaining market share across the post-paid sector due to gains in smaller markets and rural areas.\n\nThe operator\u2019s post-paid service revenue of $13.5 billion grew by 8 per cent year-over-year, which the CEO noted is more than double its peers.\n\nThe company added 428,000 fixed wireless access (FWA) internet customers in the quarter to bring its total to 6.4 million.\n\nIts post-paid phone additions are down 3.3 per cent while FWA subscribers decreased by 20.9 per cent from a year ago.\n\nT-Mobile forecast total post-paid net customer additions to be between 5.5 million and 6 million in 2025, with approximately half of that total being post-paid phone net adds. CFO Peter Osvaldik stated those numbers are T-Mobile\u2019s highest ever beginning of the year guide.\n\nRevenue came in at $21.8 billion for an 8 per cent increase. Net income increased 48 per cent to $3 billion and was up 36 percent in 2024 to $11.3 billion, which marked the company\u2019s highest full year gain.\n\nSievert stated the addition of telecoms veteran Srinivasan Gopalan as T-Mobile\u2019s incoming COO will allow him to focus on longer term opportunities and strategy.",

That feature, however, was quite limited as it could only send some emergency data out, and it required users to point the phone at the sky.\n\nStarlink connectivity is different, as it won't require users to point the phone upwards; instead, it should work like other mobile networks, even when the device is in the user's pocket. The initial version, however, will only allow texting.\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk commented on the news, saying that \"medium resolution images, music & audio podcasts should work with the current generation Starlink direct-to-phone constellation.\" He also announced that the next generation Starlink constellation will do \"medium resolution\" video.\n\nThe feature should be available on \"most current iPhone models,\" Bloomberg's report said.

While many baseball fans across the country would probably be quick to point at the notoriously hitter-friendly Coors Field in Denver, it was the Seattle Mariners\u2019 home ballpark that topped the list \u2013 for the opposite reason. Seattle\u2019s T-Mobile Park carried a park factor of 89 this past season, which means offenses performed 11% below league average when playing in the Emerald City.\n\nPetriello pointed out a few key factors in his article, including the ballpark\u2019s greatly inflated strikeout numbers, the effects of the crooked batter\u2019s eye beyond the center field fence, and even the way wind changes not only the trajectory of flyballs but the movement of pitches on their way to home plate. His analysis also included some very telling stats from the home and road splits for Mariners hitters and pitchers.\n\n\u201cYou go ahead and look at these numbers and it\u2019s undeniable what\u2019s going on in the Pacific Northwest,\u201d Bump and Stacy co-host Michael Bumpus said.\n\nIs there a way for the Mariners\u2019 to combat the issues T-Mobile Park presents? Petriello discussed that and more with Bump and Stacy on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere might be an argument to say, well, if the ballpark inflates strikeouts, then maybe we really should go get like a Luis Arr\u00e1ez or someone who\u2019s a very good contact hitter. That would be an interesting thing to do about it,\u201d Petriello said, referring to San Diego\u2019s batting champion.\n\nPetriello noted that the Mariners did start to use a different approach while seeing improved results down the stretch last season, but that also came with different players contributing.\n\n\u201cI know (president of baseball operations Jerry) Dipoto pointed that out and said they tried a different approach, because he basically said you can\u2019t pull and elevate and lift the ball here like you can everywhere else, we shouldn\u2019t try to build a team that does that,\u201d Petriello said. \u201cI think that\u2019s really interesting. The only caveat to it is, I\u2019m not sure I buy into it yet because the lineup changed a lot too. You had guys acquired midseason like Justin Turner and (Victor) Robles, Randy Arozarena, and some other guys departed.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m not going to say that because they were good in September, that this new approach is going to change everything. But you can color me intrigued, because it\u2019s hard to do that even for a month, and they at least did that.\u201d\n\nHear the full conversation at this link or in the audio player in this story.

Apple quietly worked with SpaceX and T-Mobile to add support for Starlink to its \u200ciPhone\u200c lineup, and T-Mobile's website confirms the new integration.\n\n\n\nT-Mobile announced a partnership with Starlink in 2022, and in December 2024, the carrier opened up a beta program allowing subscribers to use Starlink satellites for texting in areas without cell towers. At the time, the T-Mobile Starlink beta program was limited to Samsung smartphones, and iPhones weren't supported.\n\nFollowing the release of iOS 18.3, T-Mobile has invited a small number of \u200ciPhone\u200c users to take advantage of the Starlink beta, and those users have a new toggle to enable the satellite connectivity feature. T-Mobile customers who were selected received the following message:\n\n\n\nYou're in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\n\nWith Starlink integration, a T-Mobile \u200ciPhone\u200c without T-Mobile cellular service available will be able to pair automatically with Starlink satellites for connectivity. Starlink is limited to texting at the current time, but T-Mobile and SpaceX plan to support data and voice in the future.\n\nApple did not respond to Bloomberg's request for comment on the feature, but T-Mobile said that Starlink connectivity will eventually be available on the \"vast majority of modern smartphones.\"\n\nThe \u200ciPhone\u200c 14 and later already support satellite connectivity for text messages through Apple's partnership with Globalstar, so \u200ciPhone\u200c users who are able to use Starlink can also opt to text with Apple's built-in satellite service. Both Apple's service and Starlink are only available when there is no nearby cellular network.\n\nStarlink beta access is limited right now, but T-Mobile eventually plans to expand the beta test to additional subscribers. T-Mobile customers can sign up to join the beta on the T-Mobile website. Starlink is only available in the U.S., and it is free during T-Mobile's beta testing period.",

Or maybe another way to put that would be that it just feels gross. Anyways.\n\nAs a part of that increase, T-Mobile customers might be wondering if or when their Netflix on Us might see the new price or how T-Mobile would handle the change. Today, T-Mobile began texting customers to let them know how it would affect their plan benefit.\n\nFor those with the \u201cStandard with Ads\u201d plan that jumped to $7.99 (from $6.99), T-Mobile says they\u2019ll continue covering this plan in full and customers would see no change to their bill. T-Mobile has already updated its own FAQ to note the new $7.99/mo perk.\n\nFor those on other, more expensive plans, $6.99 is all that T-Mobile will give you to apply towards your higher-tier plan. For example, in the text below, you can see that they will apply $6.99/mo towards my Netflix \u201cPremium\u201d subscription that now costs $24.99/mo, leaving me with an $18/mo bill.

The union asserts that competition in labor markets was just as important as competition in consumer markets.\n\nWhile the coalition strongly opposed the transaction, it also suggested that strict consumer protections should be imposed if the FCC allows it to proceed. These included: Handset unlocking requirements to ensure customers have the freedom to switch carriers; no layoffs of T-Mobile or UScellular employees as a result of the merger; protections against wage cuts and forced arbitration; and neutrality in union organizing.\n\nT-Mobile has a history of merger-related commitments, as seen in its 2020 acquisition of Sprint, where it agreed to maintain jobs and expand its network.",

(NASDAQ:TMUS) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

            "content": "Apple introduced the satellite connectivity feature with the launch of the iPhone 14 lineup back in 2022. Since then, users have had the option to communicate with emergency services in remote areas with less or no cellular connectivity. It is now being reported that Apple has expanded the functionality to allow users to communicate with friends and family with the release of iOS 18.3. A new report states that Apple has been secretly working with T-Mobile and SpaceX to add support for Starlink satellite connectivity for the iPhone, and the switch is now available with iOS 18.3.\n\nT-Mobile and SpaceX partnered with Apple to bring extensive satellite connectivity features to the iPhone with iOS 18.3\n\nAccording to a new Bloomberg report, Apple has been \"secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile\" to bring Starlink satellite connectivity to the iPhone. If you're not familiar, T-Mobile and SpaceX announced their partnership in 2022, and the carrier previously claimed that Starlink connectivity would be available on Samsung's new Galaxy-branded smartphones. It appears that the company is now also adding the iPhone to the list.\n\nThe report claims that T-Mobile is making room for only a small number of iPhone users to test the Starlink satellite service. Take note that the new functionality is still in its beta phase, which means that there could be some underlying bugs and stutters, which will be addressed in the subsequent builds. While Apple did not mention anything of the sort in its changelog, the new feature is tied to iOS 18.3, which was released earlier this week to the general public.\n\nTo the lucky few users who received the update, T-Mobile says: \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected by texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d The carrier confirmed the Starlink satellite service for the iPhone in a new support document.\n\nAs of right now, the T-Mobile and Starlink satellite connectivity only works for messages, but it would add support for clear voice calls and data in the future.\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple. The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nApple was previously reported to be working with GlobalStar for its satellite connectivity, and according to Bloomberg, there is a major difference between the two satellite service providers. The report claims that the current version of satellite services on the iPhone requires users to point their phones to the sky to find a satellite. However, this is not the case with Starlink, as the entire operation is automatic, even if the phone is in a user's pocket. T-Mobile states that satellite connectivity will be available to all users \"sometime in 2025.\" We will share more details on the matter, so do stick around.",

On the other hand, hitters raved about Martinez\u2019s \u201cliners up the middle approach,\u201d and he\u2019ll direct the team\u2019s hitting program in 2025 with Kevin Seitzer as the new daily coach.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur ballpark might not be conducive to doing it quite the way we have (in the past),\u201d Dipoto said in late September. \u201cShame on us for taking this long to understand that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's just adapting a team to the ballpark,\u201d Dipoto told MLB.com in December. \u201cIt's not trying to adapt the ballpark to some fictional team.\\\"\n\n\n\nPerhaps so \u2013 though the underlying data about pull rate and grounders wasn\u2019t meaningfully different, not moreso than simply the roster changes. (Although it\u2019s worth pointing out that Raleigh really did have a massive strikeout drop, from 33% in the first half to 22% in the second.) File the September Mariners improvement under \\\"intriguing, not yet convincing.\\\"\n\n\n\nEither way, this isn\u2019t a new issue. It\u2019s not one the team has ignored, or not tried to fix. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to hit at T-Mobile. It always has been. It's a bigger factor than most people consider \u2013 and it\u2019s important to keep that in mind when you\u2019re worried about whether or not Mariners hitters are successful.\n\n\n\n*MLB.com\u2019s Daniel Kramer contributed to the reporting of this article.

So, you probably already know that T-Mobile and Verizon are the top players in the game. These two telecom companies dominate the 5G fixed wireless internet space and often compete for customers. But which provider offers an overall better service?\n\nCNET picks T-Mobile Home Internet as the better internet service provider due to its wide availability. You can find coverage in more locations across the country (including rural areas), offering internet connectivity to more people. Verizon 5G home internet has faster speeds but falls short on coverage. In recent years, T-Mobile has also performed better than Verizon when it comes to customer satisfaction. Plus, T-Mobile is usually seen in the top spots for ISP customer satisfaction in the latest 2024 J.D. Power Survey and the 2024 American Customer Satisfaction Index, too.\n\nOffering broadband services in rural areas is important. But in order to maintain competition, T-Mobile Home Internet and Verizon 5G Home Internet must also appeal to urban and suburban customers. T-Mobile has been making headlines by introducing three new plans with faster speeds and some streaming perks that compete with Verizon's perks and streaming add-ons. But keep in mind that overall, the best internet provider for you might be the one that caters to your needs and what's available in your area.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nWe'll give you the key facts on these two providers so you can make an informed decision. We've compiled exhaustive research on speed, pricing, customer care and more to help make that choice easier. Let's dive into the details on Verizon and T-Mobile's home internet plans.\n\nNote: All prices listed on this page reflect available discounts for setting up paperless billing. If you decide not to go with automatic monthly payments, your price will be higher.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet Better coverage and reaches more rural areas Our take - T-Mobile Home Internet is still fairly new on the block, but it's got the widest reach of any fixed wireless internet provider. By utilizing its 4G LTE network and the expanding 5G grid, T-Mobile has aggressively expanded its coverage map and offered its services to more households than Verizon's 5G solution.

That's great news for our phones and other smart gadgets connecting over cellular airwaves. And it could be a game changer for our homes, too. With the potential for near-gigabit speeds over the air that rival cable and fiber internet service providers -- plus the added appeal of straightforward, consumer-friendly terms that ditch data caps, equipment fees and the like -- 5G is shaping up to become one of the most exciting developments in residential internet in years.\n\nT-Mobile\n\n5G signals are extremely convenient -- much more convenient than installing a fiber or cable network -- but the signal doesn't reach everywhere. The first hurdle with 5G home internet service is whether it's available at your address. Though you may get cell service from T-Mobile or Verizon, that doesn't automatically mean you'll get home internet at your address.\n\nVerizon and T-Mobile are the providers doing the most to expand the 5G's availability for home internet use, though the providers recently found a new competitor in AT&T's 5G home internet rollout, AT&T Internet Air. AT&T does not boast the same availability as Verizon or T-Mobile, with a coverage of just 14% of the US, according to the FCC. However, all providers offer dedicated 5G fixed wireless home internet plans that promise fast speeds and simple terms at competitive rates. In some areas, you might even find that your home is serviceable by both Verizon and T-Mobile, as CNET's own Eli Blumenthal discovered in his quest to replace his cable provider.\n\nIf we take a second look at customer satisfaction data, we'll find that 5G internet continues to impress customers, significantly more than wired cable, fiber, DSL or satellite internet services. Time will tell how much 5G stands to disrupt the ISP category. For now, let's continue our look at how Verizon 5G Home and T-Mobile Home Internet match up.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs T-Mobile Home Internet: Plans and pricing\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nAre you tired of deciphering which broadband package to choose out of countless options? Both Verizon and T-Mobile lean into providing a no-strings-attached broadband experience, a welcome relief for many internet users. Each provider offers simplified 5G home internet plans requiring no term agreements, no data caps and no additional monthly equipment fees.\n\nThere are two plan options for Verizon: Verizon 5G Home and Verizon 5G Home Plus. Verizon 5G Home comes with a two-year price guarantee and lower download speeds, while Verizon 5G Home Plus locks in your price for three years, plus higher download speeds and a slew of additional perks, which we'll outline in the perks and promos section below.\n\nT-Mobile now offers three home internet plans, though two of them feature the same speeds. T-Mobile Home Rely Internet costs $50 monthly for speeds ranging between 87 to 318Mbps download and 14-56 upload. T-Mobile Amplified Internet Plus costs $60 for speeds ranging from 133 to 415Mbps download and 12 to 55Mbps upload and T-Mobile All-In Internet costs $70 monthly for the same speeds but with and includes a mesh Wi-Fi router to extend the range of coverage throughout the house and 24/7 \"interactive video support,\" according to T-Mobile's website.\n\nT-Mobile also recently rolled out its Home Internet Backup plan that you can use in the case of power or internet outages or during natural disasters interrupting connectivity. For $20 a month, you get up to 130GB -- which is admittedly, not very much, but this internet option isn't intended for heavy or regular usage. In fact, T-Mobile offers this internet option as a backup to your current internet provider.\n\nWhich is faster?\n\nWhile 5G can reach gigabit download speeds and Verizon advertises its 5G Home Plus plan as maxing out at 1,000Mbps, don't expect those top-end numbers from either provider's home internet product. T-Mobile says on its site that customers can expect \"average download speeds in excess of 100Mbps,\" and that people typically experience ranges from 87 to 318Mbps. Why so relatively low? T-Mobile Home Internet relies on its growing 5G grid and existing 4G LTE network to expedite its availability. So don't expect a pure 5G experience. Still, thanks to upgraded gateway routers, T-Mobile can offer faster speeds on average than previously offered, meaning you could see speeds up to 415Mbps (though probably not consistently). CNET's Amanda Kooser discovered that her speeds were inconsistent after trying out T-Mobile Home Internet at home.\n\n\"During congestion, Home Internet customers may notice speeds lower than other customers due to data prioritization,\" reads the first sentence of T-Mobile Home Internet's general terms. \"Service may be slowed, suspended, terminated, or restricted for misuse, abnormal use, interference with our network or ability to provide quality service to other users.\" In other words, you may experience some slowed internet speeds during peak hours, like after 5 p.m. Unlike with data caps, however, there's no allotment of \"priority data\" and no overage fees for consuming too much data.\n\nOn the other hand, Verizon tells its subscribers to expect average download speeds of around 300Mbps. Verizon's dependence on its Ultra Wideband 5G network (and lesser use of its \"4G LTE backup\") is the main reason for the faster speeds. It uses low-band, midband and millimeter-wave technology to offer speeds that could get as high as 1,000Mbps for some lucky people.\n\nWhich offers the best value?\n\nWhen trying to gauge the best deal for your home, it's essential to look at the cost per Mbps to better understand the actual value.\n\nConsidering the average download speed of 100Mbps for that basic $50 monthly fee, T-Mobile Home Rely Internet rings in at 50 cents per Mbps, comparable to what you might pay for a midrange cable internet plan. If you have a qualifying Go5G Plus or Magenta Max mobile plan, you can trim that to $30 a month or 30 cents per Mbps. T-Mobile Home Amplified Internet comes in at 60 cents comparatively, a steep price without a bundling discount, while T-Mobile All-In Internet rings in at 70 cents.\n\nVerizon 5G Home, which averages 125Mbps, matches that amount at a cost per Mbps of 40 cents. If you choose the Verizon 5G Plus plan, which averages 300Mbps, your monthly bill is $70, but that cost per Mbps goes down to just under 24 cents. Customers with qualifying Verizon mobile plans will get $15 to $25 off the monthly cost of either plan. If you can use that additional discount, it makes Verizon 5G Home -- the regular plan at 28 cents per Mbps and the Plus plan at an even better 15 cents per Mbps -- one of the most affordable out there compared to any cable internet plans by competitors.\n\nWhat about the fine print?\n\nLet's revisit that idea of the no-strings-attached internet experience. Verizon and T-Mobile are eager to get customers to try their 5G home internet offerings, so no hidden fees or taxes are added to the monthly cost. As we mentioned before, there's no contract or data cap. There's also no additional equipment rental fee, installation fee or other trap fees (although T-Mobile does charge a one-time, $35 activation fee), so it's a win-win for both providers and their customers.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet: Who can sign up?\n\nFCC\n\nNeither provider offers a detailed coverage map for its 5G home internet solution. However, considering the list of cities they claim to cover and the total number of households, T-Mobile is clearly in the lead here.\n\nWhile Verizon 5G Home Internet is available to approximately 40 million homes nationwide, T-Mobile Home Internet reaches over 50 million households and serves almost 60% of the US population. In contrast, Verizon's 5G service is now available in more than 2,700 cities, covering only 21% of the country.\n\nOverall, T-Mobile Home Internet has just over six million customers (according to a recent report in the fourth quarter of 2024.), while Verizon's latest earnings report shows that the company has added one million subscribers, putting its subscriber base at just over four million. That's a sizable piece of the broadband pie for both upstart fixed wireless offerings.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet: Deals and promotions\n\nStill not convinced by the straightforward terms both T-Mobile and Verizon put forward? They'll try to sway you with their promotional offers.\n\nFirst, T-Mobile and Verizon are so confident in their 5G home products that each offers to pay off any early termination fees for new customers who break their current ISP contract, up to $500 for Verizon and $750 from T-Mobile.\n\nSecond, they each offer similar discounts for eligible mobile customers. T-Mobile and Verizon will shave off $15 to $25 if you bundle your home internet with eligible mobile plans.\n\nVerizon also offers some solid perks. All Verizon plans include a price lock of up to five years. Depending on which plan you sign up for, you can expect a $100 to $200 Verizon gift card. Verizon also offers customers a free year-long Netflix and Max subscription (with ads).\n\nComparatively, T-Mobile's latest deal for new customers who sign up online is a prepaid Mastercard card worth $300. The All-In Home Internet plan also features Hulu (with ads) plus a Paramount Plus subscription.\n\nBoth Verizon and T-Mobile offer a price lock for internet, with Verizon pledging a five-year price lock for all plans.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet: What do customers think?\n\nWe refer to two of the top customer satisfaction surveys within our ISP reviews -- J.D. Power and the American Customer Satisfaction Index -- and they consistently place T-Mobile and Verizon at the top of their rankings. Verizon 5G scored just 605 points to T-Mobile's 649 in the J.D. Power study. As the national average in that study was 630, T-Mobile performed extremely well.\n\nACSI\n\nOn the other hand, T-Mobile Home Internet impressively led all nonfiber ISPs with 76 out of 100, well above the ACSI industry average of 68 points. But can you guess which provider was right behind it? Verizon 5G Home Internet took second place, scoring 74 points.\n\nAnecdotally, one of our CNET writers tested T-Mobile during its pilot program and preferred it over his previous provider, Xfinity.\n\nSo, which is it?\n\nT-Mobile and Verizon are still aggressively building their 5G networks, so we're closer to the story's beginning than the middle or end, especially regarding 5G fixed wireless internet overall.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet has a slight edge over Verizon 5G Home Internet in availability and customer satisfaction. Adding its 4G LTE network to 5G makes it a much more viable pick, particularly in rural and underserved areas of the country, where it's a compelling alternative to options like satellite or DSL. Verizon 5G Home Internet takes the lead in performance, featuring nearly triple the current download speeds of T-Mobile Home Internet with the addition of more enticing perks and bundles. As such, T-Mobile may have the upper hand now, but Verizon seems poised to provide a higher upside in the immediate future as the best fixed wireless internet in cities where the two overlap.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet FAQs\n\nIs T-Mobile Home Internet better than Verizon 5G Home? It depends on how you define \"better.\" T-Mobile Home Internet is available to more households than Verizon 5G Home Internet, so it's got the edge there. Verizon 5G Home boasts a higher average download speed (300Mbps), so it can claim a win in that category. Ultimately, the product that will be best for you is the one that's available at your address and can provide enough download speed to enable your household to do what it needs to do. Show more\n\nWhich internet service provider has the best 5G coverage? Not to sound like a broken record, but it depends on how you define \"best 5G coverage.\" If you're looking strictly at the number of people covered, T-Mobile Home Internet is the ISP with the best 5G coverage. If you define \"best\" by which provider has the better download speed performance, then the winner is Verizon 5G Home Internet. It has a top end of 300Mbps compared to T-Mobile's 245Mbps. Verizon 5G Home Plus is even better, with a maximum of 1,000Mbps in some areas.\n\nCan you work from home using Verizon 5G Home or T-Mobile Home Internet? Yes. Verizon 5G Home Internet and T-Mobile Home Internet should provide near or above the FCC's broadband speed definition of at least 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload. Both fixed wireless products, in urban and suburban areas, won't give you as many options as some cable and fiber providers. On the flip side, Verizon 5G Home and T-Mobile Home Internet are cheaper (especially with their mobile discounts) and you'll have the opportunity to try them out at very little risk to see if they'll be adequate for your home office needs.

Fortunately, you can stay one step ahead of them with these simple tips to help protect yourself.\n\nStrengthen your online security: Safeguard your accounts by using unique, 12-character passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication whenever possible. Avoid using public Wi-Fi, such as free internet connectivity in coffee shops or libraries, where cyber criminals might be lurking to access your information. Instead, it\u2019s safer to use your phone\u2019s mobile hotspot. Be cautious of unsolicited emails or messages promising prizes or freebies \u2014 if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Block and report anything suspicious before deleting it. And ask your provider what services they offer for safe browsing, such as Safe Browsing from T-Mobile 5G Home Internet to block malicious links. Donate only to trusted charities: Before making charitable donations, check online reviews by looking up the organization and \u201ccomplaint\u201d or \u201cscam,\u201d or use trusted resources like Charity Navigator. Use a credit card instead of a debit card as they offer stronger fraud protections and don\u2019t give scammers direct access to your bank account. Use your wireless provider\u2019s scam protection: Scammers often rely on robocalls and spoofed numbers to make calls look inviting to answer. Most providers have protection from robocalling and spoofing, including T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, which give customers Scam Shield, a free feature that labels scam calls as \u201cScam Likely.\u201d These calls can be blocked by dialing #662# or turning on Scam Block in the Scam Shield and T-Life apps. Scam Shield blocked 19.8 billion calls in 2023, giving users peace of mind. Lastly, forward suspicious texts to 7726. Monitor deliveries and protect packages: Mail and package theft happen all year round, especially as online shopping continues to grow. Track your shipments in real-time using delivery notifications and apps. Consider installing a smart door camera to monitor activity on your front porch. Many models offer live video feeds and motion detection, sending real-time alerts so you can quickly contact authorities if needed. Stay informed and report suspicious activity: Stay updated on the latest scams with resources like T-Mobile\u2019s Privacy Center and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If you encounter suspicious or fraudulent activity, report it to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint and the National Center for Disaster Fraud. By reporting scams, you can help protect others and reduce the spread of fraudulent schemes.",

He added the difficulties could have been because Florida\u2019s line led by Alexander Barkov is \u201cvery good.\u201d\n\nWhile Eichel found the back of the net in the third period on a breakaway, it was the Golden Knights\u2019s third line that powered them to a 4-1 victory over the visiting Panthers.\n\nThe third-line trio thrived: Center Nicolas Roy had three assists, Keegan Kolesar had two assists, and Tanner Pearson had a goal.\n\n\u201cWe need a couple of shifts to piggyback off just to get the momentum back, get us off our heels, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re (the third line) really good at,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThey did a great job with that tonight.\u201d\n\nThe third line recorded 8:22 minutes of ice time, the second-most behind the second line. They worked off of what Florida gave them, which led to the game-winning goal in the second period.\n\n\u201cWe tried to put pucks deep and make them make mistakes,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe wanted to throw a couple of body checks and keep it simple.\u201d\n\nPuck possession has been the root of the third line\u2019s success for years. Cassidy said this group has been executing like this since the 2023 Stanley Cup championship run.\n\nKolesar, who\u2019s been a part of the bottom two lines for four seasons, is having a career year as well. He is now three points shy of his single-season career high of 24.\n\n\u201cGood for them,\u201d Cassidy said on the third line\u2019s effort. \u201cThey played a good offensive game and played the way they needed to play. They\u2019re not necessarily a line rush group; It\u2019s puck possession.\u201d\n\nOutside of the third line, Brayden McNabb opened the scoring in the first period off a slapshot from the point. Tomas Hertl scored an empty net goal, extending his point streak to 13 in nine games.\n\nIn net, Adin Hill snapped a three-game losing streak, making 32 saves on 33 shots.\n\nSunday\u2019s game kicks off a three-game homestand, hosting the Dallas Stars (Tuesday) and Columbus Blue Jackets (Thursday).\n\nThe Golden Knights then head on the road for four games before a two-week break for the 4 Nations Face-Off, the international tournament pitting NHL players from Finland, Sweden, Canada and the United States.\n\nNearing the end of what has felt like an endless January, going 6-6-1, this could be the momentum the Golden Knights need going into the break.\n\n\u201cHow about we string some solid hockey together,\u201d Cassidy said on the Golden Knights\u2019 games before the 4 Nations break. \u201cIf it results and wins, obviously, that\u2019s what we want.\u201d",

However, his upcoming fight against David Morrell promises to be more than just another bout-it's personal. Scheduled for February 1 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, this highly anticipated showdown has been building for years, with Morrell relentlessly calling out Benavidez.\n\nMorrell, undefeated with an 11-0 record and nine knockouts, is confident he can dismantle the WBC interim champion. However, Benavidez has his sights set on more than just a win. \"I'm gonna make an example out of him for the rest of the light heavyweight division to see that I'm not playing with anybody,\" Benavidez declared during an episode of Gloves Off on Premier Boxing Champions.\n\nDavid Benavidez asks Canelo Alvarez to prepare to face him\n\nA clash of styles and stakes\n\nMorrell's rise through the ranks has been impressive, securing titles at both 168 and 175 pounds. His recent victory over Radivoje Kalajdzic showcased his technical prowess and devastating power, but Benavidez is determined to prove he's on a different level. Known for his aggressive style and knockout power, Benavidez has vowed to deliver a performance that will cement his dominance in the division.\n\nDespite the trash talk and bold predictions, Benavidez isn't just focused on winning, he wants to send a message. Anything short of a decisive victory would leave him dissatisfied. \"If I don't make him quit or knock him out, I'll be disappointed in myself,\" Benavidez stated.\n\nWhat to expect on fight night\n\nFans at the T-Mobile Arena can expect fireworks as these two fighters meet in the ring. Benavidez has promised an explosive performance, warning fans not to sit too close due to the bloodshed he predicts.\n\nFor both fighters, this bout represents more than just a win or loss; it's a defining moment in their careers. With the light heavyweight division watching closely, Benavidez and Morrell are set to leave it all in the ring in a fight that could reshape the weight class.\n\nWill Morrell's confidence pay off, or will Benavidez prove once again why he's one of boxing's most feared competitors?

Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every internet service provider in a given city. What's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary database of pricing, availability and speed information that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nWhat's the final word on internet providers in Portland?\n\nWhen choosing an internet service provider, you're always better off choosing fiber internet over all other options if it's available. Ziply Fiber and CenturyLink offer the best fiber internet plans in Portland. If fiber is unavailable in your neighborhood, cable internet or 5G fixed wireless providers offer fast and reliable connections. Just steer clear of data caps or any binding long-term contracts.\n\nInternet providers in Portland FAQ\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Portland? Ziply Fiber's 100Mbps plan is $20 a month with no contract. Xfinity offers a base plan for $20, reaching up to 150Mbps. Finally, Astound Broadband has a $20 plan that offers 300Mbps. Show more\n\nIs fiber internet service available in Portland? Yes. Most households in Portland will have access to fiber connectivity, the best internet connection you can get. Quantum Fiber, Ziply Fiber and (in some areas) Xfinity's fiber service are Portland's top ISPs offering fiber internet. Show more",

            "content": "When you're looking to live the RV life or become a digital nomad, there is one important question you need to answer \u2014 how to connect to the internet. Taking to the open road and enjoying some peace and quiet away from cities and towns is fantastic, but eventually, you'll need to get online, whether it's to work or get in contact with family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, you can't get a normal internet plan and have it work wherever you're going. Cable internet requires you to be grounded so you can plug the cable in, and with an RV, it's unlikely you'll be staying in one place for long. And while RV parks may have Wi-Fi available, it may not be the best quality.\n\nFor those who need reliable internet on the road, satellite internet is generally a good option. You'll get your signal from a satellite relay, forgoing the need for cables \u2014 though these providers tend to be pricier. Cellular internet (whether via a mobile hotspot or a cellular modem) is also a valid option, though you'll need to ensure proper cell tower coverage wherever you go. We've looked into a variety of internet providers meant to provide service to those on the road, and based our picks on prices, useability, and reviews. A full explanation of our methodology is listed below.\n\nAdvertisement",

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Walla Walla\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answer to those questions is often layered and complex, but the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Walla Walla FAQs\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Walla Walla?

            "content": "SpaceX is getting ready to start testing its new Direct-to-Cell (DTC) Starlink satellite service. The DTC service is supposed to provide cell phone connectivity to remote areas not covered by conventional cell networks.\n\nDTC beta testing will kick off on January 27, 2025, and continue until July 26, 2025. This new service builds on SpaceX's existing Starlink network, which consists of nearly 7,000 low-Earth orbit satellites already giving internet access to over 4.6 million users in 118 countries.\n\nThe satellites will include devices called eNodeB modems, which act like cell towers but are in space. These modems will help send data to ground networks and partner carriers and are designed to work with current cell phones, so no new hardware is needed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nT-Mobile's beta test will focus on text messaging, with plans to add data and voice features later. The test will include phases like launching the satellites, getting them into orbit, raising their orbit, and running them operationally. For the DTC service to move from testing to full use, it must meet target data speeds and reliability goals. T-Mobile users who signed up for the beta test have already started receiving links to join, so if you've been waiting to test this out, keep checking your e-mail.\n\nAll DTC-equipped satellites will perform regular Starlink tasks in addition to their direct-to-cell duties, meaning that there should be impact on Starlink satellite internet service. SpaceX requested permission to test as they enter this beta phase, and it seems that permission was given. The main aim of this test is to check how well a full DTC satellite system works and determine what improvements might be needed before a wider launch.\n\nThe technology could be useful for personal calls and emergencies, particularly for people in remote locations. It may even allow navigation through map services when conventional cell service is unavailable.\n\nSource: NASASpaceFlight via AndroidAuthority",

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming in 4K or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more in-depth breakdown, refer to CNET's guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one perosn sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two people to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more people to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in St. Charles, Missouri\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary pricing, availability and speed database that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answer to those questions is often layered and complex, but the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like the FCC and Ookla. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in St. Charles FAQs\n\nWhat's the best internet service provider in St. Charles? CNET\u2019s pick for the best internet provider in St. Charles is AT&T Fiber because of its broad availability, fast speeds and competitive pricing. AT&T covers 94% of the city, according to the FCC, and boasts some of the highest customer satisfaction ratings and overall speeds nationwide. Show more\n\nIs fiber internet available in St. Charles? Yes, St. Charles has fiber internet networks from AT&T and from local provider i3 Broadband. AT&T has a much larger network than i3 Broadband (94% of coverage to i3 Broadband\u2019s meager 8%, according to the FCC) so you\u2019ll likely be eligible for fiber from AT&T. Show more\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet provider in St. Charles? The cheapest internet provider in St. Charles is local fiber provider i3 Broadband, with plans starting as low as $25 and $30 monthly. Just keep in mind that i3 Broadband\u2019s $25 monthly fee for 300Mbps jumps to $50 monthly after one year of service. The $30 monthly price for 100Mbps doesn\u2019t advertise a price increase, but i3 Broadband reserves the right to raise prices at any time. Still, those are competitive prices for fiber internet -- especially in a city with most rates starting at $50 monthly. Show more",

Here's how\n\nOn the 5G front, T-Mobile was clocked at a median download speed of 281.52 Mbps and a median upload speed of 13.39 Mbps. Those numbers helped it win top grades for the fastest 5G network and the best 5G gaming experience. In second place, Verizon recorded a median download 5G speed of 199.1 Mbps, followed by AT&T at 140.09 Mbps. But Verizon did eke out a win here for the best 5G video experience.\n\nConsistent network performance\n\nSpeed doesn't do much good without consistent performance. And here, T-Mobile also came out on top. The company recorded the best network consistency in the US with more than 85% of its data samples meeting or surpassing a threshold of 5 Mbps for downloads and 1 Mbps for uploads. T-Mobile also led for consistency and availability in 5G performance.\n\nFurther, the Uncarrier was rated as the top US mobile provider by customers with a score of 3.7 out of 5, ahead of Verizon at 3.29 and AT&T at 3.12. Overall, T-Mobile took home a speed score of 222.63, followed by Verizon with 113.2, and AT&T with 111.07. The speed score is a combination of download and upload performance that takes into account modern chipsets so as not to penalize older and slower devices.\n\nWhy was T-Mobile able to outperform the other two major US carriers?\n\n\"T-Mobile has built a sizable lead on 5G performance, thanks mainly to early deployment in mid-band spectrum,\" Mark Giles, lead industry analyst at Ookla, told ZDNET. \"It continues to advance its performance, with the introduction of 5G Standalone, despite both Verizon and AT&T seeing significant improvements thanks to their deployments in C-band spectrum.\"\n\n\n\nOokla's report also measured the speed and reliability of broadband networks from internet providers. Among AT&T Fiber, Verizon, Xfinity, Cox, and Spectrum, AT&T was the leader of the pack. The company's fiber network was the fastest and most consistent fixed network.\n\nAlso: Best Samsung Galaxy S25 deals: $200 gift cards and free offers at T-Mobile and Verizon\n\nAT&T Fiber led on median download speed with 357.45 Mbps, ahead of Spectrum with 294.33 Mbps and Cox with 277.71 Mbps. AT&T's fiber network also outscored those of its rivals on median upload speed with 286.93 Mbps and low latency of 19 ms.",

While the Un-carrier offers the fastest median 5G download speeds, where available, Verizon has the bigger, more robust and reliable network overall, and sometimes having coverage, any coverage, matters more than blazing fast download speeds.\n\nThe US carrier network download speed tests for the second half of 2024 are in, and T-Mobile is once again reaping the benefits of its early investment in a 5G network made possible by the mid-band frequencies acquired during its merger with Sprint.",

Morales Sr. punched the male victim, too, before calling Morales Jr. to come assist. Morales Jr. came into the store and picked up a chair, however he did not use it during the altercation, the report said.\n\nAll three suspects attacked and struck the male victim inside the store and followed him outside. They surrounded the female victim\u2019s vehicle as both victims tried to get in. Maldonado and Morales Jr. then jumped onto the windshield, shattering the glass, the report said.\n\nWhile Maldonado and Morales Jr. ran around the vehicle, Morales Sr. tried to hit the male victim again. The male victim pulled out his pocketknife in self-defense and in fear for his and his mother. He then slashed at Morales Sr., causing a 3-inch gash about 1.5 inches deep to his left shoulder, the report said.\n\nAs the victims got into the vehicle to leave, Maldonado and Morales Jr. broke both side mirrors off the vehicle. Deputies arrived shortly after and made contact with multiple witnesses to the incident, the report said.\n\nMaldonado and Morales Jr. were both arrested on charges of battery and criminal mischief (over $200 under $1,000). They were transported to Lake County Jail and released after posting bonds of $2,000 each.\n\nMorales Sr. was arrested on charge of simple battery and taken to Lake County Jail.

The ad-supported Netflix tier now costs $7.99 per month (the same price for the full experience a decade ago), while the ad-free standard tier will jump to $17.99.\n\nAnd now an internal memo from T-Mobile suggests that the company will cover the cost increase for customers using the 'Netflix with ads' tier, but not the ad-free tier (via The Mobile Report). T-Mobile is known for offering free Netflix subscriptions to most customers, but recently adjusted its offer to restrict everyone to the Netflix with ads plan. Many customers are uncertain what this means for their bills.\n\nHere's what T-Mobile had to say about the Netflix price increase\n\nHi, Lenny. There are no changes to your monthly bill and you will continue to receive the Netflix on Us discount. We are here for you in DM if you have any other concerns we can help address for you tonight. Thank you. ^FrankieOntiveros https://t.co/8DIvLVByJj\u2014 T-Mobile Help (@TMobileHelp) January 22, 2025\n\nNetflix recently announced the price increase in an earning report to shareholders, set to take effect immediately. Many T-Mobile customers have wondered what this means for their subscriptions. The internal memo, leaked to The Mobile Report by an unnamed source at T-Mobile, alludes to not covering the price increase for customers with the ad-free tier.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"For customers enjoying Netflix Standard (w/Ads) ON US, we\u2019ve got them covered with no changes to their monthly bill! Customers who have upgraded to Netflix Standard or Premium will continue to receive their $6.99/mo. T-Mobile discount. Next week, we will notify our Netflix subscribers of these changes via SMS.\" - T-mobile memo shared with The Mobile Report\n\nThe implications for T-Mobile customers\n\nThe changes in Netflix pricing are set to take place immediately, with customers seeing it reflected in their next billing cycle. This means T-Mobile customers can expect to see their bills go up by a few dollars. Some customers feel T-Mobile should cover the full cost of the Netflix subscription, seeing as that was one of the perks that helped them choose the provider.\n\nWhat customers can expect on their next T-Mobile bill depends on their Netflix tier of choice. Customers already paid a little extra for no ads. Here's what that price increase could look like for them.\n\nNetflix tier Old price New price Standard with ads $0 $0 Standard (no ads) $8.50 $11 Premium $16 $18\n\nThis isn't entirely T-Mobile's fault. Netflix has been happy to raise prices over the past few years, and it highlights a trend in the industry. Customers who don't want to pay will need to reconsider their subscriptions. Thankfully, there are plenty of alternative ways to stay entertained.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix, Inc.\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.1\n\nDownload",

            "content": "In the U.S., the top carriers don\u2019t offer the same network performance. One carrier has significantly outperformed the others over the past six months, according to data collected in network and connectivity expert Ookla\u2019s latest \u201cSpeedtest Connectivity Report.\u201d The report, which covers data collected between July and December 2024, found that T-Mobile, the third-largest carrier in the U.S., has emerged as the clear leader in overall performance. The differences are striking.\n\nOokla reports that T-Mobile provides media download speeds 120% faster than its closest competitor, AT&T. Verizon, the largest carrier by subscriber count, ranked third. These speeds are enough for Ookla to conclude that T-Mobile offers the best mobile gaming experience.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nT-Mobile didn\u2019t just excel in speed; the company also offers the most reliable network. In Speedtest samples, T-Mobile met or exceeded the thresholds of 5 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload 85.4% of the time. Verizon ranked second in this category, while AT&T fell to third. Ookla also noted that regarding 5G network availability, T-Mobile and AT&T received high scores, with both networks being operational nearly twice as often as Verizon.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nBefore feeling sympathy for Verizon, it\u2019s important to highlight that AT&T received the lowest ratings in consumer sentiment. Additionally, AT&T ranked last in almost every performance metric, with the exception of 5G consistency and download speeds. In summary, T-Mobile is the fastest mobile network and provides the quickest 5G service, along with the most reliable network overall. It slightly outperforms AT&T in 5G availability and surpasses Verizon in terms of video and gaming experiences. Additionally, T-Mobile ranks number one in consumer sentiment.\n\nAs you know, most cell phones are expensive, but their monthly costs are even higher. In 2024, JD Morgan told CNBC that the average cell phone bill in the U.S. has risen to $144. That\u2019s certainly a lot of money to pay for inferior service. Consider our list of favorites if you\u2019re looking for a new phone plan, especially if you\u2019re considering purchasing a new Samsung Galaxy S25.

            "content": "Innovative Technology Set for Deployment at Jizerska 50 Ski Race\n\nT-Mobile Czech Republic and Primoco UAV SE have partnered to create a drone-based mobile signal booster, marking the first deployment of this technology in Europe. The collaboration aims to provide mobile signal coverage in areas where traditional ground-based infrastructure is unavailable or impractical.\n\nThe system will debut during the upcoming Jizerska 50 cross-country ski race, showcasing its potential for both emergency and commercial use. This innovative solution offers a new approach to signal propagation by using drones equipped with mobile microstations, eliminating the need for ground transmitters.\n\nA Solution for Emergencies and Events\n\n\u201cThis technology has great potential not only in emergency situations such as fires, earthquakes, or floods,\u201d said Vladan Pekovi\u0107, CTIO of T-Mobile Czech Republic. \u201cIt can also bring extensive opportunities for commercial use \u2014 with the growing popularity of mass sporting or cultural events in the countryside, there is a growing need for temporary signal reinforcement during such events.\u201d\n\nThe drone system is particularly valuable in remote or legally protected areas where permanent ground transmitters cannot be installed. The Primoco One 150 drone, manufactured in the Czech Republic, carries a mobile transmitter capable of connecting to either a dedicated local network or directly to the live network core via satellite. This flexibility makes the technology suitable for both emergency services and large-scale public events.\n\nDrone Capabilities and Performance\n\nThe Primoco One 150 is equipped to operate at altitudes of up to 3,300 meters and has a range of 1,800 kilometers. It can stay airborne for up to 15 hours and provide mobile signal coverage to areas up to 20 square kilometers. A single drone can serve up to 1,000 active users, ensuring reliable connectivity for 4G and 5G-enabled devices.\n\n\u201cThis year, we will start constructing a new production facility with a capacity of 250 drones per year to meet the growing demands of multinational partners such as Airbus Defence,\u201d said Ladislav Semetkovsky, CEO of Primoco UAV SE. He added, \u201cWe see the partnership with T-Mobile and the Deutsche Telekom Group as a great opportunity to bring the potential offered by drones to the benefit of the majority of the population, whether it be for emergencies or large commercial events.\u201d\n\nA Broader Vision\n\nThis project, supported by the Deutsche Telekom Group, positions the Czech Republic as a hub for innovative telecommunications technology. \u201cWe are very pleased that this innovative project sponsored by the Deutsche Telekom Group is taking place in the Czech Republic,\u201d said Jaroslav Holi\u0161, Research & Development Senior Manager at Deutsche Telekom. \u201cWe are already discussing with relevant EU government departments to offer the technology to support their emergency services or defence forces.\u201d\n\nPrimoco UAV SE, a publicly traded company on the Prague Stock Exchange, continues to expand its footprint with over 200 aircraft operated across four continents. The company\u2019s partnership with T-Mobile reflects the growing demand for drone technology in both civilian and defense sectors.\n\nFor more details about T-Mobile Czech Republic and Primoco UAV SE, visit T-Mobile Czech Republic and PrimocoUAV SE.",

            "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when T-Mobile (TMUS) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 29, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis wireless carrier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +28.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $21.17 billion, up 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

That year, the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) recorded almost five million unique phishing attacks \u2013 the worst year on record.\n\n\u201cAI and the sophistication of bad actors continue to evolve, putting enterprises and their personnel at higher risk than ever before,\u201d says said Jerrod Chong, president and COO of Yubico. \u201cTo protect against phishing attacks, companies need to act now to adopt and implement hardware-based security keys, which are the strongest multi-factor authentication available.\u201d\n\nYubiKeys support multiple phishing-resistant authentication protocols, including FIDO2/WebAuthn, U2F and Smart Card (PIV), and function across all operating systems and mobile devices.\n\nJeff Simon, chief security officer at T-Mobile, says \u201conce we had our YubiKeys in hand, we were able to get them up and running across the company in less than three months, and we\u2019ve seen the positive results after just one year of having them.\u201d\n\nPhishing gets more sophisticated; passkeys can help\n\nIn 2025, Yubico continues to emphasize the importance of adopting tools like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and phishing-resistant passkeys. A two\u2013part set of predictions from its cybersecurity experts notes the ongoing challenges caused by stolen, misused or fake identities, and the role that passkeys, digital wallets and regulations will play in shaping the digital landscape in the coming year.\n\nStina Ehrensv\u00e4rd, founder of Yubico, says that bad actors have turned the internet into a highly risky environment. \u201cTo mitigate these risks, some claim that we have to choose between security, usability and privacy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there is a clear solution focused on the broad adoption of digital identity wallets and open standards for digital identities.\u201d\n\nEhrensvard expects continued momentum of open standards for digital identities, and to see many more countries around the world adopt digital wallet technology backed by FIDO security.\n\nYubico VP of Standards and Alliance Derek Hanson believes \u201cpasskeys have taken the world by storm as the de facto authentication solution to replace passwords.\u201d But, he notes, \u201cthe role passkeys actually play in securing our online identities depends heavily on how they are used. Unless organizations do all the right things and have an effective strategy in place throughout the user lifecycle, passkeys won\u2019t reach their potential.\u201d\n\nHanson predicts a rapid rise in passkey adoption across the enterprise, but a longer adjustment period as organizations come to understand passkeys\u2019 full potential.\n\nDavid Treece, Yubico\u2019s VP of solutions architecture, forecasts a flurry of regulations, as governments globally draft regulations and guidelines aiming to keep businesses and individuals secure from increasingly sophisticated phishing attacks and generative AI-assisted deepfake fraud.\n\n\u201cAs federal agencies around the world look to meet new and upcoming regulations, the adoption of Zero Trust Architecture and robust, phishing-resistant MFA like YubiKeys is not just a compliance requirement,\u201d Treede says. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical step in safeguarding the nation\u2019s infrastructure.\u201d\n\nChad Thunberg, CISO, echoes the sentiment, noting the potency of Gen AI tools for conducting fraud. \u201cLegacy MFA solutions are already under attack, and generative AI will make them even less effective.\u201d Without regulatory countermeasures, he says, \u201cas the volume of generated content surges, confidence in content will decline.\u201d\n\nAs such, Thunberg predicts more regulation on AI, and \u201cbroader adoption of standards like those from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), which help consumers verify content authenticity.\u201d\n\nSolutions Architect Josh Cigna says the threat is especially dire for financial services, noting that the financial sector recently surpassed healthcare as the most breached and attacked industry. \u201cExpect to see some more support and adoption of interoperable Verifiable Credentials, starting in Europe and hopefully growing in use in the North American and Asia Pacific regions, backed by phishing resistant MFA,\u201d he says.\n\nThe youth appear to be aligned with Yubico on the security advantages of passkeys and hardware security keys. Results from its 2024 State of Global Authentication survey found that Gen Z and Millennials lead in hardware security key usage, relying less on passwords than other generations. Gen Z is also almost 20 percent more likely to use MFA than Baby Boomers and Gen X.\n\nArticle Topics\n\nbiometric authentication | biometric security key | biometrics | cybersecurity | FIDO2 | passkeys | passwordless authentication | Yubico",

Together, they have developed and tested a unique solution for signal boosting during emergencies and commercial events outside of normal signal coverage. The technology enables the propagation of the mobile signal exclusively through the air \u2014 without using a ground transmitter. The project is being developed and piloted in the Czech Republic, with potential use within the Deutsche Telekom Group. T-Mobile CZ was the first operator in Europe to present this innovative solution in practice, along with successful test results. It plans to deploy the technology in live operation in two weeks\u2019 time during the Jizerska 50 cross-country ski race.\n\nAs a leader in technology innovation, T-Mobile introduced a unique compact portable mobile micro station late last year. After last year\u2019s pilot , it now brings another alternative to mobile signal coverage \u2014 boosting the network of the future using a drone. With the help of a drone with a mobile station, it can \u2014 under favourable weather conditions \u2014 \u2018deliver\u2019 a mobile signal anywhere it is needed \u2014 and it is the first ever carrier in Europe to do so. Over the past two years, T-Mobile has invested around CZK 5 billion in mobile network development and implemented more than 4,100 projects to upgrade its network to support 5G technology.\n\n\u201cThis technology has great potential not only in emergency situations such as fires, earthquakes or floods. These are all situations where terrestrial transmitters temporarily or completely go out of service, or it is necessary to cover an area where the signal is not normally available,\u201d says Vladan Pekovi\u0107, CTIO T-Mobile Czech Republic , adding. \u201cIt can also bring extensive opportunities for commercial use \u2014 with the growing popularity of mass sporting or cultural events in the countryside, there is a growing need for temporary signal reinforcement during such events. For example, in areas with special legal protection, where it is impossible to build a permanent ground transmitter or, due to inaccessible terrain, typically in mountainous and densely forested areas or protected areas, to solve the situation even with a temporarily built mobile station.\u201d\n\nThe Primoco One 150 drone is designed and manufactured in the Czech Republic. The built-in mobile transmitter can be connected to a dedicated local network core to create a stand-alone campus network \u2014 for example, for emergency services. However, it can also be connected directly to the live network core via satellite. The drone is operated by a specialist from a control centre, most often from a vehicle due to its movement in the field. The Primoco One 150 drones carry equipment supplied by T-Mobile weighing 8 kg but can carry up to 30 kg and move in operational deployment at 1-2 km above the ground.\n\nThe drone used by T-Mobile in partnership with Primoco UAV SE has a flight time of up to 15 hours, a flight altitude of up to 3,300 m and a range of up to 1,800km at a cruising speed of 120 km/h \u2014 it can cover any area in the EU in a matter of hours. A 10 MHz channel is used for signal transmission, with a speed of up to 90 Mbps. The range of the signal depends on the flight altitude and the frequencies used. Typical coverage is around 9 km2, with a limit of nearly 20 km2. One drone can serve up to a thousand active users in the context of mobile signal distribution. From the user\u2019s point of view, nothing changes except the coverage; it is enough to have a 4G or 5G-enabled mobile phone and an active SIM card from T-Mobile. To make the most of the network\u2019s potential, it is best to use a 5G-enabled phone.\n\n\u201cPrimoco One 150 is the first certified UAV in this category in the civil domain \u2014 it is EASA LUC approved to SAIL III level and is in the final stages of military certification to NATO STANAG 4703. This means that it is virtually equal to a normal transport aircraft \u2014 it can fly over built-up areas without needing a Civil Aviation Authority permit, which increases the flexibility and efficiency of its deployment,\u201d says Ladislav Semetkovsky, CEO of Primoco UAV SE . The company has produced over 200 aircraft that are operated on four continents. \u201cThis year, we will start constructing a new production facility with a capacity of 250 drones per year to meet the growing demands of multinational partners such as Airbus Defence. We see the partnership with T-Mobile and the Deutsche Telekom group as a great opportunity to bring the potential offered by drones to the benefit of the majority of the population, whether it be for emergencies or large commercial events.\u201d\n\nJaroslav Holi\u0161, Research & Development Senior Manager at Deutsche Telekom , confirms this: \u201cWe are very pleased that this innovative project sponsored by the Deutsche Telekom Group is taking place in the Czech Republic. It means great trust, significant investments are being made here, and innovations applicable to other countries in the Group are being developed here. The Czech Republic is thus participating in a unique innovation, the first in the EU. This solution can quickly help all components of the integrated rescue system in emergencies. Still, the potential of the technology is so great that we feel obliged to share it with anyone interested. We are, of course, in the beginning, but we are already discussing with relevant EU government departments to offer the technology to support their emergency services or defence forces.\u201dPrimoco has been a publicly traded company on the main market of the Prague Stock Exchange since 2018, with a market capitalisation of CZK 4.5 billion.\n\nRelated",

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe acquisition will include all of Vistar\u2019s capabilities including its intelligent marketplace and technology for buying, selling and managing campaigns across a network of more than 1.1 million digital screens.\n\nThe move comes at an opportune time: One-third of the $10 billion in expected out-of-home ad spending in the U.S. over the next three years will be dedicated to digital OOH platforms, according to eMarketer.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s latest move is a demonstration of the company\u2019s commitment to building its Advertising Solutions unit as a viable and sustainable revenue source. Last year, the carrier unveiled its in-store retail media network (that included its T Life app) and partnered with Plex as a connected TV provider. The telecom also partnered with Uber to provide the ride-hailing company\u2019s JourneyTV on T-Mobile phone screens when a ride is in process.\n\nThe Vistar acquisition gives T-Mobile another platform to extend its Advertising Solutions unit\u2019s reach significantly. Vistar\u2019s technology powers screens provided by nearly 370 OOH media owners that serve more than 3,000 advertisers. According to T-Mobile, the combination of Vistar\u2019s scale and T-Mobile\u2019s customer insights and data will \u201ctransform the DOOH industry\u201d by helping advertisers create addressable and measurable campaigns with greater efficiency, ROI and more meaningful and engaging content.\n\n\u201cT-Mobile is always envisioning new ways to deliver for consumers and we see a tremendous opportunity to provide more relevant and personalized advertising,\u201d said JP Colaco, senior vice president and chief T-Ads officer at T-Mobile, in a release. \u201cCombining T-Mobile\u2019s customer-centric approach and its expertise as one of the nations most scaled marketers, with Vistar\u2019s leading out-of-home technology means advertisers can easily place their ads where they know their audience will be, improving every step of the customer journey.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition comes months after Vistar appointed Sean Cheyney as its head of retail media, a new role for the company. In that role, Cheney was tasked with leading the company\u2019s retail media strategy and integrating Vistar\u2019s OOH solutions into the retail media ecosystem. It\u2019s unclear how the acquisition could affect that role.",

The passwordless, device-bound passkeys replaced legacy authentication to further secure the Un-carrier\u2019s work systems and information amidst the growing escalation of cyber threats, stopping unauthorized credential use by bad actors over the last year.\n\nEnterprises and other organizations that rely on legacy multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods like passwords and one-time passwords (OTPs) can be susceptible to one of the most common tactics used by bad actors \u2014 phishing attacks. Typically, this involves sending a fake or fraudulent email, text or other communication in an attempt to steal someone\u2019s sensitive information.\n\nWith Yubico\u2019s FIDO2 security keys, T-Mobile\u2019s teams no longer have to change or remember their passwords, or type in OTP codes that could be intercepted by bad actors; they use their YubiKey to passwordlessly authenticate and verify their identity to gain access to the resources they need.\n\n\u201cT-Mobile took a critical step forward to further reduce credential phishing by deploying the stronger, device-bound passkey solution that Yubico offers,\u201d said Jeff Simon, chief security officer, T-Mobile. \u201cOnce we had our YubiKeys in hand we were able to get them up and running across the company in less than three months, and we\u2019ve seen the positive results after just one year of having them.

These attacks not only result in billions of dollars in yearly losses for businesses but threaten the safe interconnected operation of critical infrastructure and services, from government agencies to financial institutions, factories, healthcare and human rights organizations.\n\nYubico has pioneered enterprise hardware-based security keys since 2007, championing open authentication standards and delivering modern, device-bound passkey authentication security at scale to customers. YubiKeys support multiple phishing-resistant authentication protocols such as FIDO2/WebAuthn, U2F and Smart Card (PIV). This provides a pathway to passwordless authentication for enterprises of any size. With support for hundreds of applications and services, YubiKeys deliver seamless operation across all operating systems and mobile devices, are easy to use and help save time for IT help desks in resetting passwords for employees. This form of modern MFA positions enterprises to take advantage of passwordless environments across their many applications, teams and business processes, including retail environments.\n\nTo hear more about T-Mobile\u2019s cybersecurity, go here.

Without knowing if it\u2019s a tax, a new type of rate or a mistake, you simply don\u2019t question it because you don\u2019t understand it, but now, 23 consumers have taken T-Mobile to court over this case, a class action lawsuit that is causing a lot of talk\n\nClass action lawsuit for deceptive prices\n\nThat\u2019s right. T-Mobile, one of the most recognized telecommunications companies in the United States, is in the middle of a legal fight. 23 customers have filed a class action lawsuit against the company claiming and accusing it of deceptive practices (with hidden charges disguised as mandatory fees)\n\nWhat is the customers\u2019 claim?\n\nHave you heard of the charge known as the \u201cRegulatory Programs and Telco Recovery Fee (RPTR Fee?)?\u201d Well, according to the plaintiffs, this charge appears on the invoices as if it were a fee imposed by the government, but it is not! It is just a camouflaged price increase that the telecommunications company has used to get more money from its customers!! So, when customers realized this, they have felt quite vulnerable as consumers and have decided to class-action lawsuit against the company.\n\nWhat is a class action lawsuit?\n\nA legal process in which a group of people with the same problem join together to file a case against a company in order to save on court costs. Instead of each person filing their own lawsuit, they all seek a solution in a single trial. This makes the process more efficient and allows people who might not be able to take on a large corporation alone a chance to be heard.\n\nWhat has T-Mobile responded to this accusation?\n\nThe company has washed its hands of the situation and has pointed out that this fee is described on its website as part of the network infrastructure and not as a government tax, but that is not the case. The fact is that the company has implemented this charge without notifying consumers, which further aggravates the accusations of unethical behaviour.\n\nSo what are the plaintiffs asking for?\n\nThe lawsuit not only wants the affected parties to receive money, but also for T-Mobile to foot the legal bills. But there\u2019s a catch: T-Mobile\u2019s terms and conditions say that customers can\u2019t participate in class-action lawsuits or jury trials. Instead, any disputes must be resolved through binding arbitration (customer and company agree to have an impartial person make a final decision), which is a private and more limited process.\n\nSo unless customers can prove that arbitration is unfair\u2026 it doesn\u2019t look like the lawsuit has much of a future.\n\nFrom now on we will have to be careful with the terms and conditions that we accept from companies, and, above all, we will have to carefully examine all the receipts that arrive in our name. Who knows if some company is taking advantage of our ignorance?",

The passwordless, device-bound passkeys replaced legacy authentication to further secure the Un-carrier\u2019s work systems and information amidst the growing escalation of cyber threats, stopping unauthorized credential use by bad actors over the last year.\n\nEnterprises and other organizations that rely on legacy multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods like passwords and one-time passwords (OTPs) can be susceptible to one of the most common tactics used by bad actors \u2014 phishing attacks. Typically, this involves sending a fake or fraudulent email, text or other communication in an attempt to steal someone\u2019s sensitive information.\n\nWith Yubico\u2019s FIDO2 security keys, T-Mobile\u2019s teams no longer have to change or remember their passwords, or type in OTP codes that could be intercepted by bad actors; they use their YubiKey to passwordlessly authenticate and verify their identity to gain access to the resources they need.\n\n\u201cT-Mobile took a critical step forward to further reduce credential phishing by deploying the stronger, device-bound passkey solution that Yubico offers,\u201d said Jeff Simon, chief security officer, T-Mobile. \u201cOnce we had our YubiKeys in hand we were able to get them up and running across the company in less than three months, and we\u2019ve seen the positive results after just one year of having them. That progress is even more important in today\u2019s environment where bad actors continue to wage sophisticated campaigns to attempt to infiltrate telecommunication networks. YubiKeys continue to be an important element of how we approach cyber protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cAI and the sophistication of bad actors continue to evolve, putting enterprises and their personnel at higher risk than ever before. To protect against phishing attacks, companies need to act now to adopt and implement hardware-based security keys, which are the strongest multi-factor authentication available,\u201d said Jerrod Chong, president and COO, Yubico. \u201cT-Mobile\u2019s deployment of YubiKeys is a great example of how enterprises committed to cybersecurity can rapidly and effectively deploy YubiKeys to reduce phishing.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) observed almost five million unique phishing attacks, which is the worst year on record. These attacks not only result in billions of dollars in yearly losses for businesses but threaten the safe interconnected operation of critical infrastructure and services, from government agencies to financial institutions, factories, healthcare and human rights organizations.\n\nYubico has pioneered enterprise hardware-based security keys since 2007, championing open authentication standards and delivering modern, device-bound passkey authentication security at scale to customers. YubiKeys support multiple phishing-resistant authentication protocols such as FIDO2/WebAuthn, U2F and Smart Card (PIV). This provides a pathway to passwordless authentication for enterprises of any size. With support for hundreds of applications and services, YubiKeys deliver seamless operation across all operating systems and mobile devices, are easy to use and help save time for IT help desks in resetting passwords for employees. This form of modern MFA positions enterprises to take advantage of passwordless environments across their many applications, teams and business processes, including retail environments.\n\nTo hear more about T-Mobile\u2019s cybersecurity, go here.

They were inches away from securing a second at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nBut for the fourth straight game, the Knights couldn\u2019t dig themselves all the way out of a deep hole.

The Blues went on to win the shootout 2-1.\n\nThe Knights (29-14-4) did get a point for the first time in four games (0-3-1) and for the second time in their last seven (1-5-1).

It was the fact that their goals came too late.\n\nThe Knights trailed by multiple goals for the fourth straight game. They\u2019ve rallied to tie things up or get within a goal all four times, but haven\u2019t won once.\n\nWhat cost them Monday was the same thing that cost them in Saturday\u2019s loss to the Chicago Blackhawks: Late goals.\n\nBlues left wing Nathan Walker scored on a rebound with 17 seconds left in the first period to put his team up 2-1. Defenseman Cam Fowler scored a power-play goal with 31 seconds remaining in the second to increase St. Louis\u2019 lead to 4-2.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got veteran guys that understand the time and score and situation,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nThe Knights have used their resiliency as a rallying cry. Those limits have been tested over the last seven games.\n\nThey\u2019ll have to see if their late push Monday can springboard them in the right direction.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple days where we\u2019ll work on things,\u201d McNabb said. \u201cKind of get ahead of it before it gets worse.\u201d\n\nHere are three takeaways from the loss:\n\n1.

He looked up at the ceiling after the puck trickled past the net.\n\nThe Knights had another chance with 27 seconds left in overtime when captain Mark Stone got a breakaway. His shot attempt went wide.\n\nThe Knights feel much differently if one of those looks go in.\n\n\u201cI thought we left some plays on the table,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that was we\u2019re going through it a little bit, or it just isn\u2019t cooperating.\u201d\n\n2. Hertl stays hot\n\nHertl has been one of the Knights\u2019 few bright spots of late. He has five goals and 10 points during the team\u2019s last six games.\n\nHertl also is leading a line with Dorofeyev and left wing Victor Olofsson that\u2019s been the Knights\u2019 best the past few games.\n\n3. Second period conundrum\n\nThe Knights controlled play in the second period for the second straight game. It didn\u2019t matter.\n\nThey gave up just five shots to the Blues (23-21-4) in the frame, but two of them got past Hill. Only one of the Knights\u2019 10 shots in the period beat St. Louis goaltender Jordan Binnington.\n\nIt was similar to Saturday, when the team outshot Chicago 17-3 in the middle frame but still entered the second intermission trailing 4-3.\n\nContact Danny Webster at dwebster@reviewjournal.com.

            "content": "What is the best internet provider in Horseheads, New York?\n\nLocated just outside the Finger Lakes in upstate New York, Horseheads offers its residents more than one decent option for getting online. But Spectrum Internet remains CNET\u2019s pick for the best internet service provider in Horseheads, despite its price increases. The service internet provider offers wide availability in the village, straightforward pricing and reliable speeds compared with fixed wireless providers or satellite internet. According to the latest data from the Federal Communications Commission, Spectrum is available to 93% of Horseheads, meaning if you live within the city limits, you\u2019re probably eligible for internet service from Spectrum.\n\nIf your house is eligible for fiber from Empire Access, you can\u2019t go wrong with a fiber connection. Empire Access offers the fastest internet speeds in the city, up to 2,000Mbps download and upload for some lucky residents. It also offers two other plans: $50 a month for 500Mbps and $70 for 1,000Mbps. Those are decently affordable prices, coming out to a cost per Mbps of 10 and 7 cents, respectively.\n\nIf your address is not eligible for fiber from Empire Access and you\u2019d prefer to cut the cords on cable, Verizon and T-Mobile both offer a significant 5G home internet footprint in Horseheads. Based on a wider availability, Verizon 5G Home Internet is the best fixed wireless option in the city. Verizon\u2019s 5G internet service is available to 92% of the city compared with T-Mobile Home Internet\u2019s 56%, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Verizon offers faster speeds than T-Mobile Home Internet, maxing out at 1,000Mbps in some areas. Besides offering faster speeds and being more broadly available than T-Mobile Home Internet, Verizon\u2019s 5G Home Internet also comes with a few perks like a two- to three-year price guarantee, depending on what plan you choose and streaming bundle add-ons for just $10 extra a month.\n\nIf you're on the hunt for cheap internet, your best bet is to bundle your fixed wireless internet plan with an eligible phone plan from either T-Mobile or Verizon, which can bring your monthly costs down by $10 to $25, depending on the provider. Otherwise, most internet plans in Horseheads start at $50 monthly. After the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program, New York recently mandated internet service providers offer internet for as low as $15 a month for qualifying low-income households, but while we're waiting for that law to kick in, some providers already offer a few discounts to qualifying households. Spectrum Internet Access, for example, offers 50Mbps for just $25 monthly for qualifying households that participate in eligible government assistance programs. T-Mobile offers low-income students 100GB of free hotspot internet a year with Project 10Million, and Verizon offers discount opportunities to bring your monthly cost down to $20 in some cases with Verizon Forward. If none of these discounts apply to you and you're still searching for a more affordable internet option in Horseheads, your best bet is to negotiate your price with your internet provider.\n\nHorseheads internet providers compared Provider Internet technology Monthly price range Speed range Monthly equipment Data cap Contract CNET review Spectrum Internet\n\nRead full review Cable $50-$70 500-1,000Mbps Free modem; $10 router rental (optional) None None 7.2 Empire Access Fiber $50-$100 500-2,000Mbps None None None N/A T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($40-$50 for eligible mobile plans) 72-245Mbps None None None 7.4 Verizon 5G Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$45 with qualifying mobile plans) 50-300Mbps None None None 7.2 Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet in Horsehead?

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate video conferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and video conferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like video conferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Horseheads\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary pricing, availability and speed database that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answers to those questions are often layered and complex, but the providers that come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Horseheads FAQs\n\nWhat\u2019s the best internet service in Horseheads? The best internet service in Horseheads comes from Spectrum. Although Spectrum doesn\u2019t boast the same speeds as a fiber provider, it still offers competitive rates and reliable speeds and is the most broadly available provider in the city. Show more\n\nIs fiber internet available in Horseheads? Yes, you can get fiber internet in Horseheads from Empire Access, with speeds up to 2,000Mbps for some households. Empire Access more broadly offers two plans: $50 monthly for 500Mbps and $65 monthly for 1,000Mbps. Show more\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Horseheads? There isn\u2019t a cheap internet provider in Horseheads, as most providers start at $50 a month. Your best bet for cheap internet is to bundle your home internet with an eligible phone plan with T-Mobile Home Internet or Verizon 5G Home Internet, find programs that offer discounts for eligible households or try to negotiate your price down.

(photo provided)\n\nHOOPESTON \u2014 Vermilion County moviegoers won\u2019t have to leave the county to see the next Marvel superhero movie in the theater.\n\nThe announcement many had been waiting for about the reopening of the Lorraine Theatre came Friday.\n\nThe first movie that will be shown is \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World.\u201d\n\nTicket information can be found on the theater\u2019s website at lorrainetheatre.com.\n\nOn a social media post, Save the Lorraine Foundation officials said, \u201cWe are absolutely overwhelmed with gratitude and excitement as we celebrate this incredible milestone together. It has been a long and challenging 13-year journey filled with dedication, perseverance and countless hours of hard work from our amazing volunteers. Seeing the joy on your faces as movies light up this theatre once more is truly the greatest reward. We will see everyone very soon.\u201d\n\nThe foundation announced last year that it received a $40,667 T-Mobile Hometown Grant to reach its $120,000 fundraising goal to show first-run movies at the theater again.\n\nThe upgraded equipment in the theater includes the latest sound and motion picture technology, according to foundation President Alex Houmes.\n\nThe new equipment has 36-50 surround channels, compared to the previous nine, he said.\n\nHoumes has said COVID-19 made the showing of first-run movies feasible again at the theater. With the Lorraine being a single-screen, smaller theater that can hold 318 people in its newer seats, it was tough to show a movie for four weeks or more and make a profit. Now, with the relaxed rules, after COVID-19, they can show a movie for two to three weeks, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be the only first-run theater in Vermilion County,\u201d Houmes said.\n\nThat luxury has been missing in Vermilion County since the AMC Theater closed in the Danville Village Mall three years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 13 years of fundraising and renovations to the 1922 historic theater at 324 E. Main St. in Hoopeston.\n\nBefore they could buy the movie equipment, they had to get the building usable again after being closed for about a year around 2012.\n\nTheater restoration has cost about $600,00 in total, Houmes said. He estimates the entire restoration project has been about $1.1 million in costs and donated labor.\n\nThe foundation says the Lorraine Theatre will once again be \u201cThe Best Place for Movies.\u201d\n\nFOR COMPLETE ACCESS TO NEWS-GAZETTE STORY PLEASE GO TO https://www.news-gazette.com/business/marvel-movie-welcomes-return-of-cinema-at-hoopestons-lorraine-theatre/article_08a8a74c-d517-11ef-b26c-aba5e1ca5d7c.html",

The Golden Knights salvaged a point from the game and are now 29-14-4 for 62 points.\n\nAfter the game, VGK coach Bruce Cassidy said he had multiple feelings throughout this game. At first, Cassidy said he thought the team might not get a point in the standings. Then he thought VGK could have drawn two points on Eichel\u2019s missed tap-in in overtime. And in the end, Vegas snagged one point.\n\n*\n\nThe first period ended with the Knights shaking their heads.\n\nAfter Brayden Schenn snapped a wrister past VGK goalie Adin Hill, Tomas Hertl tied the game with a power play goal from in close for his 16th of the season.\n\nIt was 1-1 with only 16.4 second left in the first period when fourth-liner Nathan Walker gave the Blues a 2-1 lead.\n\nThings were not working out for Vegas in the second period when Jake Neighbours skated in and snapped a shot past Hill for a 3-1 lead.\n\nPROMO\n\nBrett Howden scored an important goal for Vegas when he turned around and slapped in a shot past St. Louis netminder Jordan Binnington midway through the middle stanza.\n\nHowden\u2019s 16th of the season cut into the Blues\u2019 lead at 3-2.\n\nIt was a strong announced crowd of 17,819 for the MLK Day game, which started at 3 PM Monday.\n\nFor VGK fans, they lamented the way the Knights finished the second period.\n\nAlexander Holtz took an ill-advised penalty and St. Louis made the VGK pay on the power play with a goal by defenseman Cam Fowler with only 31 seconds to go in the middle period.\n\nThe Knights trailed, 4-2, heading into the second intermission.\n\nThe Knights had their chances in the third period. And they cashed in.\n\nThey pulled Hill and Eichel scored a 6-on-5 goal to slice the two-goal in half to a mere goal.\n\nVGK applied heavy pressure on Binnington in the final minute and Vegas scored the equalizer when Shea Theodore slid the puck to Pavel Dorofeyev who ripped a rocket past the Blues goalie for a dramatic game-tying goal from the right circle for a 4-4 tie with only about 30 seconds left in regulation.\n\nThe game went into OT.\n\nThen a shootout, with the Blues winning the SO.\n\nFinal: St. Louis 5 Vegas 4 in a shootout.\n\nVGK hit the road with games in St. Louis and Dallas this week before playing their next home game here in Las Vegas against the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers Sunday at 5 PM.",

            "content": "As the first CMO at Bose, Jim Mollica has sought to differentiate the audio brand through strategic partnerships that keep it not only connected to culture but intertwined with it.\n\nBose recently collaborated with Ronnie Fieg, founder of lifestyle brand Kith, to redesign the brand\u2019s iconic 901 speakers, from finish to fabric to color palette. It also partnered with jewelry designer Maggie Simpkins to create diamond-set Bose earbuds, drawing the attention of rapper Travis Scott and several NBA All-Stars. \u201cOur goal is to be there as a rallying point in all these environments where music is endemic to the experience,\u201d Mollica told Chief Marketer.\n\nAutomotive partnerships, such as providing in-cabin speakers for Porsche, are critical as well. Bose\u2019s recent acquisition of McIntosh Group, parent company of luxury audio brands McIntosh and Sonus faber, signals more innovation to come in automotive sound and in-car experiences. It\u2019s a key part of the brand\u2019s future, according to Mollica, and shaped its presence at CES this year.\n\nWe caught up with the marketing chief at its CES brand space in the T-Mobile Arena to discuss partnership strategy, automotive innovation, the significance of creator-led content and marketing trends to watch.\n\nChief Marketer: Tell me about Bose\u2019s decision to be here in the Arena, and not on the CES show floor.\n\nJim Mollica, CMO at Bose: With the new brands McIntosh and Sonos faber, it made a lot of sense for us to have some additional space here, meeting with our partners, talking about all the new innovation within automotive. As you can tell, there\u2019s just so much happening in that space. Does it become a living room with wheels? Is it still a driving experience? How important is the entertainment and communication components of those? Removing people from the distraction\u2014and there\u2019s a lot of extraordinarily confidential innovation that\u2019s in this\u2014probably makes the most sense.\n\nCM: What\u2019s different about the brand\u2019s activation this year?\n\nJM: I can\u2019t speak to distant history; I\u2019ve only been here for four years. But typically, the consumer side of our business doesn\u2019t do any kind of big exhibit. But a lot of our people come here, because it\u2019s become such an encompassing gathering\u2014from technology to marketing, to data, to advertising, to broader business. There\u2019s just a lot of business that can be done, and you find\u2014at least I\u2019ve found\u2014it\u2019s incredibly efficient to come here and meet with lots of people in a three- or four-day period as opposed to multiple trips that you\u2019re trying to get on a calendar.\n\nThat being said, our automotive team finds this to be a great opportunity to talk to our existing partners and potential new partners about all of the innovation that we had. We\u2019ve a 40-plus year history in automotive, and it\u2019s been so long that we\u2019ve created so many incredible experiences in-cabin that this is just a nice showcase. We have all of our OEM [Original Equipment Manufacturer] partners here and can spend some real quality time with them.\n\nCM: On the CMO point\u2026 In your view, why did the brand decide to hire its first CMO?\n\nJM: The company had such a strong leader and founder. And what I have found is that most founder-led companies have a leader that has found an unarticulated need in the market\u2014not just the product, but the story around the product. Bose is a very product-centric innovation company\u2026 And I think the business had realized that they needed to augment that with strong storytelling and emotional pull. We always had incredible technology and best-in-class products, but I don\u2019t know that we always told the story in an emotionally-connective way.\n\nI felt like the opportunity here was not to argue that we have the best ones and zeros. We do, but what most people, when you have a passion point like music, really want is the emotion that music pushes. Whether it\u2019s helping you get through that last mile on your run or the last set at the gym, or elevating the mood of a dinner party that you\u2019re having, or following the misery of a terrible breakup\u2014all these things people use music for, this elevator of emotion. And that was the real opportunity: how to more emotionally and culturally connect the brand.\n\nOne of the great ways to do that is to collaborate with other brands, other people that have that same kind of deep connection to music. Our products are really made for the passionate music fan. And if you are going to prioritize the best sound in the world, then you\u2019re going to buy a premium product like ours.\n\nCM: How do you choose those partnerships?\n\nJM: We like to partner with other people that deeply care about music, and it influences who they are. With Ronnie from Kith, we bonded over nineties hip hop and how much that meant to him in starting and creating the brand, and what music inspires him and part of his everyday life. That became the instrumental foundation for our entire partnership. And I think that becomes fertile storytelling that then allows us to play in areas of culture that probably you wouldn\u2019t otherwise [expect us to be in].\n\nCM: So in terms of your vision, cultural partnerships are an important part of it.\n\nJM: Definitely. My goal within the brand was to celebrate that we are this fiercely independent company that is only dedicated to products that produce sound. And we are the only one out there that does this. All of our competitors are these giant tech companies. And they make laptops and phones and washing machines, and they have movie studios and ad networks. Music is a side hustle to them. We have this community of rabid music fans that have dedicated their lives to creating the best products for all these discreet listening occasions. Our Open Ear product is created for a specific use case of listening. Our over-the-ear, the world\u2019s heavyweight champion in noise cancellation, is created for a different kind of music experience for you. The sound bars, our speakers in a vehicle, etc.\n\nI wanted to make sure that we were celebrating that through all of the places where these rabid, passionate music fans would be\u2014where music\u2019s endemic, where it\u2019s really part of it. Basketball and music are so intertwined\u2026 [It\u2019s] the same thing with festivals or fashion shows. When we first showed up at New York Fashion Week, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand why we\u2019d be so intertwined with that as well. But music and fashion inspire one another. All fashion shows are created to a soundtrack. Many of the designers are using certain artists or records that help influence them for that season\u2019s design. And that\u2019s where we launched our Open Ear products last year, at Paris Fashion Week with Kith. Our goal is to be there as a rallying point in all these environments where music is endemic to the experience.\n\nCM: What\u2019s your strategy to attract younger generations? I imagine you\u2019re doing that through cultural partnerships. But anything else?\n\nJM: A lot of this is through the way that you reach them and introducing them to a brand with such backstory and heritage\u2026 Our fastest growing group of consumers is 18 to 24. And it\u2019s partly [because of] the artists that we\u2019re partnering with. We\u2019re not partnering with the biggest and the most famous. We\u2019re partnering with the artist\u2019s artists, and we\u2019re going long tail, and we\u2019re going sub genres\u2014because that\u2019s what you expect from a music-first, independent brand.\n\nSo the signal, when we do a partnership with [rapper] Central Cee in the UK, becomes, oh, wow, that\u2019s interesting. We had done something with a storied indie band, Guided by Voices. We had done something with a Detroit experimental group called Wolf Eyes. And then part of is the content and the media that we use. We spend a lot of time creating content\u2014not advertising\u2014earning people\u2019s time and attention on platforms like TikTok and YouTube.\n\nCM: So creator-led content is huge.\n\nJM: Absolutely. Some of it we do, some of it\u2019s production, a lot of it is creator-led. We treat is almost like a programming slate. For my background, I spent a lot of time at Disney and Viacom/Paramount. And I learned that you can create really interesting, compelling stories that don\u2019t have to be advertising. Your product or the DNA of what you\u2019re focused on is part of the meta theme, but entertaining people and getting their attention and being connected to the core principles of what your brand\u2019s all about are really the most compelling elements.\n\nSo [it\u2019s about] doing that with creators and giving them latitude to go and create, and creating a significant flow of content. We probably produce 10,000 pieces of content a month, flowing that through channels like TikTok, Snap, YouTube. Creating longform on YouTube has been instrumental in the passion and interest of younger audiences. The most successful things we have are the more niche influencers that have a lot more authority.\n\nCM: How do you balance your efforts to target more niche with bigger brand awareness plays? Because it\u2019s getting more and more niche, and it seems like it\u2019s additional.\n\nJM: It is. I think one of the advantages I have is having experience as a programmer, coming from a TV network, or a digital publisher when I was in my old world. You create development slates and you hire people that aren\u2019t based in advertising. They\u2019re storytellers that are creating content for you. And some of that is amassing armies and creating great content. And some of that is going specifically to certain production companies that are creating certain things. And other moments, it\u2019s engaging in podcasts and in a very different format around music and the celebration of music. And some of that\u2019s experiential. I think all of those things are additive.\n\nYes, there\u2019s a moment for brand advertising on TV. It\u2019s becoming less and less linear and more and more streaming. I\u2019m finding that a bunch of the content that we ended up creating for different purposes works incredibly well in streaming, where it wouldn\u2019t work as well in linear, because of dynamic insertion and with the ad units [being] more highly-targeted.\n\nThe key is that you can\u2019t get caught up in one channel, and you have to figure out how you share the burden of content creation with the outside world. And then, what are you doing on your own? And then what becomes more AI-driven that can be parsed? So you can take care of some of those long-tail, geographical, regional things.\n\nCM: Back to technology, since we\u2019re at CES\u2026 Automotive is more on display here than consumer products, as you mentioned. Is automotive the future of the company?\n\nJM: I think it\u2019s part of the future. It\u2019s an incredibly important part of our company and a really large part of our business. But I think you really can\u2019t have one without the other. If you create an incredibly strong consumer brand, it obviously pays massive dividends to licenses and partnerships within other arenas, vehicles being one of them. Other technology products can also incorporate sound into it. It just becomes a much more compelling partnership that way. And then once your product\u2019s in a Porsche, for example, the way that that reinforces in this virtuous circle, the consumer demand is really a beautiful thing. But I think it has to start with creating a consumer brand, taking it into these partnerships and letting those partnerships then help accentuate it back into the consumer brand.\n\nCM: My last question for you: Are there any marketing trends that you expect to break through (or fade out) in the next year?\n\nJM: I think the way that we consider the viewership around sports programming and some live events feels broken, feels off. We\u2019re looking at ratings, but in reality, if you look at the way people are consuming award shows or sporting events, so much of that is coming from clips and highlights that are being created by the leagues, but they\u2019re not necessarily seen as valuable engagement yet, because they\u2019re not measured together into an attention or engagement metric. And I think figuring out how you move to that model for brands is really important in the linear [TV] side of the world.\n\nI continue to think that podcasts\u2014with the amount of consumer consumption, attention, share of media time from consumers\u2014is still a dramatically undervalued play for people. The key is figuring out the right kind of content format that works for you there, and I think everyone\u2019s still experimenting.\n\nCM: Podcast video is picking up quite a bit.\n\nJM: A hundred percent. But even just audio podcasts would still drive the majority of the listens. But think about it: Are you creating this high-level, audio insertion with an ambassador, or are you using a recorded live read from the host? Is there a completely different storyline that you\u2019re adding? Are you creating your own serialized podcast or experience? So I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity there.\n\nWhile you have powerful recommendation engines, I think they\u2019re still missing an element of human curation and taste that will make it easier. I don\u2019t know about you, but as great as the algorithm is on Netflix, I still can\u2019t find something to watch within 25 minutes. It\u2019s the same thing with Spotify, which is wonderful at the content that they recommend, but there feels like there\u2019s an element [missing], like another layer of curation. Who makes sense of the metadata? I think there will be a push towards that coming in the future.",

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a quick connection with dependable download and upload speeds. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines: internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics -- browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one person sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two people to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more people to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Mankato\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary pricing, availability and speed database that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Mankato FAQs\n\nWhat's the best internet service provider in Mankato?

Some of them are even specifically geared towards on-the-go use for camping and whatnot, like Starlink Roam and T-Mobile Home Internet Away. The service that is best for you depends on how you plan to use it. If you live somewhere without reliable hardwired broadband access or you want a fallback option in case your hardwired connection goes down, then basic home plans from satellite and 5G internet service providers are fine. If you're going to be traveling with an access point, though, then some ISPs (internet service providers) have plans like Roam or Away when available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk's ISP is a popular choice for rural and mobile broadband, especially with Starlink's thousands of low-orbit satellites. As a mobile option, though, you might expect there to be metered data or at least an allotment of high speed data that slows down after it runs out, as that kind of arrangement is much more common with wireless ISPs. As it so happens, there are no outright data caps on any of Starlink's plans \u2014 though, it is more complicated than that. Some are completely unlimited, while others have tiers of \"priority\" vs. \"mobile\" data, not unlike priority data on wireless phone plans. To demystify how all of this works, let's take a more detailed look at each tier and how they handle the issue of data caps.\n\nAdvertisement",

            "content": "You've heard of the big names in 5G home internet: T-Mobile, Verizon, Starry and AT&T Internet Air, but what is 5G home internet and what makes this technology stand out from the rest?\n\nFor most Americans, internet service providers are a constant source of stress to consumers and, notoriously, one of the lowest-rated industries in the US. ISPs rank lower than social media, the US Postal Service and even airlines. We can collectively agree on why: wading through confusing details like hidden fees, yearly price hikes, contracts, service details and even the different speeds, can make for a frustrating experience.\n\nMany rural Americans know how difficult it is to find a good internet provider at their address, some can often feel like there are hardly any options at all. Could 5G be the answer?\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nThe technology powering the latest phones is tackling our household broadband needs. In addition, cellular internet like 5G could help rural and underserved communities to stay connected. According to the 2024 J.D. Power Survey, 5G home internet can be a cheaper and more accessible internet connection type than cable or fiber. It may not produce the fastest speeds, but customers are willing to overlook that. CNET has reviewed all the major 5G services and we've got the details on how they work, what speeds you can expect, what it costs and where it's available. Read on to see if a 5G connection is for you.\n\nSo, what is 5G home internet?\n\nSimply put, 5G stands for the fifth generation. The fifth generation of what? The fifth generation of wireless data networks. You're probably most familiar with hearing 5G used to describe better mobile communications and speedier phones. You're not wrong: 5G networks, which use different radio frequencies than previous generations, aim to provide faster data speeds with much less lag or delay than we had with 4G. However, while 5G cellular service might be available on your phone, 5G home internet is not as widely available.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nHow fast is 5G home internet?\n\nMy CNET colleague Eli Blumenthal does a great job of breaking down the basics of 5G. Millimeter-wave technology uses higher frequencies than previous generations, providing faster speeds and connections. Those higher, gigabit speeds come with a price: the data doesn't travel the same distance as 4G and has more trouble with obstructions. To combat that, midband technology, which offers speeds averaging between 300 and 400 megabits per second, increases the coverage area provided by millimeter-wave. Finally, low-band 5G offers a range similar to 4G but speeds between 100 and 200Mbps.\n\nIs 5G home internet the same as 5GHz?\n\nNope. One common mistake is to see the \"5GHz\" setting on your Wi-Fi router and assume you have access to 5G. Wi-Fi routers also use short-range radio frequencies (typically either 2.4GHz or 5GHz) to transmit your internet signal to connected devices within your home. 5GHz might be one of the band options for your home's Wi-Fi system, but it's not the same as 5G, which is a cellular technology that uses higher-frequency waves.\n\nCable, DSL and fiber internet plans require wires connecting your home to the provider's grid. Fixed wireless services, like 5G, connect your home to a provider's network over the air. Taylor Martin/CNET\n\nHow does 5G home internet stand out?\n\nMost ISPs deliver internet service via phone lines or cables connecting your home to a more extensive network. That includes common internet connection types like digital subscriber lines or DSL, coaxial cable and fiber-optic internet. Those are all wired connections from your provider to your home.\n\n5G home internet, on the other hand, is a fixed wireless internet service, which means that the connection between your provider and your home is not wired. With 5G, you will need an indoor or outdoor 5G receiver at your house to pick up the signal. It's similar to satellite internet, but instead of beaming in a signal from satellites orbiting in the night sky, it's relaying information from a much closer wireless hub. Although you're using the same 5G network as your mobile phone, the gateway is specific to your location and cannot be used elsewhere.\n\nWhat providers offer 5G home internet?\n\n5G is still being deployed across the country. Therefore, the number of providers offering any 5G home internet plan is relatively limited. Your 5G home internet options are AT&T Internet Air, Starry, T-Mobile and Verizon. All prices listed on this page reflect available discounts for setting up paperless billing. If you decide not to go with automatic monthly payments, your monthly bill will be higher. Now, let's explore what each offers.\n\nAT&T Internet Air Price range $60 per month Speed range 75-225Mbps Connection Fixed Wireless Key Info Equipment included, no contracts, no overage fees AT&T Internet Air uses AT&T's 5G wireless network and features download speeds between 90 and 300Mbps. The setup process is as simple as plugging in your router, setting up the Wi-Fi network and figuring out the best location in your home. CNET's broadband expert Joe Supan discovered this at home, taking him only 11 minutes to set up. When it comes to latency, AT&T Internet is on par with T-Mobile, Starry and Verizon, featuring a latency between 30 to 65ms. The straightforward pricing (just one plan for $60 or $47 when bundled with an eligible AT&T wireless plan), terms of service and decent speeds make Internet Air a reliable option for many customers with access to it. The Internet Air router is included in your monthly cost and you save money since no professional installation is required. AT&T offers mesh Wi-Fi extenders for an additional $10 monthly for improved connection. There are no overage fees, data caps or contracts. Read our picks for the best Wi-Fi extenders available in the market right now. What AT&T Internet Air lacks, however, is the same availability as its competitors. Although it's available across 48 states, many of those locations boast equal availability for AT&T's fiber internet option, which outpaces fixed wireless in terms of fast, reliable speeds and cost per Mbps.

Upload speeds are not symmetrical and will plateau at 50Mbps or less because Verizon does not exclusively use millimeter-wave technology, but rather a mix of low-band, mid-band and millimeter-wave. Verizon 5G Home Internet pricing is $50 a month for 50 to 300Mbps or $70 monthly for 85 to 1,000Mbps, plus some extra perks. Unlike most ISPs, you can expect a two to three-year price lock. Either way, it's an all-in price that includes equipment, setup fees and taxes. Like all other Verizon plans, it requires no contracts or data caps. Verizon offers many promos and deals to sweeten the pot for potential customers. First, both plans come with a price lock of up to five years, a rare gem in the world of broadband. In addition, if you switch to Verizon, eligible customers can receive an early termination fee credit of up to $500. Second, 5G Home Plus customers can have a free Netflix and Max subscription for a year. Lastly, customers with qualifying Verizon mobile plans will get a discount on the monthly cost of either plan, bringing them down to $35 or $45 monthly. Read our Verizon 5G Home Internet review.

While the list of cities seems to expand nearly every month, most are larger US cities.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet is the most widely available service among the three highlighted providers, with coverage of 60%, according to the FCC. While Verizon's 5G home internet service is now available to 40 million homes, T-Mobile leapfrogged that by expanding its fixed wireless service to over 50 million households. Still, T-Mobile acknowledges it does not have unlimited availability across those locations due to network capacity.\n\nVerizon's 5G Home Internet is currently offered in approximately 900 markets or 19% of the country. Although the total number of households in which it is available is less than T-Mobile's, it does cover more cities.\n\nAT&T Internet Air is not quite as widely available as T-Mobile Home Internet or Verizon 5G Home Internet. The service is still slowly expanding but making decent progress, available to nearly 100 locations in 48 states and covers just over 14% of the country.\n\nStarry Internet is available in Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington, DC serving only 1% of the country, according to the FCC.\n\nFinal thoughts: Is 5G home internet for you?\n\nThe first thing to say is what we always say regarding ISPs: No matter how good the service, it's all moot if it's unavailable at your address. 5G technology is still being rolled out nationwide, so we should expect to see some bumps in the road as that effort continues.\n\nStill, 5G home internet availability is increasing at a pretty rapid pace. The affordable, straightforward pricing is vastly appealing and it's what jumps off the page for me. Time will tell if that trend holds as availability continues to expand. It would be a real step forward if 5G could emerge as a viable broadband option for traditionally underserved parts of rural America. As CNET alum Rick Broida put it after he tested T-Mobile's service, \"Imperfection is a lot more tolerable when you're paying less than half what you were before.\"\n\n5G home internet FAQs\n\nIs 5G home internet cheaper than other connection types? 5G home internet is one of the more affordable options available considering the decent download speeds that current plans average. T-Mobile averages just over 100Mbps, Starry chimes in at 200Mbps and Verizon's median speed is 300Mbps. The lowest monthly cost among the three main providers is $15 (Starry's low-cost option) and the highest is $70 (T-Mobile and Verizon 5G Home Internet Plus without the mobile discount). Each provider's monthly costs include all fees, taxes, equipment and installation charges. So the monthly charge you see is the monthly charge you pay. Lastly, none require term contracts, so you won't have to fear any early termination fees.\n\nIs 5G fast enough for home internet? In theory, 5G should enable a speedy connection that will match or improve what you get with cable or fiber internet. That's usually not the case regarding the reality of 5G home internet. To increase the reliability and coverage of the 5G internet service, most providers rely on a mix of millimeter-wave, low-band and midband technology -- as well as 4G LTE in some cases -- and this means home internet customers won't see the real high-end capabilities of 5G at present. You should see well over the average speeds of your typical DSL and satellite internet plans.\n\nWhat does the 'G' stand for in 5G? It simply means generation. In other words, 5G is the fifth generation of cellular technology.",

            "content": "SpaceX's Starlink is trying to exempt itself from a New York law requiring ISPs to offer internet plans starting at $15 per month for low-income residents.\n\nOn Wednesday, New York\u2019s Affordable Broadband Act (ABA) went into effect, forcing broadband providers to offer low-income consumers internet plans at $15 for download speeds no lower than 25Mbps and $20 per month for speeds at 200Mbps or greater.\n\nThe law could drastically reduce the price of Starlink, which costs $120 per month for residential users. But the ABA also has a loophole for small internet providers that serve \"no more than twenty thousand households\" in the state.\n\nOn Tuesday, a day before the law came into force, SpaceX filed for an exemption, which was spotted by a Reddit user. The company says Starlink serves \u201cfewer than 20,000 households within New York State,\" according to a letter to NY's Public Service Commission.\n\n\u201cAs of the date of this filing, SpaceX provides broadband to [***Begin Confidential***] [***End Confidential***] residential customers in New York. This figure is consistent with the data most recently filed with the Federal Communications Commission, accounting for user growth since such filing,\u201d the letter adds.\n\nThe disclosure might be surprising since SpaceX told the FCC last August it had over 1.4 million Starlink customers in the US. However, the satellite internet service is less used in densely populated areas like New York City, which already have access to high-speed ISPs. Instead, Starlink is usually more popular in rural areas, where traditional broadband options are limited or unreliable.\n\nNew York\u2019s Department of Public Service tells PCMag that SpaceX's request is under review.\n\nThe law notes the state\u2019s Public Service Commission can issue an exemption if it \u201cdetermines that compliance with such requirements would result in unreasonable or unsustainable financial impact on the broadband service provider.\u201d\n\nOther smaller ISPs, including Windstream New York, have also filed for the same exemption, saying they serve under 20,000 households in the state.\n\nAT&T decided to shut down its 5G home internet service in the state because the law \"imposes harmful rate regulations that make it uneconomical for AT&T to invest in and expand our broadband infrastructure in the state.\"",

Spectrum is the area's main ISP, but T-Mobile Home Internet or satellite internet may work for you, depending on what's available at your address.\n\nIf you\u2019re hunting for the lowest prices or fastest speeds, we\u2019ve also found those top options. The cheapest internet in Val Verde Park is Spectrum\u2019s 100-megabits-per-second offering with a $30-per-month introductory price. The fastest available internet speed in Val Verde Park also comes from Spectrum, with its gig plan for as low as $70 per month, available all across town.\n\nVal Verde Park internet providers compared undefined Provider Internet technology Monthly price range Speed range Monthly equipment costs Data cap Contract CNET review score Spectrum\n\nRead full review Cable $30-$70 100-1,000Mbps Varies None None 7.2 T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$55 with eligible mobile plans) 87-415Mbps None None None 7.4 Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nOther available internet providers in Val Verde Park\n\nSatellite internet: Rural areas around Val Verde Park and Del Rio can check into satellite internet service from Starlink, Viasat or Hughesnet. Satellite internet is a fallback option for when Spectrum doesn\u2019t service your home or fixed wireless options are nonexistent, too slow or expensive. Satellite internet is pricey, but it\u2019s the only option for some locations.\n\nDowntown Del Rio, Texas, on a clear, sunny spring day. Del Rio is a neighboring town of Val Verde Park.

The $30-per-month plan offers download speeds of 100Mbps, but you may find a special deal in Val Verde Park that gets you 500Mbps speeds for the same price. Run your address or call Spectrum to determine if that offer is available. Prices will increase after the first year, and you must factor in equipment costs. T-Mobile\u2019s basic plan typically costs $55 monthly, but you may find it for $50 online. Keep an eye out for bundling deals like a special promotion with a mobile plan that lowers the 5G home internet price to $35 per month.\n\nWhat\u2019s the cheapest internet plan in Val Verde Park?\n\nundefined Provider Starting price Max download speed Monthly equipment fee Spectrum\n\nRead full review $30 100Mbps Free modem; $10 router (optional) T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review $50 ($35 with eligible mobile plans) 318Mbps None Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nHow to find internet deals and promotions in Val Verde Park\n\nThe best internet deals and top promotions in Val Verde Park depend on what discounts are available during a given time.

Others, however, including T-Mobile Home Internet and Starlink, tend to run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nHow fast is Val Verde Park broadband?\n\nOokla doesn\u2019t publish speed test data for Val Verde Park or Del Rio, so there\u2019s some guesswork involved in determining broadband speeds for the area. (Disclaimer: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) However, other communities primarily serviced by Spectrum often pull down median fixed download speeds of around 250Mbps. Most Val Verde Park residents have Spectrum, so expect that to hold true. Texas, as a state, has a median download speed of nearly 270Mbps, according to a recent Ookla speed test report.\n\nFastest internet plans in Val Verde Park\n\nundefined Provider Starting price Max download speed Max upload speed Data cap Connection type Spectrum\n\nRead full review $70 1000Mbps 35Mbps None Cable Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nWhat\u2019s a good internet speed?\n\nMost internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines -- and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics -- browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Val Verde Park\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary pricing, availability and speed database that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nWhat\u2019s the final word on internet providers in Val Verde Park?\n\nVal Verde Park\u2019s internet scene can be summed up with one word: Spectrum. The cable provider is by far the dominant ISP. You may be able to find some coverage from T-Mobile Home Internet in the wider Del Rio area. If you\u2019re in a more rural spot outside of Spectrum\u2019s coverage zone, then look to satellite internet as an option.\n\nInternet providers in Val Verde Park FAQs\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Val Verde Park? Spectrum\u2019s introductory rate of $30 per month is the cheapest in town. Check your address to see if that applies to the 100Mbps plan or your choice of the 100Mbps or 500Mbps plan. Prices go up after the first year, and you\u2019ll need to rent or buy a router.\n\nWhich internet provider in Val Verde Park offers the fastest plan? Spectrum\u2019s 1,000Mbps cable plan is the fastest in town. Upload speeds are limited to around 35Mbps.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Val Verde Park? Fiber internet is not yet available in Val Verde Park. For gig download speeds, Spectrum\u2019s cable network is your only option.",

This made some users wonder why T-Mobile decided to launch a newer app in the first place. But soon, it was rumored that the original app would be retired.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t made the switch to the T Life app, this new development will no longer allow you to choose which app to use.

T-Mobile\u2019s $600 million cash swoop for outdoor ad specialist Vistart is the latest reunion in this turbulent love story.\n\nSlated to close this spring pending approval, its ad tech\u2019s first notable deal of the year arrives as outdoor advertising cements itself as the sector\u2019s rising star.\n\nWhat truly stands out, though, is the deja vu. The bit where hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, exchange hands only to come crashing down years later? Haven\u2019t we seen this movie before?\n\nT-Mobile calls the deal a \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d for its ads business, while industry chatter dubs it a potential game-changer. The familiar chorus of hype and hyperbole rings out \u2014 because in media, some stories never change.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s worth delving into the history of the investment thesis, with its countless false dawns, to get some perspective.\n\nTelecom operators in Western Europe, North America, and notably Singtel in the Asia-Pacific region ventured into digital advertising to diversify revenues, hoping to leverage their vast customer data and establish themselves as true power players on Madison Avenue.\n\nDespite notable investments and acquisitions, they faced challenges such as regulatory hurdles, competition from tech giants, and operational inefficiencies, which led to their eventual exit.\n\nThe storied (tragic) tale of telcos and ad tech\n\nAT&T\u2019s $1.6 billion acquisition of AppNexus in 2018 marked one of the most ambitious moves into digital advertising. AppNexus became the foundation of AT&T\u2019s Xandr, which combined telecom and media assets from its $85 billion Time Warner acquisition.\n\nHowever, intense competition from tech giants, operational complexities, and tighter privacy regulations limited Xandr\u2019s success led to internal disagreements. By 2021, AT&T sold Xandr to Microsoft for approximately $1 billion, marking its exit and a significant marker to the dominance of Facebook and Google in adland.\n\nSimilarly, Verizon pursued digital advertising aggressively through its Oath division, formed after acquiring AOL in 2015 for $4.4 billion and Yahoo in 2017 for $4.48 billion. Oath aimed to leverage telecom data with digital media assets but failed to compete effectively with Google and Facebook. After rebranding as Verizon Media in 2019, the division continued to underperform, leading Verizon to sell it to Apollo Global Management for $5 billion in 2021 \u2014 further evidence suggesting media and telco businesses just can\u2019t mix.\n\nElsewhere, Spain-based Telef\u00f3nica has arguably been the leading light in this regard in Europe. In 2012, it launched Telef\u00f3nica Dynamic Insights and later invested in ad tech platform Axonix, then acquired the U.K.-based Blinkbox in 2015.\n\nArguably, the most high-profile play was in the U.K., where three of the leading telcos, EE, O2, and Vodafone, banded together to form an ad tech joint venture known as Weve in 2012, with O2 later buying out the former two telcos in 2015.\n\nFollowing the buyout, Weve shifted its focus toward programmatic advertising and beacon technology to improve location-based targeting and data analytics. However, by March 2020, Weve decided to step away from mobile advertising altogether, with many crediting this move to the decline in SMS usage, the rise of alternative communication platforms, and the dominance of tech giants like Facebook and Google in mobile advertising.\n\nFurther afield, leading APAC telco Singtel marked its entry into the global digital advertising market with its $321 million acquisition of Amobee in 2012. Amobee further expanded with the $310 million acquisition of Turn, a leading data management platform, in 2017. However, its traction was again foiled by increasing competition, operational costs, and privacy regulations; thus, in 2022, Singtel sold Amobee to Tremor International, a.k.a, Nexxen, for $239 million, exiting the sector.\n\nMaybe data and identity will be the route in Europe, rather than actually selling media Kevin Flood\n\nObservers cite the introduction of privacy laws such as GDPR in the EU and CCPA in the U.S., which makes it difficult for such players to scale operations. Simply put, there\u2019s just too much risk and not enough revenue, meaning their nascent media ambition died on the vine.\n\nSasha Auzins, the chief operating officer of the tech and data consultancy Elaboration, has advised telcos on their ad plans like this in the past and argues that its approach, i.e., with more of an emphasis on the OOH sector, may prove different.\n\n\u201cT-Mobile seems to have significant ambitions with retail screens, with the acquisition of Octopus and now this Vistar acquisition,\u201d he said, adding that the approach feels like it might have more staying power, especially since it\u2019s less entangled with the privacy challenges that have derailed previous efforts.\n\n\u201cIndeed, audience-level segmentation and insight-based targeting are things that T-Mobile can provide and distribute. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see some innovative executions,\u201d added Auzins.\n\nA new approach?\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin Flood, a principal at investment firm FirstParty Capital, raised how telcos in Europe have still maintained an interest in the advertising sector, even if their approach is somewhat modified, positing that \u201cmaybe data and identity will be the route in Europe, rather than actually selling media.\u201d\n\nFor example, Deutsche Telekom entered digital advertising with Emetriq in 2015, aiming to aggregate anonymized data for programmatic advertising during this timeframe in a manner which it claimed was GDPR-complaint \u2014 Emertiq is still an ongoing concern, but limited to the German market.\n\nIn the guise of telco-backed Utiq \u2014 which announced the appointment of Pagel Colin as director of global clients and Thomas Bailly as director of global agencies \u2014 such an assessment appears accurate given its backers: Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom\u2019s Orange, and Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nPer its promotional material, Utiq, which launched in 2023, offers a Telco-powered first-party identifier that utilizes authentic consent to facilitate responsible digital marketing to produce an \u201cauthenticated consent service\u201d that can help publishers and advertisers crack their addressability challenges, such as \u201cdark browsers.\u201d\n\nSo, as the U.S. third-largest telco, and three of Europe\u2019s three largest telco groups prepare to put the old band back together again, the question is, will this particular sequel better the original?",

While relatively minor perks, users notice when they get free, high-quality content, and access gets more difficult, like when T-Mobile recently dropped the Disney+ perk option.\n\nFor now, though, the tides have stemmed somewhat, and anyone T-Mobile gave a Hulu On Us promo code \u2014 that is, accounts that were preemptively eligible for Hulu before some perk changes \u2014 will now find Hulu linked directly to their T-Mobile account (Source: The Mobile Report via PhoneArena).

Go5G Next is a fine plan that connects you to the powerful network behind T-Mobile's success compared to cheaper MVNOs. But it's also around $200 per month for three lines \u2014 in other words, not for everyone. And if you are running a multi-line household, there's a nonzero chance you'll want to access all current 4K content, sometimes on more than two screens at once. You can't do either of those with the entry-level Hulu or Netflix plans.\n\nSubscription numbers haven't started to drop yet, but the public is increasingly frustrated with questionable content selection and networks' lack of commitment to their own quality productions. With some users getting fed up and hopping between platforms as they run out of new stuff to watch, maybe untethering from a single streaming service is for the best. That's what the un-carrier's bundle reduction implies, anyway.",

Although T-Mobile has offered satellite access to its own customers in the affected areas, the technology has also beamed emergency alerts to all phones, regardless of carrier.\n\nThe technology works by using orbiting satellites to deliver text messages to phones on the ground. As a result, residents and emergency responders in the affected LA areas can remain connected, even though the raging fires have disrupted local cell towers.\n\nThursday\u2019s update from T-Mobile also suggests the technology can connect to a wide swath of users. In October, the company also activated the cellular Starlink service to enable emergency texting following Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The effort delivered hundreds of thousands of text messages and served over 27,000 phones.\n\nIn Thursday's update, T-Mobile added: \"As of today, less than 1% of [cell] sites remain impacted in the region, the majority of which are in the Pacific Palisades area due to damage or inaccessibility.\" So, cellular Starlink access has likely been phased out across much of LA following the restoration of local cell services.\n\nFor users outside the fire-stricken areas of LA, T-Mobile has also kicked off a free beta program, giving eligible customers a chance to test the cellular Starlink access. However, the beta program currently only works with five Samsung phone models, and satellite connectivity will only switch on if the user enters a cellular dead zone.\n\nIn the meantime, SpaceX currently has over 400 cellular Starlink satellites in orbit, but the company envisions expanding the constellation to thousands. For now, the system can only power satellite-based text messaging, but it\u2019ll eventually roll out support for voice calls and data downloads. How much T-Mobile and SpaceX will charge for access in the future remains unclear.",

With a prepaid plan, you're paying a fixed rate for service to start each month, keeping your costs under control\n\nEven better, most of the prepaid options that have caught my eye also happen to be among the best cell phone plans overall, thanks to their low cost and generous amounts of data.\n\nI've spent a decade writing about different cell phone plans for Tom's Guide, and in that time, I've noticed that prepaid plans have gotten more attractive. You no longer have to choose between a lot of data and a low monthly bill \u2014 many of the best prepaid phone plans offer unlimited data for less than you might expect.\n\nThe trick is to consider mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs. These companies use the networks of other carriers for their service, which allows them to charge less for coverage. (MVNOs can also cut back on perks to keep costs down, though to be honest, you don't get a lot of those anyhow when you opt for a prepaid phone plan.)\n\nTo find a great prepaid phone plan, I look at how much data is available for how much money as well as what happens when you use up all your data in a given month. (Do your speeds slow down, or do you have to buy additional data?) In the case of MVNOs, I also look at what cell phone network they use for their service.\n\nLooking to save even more than the options here?

Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.\n\nMint Mobile | 15GB | $20/month - Best value prepaid plan\n\nMint Mobile has a good range of plans, with the carrier's 15GB offering providing a nice chunk of data at a low monthly price. You pay $20/month for the first three months of service \u2014 an initial $60 upfront cost. After those three months are up, you would need to commit to a full year of service to keep that $20 rate \u2014 that means a $240 one-time payment. To illustrate the value of paying for the full year, a six-month plan with 15GB of data increases the monthly rate to $25, so you're saving money over the long term. Looking at Mint Mobile's best plans, you can go even cheaper with a 5GB plan that costs $15/month with a $180 annual payment. If you're balking at the upfront payment, the 5GB T-Mobile Connect plan also costs $15, and you can pay monthly instead of annually. Use up your data at T-Mobile, though, and you need to pay for more; Mint only slows down your speeds when you hit your cap. T-Mobile, which owns Mint, provides the wireless coverage for this carrier. And that's good news, given T-Mobile's high speeds, particularly when it comes to 5G service.\n\n\n\nPros: Very affordable price, free hot spot data,\n\nCons: Best prices require longer commitment\n\nThe best prepaid plan from a big carrier\n\nVerizon | 15GB prepaid | $35/month - Best prepaid for coverage\n\nAmong the best Verizon phone plans, you'll find a prepaid option with 15GB of data for $45/month. But that's just the starting price \u2014 enroll in autopay, and Verizon takes $10 off your monthly bill, bringing your rate to $35. Yes, that's still higher than Mint's 15GB plan, but Verizon lets you pay month by month, without a year-long commitment. Your Verizon plan gets you nationwide 5G coverage to go with your affordable rate. Unfortunately, access to Verizon's super fast Ultra Wideband 5G requires a more expensive unlimited data plan. Should you use up your data before the month is out, Verizon slows your coverage to 2G speeds.\n\n\n\nPros: Lots of data, great coverage and speeds, 5G coverage included\n\nCons: Not the cheapest prepaid around; Ultra Wideband 5G requires a more expensive plan\n\nBest annual prepaid plan\n\nAT&T | Unlimited 12-month prepaid | $25/month - Great value prepaid on AT&T\n\nLike Mint, AT&T has a prepaid plan option where you can save big by paying for a year upfront. In AT&T's case, you can get an unlimited data plan for a one-time annual payment of $300. That works out to $25/month, which is cheaper than the $30 monthly rate Mint offers on its unlimited data option. As with most unlimited plans, there actually is a limitation on how much data you can use, with AT&T limiting you to 16GB of high-speed data before slowing down your speeds for the rest of the month. (Mint just eliminated the cap on its $30/month unlimited data plan, though like AT&T, Mint requires you to pay for your year of service in advance to get its low rate.) Other perks of AT&T's best prepaid phone plan include hotspot data, HD video streaming and 5G service.\n\n\n\nPros: Outstanding amount of data for price\n\nCons: Requires you to prepay for a full year, speeds slowed significantly after 16GB\n\nThe best prepaid unlimited data plan\n\nVisible | Unlimited data| $45/month - The best unlimited data prepaid on a budget\n\nFor those that don't want to pay for a full year to get a good rate on unlimited data, Verizon-owned Visible has the best unlimited data plan option for prepaid customers. Visible has a $25 unlimited data option, but the better choice is Visible Plus, which costs $45/month with taxes and fees included in that price. Why pay more for Visible Plus? You get access to Verizon's faster Ultra Wideband network for 5G coverage for starters. Visible Plus customers also can make calls to more than 30 countries from the U.S. at no extra cost and get up to 50GB of data without seeing their speeds slowed by Verizon. You also get a Global Pass that gives you one day of text, talk and data usage in 140 countries and you can add a smartwatch to your plan at no addition cost. You can lower the cost Visible Plus thanks to a current promotion. With the '35PLUS' sign-up code new customers can drop the Visible Plus rate to $35/month, bringing the price closer to what Mint charges, but without the upfront payment. Visible's promotion ends March 31.\n\n\n\nPros: Very affordable, 5G unlimited data, smartwatch connectivity included\n\nCons: There are cheaper prepaid plans, no discounts for multiple lines\n\nThe best prepaid plan for families\n\nTotal Wireless | Unlimited data | 4 lines | $110/month \u2014 Best prepaid plan for families\n\nUsually, prepaid options are not the place to look for the best family cell phone plans, as you don't see many escalating discounts when you add more lines to your plan. Total Wireless, owned and operated by Verizon, is one of the exceptions to that rule, as the carrier throws in a fourth line of data for free with its Total 5G unlimited plan. As a result, a family of four pays $110/month, or $27.50 per line. That price is locked in for five years and includes access to Verizon's faster 5G Ultra Wideband network. You'll also enjoy great perks like six months of the Disney Plus bundle, data roaming in select Central and South American countries and 15GB of hotspot data. You can add device protection for an extra $5/month as part of the new Total Wireless Protect service. A possible alternative to families is Xfinity Mobile, a Comcast-owned MVNO that uses Verizon's network for coverage. One line of unlimited data at Xfinity Mobile costs $40, but each subsequent line tacks $20 on to your bill, so that four lines will cost just $100 each month. You do have to get your internet from Xfinity to join Xfinity Mobile, though.\n\n\n\nPros: Great perks, discounts on extra lines\n\nCons: Single line of data is pretty pricey\n\nBest price-lock guarantee\n\nBoost Mobile | Unlimited data | $25/month \u2014 Lock in your phone bill\n\nBoost Mobile's plans starts with an appealing offer as part of its lowest-priced unlimited data plan. Sign up for autopay for the $25 monthly plan, and you'll keep that rate so long as you remain a Boost customer. Right now, Boost has cut the cost of the first month of service in half for new customers. If there's a drawback, the $25 plan lacks the perks you get with pricier Boost plans, though the low rate compares well with what Visible and Mint charge for unlimited data. Unlike with Mint, there's no requirement to pay for a full year, and Boost Mobile gives you a 30GB cap before data speeds are slowed.\n\n\n\nPros: Lifetime price lock guarantee, extensive network reach\n\nCons: Few perks, taxes not included in price\n\nPrepaid phone plans compared\n\nHere's how our best prepaid phone plan picks compare. Prices reflect the monthly cost of one line of data. (Note that the Mint and AT&T options require a full year payment upfront.)\n\nTotal's plan may seem like the most expensive prepaid option on this list, but keep in mind that per line rates fall as you add more lines, with a family of four paying $27.50 per line. (That's $110 total for the month.) Visible's $45 Plus plan is also on the pricey end, but there is a $25 option at the carrier that also offers unlimited data.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Carrier Data amount Monthly payment, 1 line Notes Mint 15GB $20 Requires annual payment to get lowest monthly rate Verizon 15GB $35 Price features autopay discount AT&T Unlimited $25 16GB of high-speed data; upfront payment required Visible Unlimited $45 Visible plus plan has more perks, including faster data; 50GB of high-speed data Total Wireless Unlimited $50 Four lines of data costs a total of $110; no cap on high-speed data Boost Mobile Unlimited $25 30GB of high-speed data; lifetime price guarantee\n\nWhat is a prepaid phone plan?\n\nThere are two kinds of cell phone plans \u2014 prepaid and postpaid. With a prepaid plan, you pay for data at the beginning of the month; that way, you know your precise costs for budgeting purposes. (Prepaid plans also don't require credit checks, so it's easier to get service if you've got a low credit score.)\n\nShould you use up your allotted data for a month, many carriers will just slow down your data speeds for the rest of the billing cycle. In some cases, you'll need to top off your plan with data. That's why it's important to pick a prepaid phone plan with the right amount of data for your needs.\n\nMany phone carriers prioritize traffic from postpaid customers, so it's possible that data rates can be slowed if you're using a prepaid plan. That's especially true when you use a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, such as Mint, Metro by T-Mobile or Cricket, where your phone service is piggy-backing on another carrier's network. (Mint and Metro use T-Mobile's network; Cricket relies on the network of parent company AT&T.)\n\nBest prepaid phone plans: What you should consider\n\nWhen shopping for a prepaid phone plan, price is paramount. That\u2019s because prepaid plans don\u2019t often come with the kind of benefits postpaid cell phone plans offer. That said, some carriers \u2014 notably, Metro By T-Mobile \u2014 do work in a few perks, so be aware of those when picking your plans.\n\nYou'll also want to pay attention to discounts and special offers. Often, larger carriers like AT&T and Verizon will adjust the size of their autopay discount, which can make a pricier plan more attractive. Some carriers, like Total Wireless, will lower the per-line cost as you add more lines, making them a good choice for families.\n\nBesides price, one of the most important things to consider is what carrier offers the best coverage around your home and workplace. That\u2019s true even if you look beyond the Big Three carriers for service. MVNOs use the cellular networks of AT&T, T-Mobile or Verizon for their coverage. So if Verizon\u2019s network is particularly strong where you are, for example, MVNOs that use Verizon\u2019s network for coverage will perform well, too. As we mentioned above, MVNOs can see their traffic slowed if a carrier\u2019s network gets too crowded.\n\n5G coverage is included with most MVNO service by now. For example, Metro by T-Mobile subscribers can access T-Mobile's 5G with an eligible phone, as can Mint Mobile customers. Visible has added 5G access on Verizon's network, and Cricket customers can now use AT&T's 5G connectivity with any of that MVNO's plans.\n\nThe best prepaid phone plans and free trials\n\nSome prepaid carriers offer free trials, in which you can test out their service on your current phone without having to switch carriers first. It's a convenient way of seeing if a prepaid carrier's coverage is strong in your area.\n\nMint Mobile's free trial lets you sample the service for seven days. You're given 250MB of data, 250 minutes of talk time and 250 texts to see what Mint's service is all about.\n\nA free trial at Cricket, which AT&T owns and operates, runs for 14 days and lets you use up to 3GB of data.\n\nVisible's free trial lasts 15 days. In addition to iPhones, it's now open to Samsung and Google Pixel devices that can support eSIM.\n\nBoost Mobile offers a 30-day money back guarantee in which you get your service fees returned if you cancel within 30 days of activation.\n\nHow we pick the best prepaid phone plans\n\nFinding the best prepaid phone plans means widening our search beyond the major carriers, though AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon all have prepaid offerings. We also research plans from smaller carriers who use the Big Three's cellular towers to provide their coverage. As smaller carriers usually offer their service at a discount, they make up a majority of the candidates that we consider for best prepaid phone plans.\n\nWhen we pick the best plans, we put a premium on the monthly price, though we also pay attention to how much data comes with that plan. After all, a carrier may not charge you a lot for data, but it also may not provide enough data for your needs. We're picking plans that offer the best mix of cost and data. We also consider a wide variety of data allotments, since some people can get by very happily using just a couple gigabytes of data each month, while others need an unlimited plan.\n\nAs noted previously, prepaid plans don't offer much in the way of perks. That said, we do take note of any special add-ons included with the best prepaid plans, as those can add value to a plan above and beyond its monthly cost.",

            "content": "Telecommunication companies have invited trouble for themselves due to hidden charges or uncalled-for price hikes sporadically. T-Mobile was earlier legally charged for passing off price increases as mandatory government charges. The companies have been scrutinized for initially offering good deals to entice users and after they are onboard with a plan, users have to face either incremental price increases or unexpected surcharges. The latest reported increase by Verizon is for customers with multi-line plans or shared usage and is expected to be a hike of $15 per month.\n\nVerizon is rumored to raise prices for Verizon family plans, stirring quite the debate online over the continuous rate increase and lack of transparency\n\nReports about Verizon's potential price increase are shared by someone who claims to be a Verizon supervisor on Reddit via Android Police. As per the post, starting this February 20th, myPlan rates for customers with five or more lines will see an increase in their cost, and the charges for four or more lines will be aligned with the five or more lines. In simpler words, this means that if the report stands true, there would be a $3 increase per line, which could translate to a minimum $15 hike for users with a five-line plan.\n\nUsers are already frustrated with the administrative fee increases that, although incremental, end up being more for users with multiple lines. If Verizon goes ahead with the pattern it has established of price hikes every now and then, it will raise concerns among customers regarding pricing transparency. It will be another example of bluffing the users into signing up by painting the plans as affordable or locked-in and then hitting them with sneaky fees or rate adjustments.\n\nMany Verizon users have expressed their dismay about the rumored price increase. Some have even blamed the company for luring them in by suggesting users can save by switching plans and adding subscriptions and then passing off these additional increases without informing users before the increase. Several staff members even shared the increased pressure they would be facing from customers as a result of the price increase. All of this is resulting in some users mentioning moving to T-Mobile instead.\n\nVerizon is not the only company with price hikes, as this seems to be a broader trend in the telecommunications industry. Most companies are steadily opting for price increases and citing these adjustments as operational costs or finding other justification for them. There should be greater transparency and regulatory notice of the ongoing pattern of creeping fees, so consumers do not feel stuck or blindsided by these increases.",

And on Wednesday, The Trade Desk acquired Sincera, an ad tech metadata company that\u2019s been helpful for supply-path optimization, fraud, monitoring of alternate IDs and more. To gain insight into these acquisitions, we bring on Conor McKenna of LUMA Partners.\n\nWhy is T-Mobile, a telco with a rideshare advertising acquisition under its belt, going further into out-of-home advertising? While Verizon and AT&T both acquired and then divested advertising businesses (AOL/Yahoo, Xandr, we\u2019re looking at you), T-Mobile is leaning in.\n\nThen, we discuss why Sincera caught the eye of The Trade Desk. For one, the metadata company\u2019s analysis has shined a light in some dark corners of ad tech since Mike O\u2019Sullivan and Ian Meyers founded the company in 2022. A year ago, it raised $4.2 million in seed funding. To be snapped up by The Trade Desk, one of Sincera\u2019s customers, a handful of years into its run is a dream scenario for many founders: a quick exit to a familiar buyer.\n\nBut what\u2019s next once these companies are in the hands of new owners? On the podcast, we predict The Trade Desk will use Sincera\u2019s tech to boost adoption of UID, by showing the value it can create, and intensify efforts to curate inventory according to its quality standards.\n\nStay tuned, because these acquisitions are only the beginning of the story and we\u2019re excited to watch the companies\u2019 post-acquisition integrations play out.",

The question NAD considered was whether the T-Mobile advertising sufficiently informed prospective customers that the assessment included the cost of third-party streaming services in addition to the price of the carriers\u2019 wireless plans.\n\nNAD sided with the challenger.\n\n\u201cBecause the main message of the commercial is price savings, without reference to optional add-on streaming services, NAD determined that the small on-screen print disclosure that references streaming services as the basis of comparison is insufficient and contradicts the main message of the commercial,\u201d the press release said.\n\nThe other case was similar.

Both advertising spots include the claim that T-Mobile subscribers \u201csave on every plan vs. the other big guys.\u201d\n\nNAD found the claim misleading because it includes the cost of third-party streaming services bundled with a T-Mobile plan on top of the price of AT&T and Verizon wireless plans.\n\n\u201cNAD\u2026 determined that the bundled streaming services are ancillary benefits to cellular phone plans that consumers are unlikely to expect are included when plan prices are being compared and that consumers are unlikely to understand that the savings comparison includes the value of streaming services bundled with a T-Mobile plan,\u201d read the press release on that decision.\n\nIn both cases, T-Mobile said it would comply with the recommendation though it \u201cdisagrees with NAD\u2019s conclusions regarding the challenged advertising.\u201d\n\nCharter Spectrum Mobile also objected to the 20% savings claim.

It\u2019s offering it at no cost for at least 30 days.\n\nWith T-Priority, T-Mobile is allocating a network slice of its 5G standalone (SA) network to the first responders, giving them more capacity, faster 5G speeds and the highest priority, said Nicole Hudnet, industry segment advisor for T-Mobile\u2019s Emergency Response Team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been receiving a lot of requests for Wi-Fi routers, hot spots and devices on our network because our network speeds and the availability of our network have been strong for first responders here,\u201d she said from a command center at Zuma Beach.\n\nIt\u2019s just one of the things T-Mobile is doing in the LA region, where members of its engineering emergency response team have been hunkered down since the wildfires swept through the region more than a week ago. T-Mobile\u2019s infrastructure vendor in the LA market is Ericsson.\n\nBesides network slicing, T-Mobile is using AI, software defined networking and network self-optimization to tweak antennas on the fly, making sure they\u2019re maximizing T-Mobile\u2019s coverage capacity based in the constantly changing situation. T-Mobile has done about 9,000 remote changes to its network during the wildfires, said Stacy Tindell, senior director, Network Engineering and Operations at T-Mobile.\n\n\n\n*Update: Since this article first published, T-Mobile informed us that it actually conducted 12,000 uptilts and restores to its network as of January 16, up from 9,000.\n\n\u201cWe like having a lot of tools in the toolbox because all of them are needed, depending on the situation on the ground,\u201d Tindell told Fierce.\n\nWe like having a lot of tools in the toolbox because all of them are needed, depending on the situation on the ground. Stacy Tindell, Senior Director, Network Engineering & Operations, T-Mobile\n\nT-Mobile was the first U.S. operator to commercially launch a 5G SA core; most operators worldwide started their migrations to 5G using a non-standalone (NSA) core that relies on LTE as the anchor. The 5G SA core is what allows carriers to offer network slicing to enterprises; it\u2019s been long promised as a way for operators to actually make a profit from their 5G upgrades.\n\nVerizon and AT&T are moving to 5G SA cores at their own, slower pace.\n\nVerizon told Fierce that its 5G SA core is commercially available in LA, although it\u2019s not quite at the stage where they\u2019re ready to talk about specific public safety agencies using it. Verizon is serving public safety agencies battling the LA fires via its commercial wireless network as well as through Verizon Frontline, the division dedicated to emergency and first responders.\n\n\u201cWe are working with multiple agencies to test and refine the technology over the course of a series of trials across a number of public safety use cases,\u201d a Verizon spokesperson said.\n\nAT&T also turned on its 5G SA network in LA, and it\u2019s in the process of migrating customers to its 5G SA services, a spokesperson said. Besides smartphones, its AT&T Internet Air fixed wireless home internet service runs on 5G SA, including in Los Angeles, she said.\n\nVerizon, AT&T lead in public safety\n\nVerizon enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of the public safety market for years, but AT&T challenged it when in 2017 it won the 25-year government contract for FirstNet Authority, giving it bragging rights at providing the first nationwide network dedicated to public safety.\n\nFirstNet is in a league of its own as an entire communications platform dedicated to public safety \u2013 \u201cnot a commercial offering or a slice of one,\u201d said Scott Agnew, president of AT&T\u2019s FirstNet division.\n\n\u201cIt provides first responders with a highly secure and dedicated network core, dedicated spectrum when they need it, always-on priority and preemption, and unprecedented network visibility,\u201d he told Fierce in a statement. \u201cNo connection is more important than one that can help save a life and, as California first responders and those providing mutual aid come together to battle the devastating Los Angeles wildfires, the FirstNet team at AT&T is honored to work along their side to deliver reliable connectivity that best serves their critical operations.\u201d\n\nFor T-Mobile, nowhere to go but up\n\nT-Mobile freely admits to having the lowest share of the first responder market, but services like the 5G-supported T-Priority give it an opportunity to grow market share where it couldn\u2019t in past generations. It also has the expertise of former Sprint and Nextel Communications executives like Hudnet who first developed relationships with the first responder community decades ago.\n\nWith network slicing, T-Mobile has been gaining in both public and private environments for some time now, noted industry analyst Chetan Sharma.\n\n\u201cI think the T-Priority\u2019s value proposition is quite compelling both from coverage and reliability point of view,\u201d he told Fierce. \u201cSA and 2.5 GHz give them a natural advantage in terms of reach and cost. So, I think they have a pretty competitive offering in the market.\"\n\nVerizon and AT&T, of course, have historical advantages, \u201cbut T-Priority is getting a second look by many public safety entities,\u201d he concluded.",

            "content": "When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of T-Mobile US, Inc. ( ) stock is up an impressive 160% over the last five years.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver half a decade, T-Mobile US managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 21% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of T-Mobile US' .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, T-Mobile US' TSR for the last 5 years was 165%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that T-Mobile US shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 22% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand T-Mobile US better, we need to consider many other factors.

Several Galaxy S24 users have reported that the service was activated without any prior announcement or notification.\n\nThis rollout follows observations in December last year when some Samsung Galaxy S24 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 users noticed a new 'Satellite Networks' option in their phone settings. At the time, the feature remained disabled, leaving users speculating about when it would become functional.\n\nNow that the service is active for select beta testers, it is limited to basic text messaging, without support for voice calls or media transfers like photos or videos. While it may not replace traditional cell service due to these limitations and slower speeds compared to mobile networks, it represents a significant step forward in mobile technology.\n\nT-Mobile has not made an official announcement yet, so it\u2019s unclear what will happen next. It remains to be seen whether the satellite messaging service will roll out to other devices in the coming weeks or stay exclusive to the Galaxy S24 series for a while longer.",

Delta has a vision for building a program for SkyMiles members both on the ground and in the air that gives them opportunities to engage with the airline beyond the flight.\n\nSkyMiles members will enjoy a refreshed look and feel, best-in-class content and smart TV features designed to feel like streaming services customers have used at home.

SkyMiles members on more than 300 aircraft have enjoyed Delta Sync seatback. With over 165,000 seatback screens across more than 850 aircraft\u2014more than any other domestic competitor\u2014the airline leads the industry in in-flight entertainment.\n\n*As of Feb. 24, 2025\n\nFAQS\n\nWHY IS DELTA DOUBLING DOWN ON IN-FLIGHT CONNECTIVITY?\n\nAs high travel demand continues to highlight the importance of customer satisfaction across the airline industry, Delta is focused on delivering immediate benefits to customer loyalty. Traditionally, airline loyalty programs have been built on the idea of longer-term benefits\u2014that customers should sign up, enjoy their travel, and over time, receive benefits for the loyalty they\u2019ve shown. Delta\u2019s shift away from this approach to one of immediate value reflects the airline\u2019s commitment to staying ahead in a dynamic industry and keeping pace with evolving customer interests.\n\nBy joining SkyMiles and filling out a profile, Delta Sync automatically uses that information to personalize customers\u2019 experiences on flights. As customers deepen their relationships with Delta through these logged-in member experiences, the airline is able to serve them in new, in-the-moment ways, ultimately furthering their preference for the Delta brand.\n\nHOW IS DELTA PARTNERING WITH SATELLITE PROVIDERS TO BRING FREE WI-FI TO ITS FLEET?\n\nDelta utilizes best-in-class technology in collaboration with leading satellite internet service providers Viasat and Hughes to make its complex connectivity revolution a reality.\n\nViasat technology delivers high-speed connectivity onboard domestic mainline routes today (with the exception of the 74 aircraft in Delta\u2019s Boeing 717 fleet) and is expanding onboard the airline\u2019s international-serving widebody fleets.\n\nHughes is bringing streaming-capable connectivity to Delta\u2019s fleet of more than 400 regional jets as well as to the Boeing 717 fleet.\n\nThe technology from both suppliers will replace Intelsat systems (formerly known as Gogo).\n\nBoth trusted partners play a crucial role in providing a consistent and enhanced in-flight connectivity experience for Delta passengers across various aircraft types and routes.\n\nHOW DO CUSTOMERS KNOW IF FREE WI-FI IS AVAILABLE ON THEIR FLIGHT?\n\nCustomers can visit delta.com/wifi for more information on what Wi-Fi service to expect on their next flight. During booking, Wi-Fi-ready aircraft are identifiable by the \u201cfast-streaming Wi-Fi\u201d indicator denoted on a search result.\n\nIn addition, customers can reference pre-flight emails, app notifications or look for the following decal located near the boarding door:\n\nHOW DO CUSTOMERS CONNECT TO FREE WI-FI?\n\nDelta Sync Wi-Fi is available from pushback to park. Once the boarding door closes, customers are free to connect to the onboard Wi-Fi network by selecting the \u201cDeltaWiFi.com\u201d network in their device\u2019s settings. After connecting, customers enter their SkyMiles number and password.\n\nIf a customer navigates away from Delta Sync on their personal device, they can return to the dashboard by simply entering deltawifi.com into a web browser on a mobile device, tablet or laptop connected to Delta Sync Wi-Fi.\n\nA parent or guardian can obtain Delta SkyMiles accounts for children younger than 16 so they can connect to Delta Sync Wi-Fi while traveling.\n\nCAN CUSTOMERS CONNECT ON MULTIPLE DEVICES AT THE SAME TIME?\n\nYes. In fact, since the introduction of Delta Sync Wi-Fi, the airline has discovered that many people are actively using multiple screens simultaneously while flying, mirroring the experience in their living rooms. This insight came as Delta learned that offering fast, free Wi-Fi has not resulted in any decline in seatback engagement, something that was hypothesized before the introduction of Delta Sync Wi-Fi.\n\nWHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE FOR SOMEONE WHO ISN\u2019T A SKYMILES MEMBER?\n\nFor Delta Sync Wi-Fi:\n\nCustomers without a SkyMiles account can join for free directly from the login page, if needed, to get immediate access to Delta Sync Wi-Fi.\n\nCustomers who prefer to not have a SkyMiles account have the option to purchase Wi-Fi access. They will receive the same fast, reliable connection regardless of how they connect.\n\nCustomers who pay for Wi-Fi access will still have access to the internet but will not have access to the personalized entertainment and offers from Delta\u2019s partners via Delta Sync Wi-Fi.\n\nFor Delta Sync seatback:\n\nCustomers who choose not to pair their SkyMiles account to the seatback screen will still be able to enjoy the hours of hit movies, TV series and audio content but will not have access to the personalization features associated with the new logged-in experience.\n\nFor more information on Delta\u2019s Wi-Fi, visit delta.com/wifi.\n\nThrough the warmth and service of the Delta people and the power of innovation, Delta never stops looking for ways make every trip feel fit for you.\n\n1Wi-Fi Terms of Use Apply.

            "content": "Delta announced its partnership with T-Mobile in 2023, offering free inflight Wi-Fi to travelers. And now, the airline is bringing back a popular promotion that rewards SkyMiles members who switch their cell phone plan over to T-Mobile.\n\nHere are the details of this promotion \u2014 and whether or not the juice is worth the squeeze.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLimited-Time Offer: Earn 10k SkyMiles by Switching to T-Mobile\n\nDelta SkyMiles members who aren\u2019t already T-Mobile customers can take advantage of this \u201cexclusive offer.\u201d You must currently have a U.S.-based phone plan for the past 90 days \u2014 and you can check your eligibility here.\n\nOnce you enter your SkyMiles number, you can confirm eligibility for the phone number on file (or a different one that\u2019s not already associated with your loyalty account). Upgraded Points team members have reported their offers, including Medallion elite status holders, and they all seem to be targeted with the same 10,000-bonus miles offer.\n\nImage Credit: Delta\n\nOnly T-Mobile\u2019s Go5G or Go5G Plus are eligible for this offer, which are the phone carrier\u2019s newest unlimited data plans. According to the promotion, you\u2019ll receive the 10,000 miles after your new T-Mobile account has been active for 3 months.\n\nFinally, you can only redeem this promotion through your eligibility link online or by calling 1-844-745-2443. If you want to visit a physical T-Mobile store instead, you will not receive the 10,000 bonus SkyMiles.\n\nHot Tip: If you have a family plan, you can switch all of the lines to T-Mobile \u2014 but only the primary line will receive the 10,000 bonus miles.\n\nIs It Worth It?\n\n10,000 SkyMiles are worth about $120 based on our latest points and miles valuations. Based on that figure alone, this promotion may not be worth the hassle of switching your phone carrier.\n\nHowever, do note that it\u2019s very common for carriers to try to poach other customers. For instance, T-Mobile is currently targeting AT&T and Verizon customers by offering to \u201cpay off your eligible phone up to $800 via virtual prepaid Mastercard.\u200b\u201d\n\nAccording to the terms of the Delta promotion, you can stack multiple promotions together: \u201cThis offer can be combined with other offers from T-Mobile. You can switch your plan using one of T-Mobile\u2019s current offers. After your new T-Mobile account is active for 3 months, you will receive bonus miles with Delta.\u201d\n\nTherefore, while the 10,000-bonus mile offer may not be worth it alone, you\u2019ll want to check out T-Mobile\u2019s current offers to see if you can stack and get extra value from switching your phone plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAside from this promotion, T-Mobile offers excellent phone plans, and you can receive free international data with eligible plans. Not to mention, many domestic airlines partner with the service to offer free inflight Wi-Fi to T-Mobile \u2014 and this promotion may be exactly what you need to convince you to switch.",

Part of the reason this happened is the result of the order in which T-Mobile received the spectrum they use for 5G. The first 600 MHz spectrum became available in rural areas with fewer television stations to relocate to different channels. Unlike typical buildouts, T-Mobile installed 600 MHz base stations in rural areas with cleared spectrum first and they skipped earlier standards and went with 5G New Radio from the start. During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, T-Mobile had permission to rent 600 MHz spectrum from other license holders to use wide channels in all markets.\n\nIn parallel, the large amount of Sprint EBS/BRS spectrum allowed T-Mobile to start building a large capacity 5G network without waiting on clearing C Band spectrum.\n\nVerizon's reputation for best coverage was built on two major purchases. They purchased the rural cellular carrier Alltel starting in 2008 and they won a nationwide license for 700 MHz upper C block, also in 2008. This gave Verizon a chance to build a nationwide 4G LTE network with excellent coverage and building penetration while also having lots of original 850 MHz cellular spectrum for their CDMA voice network.\n\nIn my opinion, CDMA with single frequency networks and soft handoffs gave Verizon an early advantage over AT&T and T-Mobile with GSM networks that have hard handoffs that are more prone to dropped calls. With a soft handoff, the phone can receive signals from both the current base station and the next one simultaneously, making it less likely that calls gets dropped.\n\n\u2014 G.

This move is part of the company\u2019s strategy to tap into the growing digital-out-of-home (DOOH) advertising sector, a market that has shown potential but has proven challenging for telecom companies in the past.\n\nVistar Media, which operates a technology platform for managing digital advertising campaigns across 1.1 million screens, will become part of T-Mobile\u2019s Advertising Solutions division. The acquisition allows T-Mobile to leverage its vast customer data and combine it with Vistar\u2019s advanced advertising technology, potentially enhancing targeted ad offerings. Vistar currently works with over 3,000 brand advertisers across various digital platforms, which will strengthen T-Mobile\u2019s advertising reach.\n\nT-Mobile is optimistic about the future of DOOH, with the company citing a report from eMarketer that predicts US DOOH spending will make up over a third of the total $10 billion spent on OOH advertising this year. The company believes that digital screens are still underutilized and represent a major growth opportunity as they become more widely accessible.\n\nHowever, T-Mobile\u2019s venture into advertising comes with risks, as telecom companies have struggled in the past to successfully monetize their customer data in the advertising space. Previous efforts by companies like AT&T and O2 to create profitable advertising businesses through customer data have not been as successful.

A new truck will be delivered end of week.\u201d\n\nWireless, satellite, broadband companies are helping victims\n\nThese companies and leaders are turning out to be a lifeline for countless users who have been displaced by these wildfires and other natural disasters.\n\nHelping Americans keep in touch with loved ones and emergency through various technologies like voice, text, email and online through social networks and more.\n\nAfter this event passes, we really need to stop and think about creating a comprehensive system to utilize all these new technologies together, so we can help everyone involved in a disaster like this.\n\nUntil that point, and as we are still fighting the fires for weeks to come, let\u2019s focus on saving lives and property.\n\nUnfortunately, lives are overturned. Going forward there will be years of rebuilding ahead. That\u2019s when we really need to fix these communications problems which are still with us.\n\nWe know, disasters will continue. However, we should always be prepared. May God bless everyone who has been devastated and all the people who are risking their lives to protect others.",

However, Spectrum comes with one huge drawback: Prices increase by $30 monthly after the first year.\n\nIf that makes you want an alternative to Spectrum, T-Mobile Home Internet is the best fixed wireless internet provider in Butler. It doesn't have the same kind of availability as Spectrum, but it has affordable plans and speeds that should suffice for most households.\n\nStarlink is the best rural internet provider in Butler, but it comes at a premium. Monthly prices start at $120, and you'll need to shell out an additional $349 upfront for the satellite dish.

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Butler\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answer to those questions is often layered and complex, but the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Butler FAQs\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Butler? Spectrum is the best internet service provider in Butler, offering the fastest and cheapest plans in the area.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Butler? No, fiber internet is not available in Butler, Ohio.\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Butler? Spectrum is the cheapest internet provider in Butler, offering plans that start at just $30 per month.",

Other data exposed included phone numbers, names, physical addresses and driver\u2019s license information, among other personal data.\n\n\u201cThis significant data breach was entirely avoidable. T-Mobile had years to fix key vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity systems \u2013 and it failed,\u201d Attorney General Bob Ferguson said Jan. 6, 2025, the day the lawsuit was filed.\n\nThe suit asserts that T-Mobile violated Washington\u2019s Consumer Protection Act by failing to address known cybersecurity vulnerabilities, misleading customers about its ability to protect their data, and understating the breach's impact in notifications sent to consumers.\n\nT-Mobile responded to the lawsuit in a statement to Broadband Breakfast, expressing surprise at the state\u2019s decision to file the suit.\n\n\u201cWe have had multiple conversations about this incident from 2021 with the Washington AG's office over the last several years and even reached out in late November to continue discussions, so the office\u2019s decision to file a lawsuit came as a surprise,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cWhile we disagree with their approach and the filing\u2019s claims, we are open to further dialogue and welcome the opportunity to resolve this issue, as we have already done with the FCC. We also look forward to sharing how T-Mobile has fundamentally transformed our approach to cyber security over the past four years to further protect our customers,\u201d according to the company.\n\nDetails of the hack\n\n\u201cWhen it learned of the data breach, T-Mobile\u2019s notification to affected consumers was inadequate in numerous ways,\u201d the release noted. \u201cCurrent customers received text messages that were brief, omitted critical and legally required information, and in some cases misled customers regarding the severity of the breach. Moreover, current customers whose Social Security numbers were exposed did not receive any information regarding that exposure.\u201d\n\nBefore the 2021 hack, T-Mobile had witnessed \u201cnumerous cyberattacks\u201d and knew it would continue to be a target as early as 2020 based on a U.S. Securities and Exchange filing, Fergusan said.\n\n\u201cFor years prior to August 2021, T-Mobile did not meet industry standards for cybersecurity and knew about these vulnerabilities. These included insufficient processes for identifying and addressing security threats and a systemic lack of oversight. In some cases, T-Mobile used obvious passwords to protect accounts that had access to customers\u2019 sensitive personal information. The 2021 breach was enabled, in part, when the hacker guessed obvious credentials to gain access to T-Mobile\u2019s internal databases,\u201d the release continued.\n\nFerguson\u2019s lawsuit seeks civil penalties and restitution for the Washingtonians harmed. It also seeks injunctive relief to require improvements to T-Mobile\u2019s cybersecurity policies and procedures, as well as increased transparency in communications about cybersecurity to its customers.\n\nAssistant Attorneys General Mina Shahin, Kathleen Box, Bret Finkelstein, Gardner Reed, Paralegal Matt Hehemann, Legal Assistant Luis Oida and Investigator Steuart Markley are handling the case for Washington.",

The acquisition, said T-Mobile US, will enable it to provide customers with \u201cmore relevant and personalized advertising.\u201d\n\nIn a blog post, Vistar Media, which operates a network of digital advertising signs at malls, airports and other similar locations, explains how digital out-of-home (OOH) advertising combines the \u201cdynamic nature of digital screens\u201d \u2014 think billboards \u2014 with \u201cprogrammatic targeting.\u201d\n\nUnlike its competitors, which have been systematically divesting their advertising and media assets, T-Mobile US has been investing heavily in this area. Two years ago, for instance, it acquired Octopus Interactive, which managed a network of interactive video screens inside Uber and Lyft vehicles; and last year, it expanded its advertising solutions to include a nationwide in-store Retail Media Network (RMN) comprised of more than 20,000 screens.\n\nIn fact, T-Mobile claimed the latest acquisition will stretch its ad business across more than 1.1 million digital screens provided by nearly 370 OOH media owners and serving more than 3,000 brand partner advertisers.\n\nOn the other hand, AT&T, as part of its 2021 exit from WarnerMedia, sold its Xandr advertising business to Microsoft the following year, while Verizon finally sold off Yahoo and AOL media to Apollo Global Management in 2021 for $5 billion after a number of asset reconfigurations, iterations and transformations.\n\n\n\n\u201cCombining T-Mobile\u2019s customer-centric approach and its expertise as one of the nations most scaled marketers, with Vistar\u2019s leading out-of-home technology means advertisers can easily place their ads where they know their audience will be, improving every step of the customer journey,\u201d commented JP Colaco, the SVP & chief T-Ads officer at T-Mobile. \u201cTogether with Vistar, T-Mobile will deliver advertising solutions built by marketers, for marketers.\u201d\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in Q1 2025.",

T-Mobile will pay approximately $600 million in cash and expects the deal to close in the next couple of months pending regulatory approval.\n\nDigital campaigns should account for more than one-third of the $10 billion eMarketer expects buyers will spend on OOH media by 2027. DOOH in particular is having a moment as a competitive ad channel, which is why so many startups have cropped up to capitalize on the gray areas between OOH video and connected TV.\n\nIn acquiring Vistar Media, \u201cwe see tremendous opportunity to provide relevant and personalized advertising,\u201d said JP Colaco, SVP and head of T-Mobile\u2019s advertising business, in a statement.\n\nStaying on target\n\nDOOH ads may not be targeted to individuals, but that doesn\u2019t mean those campaigns are devoid of digital-style targeting and measurement.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s scaled number of mobile subscribers combined with Vistar\u2019s media partnerships and OOH technology \u201cmeans advertisers can easily place their ads where they know their audience will be,\u201d Colaco said.\n\nOOH ad tech uses impression multipliers, a reach metric based on how many unique mobile devices pass by a particular display or digital billboard at different times throughout the day. And T-Mobile has heaps of first-party data about its broadband subscriber base.\n\nIf an advertiser is trying to reach consumers in a certain region who enjoy, say, gardening or crocheting, that advertiser can hypothetically use a combination of mobile app downloads and location data to target specific real-world places or screens where that target audience might be found.\n\nThe acquisition of Vistar is also a sign that ad tech still holds some allure for telcos. There\u2019s a long trend of telcos snapping up media and ad tech startups before eventually reversing their decisions, including AT&T\u2019s Xandr (which it sold to Microsoft in 2021), Verizon\u2019s media business comprising AOL and Yahoo (which it later sold to Apollo Funds) and Singaporean telco Singtel acquiring the demand-side platform Amobee (which it offloaded to ad platform Nexxen in 2022).\n\nT-Mobile, which bought rideshare-focused ad startup Octopus in 2022 and mobile-focused ad tech company PushSpring in 2019, defies the trend.\n\nWhether or not T-Mobile holds onto Vistar for the long haul is a different story. But for now, consider it the first major ad tech acquisition of 2025.",

In contrast, LUMA Partners was rumored to be negotiating on behalf of the out-of-home media specialist, although representatives there denied involvement when asked for comment by Digiday. Representatives of Allen & Co. did not respond to Digiday\u2019s attempt to contact them on LinkedIn.\n\nHowever, one executive with deep connections in the OOH industry said they had heard the deal is progressing and confirmed T-Mobile as the likely acquirer.\n\nIn its recently published analysis of dealmaking in 2024, LUMA Partners, which specializes in the ad tech sector, noted an uptick in such activity. \u201cLast year was characterized by a return of strategic dialogue in the M&A markets,\u201d read its 2024 Full Year Market Report, published Jan. 7. \u201c2024 M&A activity was up +13% from a muted 2023, as Ad Tech (+73%), MarTech (+2%), and Digital Content (+7%) all increased from the prior year.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2011, Vistar Media has positioned itself as a location-based media specialist. It claims to offer a complete marketplace to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers in the OOH ad tech space, including an ad server and demand- and supply-side platforms.\n\nSources could not provide Digiday with estimates of valuations those engaged in such negotiations may discuss, but the OOH company claims its business is \u201csurging.\u201d According to the company, its campaign billings were up by 77% year-on-year, spurred by a 31% increase in new advertisers during the same period in an August 2024 press release \u2014 a prospectus that\u2019s typical of most sales processes.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see them make a number of transactions here [from T-Mobile] because they\u2019re the last man standing as it relates to a telco that still believes in the ad opportunity,\u201d said one source speaking upon condition of anonymity, given the sensitivity of such M&A negotiations.\n\nPer its official figures from late 2024, T-Mobile has more than 127.5 million connections, which it intends to use as the catalyst for its ambitions in the media business, with the completion of any such deal likely to place it in a prime position in the U.S. digital OOH sector, which as a total addressable market of $9 billion, per eMarketer estimates.\n\nIn separate announcements last year, T-Mobile launched an in-store retail media network featuring more than 20,000 screens across T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile retail locations, and later enhanced with a tie-up with Uber\u2019s own advertising division. This was a significant development for its nascent advertising ambitions and was enabled via its 2022 purchase of Octopus Interactive, a ride share advertising network \u2014 financial terms of the acquisition were not publicly disclosed \u2014 to further shore up its footprint in the advertising business.\n\nBefore the 2020 approval of its merger with (then) fellow telco Sprint, T-Mobile purchased PushSpring for an undisclosed fee, a transaction that helped it provide app developers and publishers with audience data to enhance ad targeting and in-app push notifications, a development that also saw it start to sell media mobile inventory through its T-Life mobile app \u2014 representing an audience base of more than 7 million customers.\n\nSuch offerings fall under the telco\u2019s T-Mobile Advertising Solutions division of the telco, a company whose market capitalization stood at approximately $250 billion as of January 2025, which counts former WarnerMedia ad sales boss Jean-Paul Colaco and veteran ad tech leader Mike Peralta among its number. T-Mobile\u2019s continued efforts demonstrate its continued faith in sustaining a noteworthy ads business and contrast with telco rivals such as AT&T and Verizon, which have vacated similar plans in recent years, primarily over privacy concerns.\n\nParallel to the significant strides in developing its advertising services in recent years, T-Mobile encountered substantial privacy challenges, including multiple data breaches, leading to regulatory scrutiny and substantial financial settlements.\n\nAfter altering its data policies to enroll customers into its ads-targeting business in 2021 automatically, the carrier has experienced several high-profile privacy lawsuits that have somewhat stymied the acceleration of its ads business, including record fines. For example, the telco agreed to a $350 million settlement after a hack that compromised the data of its customers \u2014 a case that arose again in January 2025 \u2014 and in 2024, it agreed to pay $60 million in connection to unauthorized data access incidents following a ruling from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.",

As a top marketer, connectivity provider and one of the largest physical in-store retail media network operators, T-Mobile will help marketers and advertisers reach consumers with more addressable and measurable solutions, delivering greater efficiency and ROI, while enhancing the consumer experience with more meaningful and engaging content.\n\n\u201cT-Mobile is always envisioning new ways to deliver for consumers and we see a tremendous opportunity to provide more relevant and personalized advertising,\u201d said JP Colaco, SVP & Chief T-Ads Officer, T-Mobile. \u201cCombining T-Mobile\u2019s customer-centric approach and its expertise as one of the nations most scaled marketers, with Vistar\u2019s leading out-of-home technology means advertisers can easily place their ads where they know their audience will be, improving every step of the customer journey. Together with Vistar, T-Mobile will deliver advertising solutions built by marketers, for marketers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are excited to join T-Mobile, a brand that truly understands the power and potential of out-of-home advertising,\u201d said Michael Provenzano, CEO & Co-Founder of Vistar Media. \u201cFor 13 years, Vistar has pioneered using technology and data to transform OOH into a strategic and measurable channel. T-Mobile\u2019s belief in the future of OOH - and their decision to acquire Vistar - underscores the strength of this channel. Together, we have the opportunity to enhance our offerings for customers and partners globally, and inspire brands to think bigger and redefine how they engage with audiences in the real world.\u201d\n\nDOOH represents a unique, useful, and dynamic channel for advertising in an increasingly digital world. According to eMarketer\u2019s forecast, DOOH ad spending in 2025 will account for over one-third of the nearly $10 billion spent on OOH advertising in the U.S. The timing is perfect for this transformation as digital screens still represent a small percentage of the overall OOH advertising market and are becoming more accessible.\n\nT-Mobile will pay approximately $600 million in cash, subject to closing adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. Post close, the transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to EBITDA and represents additional upside to the company\u2019s financial guidance shared during the company\u2019s Capital Markets Day.\n\nT-Mobile continues to expect to return up to $14 billion as part of its 2025 Shareholder Return Program. Depending on the actual timing of close for the company\u2019s announced and still pending transactions, along with the company\u2019s liquidity position and other capital allocation priorities, the company may consider allocating additional capital to the 2025 Shareholder Return Program.\n\nFor more information on how brands can give their audiences a better advertising experience, visit https://www.t-mobile.com/advertising-solutions.\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis communication contains certain forward-looking statements concerning T-Mobile and the proposed transaction to acquire Vistar Media.

The feature uses Starlink satellites and was set to undergo beta testing by T-Mobile customers early this year. That beta testing period is still on the way, but T-Mobile and SpaceX activated the service for Android users in Los Angeles to help customers stay connected.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cT-Mobile and Starlink opened up T-Mobile Starlink Direct-to-Cellular service over impacted areas of Southern California to deliver wireless emergency alerts and SMS and enable 911 texting,\u201d T-Mobile told CNET on Thursday, Jan. 9 as firefighters struggled to contain the wildfires.\n\n\u201cWhile SpaceX's direct-to-cell constellation has not been fully deployed, we are once again temporarily making this early test version available for those who need it most,\u201d the wireless carrier continued.\n\nSatellite connectivity enables T-Mobile customers with select Android phones to contact loved ones and emergency services when cellular networks are unavailable. T-Mobile told CNET that commercial power loss in the region caused cell networks in and around Los Angeles to go offline, but added that it had \"restored roughly half of the sites that were impacted by commercial power loss.\"\n\nStarlink also announced the move in a post on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cFor those in the Los Angeles area, the Starlink team and T-Mobile have enabled basic texting (SMS) through our Direct to Cell satellites,\u201d the post explains. \u201cYou can now text loved ones, text 911, and receive emergency alerts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nT-Mobile and Starlink have activated its satellite-based network during other natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Miltion and Helene. iPhone users will get Apple\u2019s version of satellite messaging, powered by Globalstar, instead of using T-Mobile and Starlink\u2019s solution.\n\nT-Mobile customers in the Los Angeles area can text as they normally would, through their phone\u2019s default SMS app. When cellular service is unavailable, select T-Mobile Android phones will fall back on satellites for connectivity.

(Madeline Carter/Las Vegas Review-Journal)\n\nThe Golden Knights have depended on their veteran locker room to help them bounce back from losses.\n\nAnother benefit to having all that experience is that older players can push younger ones through slumps.\n\nIt sure seemed to work for Pavel Dorofeyev on Sunday night. The 24-year-old right wing, after going through one of the longest dry spells of his young NHL career, broke through with two power-play goals and an assist to help the Knights defeat the Minnesota Wild 4-1 at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nDorofeyev has a team-high 16 goals after his second three-point game of the season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great player,\u201d center Tomas Hertl said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great shot, he can hold the puck and make plays.\u201d\n\nDorofeyev exceeded expectations early this season with 12 goals his first 23 games.\n\nThe reserved Russian forward then discovered what a scoring drought looks like. He went 11 games without a goal from Nov. 29 to Dec. 23.\n\nSome of his struggles can be explained by the fact that left wing Victor Olofsson returned from a sprained ankle Nov. 30 and took Dorofeyev\u2019s spot on the top power-play unit. Five of Dorofeyev\u2019s first 12 goals came on the man advantage.\n\nHe\u2019s since gotten going again. Dorofeyev scored Dec. 27 against San Jose, then again Jan. 2 against Philadelphia. Sunday, with the Knights missing leading scorer Jack Eichel due to an illness, Dorofeyev stepped up when his team needed him to.\n\nCoach Bruce Cassidy flipped Dorofeyev and Olofsson for a second-period power-play and Dorofeyev responded by beating Wild goaltender Filip Gustavsson 5:21 into the frame. Cassidy called it a \u201cgut instinct\u201d to make the switch, and it worked.\n\nDorofeyev added his second power-play goal with 2:12 remaining in the third to put the Knights up 4-1.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s played that position when Olofsson was out, so to me, they\u2019re very interchangeable,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cI just felt like, \u2018Let\u2019s give Pav a shot. Our power play has been good, not great.\u2019 That\u2019s all it was. Good for him.\u201d\n\nCaptain Mark Stone finished with two assists. Hertl added a goal and an assist for the Knights (29-11-3), who were playing on consecutive nights after losing 2-1 to the New York Rangers on Saturday.\n\nGoaltender Adin Hill made 15 saves.\n\nDorofeyev joined linemate Hertl with a team-high five shots on goal.\n\nTime will tell if it\u2019s a sign of things to come. The Knights got a tired Minnesota team (27-13-4) that was also playing on consecutive nights after beating the Sharks on Saturday.\n\nDorofeyev has a group of teammates that have been through what he\u2019s gone through. Everyone has had slumps, Hertl said. Dorofeyev stayed with it and was rewarded.\n\n\u201cIf you have the chances and the looks and you play hard, (the goals) will eventually come,\u201d Hertl said. \u201cHe\u2019s played hard.\u201d\n\nHere are three takeaways from the win:\n\n1. Kolesar answers the bell\n\nThe Knights took a 2-1 lead 4:09 into the third period when right wing Keegan Kolesar scored his career-high 10th goal of the season .\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a much-needed goal to take the lead. It was the Knights\u2019 first goal at five-on-five in 213:11.\n\nKolesar stood out in other ways as well. He fought Wild left wing Marcus Foligno for the second time in a month. The two scrapped Dec. 15 in Minnesota after Foligno hit left wing Ivan Barbashev, who missed the Knights\u2019 next 10 games with an upper-body injury.\n\nThis time Foligno sought retribution after Kolesar checked rookie defenseman David Jiricek into the boards in the first period. Kolesar said it was inadvertent, claiming he tried to shield Jiricek after the 21-year-old toe-picked.\n\nFoligno didn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cHe gave me (a fight), so it was only right to give one back,\u201d Kolesar said.\n\n2. Roy returns\n\nCenter Nicolas Roy returned Sunday after missing 11 games with an upper-body injury.\n\nHe centered the third line with Kolesar and left wing Brett Howden and picked up a secondary assist on Kolesar\u2019s game-winning goal.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a long time there watching the boys,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be back, for sure.\u201d\n\n3. Fleury acknowledged\n\nFormer Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury was the Wild\u2019s backup Sunday in what could be his final appearance at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nFleury, who played with the Knights the franchise\u2019s first four seasons and won the Vezina Trophy in 2021, was recognized during a timeout in the first period. Fans gave him a standing ovation. They also chanted his name at times throughout the night.\n\nFleury, 40, has said this season, his 21st in the NHL, will be his last.\n\n\u201cIt was only four years, but I felt like we went through a lot in those four years,\u201d Fleury said before the game. \u201cTo start from scratch with the team, and go to the (2018 Stanley Cup Final) and things like that, I\u2019ll always keep great memories from my time here.\u201d\n\nContact Danny Webster at dwebster@reviewjournal.com.

            "content": "Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nA few weeks ago, I noticed some chatter on my social feeds about the pros and cons of buying online versus in-store. This stemmed from a customer whose trade-in was denied by T-Mobile and reported as broken, even though they were confident it was in working condition before shipping it off. While the issue has since been resolved and the original post was taken down, it got me thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of buying online versus in-store.\n\nThese days, I usually only recommend going into a physical store if you desperately need assistance immediately (like an emergency phone replacement).\n\nNot only can you find cheaper accessories through third-party stores, but your carrier\u2019s online experience is typically much faster and less risky. You avoid handing your account details to an unfamiliar store rep, which can sometimes lead to employee error or, in rare cases, fraud. Plus, you don\u2019t have to worry about packages getting lost in the mail or misplaced by AT&T after delivery.\n\nDo you prefer dealing with trade-ins through shipping or in-store? 124 votes I always go online. I trust that any issues can be resolved with customer service. 40 % I always go online, but now have a few doubts if I should keep doing this... 20 % I prefer in-store as there's less chance of running into problems. 35 % Other/Unsure (tells us in the comments) 6 %\n\nTrade-ins, however, are a bit more complicated. There\u2019s plenty of evidence suggesting that trading in devices online can sometimes lead to problems. A quick look at Reddit or other social networks reveals a long list of complaints about trade-in issues, ranging from lost packages to errors with the online system that result in missed credits, and the list goes on.\n\nThe good news is that, while T-Mobile has declined in some areas in recent years, its Uncarrier T-Force team remains a major bright spot. If you run into problems, escalating them to T-Force often gets them resolved without too many hoops. This holds mostly true for AT&T and Verizon as well, though your experience may vary.\n\nRegardless of whether it\u2019s resolved, these kinds of issues can cost you time and money. While the odds of things going wrong probably aren\u2019t as high as angry Redditors might lead you to believe, it\u2019s a good idea to minimize your risk if you prefer buying phones online and are interested in a trade-in offer. Here are just a few steps you can take or consider that could lower your risk:\n\nTake a short video and pictures of your old phone before shipping it off. This is just good for general evidence in case you have to escalate your issue with T-Mobile or with the delivery carrier used for the device.\n\nAsk for in-store pickup. Every major carrier offers this as an option and it\u2019s a great way to ensure you don\u2019t run into problems. The rep will inspect your phone in person and while errors can still happen in this process, it\u2019s a lot less likely. Just be aware there are occasional online-only promotions that require your phone to be shipped to you.\n\nConsider reselling the device instead. I often tell folks that they should resell their phones on eBay, Swappa, or another similar provider over-trading them to a carrier. Simply put, you\u2019ll often get more even if it requires a bit more work.\n\nFor many newer flagships, you\u2019ll make more than enough that you\u2019ll be able to buy the new model for fairly cheap (think a few hundred or even less) \u2014 allowing you to skip repayment plans that lock you to the big carriers for 24-36 months.\n\nThere are exceptions where a trade-in will be the better value though, so it\u2019s always important to do your homework. For example, sometimes you\u2019ll see offers that accept broken trade-ins, while you won\u2019t get much for a damaged phone through direct resale. It\u2019s also not a bad idea to look at trade-in offers from retailers like Best Buy, Apple, and others, which will sometimes honor the same trade-in promotions as you\u2019d get from your carrier directly.\n\nActivate before you get home. If possible, it\u2019s not a bad idea to go out to your car or wait in the lobby and take the phone out. A quick visual inspection isn\u2019t a bad idea but the main thing you want to do is ensure that you can activate your device even if you don\u2019t fully set it up with all your Android/iOS apps and preferences at that time. This is coming from personal experience, as Verizon sent my wife a phone a few years ago that couldn\u2019t activate and we had to take it back in store for a replacement.\n\nHave you ever run into any issues with trade-ins, either in-person or online? Any advice you want to share or insights to add? Hit me up in the comments.\n\nYou might like",

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines -- and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics -- browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one person sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two people to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more people to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Billings\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from FCC.gov.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. We use the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When it comes to selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds, and also take into account real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Billings FAQs\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Billings? Spectrum is the best internet service provider in Billings. It\u2019s the only cable or fiber provider widely available and offers fast speeds at reasonable prices. A recent speed and price adjustment at Spectrum saw all 300Mbps plans increased to 500Mbps -- for the same price of $50 a month. Now you can choose between 500Mbps for $50 monthly or 1,000Mbps for $70 monthly. The main downside with Spectrum is that prices increase significantly after two years.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Billings? Yes, fiber internet is available to 32% of Billings residents, according to FCC data. TDS Telecom is the primary fiber provider in the area, but Quantum Fiber also has some coverage in southwest Billings.\n\nWho is the cheapest internet provider in Billings? TDS Telecom is the cheapest internet provider in Billings, with plans starting at $40 a month for 600Mbps speeds.",

            "content": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 It had been 54 days since the Rangers last followed up a win with another win.\n\nFifty-four days of losses piling up in bunches, and feeling like every step forward led to two steps back.\n\nThe Blueshirts put a stop to that trend with a convincing 2-1 win over the Golden Knights Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena, where the visitors proved they can still hang with \u2014 and defeat \u2014 one of the top teams in the NHL.\n\n3 Adam Edstrom celebrates after scoring the game-winning goal in the third period of the Rangers\u2019 2-1 win over the Vegas Golden Knights on Jan. 11, 2025. USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Con\n\nIt has been weeks and weeks on a downward trajectory, but Saturday night was perhaps the Rangers\u2019 first time looking up in quite awhile.\n\n\u201cI thought we were right on point right from the start,\u201d head coach Peter Laviolette said after his team improved to 20-20-2 on the season. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a follow-up from the last game, as well. So that\u2019s even a better point, too, is it was a really solid effort and game at home [against the Devils] and then to come on the road a day later, take the travel, get out of here and play tonight.\n\n\u201cI thought the guys \u2014 everything, from the drop of the puck the first period was excellent. And then just followed it through for 60 minutes.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers went toe-to-toe with the Golden Knights through the first two periods.\n\n3 Vincent Trocheck (right) scores a power play goal on Ilya Samsonov during the second period of the Rangers\u2019 win over the Golden Knights. AP\n\nIt resulted in a 1-1 tie at the start of the final frame, but the Rangers broke it at the 5:57 mark before pushing through all the way to the end.\n\nThe game had largely been played five-on-five, and the Rangers posted one of their better performances at even-strength so far this season. A beautiful tip by Adam Edstrom on a Jonny Brodzinski shot in transition allowed the Rangers to get the lead they needed.\n\n\u201cI know [Matt Rempe] got it on the wall, great outlet pass to Jonny [Brodzinski] there and we kind of talked about crashing the net so I was just trying to get in there,\u201d Edstrom said of his third goal of the season and the first game-winner of his career. \u201cGot a tip on the puck and it went in.\u201d\n\n3 Igor Shesterkin makes a stop on Pavel Dorofeyev shot for one of his 28 saves in the Rangers\u2019 win over the Golden Knights. Stephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nNot only did they fend off another two Golden Knights power plays in the third, including 57 seconds of six-on-four play with Vegas\u2019 net empty, but the Rangers survived the home team\u2019s 11 shots on goal, made smart decisions in the defensive zone and maintained their offensive push to secure the victory.\n\nIt had fans clad in red, white and blue proudly shouting \u2018Let\u2019s Go Rangers!\u2019 inside enemy territory in the final minutes.\n\nPicking up their fourth win in their last six games, the Rangers appear to be on the up after a humbling start to the season.\n\nCHECK OUT THE LATEST NHL STANDINGS AND RANGERS STATS\n\nMika Zibanejad extended his point streak to six games with an assist on the Rangers\u2019 first goal from Vincent Trocheck, who has started playing with the insatiable fire that made his last season so successful.\n\nBoth teams capitalized on their very first power plays, which didn\u2019t come until the middle frame.\n\nAfter the ref had to repeatedly tell Trocheck to get in the box for a holding call on Tomas Hertl that he vehemently refuted, the Golden Knights made quick work of their man-advantage with a goal from Vegas captain Mark Stone at the side of the Rangers net.\n\nKeegan Kolesar got called for tripping K\u2019Andre Miller just over two minutes later, however, to give the Rangers a chance to respond \u2014 and they did.\n\nAbsorbing a hard slap shot from Zibanejad, Trocheck backhanded the loose puck past Vegas goalie Ilya Samsanov to even the score at one-all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously big, it\u2019s a real good team over there,\u201d Ryan Lindgren said. \u201cTwo in a row. We\u2019re going to play a real good Colorado team [on Tuesday], so just got to keep building off of it. Just try and play better and better every game.\u201d",

(Ellen Schmidt/Las Vegas Review-Journal)\n\nWild goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury (29) skates during warmups before an NHL hockey game against the Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena on Friday, April 12, 2024, in Las Vegas. (Ellen Schmidt/Las Vegas Review-Journal)\n\nSunday might be the final time Marc-Andre Fleury skates inside T-Mobile Arena.\n\nFleury \u2014 the second-winningest goaltender in NHL history \u2014 has announced that this season will be his last. The three-time Stanley Cup champion and former Vezina Trophy winner will call it a career when his 21st NHL season wraps up.\n\nThe 40-year-old netminder will take the ice with the Minnesota Wild to face the Golden Knights on Sunday in the Wild\u2019s only trip to Las Vegas this season.\n\nFleury became the undisputed face of the franchise when he was selected in the 2017 expansion draft from the Pittsburgh Penguins. The three-time Stanley Cup champion, after 13 seasons with Pittsburgh, came to the Knights with a chip on his shoulder as long as the Strip.\n\nHe became the most popular player the moment he walked the draft stage at T-Mobile Arena, and turned into one of the biggest reasons why the Knights found success early on.\n\n\u201cJust that first year, he came here as the face of the franchise, basically,\u201d fellow Original Misfit and defenseman Brayden McNabb said. \u201cHe did such a good job with it. You never felt he was going to go anywhere else, right? He came in here and he handled everything well.\u201d\n\nFleury helped lead the Knights to their improbable run to the Stanley Cup Final in their first year. He captured his first Vezina Trophy with the Knights in 2021, as well as the Jennings Trophy with goalie partner Robin Lehner.\n\nIt\u2019ll be a final chance for fans to acknowledge Fleury for his contributions to the Knights, but it\u2019ll be a bittersweet moment. The Wild, who are playing the second night of a back-to-back, are expected to start goaltender Filip Gustavsson after Fleury started against the San Jose Sharks on Saturday.\n\n\u201cJust an awesome guy,\u201d defenseman Shea Theodore said. \u201cIt\u2019s well-known around the league at how well he\u2019s liked. We had a blast when he was here. He\u2019s just such a good guy. I\u2019m so happy for how well he\u2019s played for how long.\u201d\n\nAhead of his final trip to T-Mobile Arena, some of his former teammates spoke about the kind of person and teammate Fleury was:\n\nMcNabb\n\n\u201cHe was just always a fantastic guy. That\u2019s well-known. Every day was awesome to see him. Every time you saw him, he was smiling. It was a fun encounter every time. He was such a team player, always worried about the team first.\u201d\n\nKeegan Kolesar\n\n\u201cJust being around him, you\u2019re kind of in awe. He\u2019s got that aura to him. He\u2019ll be a Hall of Famer. It was pretty cool that I got to play with a guy of that caliber, especially in my first year.\u201d\n\nZach Whitecloud\n\n\u201cHe epitomizes what you would want to find in a team guy. Always a part of things \u2014 dinners, team functions, organizing stuff, pranking \u2014 he just does everything in his day that brings a team together and makes everyone feel included. Those teams always tend to go far because everyone feels involved, everyone has a sense of importance and contribution to the team. He makes you feel important.\u201d\n\nAlex Pietrangelo\n\n\u201cWe were in the All-Star Game (in Tampa in 2018). I think I was on the bench at the time. We were all having a bet of $20 on who was going to win, if I remember correctly, the Target Challenge. All the kids picked the players on who would win. One of my kids won, and the next time we played Vegas, Flower gave me the $20 to give to my kid. Best story ever.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know him. I just knew him from playing in the All-Star Game. He owned up to it. Sums him up, right?\u201d\n\nKolesar\n\n\u201cI shot pucks once on him in the playoffs, and he won (his start). And then from the rest of the playoff series, he was like, \u2018You\u2019re coming to shoot on me every day.\u2019 It was pretty cool I got to be part of his superstition or his routine. It\u2019s something that, will he remember? Probably not, but I\u2019ll have that.\u201d\n\nWhitecloud\n\n\u201cWhen he won the Vezina, I can\u2019t remember exactly what we were doing, but we were together as a team and I think they either gave him a heads-up, or we found out as a team. It was just really special because he\u2019s obviously played since he was 18.\n\n\u201cWhen you play with a guy like that, you\u2019re sitting there wondering, \u2018How\u2019s the league never given this guy the Vezina?\u2019 Just being a part of it was special, and something that I\u2019ll get to tell my kids and grandkids about is that I played with Marc-Andre Fleury.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really cool is, those little Vezina statues, he personalized one to me. There was a personal message on it and stuff like that. That\u2019s one of the coolest things next to the Stanley Cup and stuff I have, that I keep in a special place. That\u2019s one of those things where I\u2019ll look at it every now and again.\u201d\n\nMcNabb\n\n\u201cHe embraced the community. Loved them. The organization, loved them, too. He was great. Just an unbelievable player and an unbelievable person. He deserves all the success he\u2019s had.\u201d\n\nPietrangelo\n\n\u201cGreat teammate, great person. He loved all his teammates. Obviously legendary. I know he says it\u2019s his last year, but you never know with Flower, right? I hope he gets a good ovation when he gets back here. He\u2019s a big part of why we are where we are with this organization.\u201d\n\nWhitecloud\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done so much for the game, and he\u2019ll probably do so much (after) his career. The way he treats everyone \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re staff or part of the team, a general manager, or whatever. He takes time to say hi to people, and he genuinely cares about a lot of people. That\u2019s one of the things I admire the most of that outside of his play.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a young guy, he took the time to sit and talk to me for however long. That meant a lot to me.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk to him, you know those people when you come across them \u2014 where the person genuinely cares about you. That makes you feel good.\u201d\n\nContact Danny Webster at dwebster@reviewjournal.com.

However, the texting is only available to T-Mobile customers with the supported phones, although the wireless emergency alerts including evacuation notices can reach anyone with a smartphone, regardless of carrier, T-Mobile told PCMag.\n\nThe cellular Starlink system works by harnessing orbiting satellites to send data to phones, enabling users to receive connectivity even when nearby cell towers have been disrupted. In October, SpaceX and T-Mobile also activated the system on an emergency basis to help victims of Hurricanes Helene and Milton receive cellular coverage. It was able to send emergency alerts to all phones in the affected areas and power emergency text messaging for tens of thousands of phones.\n\nT-Mobile is once again activating the cellular Starlink system for emergency purposes right as it embarks on a beta-test of the technology for its customers. Last month, the carrier began accepting user registrations for the direct-to-cell Starlink service, which will initially be free and focus on satellite-based messaging before rolling out support for voice and data.\n\nTo help wildfire victims in LA, SpaceX is also donating free Starlink dishes to the affected areas while offering residents one free month of Starlink access if they already own or plan on buying a dish.",

Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Bangor FAQs\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Bangor? Spectrum Internet is the best internet service provider in Bangor, offering the widest cable coverage in the area and cheap promo prices in the first year. According to the latest data from the FCC, approximately 89% of households in Bangor have access to Spectrum internet service. Most of the city will also have access to a fixed wireless connection from US Cellular.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Bangor? Yes. According to the latest data from the FCC, fiber internet is available to 75% of Bangor residents. Fidium Fiber is the best fiber provider in the city, with symmetrical speeds of up to 2 gigabits. GoNetspeed also has fiber internet, but it may not be as widely available.\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Bangor? The cheapest internet service is Fidium Fiber, which offers a $25 monthly plan with 100Mbps download and upload speeds. However, once the promo period ends after a year, the price jumps to $45 a month. You can also get a Spectrum plan for the same amount but at 50Mbps (a viable option if Fidium is not in your area). If you want to avoid the price increase after a year, Verizon and T-Mobile Home Internet are the next best options.",

But it caps the data to 50GB.\n\nIn the US, the company updated Starlink.com with the \"Backup\u201450GB\" plan as an option for customers purchasing the satellite internet service through the residential tier.\n\nPreviously, the residential tier only featured a single plan for $120 per month, which supports the standard Starlink dish and unlimited data. But on Friday, users spotted the residential tier offering the backup plan as a more affordable option for new customers.\n\nSpaceX has also offered the 50GB-for-$50 plan for the Starlink Mini dish, and it's been quietly available to subscribers who own the standard Starlink dish since last year, according to Reddit users. But it now looks like SpaceX is rolling out the 50GB option more widely to appeal to prospective customers thinking about buying Starlink as a backup internet solution.\n\n(Credit: Starlink.com)\n\nThe move comes amid raging wildfires in Los Angeles, where about 153,000 people have been ordered to evacuate. The fires have caused electrical outages and taken down ground-based internet and cellular services.\n\nWhile Starlink stills need electricity to function, the technology can bypass the outages since it relies on orbiting satellites to beam the high-speed internet. But on the downside, the $50 plan, while cheaper, will cut the user off once the cap is reached, rendering their dish useless unless they pay for more data.\n\n\u201cNote: If you exceed the allotted data on your Roam 50GB plan and have not opted in to additional Roam data, you will be unable to access the internet except to access your Starlink account,\u201d the company wrote on Starlink.com. In the past, users have reported SpaceX asking $1 for each extra GB consumed through its similar 50GB plans.\n\nIn response to the fires in Los Angeles, SpaceX has donated Starlink dishes to the affected areas and is offering one month of free access to the satellite internet service. But the deal is only available for customers who own or buy a Starlink dish, which usually goes for $349, but can cost more if you live in a congested area.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 29 Stocks Ahead Of Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed.\n\nIn his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: \u201cI think that\u2019s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I\u2019m aware of that and I\u2019m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone\u2019s, we\u2019re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about \u201cprivate equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.\u201d He added and mentioned, \u201cMarc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA\u2019s performance! So [inaudible] we\u2019ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there\u2019s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!\u201d\n\nHowever, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes \u201cthat will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there\u2019s now reacceleration in tech spend.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated \u201cI think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight\u2019s CES talk. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we didn\u2019t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!\u201d\n\nAlong with industrial and material stocks, another sector that\u2019s caught Cramer\u2019s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that \u201cone of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there\u2019s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.\u201d",

            "content": "Last year, T-Mobile ran a commercial in which Snoop Dogg breaks down Patrick Mahomes\u2019 \u200b\u201ctop three plays of the day\u201d with additional commentary from influencer Kai Cenat. Mahomes scrambles into a T-Mobile store with a \u200b\u201clittle shimmy, shimmy shake\u201d (like he\u2019s chasing an ice cream truck), holds up an iPhone 16 Pro \u200b\u201clike a baby lion,\u201d and then takes T-Mobile\u2019s savings and \u200b\u201ccalls it a day.\u201d Snoop tells the audience that families who use T-Mobile can save 20% a month \u200b\u201cversus the other big guys.\u201d\n\nCharter filed an NAD challenge, arguing that it was a \u200b\u201cbig guy\u201d and that T-Mobile\u2019s savings claims weren\u2019t accurate with respect to Charter\u2019s Spectrum Mobile service. T-Mobile pushed back, saying that Charter wasn\u2019t so big, and that T-Mobile wasn\u2019t referring to Charter at all. It demonstrated that Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T collectively represent 94% of the US market. Charter comes in fourth with 3.6% of the US market. So, at most, it was a medium guy in certain regional markets.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether T-Mobile or Charter think that Charter is a \u200b\u201cbig guy,\u201d but rather what consumers think. In this case, NAD determined that \u200b\u201cconsumers are unlikely to know a mobile provider\u2019s market share data when assessing comparative claims, as they are primarily focused on securing service from a provider that is available to them where they live.\u201d Although Charter has a much smaller footprint than the top three competitors, consumers in that footprint could reasonably believe the claim referred to Charter.\n\nAfter seeing the commercial, you may be tempted to shimmy, shimmy shake after an ice cream truck and hold up a baby lion, but we wouldn\u2019t recommend it, at least not without a proper warm up and protective gear. You may also be tempted to think that making a claim against unnamed competitors is easier or less risky than naming a specific competitor, but this case shows that\u2019s not always true.\n\nNAD has frequently held that companies must be able to substantiate claims against an unnamed competitor when consumers might reasonably interpret the ad as referring to that competitor. What makes this case a little different than some of the other ones is that although Charter might be a \u200b\u201cbig guy\u201d in some markets, it arguably isn\u2019t a \u200b\u201cbig guy\u201d on the national stage.\n\nT-Mobile has promised to appeal the decision, so we\u2019ll wait to see what NARB decides.",

Apple has rolled out this service for every iPhone model after the 14, but it never actually sold it as anything more than an emergency link to first responders.\n\nRelated Apple iPhone 14 will have emergency satellite connectivity\n\nThis is not the case with billionaire blowhard Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX/Starlink D2D venture with T-Mobile which is actually starting to come online right about now after a lot of talk about the service since October 2022. Starlink and T-Mobile, for instance, have switched on D2D emergency text messaging for users caught in the Los Angeles wildfires and T-Mobile is advertising the service as \u201ca game changer for those going off the beaten track.\u201d\n\nOff the beaten track\n\nThe words \u201coff the beaten track\u201d are key in that ad copy though, and even then the service will not work in all areas, because as T-Mobile said, you need \u201ca clear view of the sky.\"\n\nThat has not stopped Starlink fanbois claiming that the service could \u201csignificantly disrupt the telecommunications industry\u201d delivering high bandwidth and video from space.\n\nHere's where your brand new D2D service WON'T actually work:\n\n1: Indoors\n\nObviously, your satellite to cell service won\u2019t work indoors when you don\u2019t have a good view of the sky. Kind of puts paid to the idea of such services disrupting the telecoms industry doesn\u2019t it? More importantly, for emergency texting services, D2D won\u2019t work if you\u2019re trapped under an I-Beam in a collapsed building, so bad luck there!\n\nClearly, there are still areas of the Amazon rainforest that are so heavily forested that you won\u2019t get a connection holding your phone up to the steamy forest canopy.\n\nYou might think that heavily forested areas only exist in areas like Brazil or Peru, but that ain\u2019t the case at all. There are heavily forested areas across several parts of the United States and Canada. In parts of Maine - at certain parts of the year - you are going to struggle to get to get a D2D connection under the dense green foliage of North Maine Woods, for instance.\n\n\u201cD2D services won\u2019t work well indoors or in heavy forest cover,\u201d analyst Madden commented. \u201cThe radio signal transmitted from a phone is extremely weak when received by the satellite, so these services are very vulnerable to blockage,\u201d he added.\n\nThere are many lovely caves around the coast of Cornwall worth visiting when you are on holiday in the southwest of England. You, however, will need a supernatural power to get a satellite connection when you\u2019re in Merlin\u2019s Cave in Tintagel, King Arthur\u2019s supposed home base. Arthur may have been able to pull the sword out of the stone but even he couldn\u2019t get a D2D connection.\n\nThe street with the most tall buildings in New York City. If you\u2019ve ever lived in New York City, you already know that the existing satellite global positioning systems (GPS) are blocked by large buildings in certain areas of Manhattan, like in areas of the financial district in Manhattan. The same will be true for low earth orbit (LEO) satellites used to provide D2D services.\n\nIt won\u2019t matter much of course because NYC has extensive 5G cellular and WiFi coverage, so why would you need the sub-1 megabit per second connection that a satellite offers?\n\n\u201cYou will see a lot of hype about \u2018cell service everywhere\u2019, but it\u2019s better to think about these D2D services as a text-message service that might evolve for voice coverage, and won\u2019t be economically feasible for heavy data applications like video streaming,\u201d commented Mobile Experts analyst Joe Madden in an email to Fierce.\n\nNoted, Joe.

Just my luck, my siblings and I didn\u2019t see a single moose from the steps of that cabin last summer, but we did use that deck to shoot the breeze about wireless cell phone coverage.\n\nSomehow, after exhausting all other topics, the question arose about which cell phone carrier has the best coverage. Not in and around the park, mind you. That\u2019s an entirely different story. No, this was about the broader U.S. geography \u2013 and not about satellite coverage, either.\n\nI, of course, piped up and said that if you\u2019re talking strictly about 5G, the answer would be T-Mobile.\n\nThe backlash was quick and harsh. No, Verizon has the best network! Oh no! said another. AT&T is the only one with a decent signal where they live.\n\nEverybody\u2019s right and everybody\u2019s wrong \u2013 except me, of course. Hear me out. And spoiler alert: This isn\u2019t an endorsement of T-Mobile\u2019s cell phone service. Lord knows they don\u2019t need me singing their praises when they do that so very well (and often) on their own.\n\nThe rationale\n\nAs much as T-Mobile celebrates its treasure trove of 2.5 GHz spectrum, and deservedly so, it\u2019s T-Mobile\u2019s 600 MHz spectrum that gives it the lead in 5G coverage, as well as a jump on 5G capacity in the rural areas. You know, the whole foundation of the spectrum \u201clayer cake\u201d that former T-Mobile President of Technology Neville Ray liked to talk about.\n\n\u201cTheir nationwide average of 600 MHz spectrum is 37 MHz, meaning they primarily have 20 MHz channels deployed with some 15 MHz channels, while AT&T and Verizon have each deployed 5G in a portion of their cellular spectrum (likely 5 MHz channels),\u201d according to Brian Goemmer, president of Spektrum Metrics, via email this week.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s T-Mobile\u2019s 2.5 GHz mid-band spectrum that gives it the biggest bang for the buck because it has a lot of it and it got out early with its deployment \u2013 far faster and sooner than Verizon and AT&T could do since they had to wait for the C-band auction to transpire and then for that spectrum to be vacated by satellite companies.\n\nBecause the C-band \u2013 at 3.7-3.98 GHz \u2013 is higher on the spectrum range than 2.5 GHz, it\u2019s going to cost Verizon and AT&T more money to reach as many places as T-Mobile can cover with 2.5 GHz. It\u2019s just physics.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that T-Mobile didn\u2019t buy Sprint for its network assets. Sprint had a crappy network. I know because I used it tried to use it. T-Mobile\u2019s network also sucked for a long time before it bought Sprint. It ended up decommissioning Sprint sites and transitioned parts of its network onto Sprint\u2019s 2.5 GHz spectrum, allowing it to leapfrog its rivals in 5G.\n\nNotice I\u2019m not saying T-Mobile has the best wireless network or the best 4G/5G coverage. That\u2019s a different question and one best left to third parties that study every which way you can measure those things.\n\nBut in support of my opinion, I\u2019ll point to this Opensignal report released this week that once again crowned T-Mobile as the U.S. leader in 5G coverage. You can find other third-party reports by Ookla and Root Metrics here and here.\n\nLest you think I\u2019m cherry-picking third-party reports, I queried some industry analysts as well to see who they deem the U.S. operator with the most 5G coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s T-Mobile as they have put the Sprint 2.5 and attained 600 to work ahead of VZ and AT&T\u2019s C-band,\u201d said Bill Ho, chief analyst at 556 Ventures. \u201cThey are a year or two ahead of Verizon and AT&T.\u201d\n\nMoreover, \u201cthey have deployed [standalone] SA, which allows them to offer 5G slicing products, which competitors have yet to offer, I believe. Doing so can give them inroads to enterprise and medium-sized business sectors, which they are scrapping to get more market share,\u201d Ho said.\n\n\u201cThe most 5G coverage is T-Mobile,\u201d said Roger Entner of Recon Analytics, speaking with Fierce from Germany. \u201cThey have built out 5G, especially in mid band, like fiends.\u201d\n\nDoes it even matter?\n\nBut who cares? People have been berating 5G like it\u2019s the plague. No one \u2013 except I\u2019d argue T-Mobile for all kinds of reasons \u2013 is making much bank on 5G. Other than fixed wireless access (FWA), the only real \u201ckiller app\u201d from 5G is speed. That only gets you so far on a mobile device.\n\nBesides, most people still think Verizon is the superior network provider. In their most recent survey measuring consumer sentiment in April 2024, TD Cowen analysts found that Verizon remained No. 1 for overall brand/image, beating T-Mobile by a hair and AT&T by a wider margin. But they suspect T-Mobile could take the top brand, for the first time in company history, in the next few quarters.\n\nInevitably, which carrier is the best boils down to which one provides the best coverage, 5G or otherwise, where you live, work and play. That\u2019s going to be different for someone living in a remote part of the country where AT&T and Verizon still provide the best signal \u2013 because let\u2019s face it, T-Mobile\u2019s network before the 5G era was nothing to write home about.\n\nThat said, overall, customers in the U.S. are relatively happy, according to Entner, whose firm in 2024 surveyed 200,000 Americans about their mobile network experiences. Unlike other geographies like Europe, wireless networks in the U.S. are pretty decent (but apparently not as good as Iceland.) The net promoter scores for all three U.S. network providers were \u201cvery good,\u201d Entner said.\n\nSo, there you have it. That and $35 will get you into Rocky Mountain National Park, moose or no moose. But watch out, because you\u2019re probably not going to have great cell service once you get past the entry gates. And that goes for all the major carriers.\n\n________________________________________\n\nOp-eds from industry experts, analysts or our editorial staff are opinion pieces that do not necessarily represent the opinions of Fierce Network.\n\nDisagree with this opinion?

But the NAD discovered that any Spectrum customer switching to T-Mobile would not achieve the 20% savings in their first year with T-Mobile because of a promotional offer that ends after year one.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo while the disputed ad says \"Families Can Save,\" if Spectrum is included among \"the other big guys\" that T-Mobile compares its prices with, the advertised 20% savings might not materialize if a Spectrum Mobile customer switches to T-Mobile . That would make the ad misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In 2022, the company paid out USD 350 million to settle a lawsuit relating to the breach.\n\nClaiming that T-Mobile failed to adhere to recognised industry standards as well as its own internal cybersecurity policies, the complaint states that the August breach was a direct result of \u201cT-Mobile\u2019s lack of accountability\u201d and failure to implement adequate cybersecurity measures to address vulnerabilities it knew to exist.\n\n(NOT) GOT YOUR BACK\n\nThe complaint further claims that T-Mobile had misrepresented to its consumers \u201ca high-level of commitment to protecting consumer data\u201d, with the company\u2019s website at the time of the breach using \u201cbold, prominently featured text\u201d to encourage consumers that \u201cwith T-Mobile, you don\u2019t have to worry\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve got your back\u201d.\n\nThis was despite T-Mobile being well aware of its vulnerability to cyber-attacks, the complaint argues. In a 2020 filing at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company stated: \u201cWe are subject to the threat of unauthorised access or disclosure of Confidential Information by [\u2026] malicious actors [\u2026] that could comprise the confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information.\u201d T-Mobile\u2019s merger with telecommunications company Sprint further increased vulnerabilities, with a separate SEC filing acknowledging that the migration could cause an increase in \u201cerrors, cyber attacks or other operational disruptions\u201d.\n\nBLIND EYE\n\nInstead of taking action to protect consumers from the possibility of bad actors capitalising on such vulnerabilities, the complaint alleges that T-Mobile \u201cdecided to accept the risks rather than adequately implement safeguards\u201d. As a result, its practices \u2013 which included the absence of a thorough risk management structure and centralised ownership to ensure compliance with risk assessments and remediation, as well as inadequate password management in breach of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) standards \u2013 allegedly led directly to the potentially avoidable August breach.\n\nNotably, T-Mobile only became aware of the breach when informed by a third-party that its consumer data was listed for sale on the dark web. The complaint claims that without this tip off, T-Mobile would have \u201cremained in the dark\u201d.\n\nINADEQUATE NOTIFICATION\n\nA core aspect of the complaint centres on T-Mobile\u2019s failure to adequately notify customers affected by the August breach. The complaint alleges the provider sent brief and misleading text messages to affected customers which omitted critical information that T-Mobile was required by law to provide. Instead, consumers were left with \u201cpiecemeal information\u201d that restricted them from taking the necessary reasonable steps to protect their personal information, with many left uninformed of the possibility they could be exposed to identity theft or fraud.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks civil penalties and restitution for Washington residents harmed by the breach, as well as injunctive relief requiring T-Mobile to improve its cybersecurity practices and increase communication transparency.\n\nAttorney General Bob Ferguson commented: \u201cThis significant data breach was entirely avoidable. T-Mobile had years to fix key vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity systems \u2014 and it failed.\u201d",

            "content": "The state of Washington has filed a lawsuit against T-Mobile, accusing the carrier of failing to safeguard sensitive data for more than 2 million residents and of \"downplaying the severity\" of its massive data breach in its communications with affected customers.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Attorney General Bob Ferguson, is the latest in a string of suits alleging the company failed to address known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In 2021, a hacker accessed and exposed personal information of more than 79 million T-Mobile customers nationwide, including more than 2 million Washington residents.\n\nT-Mobile previously agreed to a $350 million settlement to resolve claims that its negligence led to the breach. It was the second-largest data breach settlement in US history, following Equifax's $700 million settlement in 2019. Meanwhile, T-Mobile was hit with a $15.75 million fine last year by the Federal Trade Commission related to its repeated security breaches.\n\nThe Washington state lawsuit seeks additional penalties and changes to T-Mobile's cybersecurity practices to prevent future breaches.\n\nThe new suit says T-Mobile knew \"for years\" about some of its cybersecurity vulnerabilities and didn't do enough to address them, which made customers caught up in the breach vulnerable to identity theft and fraud. T-Mobile's headquarters are in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Washington.\n\nRead more: T-Mobile Home Internet Review\n\nThe lawsuit says that more than 183,000 Washington residents had their Social Security numbers compromised but were \"inadequately\" notified that they were among the affected group, making it difficult for them to determine if they were at risk.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that T-Mobile didn't disclose enough information about what was compromised. Beyond Social Security numbers, the hacker exposed phone numbers, names, physical addresses, driver's license information and other personal data.\n\n\"This significant data breach was entirely avoidable,\" Ferguson said in a press release. \"T-Mobile had years to fix key vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity systems \u2014 and it failed.\"\n\nIn a statement sent to CNET, T-Mobile said the lawsuit \"came as a surprise\" because the company had been involved in ongoing discussions with the Washington attorney general's office over the years. It also said it reached out to the office in late November to continue those conversations.\n\n\"While we disagree with their approach and the filing's claims, we are open to further dialogue and welcome the opportunity to resolve this issue, as we have already done with the FCC,\" T-Mobile said in a statement.\n\nThe company added that T-Mobile \"fundamentally transformed\" its \"approach to cyber security over the past four years to further protect our customers.\"\n\nFor years, T-Mobile marketed itself as prioritizing cybersecurity, with the tagline: \"We've got your back. We're always working to protect you and your family and keep your data secure.\"\n\nRead more: I Use T-Mobile Home Internet Every Day. Here's What I Love (and a Few Things I Don't)\n\nBut the lawsuit cited a 2020 filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission that revealed T-Mobile was aware it remained a target of cyberthreats.\n\n\"We are subject to the threat of unauthorized access or disclosure of Confidential Information by ... malicious actors ... that could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information,\" the filing with the SEC read, according to the lawsuit.\n\nT-Mobile said it would \"expect to continue to be the target of cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents.\"\n\nThe lawsuit argues that company failures violated Washington's Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive business practices, and it seeks civil penalties and restitution for impacted Washington customers.\n\nIt also calls for court-ordered changes to improve T-Mobile's cybersecurity practices and requires the company to be more transparent about cybersecurity risks and data breaches.",

It also would expand fixed wireless access (FWA) services in UScellular\u2019s service regions, especially in rural areas,\u201d President Randolph May and Director of Policy Studies Seth Cooper said. T-Mobile is the leading FWA provider with 6 million subscribers. UScellular has 140,000.\n\nIn its comments, the American Consumer Institute said it was urgent for UScellular to find a big partner.\n\n\u201cUScellular is a struggling regional carrier that covers only 10 percent of the U.S. population and yet accounts for just one percent of wireless connections nationwide. That means the acquisition is not large enough to impact market concentration, pricing, or business strategies.\u201d\n\nThe Institute also noted that T-Mobile has announced it will offer cheaper wireless services to current UScellular customers, a move it said will benefit consumers.\n\nAdditional support came from the National Rural Education Association.\n\n\u201cBy enhancing network capacity, reducing costs, and expanding broadband access, T-Mobile\u2019s acquisition of UScellular\u2019s assets aligns with the FCC\u2019s goals of promoting competition and ensuring all Americans have access to high quality wireless services,\u201d the NREA said in a letter to the FCC Wednesday.\n\nThe Association of Women\u2019s Business Centers, which assists nearly 150,000 women entrepreneurs each year, said \u201cthis merger could yield significant benefits for rural communities, a segment of particular importance to many women entrepreneurs,\u201d the organization said in a letter to the FCC . The merger will expand e-commerce capabilities, provide better access to essential business resources, and attract new business opportunities in rural areas, AWBC said.\n\nOther public interest groups, such as Public Knowledge , have expressed opposition to the merger in the past, citing concerns over further consolidation of the market and the potential misuse of public funds that were not supposed to benefit the major wireless carriers.",

At that time it put the number of people affected at 47.8M, but later admitted it was 79M.\n\nA series of further breaches saw the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fine the carrier $15.75M, and ordered it to spend the same again on boosting its security measures.\n\nWashington State suing T-Mobile\n\nAttorney General Bob Ferguson announced this week that he has filed a lawsuit against the company, arguing that the breach was \u201centirely avoidable.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, asserts that T-Mobile knew for years about certain cybersecurity vulnerabilities and did not do enough to address them. At the same time, T-Mobile misrepresented to consumers that the company prioritizes protecting the personal data it collects. Ferguson\u2019s lawsuit also alleges T-Mobile failed to properly notify affected Washingtonians of the data breach, downplaying its severity and sending notices to affected consumers that did not disclose all the information that had been compromised. In short, the lawsuit asserts that the massive data breach was a direct result of T-Mobile\u2019s lack of accountability and failure to adhere to industry cybersecurity standards. \u201cThis significant data breach was entirely avoidable,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cT-Mobile had years to fix key vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity systems \u2014 and it failed.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit says T-Mobile\u2019s security failures violated consumer protection law.\n\nFor years prior to August 2021, T-Mobile did not meet industry standards for cybersecurity and knew about these vulnerabilities. These included insufficient processes for identifying and addressing security threats and a systemic lack of oversight. In some cases, T-Mobile used obvious passwords to protect accounts that had access to customers\u2019 sensitive personal information. The 2021 breach was enabled, in part, when the hacker guessed obvious credentials to gain access to T-Mobile\u2019s internal databases. Prior to 2021, T-Mobile had already been the target of numerous cyberattacks. In fact, filings with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission from 2020 \u2014 a year before the data breach at the center of Ferguson\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 show that T-Mobile knew it would continue to be a target. Despite knowing about and failing to address these cybersecurity issues for years, T-Mobile continued misrepresenting to its customers a commitment to cybersecurity, publicly touting on its website: \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back. We\u2019re always working to protect you and your family and keep your data secure.\u201d Ferguson\u2019s lawsuit asserts that these failures violated Washington\u2019s Consumer Protection Act. It alleges the 2021 data breach was the direct result of T-Mobile\u2019s lack of accountability.\n\nT-Mobile told us:\n\nWe have had multiple conversations about this incident from 2021 with the Washington AG\u2019s office over the last several years and even reached out in late November to continue discussions, so the office\u2019s decision to file a lawsuit came as a surprise. While we disagree with their approach and the filing\u2019s claims, we are open to further dialogue and welcome the opportunity to resolve this issue, as we have already done with the FCC. We also look forward to sharing how T-Mobile has fundamentally transformed our approach to cyber security over the past four years to further protect our customers.\n\nPhoto by Mateus Maia on Unsplash",

            "content": "T-Mobile is being sued by Washington for allegedly poor cybersecurity practices that led to a hack compromising the sensitive personal data of more than 2 million state residents, exposing them to identity theft and fraud.\n\nThe consumer protection lawsuit, announced Monday, alleges that the telecommunications giant knew about its cybersecurity weaknesses for years and failed to fix them.\n\nThe carrier also misled customers by telling them it focused on safeguarding consumer data and did not properly alert them about the 2021 breach, including by failing to reveal which information had been hacked, state Attorney General Bob Ferguson alleges. The suit seeks civil penalties.\n\nT-Mobile agreed to pay a $31.5 million fine and strengthen its cyber practices in September as part of a wide-ranging settlement with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for its alleged cybersecurity failings, which the FCC said led to the 2021 breach as well as additional hacks in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThat settlement ordered T-Mobile to adopt zero-trust network security and multi-factor authentication measures that it had previously lacked, the FCC said at the time.\n\nThe 2021 breach led to the leak of personal data belonging to 79 million T-Mobile customers across the country, according to a Ferguson press release. The breach also allegedly exposed Social Security numbers (SSNs) for 183,000 of the more than 2 million Washington state consumers impacted by the hack, the press release said.\n\nPhone numbers, names, physical addresses and driver\u2019s license information also were allegedly leaked, Ferguson\u2019s office said.\n\nA T-Mobile spokesperson said in a statement that the company is surprised by the lawsuit since it has had more than one conversation about the incident with Ferguson\u2019s staff and even contacted the office in November to continue discussions.\n\n\u201cWhile we disagree with their approach and the filing\u2019s claims, we are open to further dialogue and welcome the opportunity to resolve this issue, as we have already done with the FCC,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe also look forward to sharing how T-Mobile has fundamentally transformed our approach to cyber security over the past four years to further protect our customers.\u201d\n\nThe breach began in March 2021 and didn\u2019t end until August of that year. T-Mobile security monitoring was so poor, the lawsuit says, that the company only learned of the intrusion when an anonymous outsider alerted the company that data belonging to its customers was for sale on the dark web.\n\n\u201cThis significant data breach was entirely avoidable,\u201d Ferguson said in a statement. \u201cT-Mobile had years to fix key vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity systems \u2014 and it failed.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile alerted customers to the breach via text messages which \u201comitted critical and legally required information, and in some cases misled customers regarding the severity of the breach,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nConsumers whose SSNs were breached were not told about their exposure, Ferguson alleges. Meanwhile, the company allegedly did tell customers whose SSNs were not hacked that their numbers were safe.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s cybersecurity failings included \u201cinsufficient processes for identifying and addressing security threats and a systemic lack of oversight,\u201d according to the release.\n\nThe company sometimes used \u201cobvious\u201d passwords to safeguard accounts that included sensitive personal data, Ferguson\u2019s office said.\n\nThe 2021 hack should not have surprised T-Mobile, Ferguson\u2019s office said, citing the fact that 2020 Securities and Exchange Commission filings \u201cshow that T-Mobile knew it would continue to be a target.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the press release said, the company\u2019s website told customers the company prioritized data security, Ferguson\u2019s office said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got your back,\u201d the website said. \u201cWe\u2019re always working to protect you and your family and keep your data secure.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the civil penalties, the lawsuit asks for T-Mobile to be forced to bolster its cybersecurity program.",

According to Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, the telecom giant chose to play down the severity of the breach and failed to notify impacted individuals in a timely manner.\n\n\"When it learned of the data breach, T-Mobile's notification to affected consumers was inadequate in numerous ways,\" reads the AG's announcement.\n\n\"Current customers received text messages that were brief, omitted critical and legally required information, and in some cases misled customers regarding the severity of the breach.\"\n\n\"Moreover, current customers whose Social Security numbers were exposed did not receive any information regarding that exposure.\"\n\nFerguson alleges that this breach came after a series of previous cyberattacks that showed T-Mobile remained in threat actors' crosshairs, yet the firm allegedly failed to implement the appropriate security measures to prevent its occurrence.\n\nThis continued into 2024, when T-Mobile was compromised by the Chinese state-backed actors \"Salt Typhoon.\" However, the telecommunications firm says that no customer data was accessed as part of this breach.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed at King Country Superior Court, also alleges that T-Mobile misrepresented its cybersecurity capabilities, giving customers a false sense of security and safety about their data.\n\nThe legal action now seeks a court order mandating that T-Mobile strengthen its cybersecurity practices to meet industry standards and improve transparency and customer communication when data breaches happen.\n\nThe lawsuit also seeks the approval of civil penalties for violations of the Consumer Protection Act and compensation to affected customers who suffered damages resulting from the breach.\n\nAdditionally, T-Mobile may be ordered to surrender any financial gains obtained through the alleged deceptive practices.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted T-Mobile requesting a statement on the Washington AG lawsuit, and a spokesperson sent us the following comment:\n\n\"We have had multiple conversations about this incident from 2021 with the Washington AG's office over the last several years and even reached out in late November to continue discussions, so the office's decision to file a lawsuit yesterday came as a surprise,\" T-Mobile told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"While we disagree with their approach and the filing's claims, we are open to further dialogue and welcome the opportunity to resolve this issue, as we have already done with the FCC.

The lawsuit also claims T-Mobile's notifications to affected consumers were inadequate, lacking critical information and downplaying the severity of the breach.\n\nThe lawsuit further alleges that T-Mobile did not meet industry standards for cybersecurity, using insufficient processes for identifying and addressing security threats. In some instances, the company reportedly used obvious passwords to protect accounts with access to sensitive customer information. The breach was partially enabled when a hacker guessed these credentials to access T-Mobile\u2019s internal databases.\n\nDespite previous cyberattacks and filings with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 indicating awareness of ongoing threats, T-Mobile allegedly continued to misrepresent its commitment to cybersecurity. The company publicly claimed, \"We\u2019ve got your back.

            "content": "Shares of T-Mobile (TMUS -1.20%) fell 4.3% on Monday as of 11:37 a.m. ET, a notable decline even as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 2.61%) was up over 1.8% by that time.\n\nT-Mobile was a massive winner in 2024, finishing the year up 40% with dividends included. However, with its shares perhaps reflecting the strength of its business and the full synergies from the 2020 Sprint merger, two Wall Street analysts both downgraded shares today.\n\nWells Fargo and RBC move to the sidelines\n\nToday, sell-side analysts at both Wells Fargo and RBC Capital downgraded T-Mobile from a buy to a hold rating. The analyst team at Wells lowered its price target from $240 to $220, while the RBC team lowered its target from $255 to $240. T-Mobile's stock entered the day at just over $219 per share.\n\nT-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint back in 2020 was a home-run deal, as it not only led to massive cost synergies, but also gave the combined company a spectrum advantage over rivals as the market transitioned from 4G to 5G. Since then, T-Mobile has been outgrowing rivals, taking market share and seeing a huge inflection in free cash flow.\n\nHowever, the \"low-hanging fruit\" of the acquisition appears to be now behind the company, according to both analysts. Furthermore, the analysts note that T-Mobile will see a slowdown in free cash flow growth as its tax rate reverts to that of a full taxpayer. The analysts also note T-Mobile trades a 11 times forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and 15 times forward free cash flow estimates, whereas rivals Verizon (VZ -0.32%) and AT&T (T 1.88%) trade at 7 times EBITDA and 9 to 11 times free cash flow, respectively.\n\nT-Mobile is still solid\n\nThe analysts may be correct that T-Mobile stock will struggle to achieve the huge gains of the past few years, but that doesn't mean it's a sell. T-Mobile still remains \"best in class,\" even to these cautious analysts, and is plowing a lot of cash flow into share repurchases.\n\nFurthermore, T-Mobile just raised its dividend 35% last year, but at just a 1.6% yield, that payout has lots of room to grow. So for those 10 years or so away from retirement, T-Mobile is an excellent recession-resistant pick that should pay a hefty yield by the time you are seeking retirement income.",

            "content": "For T-Mobile home internet users, T-Mobile's upgrade in speeds is a cause for celebration. But for certain new customers looking to sign up, this might not be the case.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet is changing things up by offering two new speed tiers. Your download speeds can now reach up to 415 megabits per second, and the boost in speeds comes with free Hulu and Paramount Plus subscriptions. You might be excited to sign up for T-Mobile's faster speed tiers and new streaming perks, but I wouldn't get too excited just yet. T-Mobile finished strong in the third quarter of 2024, offering service to 6 million home internet customers across the country. However, this number doesn't tell the entire story.\n\nIn December 2024, it was revealed at the UBS TMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, that 1 million additional customers are currently in a queue for the company\u2019s service.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nWe have a million people on our waitlist right now for 5G broadband at T-Mobile -- a million people that want to be a part of us, but we don't have a slot open for them right here right now based on where they live. Jon Freier, US consumer group president of T-Mobile\n\nT-Mobile frequently boasts about its large 5G network, stating on its website that it\u2019s the country\u2019s largest and fastest 5G network. T-Mobile Home Internet connected over 400,000 new home broadband customers in the third quarter alone.\n\nRegarding the backlog, a spokesperson told CNET that \"the availability of T-Mobile\u2019s 5G home internet depends on network capacity, and spots are available on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure all customers, including wireless, get the best possible experience.\u201d\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nThat vibes with what a T-Mobile spokesperson told us last year when we asked why some people can get 5G mobile service at home but can't sign up for 5G home broadband service.\n\n\"There are still many households that do not qualify for Home Internet yet, even though they may get 5G on their mobile device -- and that's intentional,\" we were told via email.\n\n\"Our fixed wireless Home Internet runs on the extra capacity on our wireless network. In some areas, we have extra capacity on the network, but in others, we don't. So, we allocate access to Home Internet on a sector-by-sector, home-by-home basis.\"\n\nIts 5G network has grown substantially over the years, but the company still has plenty of room for improvement to ensure that coverage is met across its entire footprint.\n\nThe FCC map shows that many Americans in the West do not have coverage for T-Mobile Home Internet, and coverage remains spotty in the Midwest. Federal Communications Commission\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Federal Communications Commission, almost 60% of the US population has access to T-Mobile Home Internet. More importantly, some households in the Western region -- including Nevada, Oregon, Wyoming, New Mexico and Utah -- lack significant access. The same can be said for certain addresses in the Midwest, where coverage is spotty in South Dakota and Nebraska.\n\n5G technology and why it matters\n\nWhat is 5G home internet, exactly? 5G stands for the fifth generation of wireless data networks, which uses mobile connections to power your home internet. This technology promises faster data speeds and features less lag than 4G. In some cases, you might be able to access 5G on your phone but not for home internet.\n\nViva Tung/CNET\n\nOverall, broadband access is an ongoing issue, and as the FCC map shows, it's particularly affecting rural America, which does not have many options for a decent internet connection. 5G home internet is helping to bridge that gap more quickly than other internet connection types, apart from satellite internet, which can be cost-prohibitive due to expensive equipment costs.\n\n5G home internet has been on the rise, as seen in the growth of AT&T Internet Air, Starry Internet, Verizon 5G Home Internet and T-Mobile Home Internet. Demand is growing, evidenced by T-Mobile\u2019s considerable waitlist and users' reports of being more satisfied with wireless connections. The latest J.D. Power 2024 Customer Satisfaction survey highlights that even with the potential slow speeds that come with a wireless connection, people aren't dissuaded and consider this technology as a less costly option. On average, 5G home internet monthly cost is anywhere between $50 to $70, whereas, with fiber, will ring you anywhere from $30 to $100 or more.\n\nThis will pressure wireless internet service providers, such as T-Mobile, to address the rising demand for 5G home internet technology. T-Mobile hasn't announced how it\u2019ll bridge the gap of home internet access for the million Americans on its waitlist, but the company may lean on another approach.\n\nT-Mobile turns to fiber internet\n\nIn September 2024, Mike Katz, T-Mobile\u2019s president of Marketing, Strategy and Products, spoke at the company's Markets Day about using its growing fiber network to address the backlog.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that gives us a real advantage as we move into fiber is the fact that we have customers today that have tried to buy 5G broadband from us and we haven\u2019t been able to support them because of our fallow capacity model. We think there\u2019s an immediate opportunity for us to take that demand and convert it into paying fiber customers,\u201d Katz said.\n\nIn other words, T-Mobile\u2019s recent expansion of its fiber network is partly trying to fill the gap that its 5G network simply cannot fill. According to a company press release, T-Mobile is aiming to reach 12 to 15 million or more households with its fiber network by the end of 2030.\n\nLooking to Sign Up For T-Mobile Home Internet FAQs\n\nWhat is 5G home internet? 5G technology stands for the fifth generation of wireless data networks. Unlike 4G, it promises faster speeds and less lag. It uses mobile cellular networks to power your home internet connection. 5G home internet providers like AT&T Internet Air, Verizon and T-Mobile offer service starting at $50 to $70 monthly. Starry Internet may also have cheap starting rates, but it's not as widely available.",

            "content": "The Attorney General (AG) is suing Bellevue-based T-Mobile for \u201cfailing to adequately secure sensitive personal information of more than 2 million Washingtonians,\u201d according to a news release.\n\nWashington AG Bob Ferguson said the failure led to a \u201cmassive data breach\u201d that exposed the personal information of the affected consumers, making them vulnerable to fraud and identity theft.\n\nOther MyNW news: Mercer Island police investigate middle school vandalism, hate crime\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, claimed T-Mobile knew about the security issues for years, but didn\u2019t do enough to fix them. The AG\u2019s Office also claimed the company was not correct in saying it prioritizes protecting its customers\u2019 data. It also alleged T-Mobile failed to properly notify the impacted Washingtonians of the data breach, downplayed its severity and did not disclose all the information that was compromised.\n\nThe AG\u2019s Office believes the massive data breach was the company\u2019s fault.\n\n\u201cThis significant data breach was entirely avoidable,\u201d Ferguson said in the release. \u201cT-Mobile had years to fix key vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity systems and it failed.\u201d\n\nThe data breach started in March 2021 and was not discovered until August 12, 2021, the AG\u2019s Office explained. The company found out a hacker gained access to the company\u2019s internal network when an anonymous source notified the company that its customers\u2019 data was posted for sale on the dark web.\n\nThe breach exposed the personal information of more than 79 million customers across the country, with 2,025,634 of those in Washington. Of those, 183,406 Washingtonians had their Social Security numbers compromised, the release stated.\n\nThe company sent out a text that said in part, \u201cT-Mobile has determined that unauthorized access to some of your personal data has occurred. We have no evidence that your debit/credit card information was compromised.\u201d The text left out any information about social security numbers being compromised.\n\n\u201cBecause T-Mobile\u2019s breach notifications omitted critical information and downplayed the severity, it affected consumers\u2019 ability to adequately assess their risk of identity theft or fraud,\u201d the news release stated.\n\nT-Mobile sent the following response to KIRO Newsradio on Monday.\n\nWe have had multiple conversations about this incident from 2021 with the Washington AG\u2019s office over the last several years and even reached out in late November to continue discussions, so the office\u2019s decision to file a lawsuit today came as a surprise. While we disagree with their approach and the filing\u2019s claims, we are open to further dialogue and welcome the opportunity to resolve this issue, as we have already done with the FCC. We also look forward to sharing how T-Mobile has fundamentally transformed our approach to cyber security over the past four years to further protect our customers.\u201d\n\nLocal crime: Man charged in Metro bus stabbing pleads not guilty\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, In July 2022, T-Mobile agreed to pay $350 million to customers affected by a class-action lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission after the company disclosed personal data was stolen. However, the company said the settlement contained no admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the defendants.\n\nFerguson\u2019s lawsuit, according to the AG\u2019s Office, seeks civil penalties and institutions for those in Washington who were harmed by the data breach.\n\nT-Mobile was awarded the naming rights to the Seattle Mariners\u2019 stadium in 2019 for $87.5 million. The agreement between T-Mobile and the ballpark is expected to last 25 years.\n\nContributing: Anne D\u2019Innocenzio, The Associated Press\n\nJulia Dallas is a content editor at MyNorthwest.

TMUS is expected to release its fiscal Q4 earnings results before the market opens on Wednesday, Jan. 29.\n\nAhead of this event, analysts expect the wireless carrier to report a profit of $2.17 per share , up nearly 30% from $1.67 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has surpassed Wall Street's bottom-line estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion. In the most recent quarter, TMUS exceeded the consensus EPS estimate by 10.1%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect TMUS to report EPS of $9.31, up 34.3% from $6.93 in fiscal 2023 .\n\nT-Mobile has surged 35.2% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming the S&P 500 Index's ( $SPX ) 26.3% gain .

Prosecutors said he stole cash from a Wauwatosa restaurant and \"numerous\" cellphones from a Milwaukee cellphone store. The 29-year-old is charged with six felonies, and his bond was set at $50,000.\n\n\n\nA Milwaukee man is charged in a pair of armed robberies \u2013 one from a restaurant, the other from a cellphone store \u2013 that happened at the end of December.\n\nProsecutors said 29-year-old Lamont Stallings denied robbing the restaurant, and claimed an unspecified co-actor \"forced him\" into the cellphone store robbery.\n\nSIGN UP TODAY: Get daily headlines, breaking news emails from FOX6 News\n\nRestaurant robbery | Dec. 27\n\nWauwatosa police were called for an armed robbery at a restaurant near 67th and North. According to a criminal complaint, an employee said a masked suspect handed over a note that said something to the effect of: \"Don't scream. Give me all the money or I'm gonna shoot.\" The employee handed over all the cash in the register, and the suspect ran off.\n\nThe robbery was captured on surveillance. Court filings said it showed a red car pull up and seemingly park just out of view of the camera. Shortly after, the suspect walked into the frame from where the car would've parked, and ran back to the area where the car would've parked just after the robbery.\n\nSuspect, later identified as Lamont Stallings, in restaurant robbery (Courtesy: MCDAO)\n\nCellphone store robbery | Dec. 30\n\nMilwaukee police were called for an armed robbery at a T-Mobile store near 103rd and Silver Spring on the city's northwest side. The complaint said a suspect handed over a note that read: \"Don\u2019t scream, I am armed, make it quick, give me 20 iPhones.\" The suspect then showed a pistol.\n\nAccording to court filings, an employee handed over \"numerous\" iPhones, each worth approximately $500, and the suspect loaded them into a duffle bag before he made the employee walk him out of the store.\n\nThe robbery was also captured on surveillance, and a nearby doorbell camera video showed the suspect \u2013 with the duffle bag in tow \u2013 walking toward a red car.\n\nFeatured article\n\nCourt filings said one of the cellphones had a GPS tracking device. Officers used that GPS information to look for the suspect, leading them to the area of 76th and Brown Deer. There, officers saw a man matching the suspect's description walk to a red car and place a duffle bag in the trunk.\n\nThe suspect drove off, per the complaint, and minutes later officers were notified that the phone's GPS location was on the move. Officers continued to get updates on the device's location and found the same car parked more than nine miles away near 27th and Burleigh. Officers saw the same suspect they saw near 76th and Brown Deer and took him into custody.\n\nFREE DOWNLOAD: Get breaking news alerts in the FOX6 News app for iOS or Android.\n\nIn custody\n\nProsecutors said the suspect initially refused to identify himself, but a traffic citation issued to Stallings was found in the car. A previous booking photo further identified the man in custody as Stallings.\n\nA search of the car located a pistol, the complaint states, as well as clothing that matched that worn by the suspect in the T-Mobile robbery. When he was arrested, investigators said Stallings was also wearing pants and shoes that were \"an identical match\" to the suspect in the restaurant robbery.\n\nSuspect vehicle tied to robbery (Courtesy: MCDAO)\n\nIn the trunk of the car, the complaint states police found numerous cellphones that were confirmed as having been stolen from the T-Mobile near 103rd and Silver Spring.\n\nStallings denied involvement in the restaurant, per the complaint. In regard to the T-Mobile robbery, court filings said he told investigators a \"co-actor forced him to do it with him, and force [sic] him to ride in the maroon Pontiac, change clothing with this unknown suspect before the robbery, and then change clothing back after the robbery.\"\n\nIn all, Stallings is charged with two counts of armed robbery, one count of possession of a firearm by an adjudicated delinquent and three counts of felony bail jumping. Stallings appeared in court on Jan. 4, and his bond was set at $50,000.",

            "content": "Switching wireless providers isn't easy. Although there are three major networks in the US, the actual number of wireless carriers and plans is significantly higher. Sifting through this big, confusing mess can be overwhelming especially when you are thinking of switching providers after your carrier raised the rate on your older plan.\n\nWe want to help make this process a little easier. Here's how to choose a cellphone plan in 2025.\n\nWhich network works best for you?\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nIn the US there are three major networks: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. All three offer services directly and have robust nationwide networks that offer 4G LTE (fast) and 5G (really fast) data.\n\nThe most important aspect of choosing a network is finding one that works in your area. This makes it hard for us to give a blanket recommendation of any one carrier. For example, T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in rural Iowa, Verizon is more reliable.\n\nWhile your mileage may vary, the good news is that these networks are growing and improving all the time, particularly as the three major players continue to try and blanket the US with 5G. It's quite possible that a decade ago you left a network complaining about its sparse service, but now it has beefed itself up because of that arms race to acquire customers.\n\nIf you know any friends or family in your area that already use the carrier you're considering, ask about their experience. You could also go to a carrier's store and see if they offer any free ways to try out the service before switching over, such as T-Mobile's Network Pass which lets you sample T-Mobile's service for free for three months. Verizon offers a similar 30-day \"trial\" program while AT&T has recently introduced its own 30-day eSIM free trial option for sampling its network.\n\nThen, of course, there are the plans themselves. Below is a comparison of some of the latest plans from AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. For this chart, we focused on each carrier's cheapest plan, as well as their respective \"middle\" options that we think could make sense for most people.\n\nIt is worth noting that some plans, like T-Mobile's Go5G include streaming perks like Netflix while Verizon lets you add perks like the Disney Bundle (Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu) for $10 per month if you have its latest Unlimited Welcome, Plus or Ultimate plans.\n\nMost Verizon and AT&T unlimited plans (with the notable exception being AT&T's Value Plus VL) also don't require you to have every line on the same plan, so if only one of your family plan's lines needs extra hotspot data, you can drop the others down to cheaper options and save a little.\n\nIf you're looking for multiple lines on T-Mobile and its cheapest rate, you're better off going with its regular Essentials or Essentials Saver plans. A promotion the carrier is doing has it available for $100 per month for four lines.\n\nWireless plans compared Plan Total data Cost for one line (with AutoPay) 5G High-speed hotspot Cost for four lines (with AutoPay) T-Mobile Essentials Saver Unlimited $50 Yes Yes (but at \"3G speeds\") $120 T-Mobile Essentials Unlimited $60 Yes Yes (but at \"3G speeds\") $100 AT&T Value Plus VL Unlimited $51 Yes No $124 Verizon Unlimited Welcome Unlimited $65 Yes (5G Nationwide only) No $120 T-Mobile Go5G Unlimited $70 Yes 15GB per line $140 AT&T Unlimited Extra EL Unlimited $76 Yes 30GB per line $164 Verizon Unlimited Plus Unlimited $80 Yes 30GB per line $180\n\nKnow the smaller and prepaid players\n\nVisible, Google Fi and Mint Mobile are just a few of the many MVNOs that rely on larger networks. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nWhile AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon operate the major networks, other smaller providers offer service on their airwaves. First, there are the prepaid brands each carrier owns. Verizon has Visible, AT&T has Cricket and T-Mobile has Metro and now Mint Mobile. All use their parent's respective networks for service.\n\nSmaller players also rely on the larger networks for service. Google Fi, for example, uses T-Mobile's network, while cable companies Comcast and Spectrum rely on Verizon for their respective Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile brands.\n\nBoost Mobile, which is owned by Dish, uses a combination of T-Mobile and AT&T while Dish builds out its own 5G network. Dish has started offering its own service that rivals the big carriers under the Boost brand.\n\nThe benefit of these smaller carriers -- many of which are known as mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs -- is that you can get access to the larger provider's service at a more affordable rate. If you found that Verizon works best where you live but its service is too pricey, switching to Visible, Spectrum Mobile or Xfinity Mobile could potentially allow you to keep similar coverage but pay a bit less (although you may lose out on some other perks like free streaming services).\n\nWe've broken down a few of these providers, including which provider uses which network and explained some of the trade-offs you'll want to keep in mind.\n\nKnow how much you owe on your installment plan\n\nGetting a new iPhone at a deep discount from a carrier often requires a big commitment. Patrick Holland/CNET\n\nTwo-year contracts have largely disappeared from the US wireless market. Unfortunately, they now seem set to be replaced by increasingly longer installment plans.\n\nAT&T and Verizon now consistently only offer 36-month installment plans for the latest devices from Apple, Google and Samsung. T-Mobile, meanwhile, still has options for 24-month installments with plans like its Go5G Plus offering better upgrade deals every two years and Go5G Next offering deals every year.\n\nWith these longer timelines you can get a flagship phone for significantly less, but you need to stay on that carrier (and potentially with a pricier unlimited plan) for two or three years. If you leave before that time has passed, you risk needing to pay out the balance owed on the phone, which some providers require before they \"unlock\" the device to be used on other networks.\n\nMajor carriers often offer several hundred dollars when you switch, which can help subsidize the price of the change. You'll want to check your account online or go into your carrier's store to find out how much you might still owe on your phone before you leave.\n\nDecide if you should keep your current phone\n\nThe modernization of phones and networks means your existing phone will probably work just fine on a new carrier. All the major wireless carriers offer a similar assortment of the latest devices, particularly when it comes to the iPhone and the Galaxy lines.\n\nTo make the most of any switch you'll probably want to take this opportunity to upgrade your device, particularly if it's a few years old and lacks modern features like 5G. There are often extra deals when adding or opening a new line to help pay off any installment plan or get you to a better device.\n\nIf you'd rather keep what you have, your existing device will probably work just fine so long as it's unlocked from your previous provider.\n\nKnow your discounts\n\nKeep in mind that all of the carriers offer additional savings, which you could be eligible for depending on your employer, military status, student status or even age. If you're on a family plan, a family member could qualify even if you don't.\n\nFirst responders, military members, veterans, nurses and teachers can get discounts from every major carrier. Verizon offers discounts for students and those in a range of professions, while T-Mobile's Work Perks could knock 15% off Go5G Plus or Go5G Next plans and AT&T offers a similar program for its Unlimited Premium PL and Elite plans that it calls Signature.\n\nIf you're 55 or older, you may also be eligible for a discounted plan: T-Mobile offers discounted plans nationwide for as low as $55 a month for two lines, while Verizon and AT&T offer similar options but only for Florida residents.\n\nWe break down the discounts in greater detail here, for AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile.\n\nThis could save you money if you switch, or potentially lower your current rate a bit and save you the hassle of changing providers.\n\nUnderstand the perks\n\nIf you have the right Verizon plan you could get free Disney Plus. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nMany of the major carriers bundle in perks for using their higher-end unlimited plans, particularly streaming services. Verizon offers the Disney Bundle (Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus) as a $10 monthly perk for its latest unlimited plans while T-Mobile offers Netflix Standard (with ads) on its Go5G branded offerings and also includes a subscription to Apple TV Plus and Hulu (with ads) with Go5G Next.\n\nEven prepaid and smaller carriers like Cricket (HBO Max with Ads) and US Mobile (a variety of options) offer perks with some of their unlimited plans.\n\nIn addition, Verizon has perks for services including Apple One, Walmart Plus and a Netflix/Max bundle while T-Mobile's Go5G plans also offer in-flight Wi-Fi and unlimited data abroad. T-Mobile's Metro offers 100GB of Google One storage and one-year subscriptions to ViX Premium with some of its Unlimited and Metro Flex plans, with its Metro Flex Plus adding in a subscription to Amazon Prime. AT&T, meanwhile, gives six months of free gaming with an extended trial of Nvidia's GeForce Ultimate.\n\nIf you're already paying for one or more of these subscriptions, switching to the right provider could be a way to help you save even more.",

We\u2019re seeing the start of the breakdown.\n\nAlthough he\u2019s young at 28, he physically looks much older, like a person in his mid-to-late 30s, due to the punishment he\u2019s received. We\u2019re seeing that now, with him entering fights with multiple injuries, stamina problems, and slowed reflexes.\n\nIn Benavidez\u2019s last fight, his head resembled a doorstop with the shots he was getting hit with by Oleksandr Gvozdyk on June 15th.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t blocking anything and getting hit at will by Gvozdyk. If the Ukrainian fighter hadn\u2019t been recently retired for four years, he would have likely knocked Benavidez out. That was hard to watch. Granted, it was his first fight at 175, but it was obvious that David had reached his ceiling. It was a combination of age and fighting where he should have been all along.\n\nWeight Bully?\n\nPeople criticize Benavidez for fighting outside of his natural weight class, competing at 168 rather than 175. Although he\u2019s been young enough to dehydrate down in weight, he likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this if there had been strict 10-lb rehydration limits to prevent him from blowing up. In other words, Benavidez has been a weight bully, and Judah and Dirrell fail to mention that.\n\nJudah thinks Benavidez (29-0, 24 KOs) will knockout Morrell early, using his volume punching. He crowds his opponents and unloads nonstop punches. That\u2019s what he did with Dirrell and tried to do with his last opponent, Oleksandr Gvozdyk. It didn\u2019t work in that case.\n\n\u201cI believe that fight is going four rounds. David Benavidez by knockout,\u201d said Zab Judah to MillCity Boxing, picking Benavidez to stop David Morrell on February 1st. \u201cDavid comes in round one. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to go longer than that,\u201d said Anthony Dirrell. \u201cDavid [Benavidez] doesn\u2019t have the one punch [power]. It\u2019s the accumulation. David has some pop, but I don\u2019t see the one-punch knockout. \u201cDavid Morrell can last a little bit. Being from Cuba, he can hit, too. Everyone knows Cubans are made to hit. If I have to lean one way, it\u2019s David Benavidez 100% because of his resume. We haven\u2019t seen Morrell tested. We\u2019ve seen David tested on multiple occasions. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Morrell tested in a big old fight, a magnitude like this. This fight, everybody is going to want to see this fight. It depends on how Morrell is going to fight,\u201d said Dirrell when asked if Morrell can go the 12-round distance with Benavidez.\n\nDirrell has first-hand experience fighting Benavidez on September 28, 2019, and was stopped in the ninth round on a cut. He did stun him twice with left hooks but couldn\u2019t finish him. Benavidez was much bigger than Dirrell and looked like a light-heavyweight\n\nPast-Their-Prime Fighters\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen Benavidez tested in a big fight, either. It\u2019s not just Morrell. Dirrell was in his mid-30s when he fought Benavidez, and well, his prime. Also, he was a lot smaller, going up against the light, heavyweight-sized Mexican Monster.\n\nMorrell has fought better guys in the amateur ranks than Benavidez has as a pro. It\u2019s not even close. Morrell has the experience advantage against quality opposition. The best fighters Benavidez fought were mainly older, over-the-hill fighters like these guys:\n\n\u2013 Demetrius Andrade: 36\n\n\u2013 Oleksandr Gvozdyk: 37\n\n\u2013 David Lemieux: 35\n\n\u2013 Roamer Alexis Angulo: 40\n\nCaleb Plant wasn\u2019t old when he fought Benavidez in 2023, but Canelo Alvarez had already knocked him out in 2021. He had no power. That\u2019s the only younger world-class fighter that Benavidez has beaten. The rest of them have been old.\n\n\u201cDavid, it\u2019s the accumulation that is going to get to him [Morrell]. He\u2019s got some pop. Every punch, you\u2019re going to feel it. I think Morrell is going to put up a fight,\u201d said Dirrell.\n\n\u201cDo you think David Morrell can knock out David Benavidez?\u201d said Judah.\n\n\u201cBenavidez can take a hit, though,\u201d said Dirrell. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really seen Benavidez hurt. I never seen it. He got dropped, but I think it was a flash knockdown [against Ronald Gavril on September 8, 2017, in their first fight. He was a little too aggressive, but that\u2019s Benavidez.\u201d\n\nIf Morrell is forced into a war on the inside, he\u2019s got a chance to knock out Benavidez because he\u2019s a lot stronger and bigger than the guys he\u2019s been fighting at 168. Gvozdyk couldn\u2019t fight on the inside. He mostly lit up Benavidez from the outside after he gassed out in the second half of the fight. Again, Dirrell had Benavidez hurt, and was a lot smaller.\n\nMorrell\u2019s Youthful Advantage\n\n\u201cI think he calmed down a little bit. He\u2019s a good counter-puncher. So, blocking and coming back with his own counter. I think it\u2019ll be a good fight. I think it\u2019ll be a chess match at first. Then it\u2019ll heat up in the middle of the rounds,\u201d said Dirrell.\n\n\u201cI see it going four rounds,\u201d said Judah.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t see Morrell banging it out with him like that,\u201d said Dirrell. \u201cI see him moving, getting his shots in, but be on the move. I think he\u2019s going to mix it up at times because of the blood, but I don\u2019t see a mix-up like that.\u201d\n\nMorrell, 26, is two years younger than Benavidez but is more youthful and has that freshness factor going for him. He hasn\u2019t pounded for 12 years in the pro ranks like Benavidez, and that shows. So, Judah and Dirrell are looking at the experience factor as a positive rather than as a major negative for the Mexican Monster Benavidez. When it\u2019s early in a fighter\u2019s career, experience is important, but not when a guy has been in the game since 2013. Then it\u2019s a negative.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that Morrell has to take him into the deeper waters for him to win?\u201d said Judah.\n\n\u201cYou have to, but Benavidez gets stronger as it goes, too, though. We got to see what Morrell\u2019s condition is going into the fight,\u201d said Dirrell. \u201cI see David in Vegas right now. If you don\u2019t go to Vegas a few weeks before, it\u2019s over.\u201d",

The first commercial flyer with Starlink connectivity will also take off before the ongoing year comes to an end.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAccess will be given free of charge to all MileagePlus loyalty customers. \u201cWe have a lot planned for our MileagePlus members this year, and adding Starlink to as many planes as we can \u2014 as quickly as we can \u2014 is at the center of it all,\u201d MileagePlus chief Richard Nunn was quoted as saying.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nThe carrier has plans to add Starlink infrastructure to its entire fleet. Once the plans materialize, United will become the first major U.S. carrier to embrace Starlink for in-flight Wi-Fi convenience.\n\nUnited, however, won\u2019t be the first airline to land Starlink Aviation services. Hawaiian Airlines started offering free Starlink-assisted Wi-Fi on its Airbus fleet starting in September of last year. The entirety of the A330 fleet, operating across Asia, Oceania, and the U.S., now offers free Starlink access.\n\nA month later, Qatar Airways also launched its Boeing 777 flight with Starlink access and extended it across its entire fleet without any added cost to customers. AirBaltic, too, has confirmed plans to equip its fleet with Starlink gear.\n\nSpaceX-owned Starlink has also inked deals with a handful of overseas carriers to offer fast, low-latency in-flight Wi-Fi services. The Musk-backed company had initially aimed to deliver speeds of up to 350Mbps on planes armed with its Aero Terminal kit.\n\nAt the moment, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink for Aviation arm promises downlink and uplink speeds of up to 220Mbps and 25Mbps, respectively, per terminal. That kind of bandwidth is not only good for basic communication, but also for calling, video watching, and online gaming.\n\nIn addition to commercial airlines, Starlink is eying deals with private charter services as well as the government for special missions. Starlink, in partnership with T-Mobile, will also start testing its direct-to-cell service for phone satellite connectivity in the coming months.",

Laczynski, called up from Henderson, Nev., of the AHL to fill the lineup spot of ex-Sabre Victor Olofsson (illness), buried a rebound of a Brett Howden shot inside the left post for his third career goal and first with the Golden Knights. It was Laczynski's first goal since Dec. 5, 2022, against Colorado as a member of the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nStone made it 2-0 midway through the period on a delayed penalty when he tipped in Eichel's cross-ice pass into a wide-open right side of the net for his 600th career point.\n\nVegas clamped down defensively after that, holding Buffalo to just seven shots over the first 35:52 while finishing with a 26-10 advantage in shots on goal after two periods.\n\nEichel extended the lead to 3-0 at the 7:44 mark of the third period when he fired a wrist shot from the left face-off dot past Reimer's glove side for his fifth goal in four career games against his former team.\n\nThe Sabres pulled Reimer and cut the lead to 3-1 with 2:18 to go with a 6-on-4 power-play goal by Zucker, who deflected a point shot by Rasmus Dahlin past Hill.\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

            "content": "Choosing the right cell phone plan can make a world of a difference when traveling.\n\nI learned this lesson the hard way during college, when I was still on a Verizon family plan and got charged $10 per day for international data. The bills piled up quickly, and I knew I needed to find a better solution for future trips abroad.\n\nIn 2021, I made the switch to T-Mobile and haven\u2019t looked back since. Not only are T-Mobile\u2019s unlimited plans more affordable than Verizon\u2019s, they also come with several travel-friendly perks that are hard to beat. Here\u2019s a closer look at those benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverview of T-Mobile Plans\n\nOf all T-Mobile\u2019s plans, frequent travelers should pay close attention to Go5G Plus or Go5G Next in particular. These plans include unlimited data in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, unlimited Wi-Fi on major domestic airlines, and up to 5GB of high-speed data in over 200 countries (with speeds reduced to 256 Kbps afterward).\n\nPricing starts at $95 per month for Go5G Plus and $105 per month for Go5G Next, with discounts available for multiple lines. Additionally, you can save $5 per line by enrolling in auto pay, though payment must be made via debit card or bank account \u2014 not a credit card.\n\nI personally don\u2019t enroll in auto pay and instead use The Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express, which I find to be one of the best cards for paying cell phone bills thanks to its long list of benefits. By enrolling, I can receive up to $10 in monthly statement credits when I use my card to pay for wireless phone services from a U.S. carrier, including T-Mobile. Additionally, I benefit from complimentary cell phone protection against damage and theft, which makes skipping the auto pay discount worth it to me.\n\nELEVATED OFFER Terms Apply / Rates & Fees The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express U.P.

This ongoing promotion pays you up to $800 on your eligible phone on the remaining device payment balance by switching from carriers like AT&T, Verizon, Xfinity, and more.\n\n1. Free Wi-Fi When Flying\n\nT-Mobile provides complimentary inflight Wi-Fi, texting, and streaming on Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines for Go5G customers. These inflight Wi-Fi partnerships give T-Mobile a significant edge over other wireless carriers.\n\nWith the Go5G Next and Go5G Plus plans, customers enjoy unlimited Wi-Fi and texting for the entire flight, while the standard Go5G plan includes up to 4 full inflight Wi-Fi sessions per year and 1 hour of free Wi-Fi on all other flights thereafter. For frequent travelers, upgrading to Go5G Next or Go5G Plus is worthwhile for this benefit alone.\n\nYour number will be verified upon connecting to Wi-Fi. Image Credit: T-Mobile\n\nThis complimentary Wi-Fi perk is available on 100% of domestic flights with these airlines with Intelsat, Viasat, Thales, and Panasonic systems, according to T-Mobile. To access it, simply switch your phone to airplane mode and connect to the airline\u2019s Wi-Fi. You\u2019ll be redirected to a portal where you can log in using your T-Mobile phone number, and you\u2019ll receive a verification code to complete the connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Unlimited International Data\n\nI travel internationally several times a year, though most trips typically last about a week or less. However, in 2023, I spent nearly 3 weeks in Japan and South Korea, and I was grateful to have a T-Mobile plan by then, which made staying connected much simpler.\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible to buy a new SIM card for international data, I found it much more convenient to stick with my T-Mobile plan. The Go5G Plus and Next Plans provide up to 5GB of 5G data and unlimited texting in over 200 countries per billing cycle. During my 3-week trip, I came close to hitting the 5GB limit but didn\u2019t feel the need to strictly conserve the data I was using on my phone day by day.\n\nEven if you exceed the 5GB limit, you still have unlimited data, though speeds slow to 256 Kbps. For longer trips, I always recommend using Wi-Fi when available. T-Mobile also offers reasonably priced additional data options:\n\n24-hour pass (512MB): $5\n\n$5 10-day pass (5GB): $35\n\n$35 30-day pass (15GB): $50\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that international calls cost 25 cents per minute (except in Canada or Mexico, where it\u2019s actually free!) so I generally avoid making phone calls while traveling. However, if unlimited international calling is important to you, you can add it to your T-Mobile plan for an additional $15 per month.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I had been a Verizon customer for over a decade, and their international data rates are significantly higher. Verizon\u2019s TravelPass costs $5 per day in Canada and Mexico and $10 per day elsewhere. Although it offers unlimited data, calls, and texts, only the first 2GB each day is at high speeds; after that, you\u2019re limited to 3G speeds.\n\nIn essence, you can save a lot of money and avoid the hassle with T-Mobile\u2019s plans, eliminating the worry of paying $10 per day for data. It may not be the best option if you\u2019re a nomad or a long-term traveler, but T-Mobile is perfect for my 3 or 4 international escapades every year.\n\n3. Other T-Mobile Benefits You Didn\u2019t Realize You Have\n\nWhile inflight Wi-Fi and international data are the main reasons I stay loyal to T-Mobile, the phone carrier offers several travel perks that you may not even realize you have.\n\nEvery Tuesday, the company\u2019s T-Mobile Tuesdays offer rotating perks and deals. Some weeks are better than others, but I\u2019ve taken advantage of $2 movie tickets, free Shake Shack burgers, $25 off Zappos orders (with no minimums), and more.\n\nT-Mobile customers can also enroll in a complimentary AAA membership for 1 year, which saves you $65. This can be especially useful for road trips and driving in general, as it provides access to 24/7 roadside assistance in the U.S.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nT-Mobile has made it much easier for my family and me to stay connected while traveling, and at an affordable rate. I\u2019ve found that the data speeds abroad are reliable, and the free inflight Wi-Fi on my phone saves me at least a few dollars every time I fly.\n\nFor the cell phone protection benefit of The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, coverage for a stolen or damaged eligible cellular wireless telephone is subject to the terms, conditions, exclusions and limits of liability of this benefit. The maximum liability is $800, per claim, per eligible card account. Each claim is subject to a $50 deductible. Coverage is limited to two (2) claims per eligible card account per 12 month period. Eligibility and benefit level varies by Card. Terms, conditions and limitations apply. Please visit americanexpress.com/benefitsguide for more details.

            "content": "Storylines\n\n1. Power-play progress\n\nThe Sabres have now converted on four of their last six power plays since Sunday and six of their last 13 (46.2%) since Dec. 21. For context, they\u2019d converted at 5.4 percent (2-for-37) in 14 games leading up to that Boston loss.\n\nJason Zucker, tied for the NHL lead with four power-play goals since that date, appears to have found a home as the first unit\u2019s net-front presence. The rest of that top group includes Tage Thompson in the bumper, Jack Quinn and JJ Peterka on the flanks and Rasmus Dahlin at the point.\n\nThursday at Colorado, both Quinn and Thompson fed Zucker for net-front power-play goals.\n\n\u201cThe guys made great plays for me,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay around the net. I try to be around there as much as I can and try to draw a defenseman to me, make them make decisions. I thought Tommer made two, Quinny made one that were just unbelievable passes.\u201d\n\nRead Friday's practice report for more on Zucker's net-front scoring, an area where he ranks among the NHL's best.\n\nQuinn, too, has become a key cog in the top unit after watching several December games from the press box. He\u2019s tallied four power-play assists \u2013 along with two goals and one helper at even strength \u2013 in the last five games.\n\n\u201cI thought last night the power play was fantastic,\u201d Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said at Friday\u2019s practice. \u201cThey made some great plays, they had some great recoveries, they solved the pressure. I think if we can continue with that look, it can be a dangerous weapon for us.\u201d\n\nMovement within the offensive zone is essential to any power play, as the Sabres have learned through tough stretches this season. A less stationary approach has served them well the last couple weeks.\n\n\u201cI think motion causes confusion,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of guys that have a lot of skill out there that can fill different spots. It\u2019s been working recently for us, so we\u2019ve got to keep doing that.\u201d\n\nBuffalo\u2019s man advantage will be tested by the Golden Knights, who\u2019ve killed off 12 of 13 shorthanded situations in their last five games.\n\n2. Thompson on the wing\n\nRuff made a number of changes to his lines prior to Thursday\u2019s game, none more notable than on the first line. Dylan Cozens elevated to No. 1 center while Thompson shifted to right wing. Alex Tuch, meanwhile, skated with Jiri Kulich and Jack Quinn on the second line.\n\n\u201cWe got [Thompson] on the wing and the thinking was maybe to try to free him up to skate a little bit more, where he\u2019s not working down low,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cI really thought that line skated well.\u201d\n\nFreed from some of the center position\u2019s 200-foot obligations, Thompson tied a career high with three assists. He also logged his most time on ice (19:43) and shots on goal (4) since Dec. 11 against the Rangers.\n\n\u201cAlways trying to find ways to get shots off,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cLast night was one of those nights where I felt like I was getting some good looks and some time and space with the puck.\u201d\n\n3. Scouting the Golden Knights\n\nVegas has gone 11-2-0 since the beginning of December, allowing 1.92 goals per game during that span (best in NHL) while scoring 3.46 (5th in NHL).\n\nJack Eichel leads the team and is tied for eighth in the NHL with 50 points (10+40). Forward Mark Stone, who missed a month a lower-body injury, ranks second on Vegas with 32 points (9+23) in just 24 games. Shea Theodore\u2019s 31 points (4+27) place him fifth among NHL defensemen.\n\nForward Victor Olofsson will face the Sabres for the first time after playing his first six seasons in Buffalo. The 2014 seventh-round pick has eight goals and five assists in 18 games with Vegas, and he's been a mainstay in the lineup since returning Nov. 30 from a lower-body injury.\n\nAdin Hill figures to start in net Saturday after sitting Thursday versus Philadelphia. The 6-foot-6 netminder has gone 16-6-2 with a .902 save percentage and 2.65 goals-against average, and in his first year as a starting goalie, he\u2019s on pace to blow past last season\u2019s career-high 35 games played.\n\nThe Sabres have beaten Vegas three straight times and in four of their last five matchups dating back to March of 2022. Last season, Buffalo outscored the Golden Knights 12-4 between the two wins.",

The transaction took place on December 9th. Such \"insider\" stock purchases are often seen as a bullish signal since board members typically know much more about how a company's business is really performing than the typical Wall Street analyst or investor. Almeida's own money is at risk which also raises the importance of the purchase.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a few days after Almeida's purchase, T-Mobile announced that it would spend up to $14 billion through the end of this year to buy back its own shares. This is done to raise the value of existing stockholders' shares since the practice reduces the number of shares outstanding. We should note that following the buy/sell decisions made by company insiders is not a short-term system for investors.

            "content": "You know the drill. It's time to shop for home internet but you only have one or two options and you're not sure how to decide which one is better. You've heard the woes from friends who signed up with Spectrum and were surprised by two price increases within the same year -- and as Spectrum is one of the biggest internet providers in the country, there's a good chance that Spectrum is one of the two options available at your address. So what can you do?\n\nFirst, let's do a little research\n\nIf you type your address into the Federal Communication Commission's broadband map, you can pull up all of the internet providers that will service your address. If you live in an urban area, you may have as many as seven options, each an alternative to Spectrum if that's a provider you're trying to avoid. But let's say you're trying to stick to a high-speed internet option. Maybe you have a smart TV you use for streaming in crisp 4K, a roommate who games religiously in their room or you're a student who uses Zoom pretty regularly. Whatever the reason, a good rule of thumb is to aim for speeds of 300 megabits per second or higher for average internet use with multiple devices in the home.\n\nYou can use the FCC broadband map to find a list of internet providers that service your address. FCC\n\nThe FCC defines \"broadband\" as an internet connection with speeds of 100Mbps down and 20Mbps up. Using that definition, go back to the FCC broadband map and rule out each provider with advertised speeds of 100Mbps or less. Why? Even though an ISP advertises that speed, you probably won't get it consistently because of how your router and Wi-Fi work.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nAccording to the FCC, there are only seven internet providers available at my address. If I eliminate ISPs with speeds of 300Mbps or lower, there are only two. FCC\n\nFor most people, at this stage in internet shopping, there are only one to three decent options left and if one of them isn't Spectrum, it's most likely AT&T, Cox, T-Mobile Home Internet or Xfinity.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t personally have anything against Spectrum (and CNET ranks it as one of the better cable ISPs out there), some people do. The leading cause of those frustrations is usually outages or price increases. It\u2019s frustrating not only because your bill increases while your speeds remain the same but also because not having another internet option means you can\u2019t switch.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nAt this point, your head is probably spinning. Why is shopping for internet providers such a headache? Will those other internet options be any good? Why can\u2019t you get more than one decent option at your address?\n\n\u201cAccording to the New America Foundation, Americans pay the most for broadband [among 38 democratic nations].\u201d Christopher Ali, professor of telecommunications at Penn State University\n\nInternet monopolies are far too common in the broadband industry\n\nOver a third of Americans only have access to one or no internet provider. According to data from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, approximately 83 million Americans have internet access through just one provider.\n\nOverall, the American broadband industry is dominated by a handful of ISPs with broad footprints: only six ISPs cover 98% of the mobile internet market. Of these, Xfinity ranks as the country's largest cable internet provider, with Spectrum close behind.\n\nVarious factors, including geographically diverse terrain, high infrastructure costs and the daunting task of competing with prices from a much bigger ISP, can make it costly for smaller businesses to get a foot in the door without significant funding.\n\n\"Because of the way that we classify broadband service providers, the FCC has very little authority over prices, which means that [ISPs] can pretty much do whatever they want,\" Christopher Ali, a telecommunications professor at Penn State, told CNET.\n\nWhat does that mean for you? Because you likely have only one or two options for internet at your address, your internet provider can keep inflating your monthly bill and you can\u2019t really do anything about it.\n\nJust 10 years ago, our definition of broadband vastly differed from the FCC's definition today (it was previously a mere 4Mbps down and 1Mbps up). Our conversations about home internet needing to be more accessible, affordable and sustainably fast for average household needs are a relatively recent development.\n\n\"The amount of money the average American is spending [on internet] relative to their income is about the same [compared to 10 years ago],\" said Blair Levin, a policy analyst from New Street Research and former executive director at the FCC. \"In that sense, we have a much faster, better product at about the same price point. Sure, you could say that's good. Does that mean it's affordable? Not for a lot of Americans it is not affordable and affordability is a key problem.\"\n\nAlthough there are thousands of local internet providers, our options often boil down to one or two of the country's ISP giants. Admittedly, CNET often reviews those top providers and may recommend them as viable internet options because those ISP giants aren't necessarily always bad home internet options. They typically offer an efficient cost per Mbps compared with plans from local ISPs, often DSL or fixed wireless options with slower speeds targeted to rural homes.\n\nIn rural areas that may not have a big or local ISP presence, internet options are even more limited, and people usually have to fall back on the slow speeds and high costs of satellite internet. Although satellite internet offers extensive availability and has proven an invaluable internet option in rural areas, it tends to average less than 100Mbps in download speeds, not quite fast enough for average to above-average internet use.\n\nAccording to data from the FCC, Xfinity (red) and Spectrum (purple) are the two largest cable internet providers in the country. FCC\n\nAlthough competition among ISPs is often limited, there are pockets of regions where competition -- and fast, cost-efficient internet options -- thrive. Wireless internet providers, specifically, have a strong presence in rural areas, which are harder to reach with wired internet services.\n\n\"There are about 1,500 wireless internet service providers in America, largely in rural, under-resourced and Tribal parts of the country,\" Mike Wendy, the communications director of WISPA, the Association for Broadband Without Boundaries, told me over email. \"They serve about ten million Americans through primarily fixed wireless access.\"\n\nIn other cases, municipal broadband networks (such as the community-owned fiber networks in Wilson, North Carolina, or Chattanooga, Tennessee) and public middle-mile networks offer much faster speeds for lower prices than a private-owned ISP.\n\nStill, those success stories aren't ubiquitous, effectively creating what Ali calls a \"Swiss cheese pattern of broadband availability\" throughout the country. All too often, people face high price increases, limited high-speed options and inconsistent connectivity with home internet. Even in urban areas, which typically have higher concentrations of internet serviceability, some low-income neighborhoods may see much slower speeds and fewer options at their address than a higher-income neighborhood across town.\n\nA study from the Markup and the Associated Press in 2022 zeroed in on the trend of inequitable internet access across neighborhoods with marginalized or low-income communities, raising questions about \"digital redlining\" by ISPs.\n\nWhy the difference in the US?\n\nYou may find it surprising that the high cost of the internet in the US isn\u2019t necessarily replicated in other countries. According to a study by the New America Foundation, US consumers pay the highest average costs for broadband compared across all studied regions.\n\nThe average cost of internet service in the UK sits at around \u00a327 ($34) a month, while the US averages $63 in monthly internet costs -- not including hidden fees, equipment costs and those yearly price hikes.\n\nSome researchers point to the concentration of US markets compared to the UK, noting that the concentrated telecommunication industry warrants high internet costs and low capital expenditures from both a consumer and investor perspective. Others point to the tendency of US policy to favor larger ISPs, limiting competition and driving up prices.\n\n\u201cAccording to the New America Foundation, Americans pay the most for broadband in any country in the OECD,\" Ali told CNET. \"We\u2019re averaging somewhere between $74 and $84 a month -- and there is no technological reason why costs are this high. Zero. It is entirely price-gouging.\u201d\n\nThe size of internet companies such as AT&T, Google, Verizon and T-Mobile is staggering when you consider not only how sizable their footprints are but also how much of the infrastructure (from undersea cables to vast middle-mile fiber networks) they own. Although there are countless other local providers, many have to pay network fees to larger providers to use parts of the \"middle mile\" for internet services.\n\nPlus, it's often easier for those bigger companies to buy out another company and merge their networks than to build out a new network. For example, Verizon bought Frontier Fiber early this year in an attempt to expand its Verizon Fios fiber internet brand. Brightspeed edged into the playing field by buying parts of CenturyLink\u2019s DSL network in 2022 and Charter (Spectrum) bought Time Warner Cable in 2016.\n\nFixed wireless internet services might make a difference\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve mostly discussed wired internet services, which are tricky networks to establish because of zoning, equipment and labor costs. What about other internet connection types, such as satellite or 5G home internet? Although a fixed wireless internet service is generally touted as a solution to broadband accessibility because it\u2019s easier to establish than a wired network, only a handful of big companies dominate the fixed wireless internet market, namely, Starlink, T-Mobile and Verizon.\n\nStarlink, which edged into the satellite internet market in 2020, established itself as a top name in satellite internet by deploying roughly 7,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites and offering speeds up to 220Mbps and relatively low latency (the time it takes for data to get to the server and back). In contrast, competitors Hughesnet and Viasat fall behind with speeds that top out at 100 and 150Mbps, respectively.\n\nT-Mobile presents a popular alternative to rural internet with its network of high-powered cell sites and licensed 5G frequencies. To date, T-Mobile has the largest footprint of any single US internet provider, thanks to the reach of those frequencies.\n\nThe catch? Starlink costs roughly $120 a month, not including the hefty up-front cost of satellite equipment, which runs $349 for the basic package. By comparison, T-Mobile offers a much more competitive price. For $50 monthly, you can get speeds around 87 to 318Mbps. There\u2019s no equipment rental charge, just the $35 activation fee you pay when you start service.\n\nBut although Starlink and T-Mobile are popular choices for people with limited internet access, neither provider can offer a consistent speed of 300Mbps over a fixed wireless internet connection, which is why, although neither provider enforces a data cap, your speeds likely will be throttled during peak congestion periods. You won\u2019t see the quick, consistent gigabit speeds that you\u2019d get from a cable or fiber internet provider (or at least, not yet). Additionally, more than 1 million people are on a waitlist for T-Mobile services, delayed because of network capacity.\n\nThe internet services offered by Starlink and T-Mobile are an attractive alternative to solving internet accessibility in underserved or hard-to-reach areas, but the quality of those internet connections and the affordability of monthly prices, equipment and additional fees, are an imperative consideration.\n\nWhat does this all mean for you and me?\n\nSo, what\u2019s being done to ease internet connectivity and affordability? How can we ensure that people have more than one or two options for internet service and that the costs of that internet stay low?\n\nNo one really has the answers yet. Since the ILSR published its findings on telecom and cable internet monopolies, Congress portioned $90 billion toward bridging the digital divide. That money was split among various groups, including the Tribal Connectivity Program, but most of it has been funneled into the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program (BEAD) -- the largest investment that the federal government has made in internet accessibility.\n\nThe Affordable Connectivity Program, which offered more than 23 million low-income Americans a monthly discount from $30 to $75 monthly, was perhaps the most significant attempt at ensuring accessible, high-speed internet nationwide. After the ACP ended in May 2024, policymakers disagreed over how to ensure that ISPs offer low-cost plans to their customers.\n\nSo far, BEAD funding has become tangled with competing interests about how best to use it -- including disagreements with the organization tasked with administering BEAD funding, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.\n\nThe NTIA set guidelines for ensuring a low-cost plan with a baseline cost of $30 monthly, but many states have already planned a price increase for that baseline.\n\nDespite that, the plight of internet monopolies, high monthly internet costs and lack of adequate connectivity still hangs in the balance. In the meantime, the most you can do to trim down your monthly internet costs is to either reduce your monthly data consumption or look for a cheaper internet provider in your community.",

On the December 21st I did watch a lot of YouTube and Instagram videos along with an episode of Bones plus normal use of the phone including text, calls and checking emails, and after all day the Battery reached 75%, after I streamed music all night when I got up at 7:00am the battery was at 58% I plugged it in to charge, it took just shy of two hours to charge. I was using a cable I already had because it was longer than the one that came with the phone, so maybe I would have gotten a better result from it. The way I normally use this phone, it easily last me 3\u20134 days between charging. Being conservative with it, I reached day 5.\n\nThe Camp Light is bright 512 Lumens, and it is bright enough to brighten up an area, the Camp Light cannot be focused so using it in wide open areas is not as good as enclosed or close in locations. It does have 3 Brightness settings: Full, 1/2, and 1/4. It also has SOS and Super, which is like a fast strobe light.\n\nThe 20MP Night Vision Camera is fun to use, if you use it too long you will get a warning letting you know the IR LEDs are getting hot so you can shut it down, or it will shut the Night Vision off for you. When you click the more button, there is an option for Night Vision video also.\n\nThe Night Mode on the camera is great for taking pictures at night or low light areas.\n\nThe 48MP main camera is pretty good, It definitely suits my needs for a camera, it takes good clear pictures. When you select 48MP, there is no zoom, but after you take the picture you can enlarge the picture a lot.\n\nThe loudspeaker is plenty loud. On Amazon, it says it is 110db and on Fossibot\u2019s website it says it is 103db. I measured it with two different sound meter apps, and it hit a high of 90 in my test. The Fossibot website would appear to be more accurate than the Amazon site for the decibels of the speaker.\n\nWhen I received the Fossibot F106 Pro, I thought I would miss the 5G service, but the 4G meets all my needs. When I do something that would benefit more from 5G, I am usually at home and can use my WI/FI for that.\n\nThe Fossibot F106 Pro is truly a rugged phone, it is definitely designed to stand up to abuse. I really enjoy using it, just being free from cables and powerbanks and worrying if my battery is going to hold up if I am out longer than I expected to be is a whole new feeling that I have now, and it is amazing.\n\nAre there any drawbacks to the Fossibot F106 Pro, yes there are. For most people, dropping to 4G from 5G service will feel like a step backwards.

(Madeline Carter/Las Vegas Review-Journal)\n\nThe fist pumps are harder. The screams are a little louder.\n\nIt\u2019s that evident whenever Jack Eichel plays the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nHe cycled around the corner doing his patented celebration after beating goaltender James Reimer glove side at 7:44 of the third period, smile wide as his teammates hugged him.\n\nThe goal capped off a two-point night for Eichel, as he provided the highlight-reel offense for the Golden Knights in a 3-1 win against his former team Saturday at T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\u201cIt was good for us to get the win,\u201d Eichel said. \u201cI liked a lot of the way we played.\u201d\n\nThat was how Eichel ended the answer to the question of if he still gets excited to play against his former team.\n\nHe preceded that by saying that it\u2019s human nature to have some sort of emotion playing against a former team. There\u2019s still the rush of wanting to show what\u2019s now missed on the other side.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always an emotional aspect,\u201d Eichel said. \u201cI think any guy who\u2019s played somewhere and moved on to another situation, whenever you play against your former team, you always want to have a good game.\u201d\n\nEichel did that with his 18th multipoint game of the season to help the Knights (27-9-3) to their eighth win in nine games, improving to 16-3-1 since Nov. 21.\n\nIt\u2019s been a little over three years since the Knights made the franchise-altering trade with Buffalo to acquire Eichel. He has the Stanley Cup on his resume, as does the title of being the top scorer in that playoff run.\n\nHe\u2019s also shattering paces for the best season of his career. His two-point night gave him 52 on the season, tied for seventh in the league. Eichel\u2019s 41 assists rank third in the NHL.\n\nEichel is playing like a Hart Trophy candidate. He\u2019s the best player on the best team in the NHL as things stand.\n\nBuffalo (14-21-5) is on its third coach since Eichel played his final game in Western New York in March 2021. The Sabres had a 13-game winless streak (0-10-3) from Nov. 27 to Dec. 21. Saturday was their 16th loss in their past 19 games.\n\nThe trajectory of the two franchises will be evaluated for as long as Eichel is playing. The Knights, barring a historic collapse, are going to make the playoffs for the seventh time in their eight-year history.\n\nBuffalo is surely to miss the playoffs for a 14th consecutive year.\n\n\u201cHis leadership has grown here,\u201d coach Bruce Cassidy said. \u201cHis presence, when the game is close, he\u2019s much more vocal now and wants the ball, so to speak. That\u2019s the growth I\u2019ve seen in Jack. He just feels more comfortable. He projects confidence and assertiveness.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a natural evolution of winning a Stanley Cup, some guys leading where he now sees himself as that type of player. So, good for him.\u201d\n\nEichel now has seven points (five goals, two assists) in four games against the Sabres. The lone game he didn\u2019t register a point in was his first game back in Buffalo on March 10, 2022. That was his 11th game with the Knights after missing nearly a year with his neck injury.\n\nHe\u2019s playing winning hockey in a winning culture, while his former team is still trying to find an identity.\n\n\u201cI think we understand that you\u2019re not going to have your best every night, whether you\u2019re not going to have your best legs, the puck\u2019s not going to feel great,\u201d Eichel said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve found different ways to win and different guys have stepped up.\u201d\n\nHere are three takeaways from the win:\n\n1. Stone\u2019s milestone\n\nKnights captain Mark Stone scored a goal in the first period to record his 600th NHL point.\n\nMark Stone is so good at hockey. Comment if you agree \ud83d\ude01 pic.twitter.com/ebeJ9Azo1i \u2014 Vegas Golden Knights (@GoldenKnights) January 5, 2025\n\nStone reached the mark in his 665th game and his 299th with the Knights. He\u2019s 11 points from reaching 300 with the Knights after scoring 311 with the Ottawa Senators in the first seven seasons of his career.\n\nStone reached the milestone when Eichel threaded a pass through all five Sabres players and found Stone cutting to the net for his 10th goal of the season.\n\n2. Olofsson out\n\nLeft wing Victor Olofsson did not get to partake in the revenge game against his former team, as he was a late scratch due to an illness.\n\nOlofsson was a seventh-round pick of the Sabres in 2014 and played the first five seasons of his career in Buffalo before signing a one-year deal with the Knights in July.\n\nCassidy said the Knights had an idea in the afternoon that Olofsson wasn\u2019t going to go in. The Knights are off Sunday before returning to practice Monday, and Cassidy is hopeful that the day off will help.\n\n3. Laczynski in\n\nWith Olofsson out, center Tanner Laczynski made his presence felt.\n\nLaczynski scored his first goal in nearly three years at 4:53 of the first period on a rebound in front of the net. His last goal came on Dec. 5, 2022, with the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n\u201cHonestly, any time you score a goal it\u2019s special,\u201d Laczynski said. \u201cTo do it here in this building makes it that much better.\u201d\n\nContact Danny Webster at dwebster@reviewjournal.com.

            "content": "LAS VEGAS (KTNV) \u2014 On the morning of her 99th birthday, Vegas Golden Knights super fan Dora Walker was surprised with a pre-game Zamboni ride on the team\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve matinee game.\n\n\u201cI almost fainted! I almost had a heart attack,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhen they told me what I was doing I said \u2018oh no! This is a dream.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs the nearly one-hundred-year-old fan\u2014 affectionately called Grandma Dora\u2014 rolled up to the Zamboni tunnel at T-Mobile Arena with her grandson, she was still in shock that she would have the opportunity to be on the same ice as her beloved Golden Knights.\n\nIt was something that I never dreamed I would do. Never came to my mind.\n\nShe admits that she wasn\u2019t always a hockey fan due to the aggressive nature of the sport and fighting; however, once she got to know the team from watching countless games, she was hooked.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re an inspiration,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re so energetic, they are family guys, they are handsome. You just can\u2019t expect more! I wish I could find a guy \u2013 when I was younger \u2013 that was like the Golden Knights.\u201d\n\nWhile Grandma Dora knows she isn\u2019t getting any younger, she says that the Golden Knights keep her alive\u2014 making her feel young and energetic again, which is why she can\u2019t miss a game.\n\nI have to watch them constantly. It\u2019s my vitamins to watch them. I don\u2019t watch other things. They are so inspiring. They give me energy. It\u2019s hard to live longer and I enjoy every minute. I could live in the stadium watching them all the time. For me, it\u2019s everything.\n\n. . .\n\nDecked out in VGK earrings, a faux fur jacket and a \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 tiara, Grandma Dora was ready for her close-up\u2014 spending extra time practicing her royal wave before her big moment: \u201cThis will give me another 50 years of life!\u201d\n\nWhen it was time to board the Zamboni, Grandma Dora ditched her wheelchair and fearlessly climbed aboard. She said being up on her perch felt like she was going to heaven.\n\n\n\nWATCH: \u2018Grandma Dora\u2019s\u2019 Zamboni ride\n\n\u2018Grandma Dora\u2019s\u2019 Zamboni ride\n\nIn front of an NHL crowd, Grandma Dora had no stage fright. She spent her ride smiling ear-to-ear, waving to the crowd and talking to thousands of fellow Golden Knights fans like they were her best friends.\n\nWhen her ride ended, she pledged that it would be on foot the next time she took the ice at T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not dying without learning to skate!\u201d she said.\n\nThe Golden Knights couldn't deliver a win for Grandma Dora's birthday,snapping their 6-game winning streak with a 3-2 loss to the Montreal Canadiens, but she says their impact on her life is more than enough.\n\n\"They really made it special \u2013 all of them,\" she said. \"Because they are unique. I have never seen in all my life anyone more energetic and human.\"",

            "content": "What is the best internet provider in Houston?\n\nAT&T Fiber is the best internet service provider in Houston, thanks to its symmetrical download and upload speeds and high customer satisfaction scores. Plans start at $55 and go up to $245 for the 5-gig plan. However, AT&T Fiber doesn't cover all Houston addresses, so Xfinity and Verizon 5G Home Internet are also quality options to consider if you're outside of AT&T's service area.\n\nIf you want the cheapest internet plans in Houston, there are some solid options, too. The cheapest ISP in Houston is Astound Broadband, offering a $20-a-month plan. Astound's service comes with a 300-megabit-per-second connection.\n\nAT&T Fiber, Frontier Fiber and local internet provider Tachus Fiber offer the fastest internet speed in Houston. Each provider boasts 5 gigabits of symmetrical speed, costing $245, $130 and $180, respectively.\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nOther available internet providers in Houston\n\nBeyond the three picks above, several other broadband choices exist in the Houston metro area. Some can be found only in small pockets of the city, while others are mainly located in the city suburbs. There are some compelling choices here, even though they're not as widely available.\n\nAstound Broadband: This cable internet provider, known regionally as Grande, offers some of Houston's most competitive starting rates. Its starting price of $20 a month for a 300Mbps plan comes out to an affordable 6 cents per Mbps. The rub is that Astound's price increases are some of the steepest in the industry.\n\nBrightspeed: You'll want to research this because, depending on your location, you may be dealing with mostly DSL coverage for the Houston area (which can be as low as 20Mbps), or if you're in the Kingwood area, you might see the company's much more compelling fiber product.\n\nFrontier Communications: Frontier has a scattered presence in the greater Houston area. You won't find it downtown, but you can get its DSL and fiber-optic service in the northeast outskirts of Baytown, Beach City, Cove and Crosby. You'll also find it in the southern portion of the metro area in League City and Sante Fe. If Frontier Fiber is available -- it features symmetrical plans of 200Mbps, 500Mbps, 1Gbps, 2Gbps, 5Gbps or 7Gbps speeds ranging from $30 to $300 per month for the first year -- it's a very appealing choice. If Frontier DSL is your only option, try other alternatives.\n\nKinetic by Windstream: This DSL and fiber provider is available in just a few small pockets within the Houston city limits. Most of that availability is in the southern suburb of Sugar Land. You'll mostly deal with its DSL service rather than the faster fiber-optic plans.\n\nOptimum: First off, I can imagine you might be confused. Suddenlink is the provider you're probably familiar with in the Houston area. Its parent company, Altice USA, renamed it Optimum in 2022. In any case, Optimum service is scattered lightly throughout the metro area but has a heavier density north of the city in Conroe and Kingwood. This cable ISP is notable for its highly competitive starting rates, some of the most affordable in the area.\n\nSpectrum: Charter Communications' ISP has some of the more customer-friendly, straightforward terms you'll find for cable internet service. There are no contracts, no data caps and a free modem rental included in your monthly price, ranging from $50 to $70. It also includes free access to Wi-Fi hotspots across the country. Spectrum service is limited in the city center of Houston. You can find coverage north of the city, mainly in Magnolia, Spring, Tomball and The Woodlands.\n\nTachus: This local ISP, founded in 2018, is notable for its community presence and commitment to building 100% fiber-to-the-home networks within the greater Houston metropolitan area. It's now available to over 50,000 homes in Atascocita, Conroe, East Montgomery County, Kingwood, Magnolia, Oak Ridge County North and The Woodlands. There are five fiber plans, depending on what is available at your location, -- 300Mbps, 600Mbps, 1Gbps, 2.5Gbps and 5Gbps -- ranging from $65 to $180 a month, with no data caps and no contracts. A modem rental is included in the monthly price, but you'll need to provide your own router or rent one for as low as $6 per month.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet: T-Mobile uses its 5G and 4G LTE networks to power its fixed wireless home internet product, which is available to over 50 million homes nationwide and approximately 55% of residents in the greater Houston area. Check your address on the T-Mobile site\n\nGetty Images\n\nCheap internet options in Houston\n\nThe average starting price for internet service in Houston is just over $46 a month, but a few providers offer plans cheaper than that.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nAstound Broadband offers the lowest starting price in Houston. Astound Broadband's $20 plan grants download speeds up to 300Mbps and includes your equipment rental. Xfinity also offers a $20-a-month plan that gets you 150Mbps speeds.\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet plan in Houston?\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nHow to find internet deals and promotions in Houston\n\nThe best internet deals and top promotions in Houston depend on what discounts are available during a given time. Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers.\n\nHouston internet providers, such as Xfinity, Astound Broadband, Spectrum and Optimum, may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Many, including AT&T, Frontier and Verizon, run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nHow fast is Houston broadband?\n\nHouston, we have a problem. Although it's one of the top five most populated metros in the US, H-Town couldn't crack the top 50 on Ookla's list of the country's fastest cities for broadband. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nPer the speed-testing site's most recent reporting, Houston managed to clock in at only No. 58. By contrast, its fellow Lone Star State cities of Austin, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Fort Worth and San Antonio all placed in the top 15. Other Texas towns that placed higher on the speed chart -- adding insult to injury -- include Arlington, Garland, Irving, Lubbock, Laredo and Plano. Some small consolation: Houston finished well ahead of Dallas, which was in the bottom 3.\n\nSome Houstonians may have access to the splashy 5Gbps plans from AT&T and Frontier which cost $245 and $130 per month, respectively, and even the 7Gbps plan from Frontier for $300 per month.\n\nFastest internet plans in Houston\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nInternet providers in popular cities near Houston\n\nSee all results for internet providers in Texas.\n\nWhat\u2019s a good internet speed?\n\nMost internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Houston\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nWhat's the final word on Houston internet providers?\n\nHouston offers several high-speed internet choices. You can get hooked up with home internet from fast fiber options, including AT&T, Frontier and local internet service provider Tachus. You could hop online via cable connections from Optimum and Spectrum. You could join the 5G home internet movement by trying Verizon 5G Home Internet or T-Mobile Home Internet.\n\nComcast's cable internet offering of Xfinity has Houston covered with the most extensive availability across the metro area. As we say in our CNET home internet reviews, a fiber internet connection outperforms cable almost every time. If you can access a fiber provider in the area -- including AT&T Fiber, Consolidated Communications, Frontier Fiber or Tachus -- don't hesitate to sign on the virtual dotted line.\n\nBest internet providers in Houston FAQs\n\nWhich internet service provider has the most coverage in Houston? More than a dozen different ISPs are in the greater Houston metro, including satellite internet providers like Hughesnet, Starlink and Viasat (all three are available to 100% of the area, according to the FCC). Besides those satellite providers, Xfinity covers the most extensive area. You can find Comcast's cable service as far as Conroe to the north, East Bernard to the west, Baytown to the east, and Freeport and Galveston to the south. Show more\n\nIs fiber internet available in Houston? Yes. You can find fiber internet throughout H-Town. Houston's top fiber internet providers include AT&T Fiber, Frontier Fiber and Tachus Fiber. It should also be noted that a small percentage of Xfinity locations are also eligible for fiber service, but it first requires a site survey to ascertain if the address is serviceable. Show more",

That means, the Unlimited plan, normally $20 per month, or $60 for three months, is now just $15 per month or $45 for three months. The base 5GB of data per month plan is $10 per month, and the 15GB per month plan is $15 per month, or $45 for three months. These are incredible deals. All Mint Mobile plans include unlimited talk and text, access to 5GB high-speed data, free calling to Mexico and Canada, free mobile hotspot access, and WiFi calling support. You can\u2019t beat that!\n\nU.S. Mobile: Pre-pay $23 per line per month\n\nPrepaid wireless plans are a great option for light users, kids, and anyone else who won\u2019t be consuming a lot of data on a daily basis. U.S. Mobile is one of the best prepaid service providers available today, allowing you to build your own custom plan, so you\u2019re only paying for as many minutes, texts, and gigabytes of data as you want to. As just one example, its Unlimited Starter plan is just $23 per line, or $276 for 12 months \u2014 saving you $72 per year. You get unlimited talk, text, and data, 10GB of hotspot data, international calling and texting, and more. If you\u2019re adding multiple lines to a plan, you can also unlock free extras like Disney+ and Netflix. U.S. Mobile even has an Unlimited Flex plan that goes for just $15 per month when you pre-pay for 12 months.\n\nAT&T: Unlimited Premium (4 lines) \u2014 $51 per month per line\n\nAT&T is another contender for the best unlimited phone plan deal going right now. Its Unlimited Premium plan rings in at $51 per month, per line, with four lines and includes unlimited talk, text, and data in the U.S. as well as Mexico and Canada. You also get 60GB of high-speed mobile hotspot bandwidth per month (which reverts to 128Kbps speeds after this is used up), HD streaming, 5G access. If you don\u2019t need all the extras, the Unlimited Starter plan gives you the same unlimited calls, texts, and data and 5G for a cheaper $36 per month, per line, for four lines.\n\nVerizon: Welcome Unlimited with a perk of your choice \u2014 $65 per month\n\nFinishing off the \u201cbig four\u201d list of U.S. carriers, Verizon\u2019s Welcome Unlimited plan runs about $65 per month for a single line or $120 per month for four lines as part of Verizon new customer deals. You get unlimited talk, text, and data, but not 5G. But the best part is that you can add perks at a $10 per month rate like the Disney Bundle \u2014 normally $15 per month on its own \u2014 or Apple One, Walmart Plus, and others.\n\nT-Mobile: Go5G Next (3 lines) \u2014 $180 per month, was $230\n\nT-Mobile is offering one of the best cell phone plan deals right now, with its Go5G unlimited bundles \u2014 part of T-Mobile\u2019s 5G plans.

You can also upgrade your device every year. As a result of T-Mobile\u2019s merger with Sprint, Sprint customers are now T-Mobile customers.\n\nMore cell phone plan deals we love",

Even they would be hard-pressed to offer you a deal as good this one from Samsung which could get you as much as 65% off of a brand-new Galaxy S24+.\n\nBeauty, and a Beast\n\nThe Galaxy S24+ is, to put it mildly, a truly gorgeous phone. The 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display really pops, with resolution of 1440 x 3120 pixels and support for HDR10+ for the deepest blacks and the whitest whites. It can be pumped up to as much as 2600 nits of brightness, and the 120Hz refresh rate is the final touch to make the Galaxy S24+ a true marvel when you\u2019re streaming, gaming, or browsing.\n\nBehind that beautiful screen sits Samsung\u2019s ultra-powerful 10-core Exynos 2400 chipset and Xclipse 940 graphics-processing unit to ensure that you can multitask, run numerous apps simultaneously, or take video calls, all without lag or choppy performance. If it\u2019s superior video performance you\u2019re looking for, the Galaxy S24+ shoots 8K video at a crisp 30 frames per second.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24+ also has a 3-camera setup that rivals any competitor, with a 50 megapixel main lens, a 10 MP telephoto lens that can achieve 3x optical zoom, and a 12 MP ultra-wide lens for optimal landscape imaging.\n\nUnleash the AI\n\nGalaxy AI features are all over the Galaxy S24+, including the amazing Circle to Search which lets you use your finger or a Samsung S Pen to circle text or an object of interest on your screen and instantly have Google search for it. Live Translation, Chat Assist, and Photo Assist also make the Galaxy S24+ one of the best AI-deploying mobile devices anywhere.\n\nSamsung boosted the battery of the Galaxy S24+ to accommodate all of these amazing features, giving it up to 25 hours of Wi-Fi internet time, 29 hours of video playback time, or a crazy 88 hours of audio playback time on a single charge.\n\nWhen a huge trade-in offer like this pops up from Samsung, suddenly you look at your current devices in a whole new light: \u201cHow much can I get for this so I can upgrade to a Galaxy S24+ phone?\u201d Head to Samsung now and see how close you can get to the $650 max credit.\n\nSee at Samsung",

In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. T-Mobile US Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $8.77 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.54%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 51.65 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 21.97 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 139.52\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $97.13. This valuation indicates that the T-Mobile US Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -127.25%.

            "content": "Comcast Xfinity moved up from 16th place to 5th in CableTV.com\u2019s 2025 Internet Customer Satisfaction Awards. It now joins with Starlink, Google Fiber, T-Mobile, and Verizon as the top five national internet providers with the most satisfied customers.\n\nMost companies in this group are 5G and fiber internet providers, while Xfinity is the only exception as a cable internet provider.\n\nCableTV.com attributes the increase in Xfinity\u2019s score not to prices \u2014 which were mostly unchanged \u2014 but to internet performance and value. The company introduced higher speeds to its budget and mid-tier plans. It also launched a bundle called StreamSaver.\n\nThe survey of nearly 9,000 internet users in the U.S., also found that younger internet users are much more likely to choose a bundled internet/cell phone plan than older users (67% of Gen Z internet subscribers compared with 48% of Millennials and 36% each of Gen X and Baby Boomers).\n\nTo compose the customer satisfaction award rankings, the survey asked respondents questions such as: What is your overall satisfaction with your internet service provider? How satisfied are you with your ISP\u2019s customer support? Given your ISP\u2019s internet service quality, how would you rate the price that you pay for them?\n\nThe top 10 providers and their overall customer satisfaction scores are:\n\nStarlink (94%) Google Fiber (83%) T-Mobile (80%) Xfinity (80%) Verizon (79%) Metronet (77%) Armstrong (73%) AT&T (73%) Spectrum (71%) Sparklight (70%)\n\nT-Mobile, Google Fiber, Starlink and Verizon also ranked in the top five for overall customer satisfaction in last year\u2019s awards survey.\n\nThe five leading internet providers with the top customer support teams are: Google Fiber (82%), Starlink (80%), T-Mobile (78%), Armstrong (which is new to the top five list this year, 76%), and Verizon (74%).\n\nThe survey showed that Spectrum, Comcast Xfinity, and AT&T finished in the middle of the results for best customer support. In fact, AT&T dipped below the study\u2019s 70% \u201capproval threshold\u201d for the second consecutive year, the survey said.\n\nMore than 60% of respondents were highly satisfied with the cost of their internet service in this year\u2019s survey.The top-rated providers for price were Google Fiber (80%), T-Mobile (78%), Starlink (77%), Metronet (72%), and Armstrong (71%).\n\n\u201cStarlink\u2019s high base price tag knocked it out of first place, although not by much \u2014 its 77% approval mark was only 3% behind Google Fiber and a point away from T-Mobile,\u201d the customer satisfaction award survey said. \u201cSimilarly, Google\u2019s hardly the most affordable ISP thanks to pricing that starts at $70.00 monthly.\u201d\n\nBased on the survey\u2019s results, CableTV.com surmised that respondents largely value performance and reliability over price. This point was based cable providers such as WOW and Xfinity, which are less expensive than Google Fiber and Starlink, having scored far behind both providers. It said that T-Mobile\u2019s ability to combine cable internet reliability with flat-rate pricing helped it take second place.\n\nCableTV.com said this year it changed its methodology affecting regional ISPs by raising its minimum sample group size to 100 respondents. This change ultimately removed additional providers such as Quantum Fiber, Ziply and Earthlink.\n\nAlthough AT&T ranked eighth in overall customer satisfaction in the CableTV.com survey awards, it led fiber broadband providers in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) Telecommunications Study 2024 with a score of 80 (out of 100).",

Zach Whitecloud and Noah Hanifin each collected a goal in the loss. Hanifin\u2019s goal marked his third talled in his last five games.\n\nSEASON SERIESThe first meeting between Vegas and Philadelphia saw the Golden Knights erase a 3-0 deficit to earn a 5-4 shootout win on Nov. 25 at Wells Fargo Center. The win was the fourth three-goal comeback victory in franchise history. Jack Eichel led the way with two points (1G, 1A) and the shootout winner to improve the team's record to 3-1-0 in the fourth game of a five-game trip. Ivan Barbashev (1G, 1A), Pavel Dorofeyev (1G) and Tanner Pearson scored in the win. Pearson's goal marked the first time he had scored in consecutive games this season. Ilya Samsonov stood strong in the net with 32 saves in the 5-4 shootout win.\n\nOPPOSITION UPDATE\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers currently rank sixth in the Metropolitan Division with a 17-17-4 record, totaling 38 points. Philadelphia is entering Thursday\u2019s matchup with a 4-0 win over the San Jose Sharks on Tuesday to improve their six-game road trip record 2-2-0. After a narrow 5-4 defeat to the Los Angeles Kings, the Flyers bounced back with four different goal scorers in their shutout win over the Sharks on New Year's Eve. Travis Konecny scored on the night to extend his team-lead in scoring to 42 points (17G, 25A).

The Golden Knights aim to play their first game of 2025 with new energy and a fresh mindset.\n\nPlay On Your Toes: Whitecloud and Hanifin said the team lost track of its identity in the third period on Tuesday against Montreal.

Perhaps you're prioritizing price or putting a premium on speed. Maybe you're after something that meets in the middle, like a fiber or cable plan that's both affordable and fast. Here's what you can expect for internet pricing and speeds in Valrico.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nValrico internet pricing\n\nThe starting price for internet service in Valrico is about $50 per month. All of the area ISPs offer a plan at around this price point. The difference is in the kind of technology and the speeds you get. Frontier's $45-per-month fiber plan for 500Mbps is one of the best deals when it comes to price and speed. For tight budgets, look to bundle a T-Mobile or Verizon phone plan with home internet or check into Spectrum's low-cost options.\n\nCheap internet options in the Valrico metro area\n\nIt's hard to find a cheaper internet plan than the Internet Advantage offering from Spectrum, and the Fiber 200 plan from Frontier. They both cost $30 per month, but the Spectrum plan offers 100Mbps while the Frontier plan gives speeds of up to 200Mbps service. Yes, they're still somewhat slow in our age of broadband, but they're incredibly affordable and is serviceable for basic online needs. The next closest offerings are fixed wireless plans from T-Mobile or Verizon when bundled with an eligible phone plan. That brings T-Mobile down to $40 per month and Verizon to $35 per month.\n\nCheapest internet plans in Valrico Plan Starting price Max download speed Monthly equipment fee Contract Spectrum Internet Advantage\n\nRead full review $30 100Mbps Free modem; $10 router None Frontier Fiber 200\n\nRead full review $30 200Mbps None None Frontier Fiber 500\n\nRead full review $45 500Mbps None None Spectrum Internet Premier\n\nRead full review $50 500Mbps Free modem; $10 router None Verizon 5G Home Internet\n\nRead full review $50 ($35 with eligible phone plan) 300Mbps None None T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review $50 ($40 with eligible phone plan) 115Mbps None None Show more (2 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nFastest internet providers in Valrico\n\nOokla's Speedtest service shows Valrico has some pretty peppy internet speeds. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) The median download speed for fixed internet is 365Mbps. That's thanks in part to Frontier and Spectrum's fast plans. Both offer reasonable deals in the 1,000 Mbps range, while Frontier kicks things up several notches with its maxed-out 7,000 Mbps offering.\n\nIf you have a hankering for face-melting internet speeds, your best bet in Valrico is to go with Frontier's Fiber 7 Gig plan for 7,000Mbps speeds, if it's available at your address. It will cost you a premium price of $300 per month, but it can make sense for residents with extreme demands or households with multiple heavy internet users. If that's a bit more than you need, then Frontier also has a 2,000Mbps plan for $100 per month.

The speeds are fast and the pricing is competitive. The numbers look good, but there's a lingering ding against Frontier when it comes to the quality of its customer service.\n\nFrontier has made progress in improving its customer satisfaction ranking in recent years. Spectrum remains in play with affordable cable plans, though it can't match the upload speeds of fiber. T-Mobile and Verizon are worthy of consideration, especially if you're an existing phone customer of one or the other.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Valrico\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we\u2019re considering every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. To evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service, we look at sources including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our How We Test ISPs page.\n\nValrico internet FAQs\n\nIs fiber internet available in Valrico?

Great for quick debt payoff It may be best for the cash-strapped millennial or the person who wants to pay off all their monthly debts as quickly as possible. However, the ideal user is a T-Mobile wireless customer who can get that flashy APY. GOBankingRates ranked it among the Best Checking Accounts for 2025.\n\nWhen you discover T-Mobile MONEY, you find a checking account that helps you get your hands on your direct deposits earlier and an impressive APY on balances. You can easily open your online checking account, get access to over 55,000 no-fee ATMs and are subject to no account fees.\n\nT-Mobile MONEY Checking Account\n\nWith its MONEY offering, T-Mobile is looking to disrupt the world of big banks with big fees and, certainly, to nab more wireless customers to whom it offers a high yield versus what non-T-Mobile customers get. T-Mobile MONEY also provides up to two-day early direct deposits for users on a payroll. Here are some key features of the account:\n\nT-Mobile MONEY doesn\u2019t attach any fees to its accounts \u2014 no maintenance fees, no overdraft fees, no out-of-network fees and no ATM fees for its 55,000+ in-network Allpoint\u00ae ATMs.\n\nThere are no account balance minimums or overdraft fees. In fact, overdraft fees are covered up to $50 through the Got Your Back program.\n\nT-Mobile MONEY account holders can get paid up to two days early with direct deposit. This is because T-Mobile MONEY typically makes funds available to users on the business day received, as opposed to up to two days later as is par for the average bank.\n\nAPY is a unicorn in the checking account space. Usually, you\u2019ll only get this kind of rate with a credit union, and that\u2019s a whole other ball of wax.\n\n4.8 GBR Rating GOBankingRates scores and rankings are objectively determined by our research/editorial team.

Show Pros, Cons and More Hide Pros, Cons and More\n\nBanking Experience\n\nOf course, you could switch over to T-Mobile to nab the high interest rate, as APY on a checking account is a pretty serious perk, even if it only covers balances up to $3,000.

It\u2019s got a scrappy, indie edge-and that cushy APY-that is most commonly associated with credit unions.\n\nEven for non-T-Mobile wireless customers, earning the APY and having no fees are enough to make this account worth considering.

            "content": "Analysis This year saw the launch of the first satellite constellations designed to provide commercial services straight to unmodified smartphones, which looks set to become the biggest satellite use case, with the US leading the way on adoption.\n\nSatellite services integrated with terrestrial cellular networks are still in their infancy, but the revenue from these is expected to grow rapidly to reach about $16.8 billion by 2028, according to forecasts by research firm CCS Insight, overtaking satellite broadband and leaving IoT connectivity via satellite in the dust.\n\nThose are the three applications of orbital internet service that CCS identifies, with broadband currently the largest at about $7.9 billion in revenue, thanks to providers such as Starlink.\n\nThis is predicted to rise to about $13.3 billion by 2028, but the revenue from so-called direct-to-cellphone satellite connectivity \u2013 your smartphone uses an overhead orbiting bird rather than a nearby cell tower \u2013 is set to rocket from virtually nothing today to pass broadband in 2027, while IoT will only just top a billion. (Direct to unmodified cellphone is not the same as dedicated sat phones, which have been around for yonks.)\n\n\"On the whole, the total revenue generated from these use cases is still relatively small compared to the telecom industry as a whole, but they do represent a long-term opportunity,\" said Research Analyst Vaishali Purohit.\n\nImage courtesy CCS Insight\n\nCCS also distinguishes two distinct approaches to providing a direct-to-cell service. One is to target modified devices that feature special hardware, the other focuses on unmodified smartphones, with key distinctions between the two in the spectrum they use, the players and partnerships involved, and the device support required.\n\nApple is one example of the modified device approach, first seen in the iPhone 14 which launched 2 years ago with the ability to send a message via satellite to a contact center and call for emergency help if no cell network is available. Messaging capabilities were extended in iOS 18.\n\nGoogle added SOS capability with its Pixel 9 device, and some Chinese brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi also have satellite messaging, but only for users in China.\n\nModified devices typically access dedicated spectrum in the L-band or S-band ranges, owned by the satellite operator, Purohit said. This includes Globalstar in Apple's case, plus others such as Skylo and ViaSat.\n\nWhile modified devices support basic services such as emergency and text messaging now, they are likely to support richer services such as voice and data by 2027, according to CCS.\n\nHowever, the unmodified device market is likely to be significantly larger than that for modified devices \u2013 forecast to reach 8.8 billion units by 2028, compared with about 1.5 billion, respectively.\n\nIridium flares for another $500m FLASHBACK\n\nUnmodified devices effectively means those compliant with the non-terrestrial network (NTN) capabilities specified in Release 17 and 18 of the 3GPP standards, which should include all smartphone handsets going forwards.\n\nThis market is based on terrestrial cellphone operators partnering with a satellite provider to deliver a service, typically by sharing some of the operator's spectrum in order to expand coverage out to areas beyond the coverage of the cell towers, or \"like putting a cell tower in space,\" as it has been described.\n\nCCS highlights three main satellite provider networks that are serving unmodified devices; Lynk, AST SpaceMobile, and SpaceX's Starlink, all operating low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.\n\nLynk, the smallest of the three, is the only one that offers an active service, but its coverage is currently in places such as the Cook Islands and Solomon Islands, though it does have a partnership with Rogers Wireless in Canada.\n\nHowever, most of the market for the near future is going to be in North America, especially the US where there are large areas outside unserved by cellphone signal coverage. Starlink has a partnership with T-Mobile US, while AST SpaceMobile has signed up the other two major US cellphone carriers, Verizon and AT&T.\n\nOther notable satellite operators include Amazon's Project Kuiper, which \"could impact the satellite industry on a similar level to Starlink,\" according to Research Analyst Joe Gardiner.\n\nThere is also Sateliot, which focuses on NarrowBand-IoT for connecting devices, and Telesat, which is adding a LEO constellation to its existing geostationary network.\n\nHowever, CCS Director for Consumer and Connectivity Kester Mann reiterated that satellite links are only likely to be a complementary technology to terrestrial networks, rather than any kind of replacement for them.\n\n\"It's about connecting the unconnected, principally the 350 million people throughout the world, many in emerging markets, who still cannot get online due to unavailability of telecom infrastructure,\" Mann said.\n\nThe US is going to be the epicenter of direct-to-cell satellite activity for the near future, dominating early usage and uptake thanks to all three of the country's major cellular carriers getting involved.\n\nCCS figure 2 - chart showing sms subscribers - Click to enlarge\n\nFirst mover on this is likely to be the T-Mo and Starlink partnership, according to CCS.\n\n\"We're expecting a commercial direct-to device offer for personal messaging almost anytime,\" Mann said, a forecast made more likely by the recent news that the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has given Starlink conditional authorization to operate its service.\n\nData services also on the near-term roadmap after the pair managed to demo a phone-to-phone video call using a Starlink satellite and unmodified smartphone back in May, he added.\n\nHowever, Starlink has only agreed a one-year period of exclusivity with T-Mo before it opens up its network and offers the service to rival carriers as well.\n\nIn regions like Europe, the case for direct-to-cell is less clear cut because existing telecoms infrastructure already serves much of the population with either fiber or cellular services, plus the relative lack of large sparsely populated regions. The UK government has already partnered with Starlink to cover some remote areas.\n\nThere is also a much more fragmented telecoms structure that may make it difficult for satellite operators to share the spectrum of a terrestrial network partner without the risk of interfering with neighbouring services that may be operating in a bordering nation.\n\nBut Australia is \"a recent hotbed of satellite activity,\" according to Mann, because like the US, it also has huge areas still lacking in any kind of mobile coverage. He pointed to Telstra partnering with Starlink for broadband delivery, while Optus is also working with the Musk-owned biz on direct-to-cell services.\n\nOverall, it seems like satellite-based phone services could soon become the norm, as we have written before \u2013 depending on where in the world you are, of course. \u00ae",

            "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider T-Mobile (TMUS). This company, which is in the Zacks Wireless National industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nThis wireless carrier has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.91%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, T-Mobile came out with earnings of $2.61 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.37 per share, representing a surprise of 10.13%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.27 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.49 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.69%.\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for T-Mobile. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nT-Mobile has an Earnings ESP of +3.24% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 29, 2025.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

            "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like T-Mobile US ( ). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nHow Quickly Is T-Mobile US Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. T-Mobile US' shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 49%. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that T-Mobile US is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.4 percentage points to 22%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\n\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check ?\n\nAre T-Mobile US Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$256b company like T-Mobile US. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. This comes in at 0.4% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.\n\nDoes T-Mobile US Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nT-Mobile US' earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics.

            "content": "A user bought a new phone from T-Mobile and ended up with a replaced and dirty unit, causing a bit of a stir in the community. Usually, when carriers replace a smartphone under warranty, a refurbished unit is dispatched in its place, which is fine as long as both devices work. In a surprise turn of events, a T-Mobile customer purchased a brand-new Galaxy S24 FE and ended up getting a refurbished phone, which appears to have a few thousand hours of use time.\n\nA user paid full price for the Galaxy S24 FE to T-Mobile and ended up with a used, refurbished model\n\nReplacing a used smartphone with a refurbished one makes sense as long as it comes with a new battery. However, things took a slightly different turn when a Reddit user bought a new Galaxy S24 FE from T-Mobile. The phone was received dead on arrival, which means that it was unusable, and the user did what any of us would do - ask the carrier for a new replacement unit. The replacement phone arrived five days later but was not in its original packaging. This is the first clue that the transaction did not go through as intended.\n\nT-Mobile possibly sent the device in plain white packaging, which is way different from Samsung's original one. While examining the device, the customer also noticed that the replacement device had dirt in the speakers and the charging port, hinting that the device was already used by another user and the unit was not examined by quality control. After running some tests through a diagnostic app, the user came to know that the battery was degraded compared to a new phone, as this specific unit showed 9,000 hours of use time.\n\nWe believe that T-Mobile should have accounted for the dead device as a return instead of a replacement. This would have allowed the customer to receive a new device instead of a refurbished replacement. Another user told the T-Mobile subscriber to inquire about the issue through T-Mobile's T-Force customer service. While we are not familiar with the full story or if the issue was resolved by the carrier, it can be seen that the customer paid the full price of the Galaxy S24 FE and received an old, refurbished model.\n\nThe customer should have used the device's original warranty instead of pushing it to the carrier as a replacement. We will share more details on the story as soon as further information is available.",

SpaceX has been busy launching direct-to-cell-enabled satellites into the Starlink constellation, and the deal with Kyivstar is not its first rodeo regarding direct-to-cell services.\n\nEarlier in 2024, Starlink was given temporary authorization by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate direct-to-cell satellite-based phone services in areas hit by Hurricane Helene. It was granted authorization for further services in the US on the condition that it won't cause harmful interference.\n\nIn 2022, T-Mobile US and SpaceX announced plans to use suitably equipped Starlink satellites for cellphone coverage in remote areas of the US. In December 2024, One New Zealand launched a direct-to-cell messaging service for eligible customers.\n\nStarlink connectivity has proven to be a valuable asset for Ukraine during the conflict with Russia. According to Kyivstar's parent company, VEON, \"the service will make Ukraine one of the first countries to have the game-changing Starlink direct-to-cell service, enhancing the resilience of the country\u2019s connectivity landscape.\"\n\nVEON Group CEO Kaan Terzioglu said the plan would \"take our commitment to Ukraine's connectivity to the next level, exponentially amplifying the resilience of our services with satellite connectivity.\"\n\nTerzioglu added, \"We look forward to exploring the opportunities across our markets that are home to 520 million people.\"\n\nKyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov said, \"Kyivstar has been the backbone of Ukraine's resilience throughout the war, and we are committed to leaving no stone unturned to keep Ukraine connected. Our collaboration with Starlink is a game-changer in our journey towards achieving our 'LTE everywhere' ambition.\"\n\nThere are, however, challenges facing Starlink's direct-to-cell service. In November, the FCC deferred a request by SpaceX to operate at signal strengths beyond those permitted. Other vendors, such as AST SpaceMobile, are also working to provide service directly to customer devices.\n\nWhile Starlink counts T-Mobile as a partner for its US plans, AST SpaceMobile has signed up Vodafone in an agreement to run through 2034 for space-based cellular broadband. It has also inked deals with US telco giants Verizon and AT&T. \u00ae",

            "content": "Federal Communications Commission has released its communications market place report for the year 2024 indicating significant investment in 5G network.\n\nCapex\n\nOver the past five years, mobile wireless service providers have invested nearly $163 billion in their networks, with $30.2 billion reported in 2023, a 22 percent decrease from $38.7 billion in 2022. The three largest providers \u2014 AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon \u2014 combined for an estimated $32.6 billion in 2023, reflecting a decline after steady increases from 2020 to 2022.\n\nIn 2023, these providers allocated 16.1 percent of their revenues to capital expenditures, with AT&T leading at 19 percent, followed by T-Mobile at 15.3 percent and Verizon at 14.2 percent. EchoStar has spent $2.6 billion annually in 2022 and 2023 to develop a facilities-based 5G network, contributing to the rapid deployment of wireless infrastructure, FCC said.\n\nThe major providers constructed their 5G networks 1.5 times faster than their 4G networks. EchoStar projects a $10 billion investment to create the first nationwide cloud-native 5G network, reporting broadband coverage to over 246 million people, or 73 percent of the U.S. population, by mid-2023.\n\n5G coverage\n\nOver the past two years, 5G coverage has significantly expanded, enabling high bandwidth and low latency for applications on a scale and with time sensitivity not achievable with 4G LTE. This growth has driven new streams of research and development in the wireless industry.\n\nBy mid-2024, AT&T reported 5G coverage for over 300 million U.S. consumers across 24,900 cities and towns, T-Mobile covered 330 million people over two million square miles, and Verizon aimed to cover 250 million consumers.\n\nEchoStar, as of mid-2023, covered 70 percent of the U.S. population with 5G. According to FCC data, by December 2023, approximately 97 percent of the U.S. population was covered by at least one 5G provider at speeds of 7/1 Mbps or higher in outdoor stationary environments, with 93 percent covered at speeds of 35/3 Mbps or higher.\n\nMIMO antenna\n\n5G-NR has enabled the adoption of Massive MIMO antenna technology in higher frequency bands, significantly enhancing network capacity, coverage, and user experience. Massive MIMO antennas, with numerous active elements, use beamforming to direct signals to specific users, reducing interference and improving signal quality.\n\nVerizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and EchoStar are actively deploying this technology. Wireless providers have also embraced carrier aggregation, which combines different spectrum channels to improve service quality by enhancing coverage, capacity, and speed. AT&T pioneered two-carrier aggregation for standalone 5G uplinks in 2023, while T-Mobile introduced four-carrier aggregation in mid-2023 and began deploying six-carrier aggregation in early 2024, aiming for speeds exceeding 3.6 Gbps.\n\nInitial 5G deployments primarily used non-standalone architectures, combining 5G radios with an LTE core, allowing seamless switching between 5G and 4G LTE based on application needs and device compatibility. Standalone 5G, featuring a 5G core, has been introduced by T-Mobile, AT&T, and EchoStar in select areas. This architecture offers faster speeds, enhanced coverage through carrier aggregation, support for higher device density, lower latencies, real-time applications, improved security, and enables network slicing. Equipment vendor Spirent anticipates broader deployment of standalone 5G in 2024.\n\nOpen RAN\n\nThe largest Open RAN deployment in the U.S. is EchoStar\u2019s 5G network, which covers 246 million people. Other deployments include Inland Cellular in Idaho and OptimERA in Alaska. In 2023, AT&T announced a $14 billion investment to move 70 percent of its wireless traffic to Open RAN, and in 2024, Verizon reported 130,000 radios supporting Open RAN specifications.\n\nFWA\n\n5G\u2019s enhanced spectral efficiency, achieved through Massive MIMO and beamforming, has made it a viable technology for Fixed Wireless Access (FWA). FWA is more cost-effective and quicker to deploy than other fixed broadband services, and consumers can install antennas themselves. AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and UScellular are offering FWA services using their 5G networks as they compete for fixed broadband customers.\n\nWhile cable and wireline companies lost over 140,000 broadband subscribers in 2023, FWA saw more than 3.6 million net additions. Verizon and T-Mobile together gained over 6.7 million FWA customers in 2022 and 2023, with AT&T having over 200,000 FWA customers by April 2024.\n\nRegional providers like Carolina West Wireless, Cellcom, Cellular One, and Union also use FWA in remote areas, and UScellular is exploring FWA with standalone 5G. In addition, IoT solutions such as Low-Power Wide-Area Networks, Narrowband IoT, and Long Range have emerged, and 5G\u2019s high bandwidth, low latency, and ability to support many devices make it ideal for IoT. Companies like CISCO and TELUS are launching IoT services.\n\nBaburajan Kizhakedath",

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Port Arthur?\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answers to those questions are often layered and complex, the providers that come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Port Arthur FAQs\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Port Arthur? Spectrum is our top pick for the best internet provider in the area due to its competitive introductory prices and gigabit speeds available. Spectrum also offers the widest fixed coverage in the city, reaching over 91% of households in Port Arthur. All plans come with unlimited data and no contracts. Customers can skip the $10 monthly equipment fee by using their own router.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Port Arthur? At present, fiber connections are very limited throughout the city. Approximately 3% of households have access to a fiber connection. A select few addresses along the city's outskirts near Groves might have access to AT&T Fiber.\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Port Arthur? Spectrum, Verizon and T-Mobile offer cheap internet plans starting at $50. Select households also have access to Spectrum's Internet Advantage plan which comes in at $25 a month for 50Mbps. Verizon and T-Mobile also offer lower rates for eligible mobile customers, which could bring your bill down to around $35 or $40.",

The Knights used December to fortify their division dominance, now 13-2-1, by going 7-1 against division foes.\n\nThe good news for the Knights is the first five games of the month are against teams below the playoff cutline in the Eastern Conference, including the last-place Buffalo Sabres (Saturday) and New York Rangers (Jan. 11).\n\nThere are chances to bank more points before the schedule gets hectic.\n\n\u201cWhoever the next opponent is, get to your game, try to get as many points as you can every night,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to do that (in December) than the previous two months.\u201d\n\nMarquee matchups\n\nJanuary is also a time for games that were circled on the calendar before the season began.\n\nGoaltender Marc-Andre Fleury will make his final appearance at T-Mobile Arena when the Minnesota Wild come to town on Jan. 12. Fleury, 40, will retire at the end of the season.\n\nThe second-winningest goalie in NHL history (567) claimed 117 victories with the Knights over four seasons, helped them reach the Stanley Cup Final in 2018 and won the Vezina Trophy and Jennings Trophy in 2021.\n\nTwo days later, Jonathan Marchessault will face his former team for the first time as a member of the Nashville Predators at Bridgestone Arena on Jan. 14.\n\nMarchessault, the Knights\u2019 all-time leader in goals (192) and points (417) and the 2023 Conn Smythe Trophy winner as playoff MVP, signed a five-year, $27.5 million contract with Nashville on July 1 after playing the first seven years of the Knights\u2019 existence with the organization.\n\nThe defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers will make their lone trip to Las Vegas on Jan. 26 in a matchup of the past two league champions. Florida won the first meeting, 4-3 in overtime, on Oct. 19 in Sunrise, Florida.\n\nKeeping it going\n\nThe Knights would love to carry their production from December into January.\n\nThey outscored teams 40-23 and gave up 1.92 goals over 12 games and held teams to two goals or less in nine of them. The level of competition helped, but the Knights still found ways to win against Winnipeg, Edmonton, Dallas and Minnesota.\n\nThis time last season, the Knights had 49 points and the eighth-best points percentage in the league. They went 7-5-1 in January and went from tied atop the Pacific Division to seven points behind the Vancouver Canucks by the All-Star break.\n\nThey\u2019ll gladly take where they are now, but there are still plenty of games to go.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re really picking up off each other right now,\u201d center Brett Howden said. \u201cWe just want to keep that going.\u201d\n\nContact Danny Webster at dwebster@reviewjournal.com.

            "content": "Trainer Jose Benavidez Sr. says his son, David Benavidez, is going to take David Morrell into the deep waters and drown him in their fight in 29 days on February 1st on PBC on Prime Video PPV in Las Vegas.\n\nJose Sr. feels that Benavidez (29-0, 24 KOs) can wear down WBA \u2018regular\u2019 light heavyweight champion Morrell (11-0, 9 KOs) with body shots and pressure.\n\nBenavidez\u2019s Plan\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know. Everybody\u2019s style is different,\u201d said Jose Benavidez Sr. to YSM Sports Media when asked if David Morrell is a tougher opponent for David Benavidez than Caleb Plant and Demetrius Andrade. \u201cDavid Morrell is a great fighter, a very decorated amateur fighter, a two-time world champion at 168 and 175. He\u2019s a left-hander. We don\u2019t know [if Morrell is tougher than Plant and Andrade], but as of right now, we\u2019re training like he\u2019s the best fighter in our career. We\u2019ve got to think that. \u201cWe can\u2019t underestimate David Morrell. We don\u2019t know how big is his heart. We\u2019re going to take him to the deep waters, and we\u2019re going to see if he can swim. If not, he\u2019s going to drown. The plan is not to just win the fight. Look spectacular,\u201d said Benavidez Sr.\n\nMorrell is much bigger, stronger, and younger than Plant and Andrade. So, for Jose Sr. to be counting on Benavidez doing the same thing to him that he did against those fighters, he could be in for a big disappointment on February 1st.\n\n\u201cThe thing is with all these fighters that move around. They don\u2019t want to get hit. So, they\u2019re very careful. They use their legs a lot,\u201d said Jose Sr. \u201cI hope David Morrell comes to fight and shows the people he\u2019s the best at 175, and that\u2019s going to end in a knockout.\u201d\n\nMorrell doesn\u2019t move around a lot. When he does move, he\u2019s standing in front of his opponents. He\u2019s not moving around the ring but side to side with his upper body. Morrell will be there for Benavidez to exchange shots.\n\nThe punches that Morrell throws are much harder than the guys the Mexican Monster has been fighting during his career and might not last long when he starts getting hit by the Cuban.\n\nTargeting The Body\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s careful, using his legs and moving around, it\u2019s going to take us a little time because when you have a fighter that\u2019s moving, it makes it a little bit difficult,\u201d said Jose Sr. \u201cI\u2019m sure David [Benavidez] is going to capitalize on that and start breaking that body and start putting damage on him.\u201d\n\nThe shots that Morrell was hitting his last opponent, Radivoje Kalajdzic, on August 3rd wound knockout Benavidez or badly hurt him to where he\u2019s defenseless to a follow-up barrage. Morrell had Radivoje hurt numerous times in their fight at the BMO stadium in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we can take him out of there before the ninth or tenth round,\u201d said Benavidez Sr.",

Loans are available to borrowers in every U.S. state except Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. It's one of the few lenders that offers park model loans, but it only offers those loans in 43 states.\n\n21st Mortgage Corporation doesn't require a minimum credit score, and down payments typically range between 5% and 35%, depending on your credit score, collateral and property type. A 20% down payment is required for investment properties. Borrowers with no credit score or a score below 575 need to put 35% down. This down payment can come in the form of land equity, trade-in, cash or any combination of the three.\n\nAlthough 21st Mortgage Corporation doesn\u2019t have a maximum debt-to-income ratio (DTI), if yours is above 43%, you may be required to provide additional documentation. Minimum loan amounts are $16,00 for mobile homes purchased through a dealer or retailer and $25,000 for refinanced properties or those purchased from an individual.\n\nBorrowers can apply online, and the process takes approximately four to six weeks for home-only loans. If land is included in the loan, the processing time may take six to eight weeks.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Loan term Varies Min. credit score No minimum credit score Types of loans Manufactured and mobile home refinances and loans Max. loan amount Varies\n\nBest for First-Time Buyers: eLEND View Rates\n\nPros Assistance with down payments\n\nLengthy loan terms\n\nEducation programs for first-time buyers Cons For a mobile home loan, you must own the land\n\nHigher minimum credit score\n\nWhy we chose it: eLEND (NMLS #2826) provides loans for new homes, first homes, multi-family homes, investment properties and vacation homes. It's a good option for first-time borrowers because the down payment requirements are low and the company educates borrowers about loans. eLEND also offers down payment assistance for those who need it.\n\neLEND provides financing through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), specifically the FHA\u2019s mobile home loan program, offering fixed interest rates and competitive pricing. The property must be at least 400 square feet, built after June 15, 1976, have a permanent foundation, and can\u2019t be located in a mobile home park.\n\nThe loan must also cover the land purchase. If you\u2019re buying a home that will sit on leased land, you\u2019ll need to take out an eLEND personal property loan instead. Credit score requirements will depend on location and property type, so you\u2019ll need to contact a loan consultant for more information.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Loan term 30 years Min. credit score 620 Types of loans Refinance, investment property, multi-family, vacation and mobile homes Max. loan amount Varies\n\nBest for Low Down Payment Options: Guild Mortgage View Rates\n\nPros E-closing options\n\nSeamless application and submission process\n\nVariety of manufactured home loan options Cons Not available in all U.S. states\n\nNo home equity lines of credit or loans\n\nWhy we chose it: We like Guild Mortgage (NMLS #3274) for its e-closing options, seamless application process, and wide variety of loans with low down payment requirements designed specifically for manufactured homes.\n\nLoan options include FHA, conventional, VA, USDA, FNMA MH Advantage and FHLMC CHOICEHome, all made for the manufactured home market. Depending on the loan type, you can qualify with a credit score as low as 540. Down payments range as low as 0% to 5%. All loans have a fixed interest rate, which means payments won\u2019t change from month to month.\n\nGuild\u2019s loans are available for single, double, and triple-wide properties. However, there are some standard qualifying requirements. The home must have been built after June 15, 1976, and transported to the home site directly from the manufacturer.\n\nGuild Mortgage works with over 500 down payment assistance programs to support first-time homebuyers with little savings. However, this assistance isn\u2019t available in all 50 U.S. states.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Loan term Varies Min. credit score 540 (varies by type of loan) Types of loans USDA, FHA, VA and conventional Max. loan amount Varies\n\nBest for High Loan Amounts: ManufacturedHome.Loan View Rates\n\nPros Option to finance mobile homes as a vacation property\n\nOption to finance homes located in mobile home parks\n\nSpecial programs for first-time home buyers Cons Website is not user-friendly\n\nInterest rates aren't posted\n\nWhy we chose it: A licensed nationwide mortgage broker, ManufacturedHome.Loan (NMLS #1905879) works with eLEND to offer loan variety and competitive terms to borrowers.\n\nManufacturedHome.Loan specializes in personal property/chattel loans for homes located on leased land or within mobile and manufactured home parks, something not every lender will do. It will also finance the purchase of a vacation home on leased land.\n\nYou can also take out FHA, VA, conventional and one-time close manufactured home loans through eLEND (see review above).\n\nManufacturedHome.Loan doesn't post interest rates, so you'll need to speak to a representative or fill out an application to request more information. Compared to the other sites we studied, the company's website is less user-friendly.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Loan term Varies Min. credit score Not posted Types of loans FHA, VA, construction, 30-year fixed, 15-year fixed, chattel Max. loan amount Varies based on credit and income\n\nBest for Low Credit Scores: Manufactured Nationwide View Rates\n\nPros Loans to borrowers in all 50 U.S. states\n\nGood for those with low to fair credit\n\nNo down payment in some cases Cons No loans for homes in mobile home parks or on rented land\n\nLengthy closing process\n\nWhy we chose it: Manufactured Nationwide (NMLS #411500) offers several loan options that provide up to 100% financing for a manufactured home on a fixed foundation, with no mortgage insurance required.\n\nThe lender offers manufactured home loans through FHA, VA and USDA programs. Options include purchase loans and refinance loans, including cash-out refinancing and VA jumbo loans. Depending on the loan type, you can obtain between 85% and 100% financing.\n\nManufactured Nationwide also provides up to 100% financing on mobile home construction loans and has the highest loan limits of all the lenders we considered: $3+ million, which provides greater flexibility when purchasing the land.\n\nOwned by The Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered, veteran-owned organization, Manufactured Nationwide made the list because of its extensive work with government-backed low-down-payment programs and availability in all 50 states. The lender has a lengthy closing process and doesn't offer loans for mobile homes on rented land or in parks.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Loan term 15, 20 or 30 years Min. credit score 580 Types of loans FHA, VA and USDA Max. loan amount $3 million\n\nBest for High Personal Loan Limits: PenFed Credit Union View Rates\n\nPros Available to any eligible borrower in the U.S.\n\nLoans funded in as little as one week\n\nTerms ranging from 12 to 60 months Cons Payments only reported to one major credit bureau\n\nMust maintain a member savings account\n\nWhy we chose it: PenFed (NMLS #401822) offers personal loans with a limit of up to $50,000, a large enough amount for those who choose to use this type of loan to finance a mobile home. Bear in mind that the credit union does not provide mobile or manufactured home loans.\n\nMost personal loans offered by PenFed have competitive interest rates and terms of 12 to 60 months. Since this is an unsecured loan and not a mortgage, you don\u2019t have to make a down payment, and a lien won\u2019t be placed on your home. The second largest credit union in the nation, PenFed was formerly only available to members of the U.S. military but is now open to any eligible borrower so long as they maintain a member savings account with the credit union.\n\nPen Fed also offers more traditional home financing options like conventional, FHA and VA loans for borrowers planning on buying property other than mobile homes.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Loan term Up to 30 years Min. credit score Lenient credit requirements Types of loans FHA, VA, jumbo, conventional fixed, adjustable rate and Power Buyer Max. loan amount Varies\n\nBest for Rural Areas: USDA View Rates\n\nPros 100% financing with no down payment required\n\nLow credit requirement Cons Income limits and geographic restrictions\n\nUSDA-guaranteed loans include a guarantee fee\n\nWhy we chose it: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers Section 502 direct and guaranteed loans and Section 504 home repair loans. Most USDA loans offer 100% financing, requiring no down payment, and are intended to help low- and moderate-income households afford a home purchase.\n\nUSDA loans aren\u2019t offered directly through the government agency but via approved lenders. You can also apply through the USDA Rural Development Loan program. These loans can be used to purchase, build, repair, or refinance a primary residence, including a mobile home. You can borrow 100% of the home's value, so there\u2019s no down payment.\n\nBorrowers who apply through third-party lenders will be subject to a guarantee fee, which, similarly to mortgage insurance, is generally rolled into the total amount of your loan. USDA loans have some eligibility requirements, including a credit score of 640, a willingness to repay the mortgage and United States citizenship or legal permanent residency.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Loan term 30 year Min. credit score None Types of loans USDA Max. loan amount Varies\n\nAds by Money.

VMF loans are available for new and pre-owned mobile and manufactured homes. They can also be used for home improvement and to upgrade your home\u2019s energy efficiency through the eScore program.\n\nWhy it didn't make the cut: VMF was recently sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly failing to properly determine borrowers ability to repay loans and other violations of the Truth in Lending Act.\n\nMobile home loans guide\n\nFinancing a mobile home purchase is a little different than financing your typical property. Not all lenders offer these kinds of loans, and the type of home you buy can determine the type of financing you need. Here's what you need to know about mobile home loans.\n\nTypes of mobile homes eligible for financing\n\n\"Mobile home\" is a broad term that people often apply to different types of homes, including mobile homes, park models and manufactured properties. However, though people may use the terms interchangeably, these three property types are very different from one another, and their distinction affects what financing options are available:\n\nMobile home: A true mobile home is a factory-built home built prior to June 15, 1976 \u2014 when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) instituted new regulations. Homes built before that date are ineligible for most mortgages. If you're buying an older mobile home, you may need to apply for a personal loan or seller financing.\n\nPark model: A park model home is a different classification than a mobile or manufactured home. Park models are considered vehicles for recreational use and don't need to meet HUD regulation standards. Park model homes are smaller and usually portable; they're good options for those who prefer to live in one area for a season or two before relocating elsewhere. Since they don't meet HUD standards, they may require alternative financing or specialty loans.\n\nManufactured home: A manufactured home is a mobile home built after June 15, 1976. These homes meet HUD standards and are eligible for a broader range of mortgages and loans.\n\nMain things to know before choosing a mobile home loan\n\nManufactured housing includes mobile and modular homes that are factory-built or site-built and placed on land owned or leased by the homeowner. These types of homes are typically single-family residences.\n\nThe type of loan you need will largely depend on your income, credit score, the lender you choose and the amount you want to borrow. A personal loan may be sufficient for some borrowers, while others may opt for a mortgage loan to finance a mobile home. In most cases, a mortgage loan is preferable to a personal loan because the maximum loan amounts are higher, the repayment terms are longer and the credit requirements are more flexible.\n\nBefore applying for a mobile home loan, consider doing the following:\n\nCheck your credit score: If it's less than 600, research ways to raise your credit score.\n\nSave for a down payment: While some loans don't require a down payment, many offer lower interest rates and better terms to those who put some money down.\n\nResearch loan types: Most lenders also offer conventional loans, FHA loans, VA loans and USDA loans. Some even offer investment property loans and LLC loans.\n\nWhat are the different types of mobile home loans?\n\nIn addition to personal loans, there are four primary types of mobile home loans:\n\nConstruction mortgage: Enables you to borrow specific amounts of money at different times if you purchase your mobile home and land separately.\n\nEnd mortgage loans: Provides financing for a residence that has already been built.\n\nChattel mortgage: Used to finance a residence that doesn't include land, such as those situated in a mobile home park or on leased land.\n\nSeller financing: Available with some mobile homes, the buyer makes payments directly to the seller over a specific period. These financing arrangements tend to be better for those with less-than-stellar credit, but they may have shorter repayment terms and higher interest rates.\n\nTraditional mortgage loans include the following:\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages (ARM loans): Involves interest rates that fluctuate throughout the life of the loan\n\nConventional loans: Not backed by the government and available as both non-conforming (jumbo loans) and conforming (loans that meet the guidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) loans\n\nJumbo loans: Ideal for borrowers with good credit who need a substantial loan\n\nGovernment-insured loans: Ideal for those with low credit scores and no down payment; for example, FHA, VA and USDA loans\n\nFixed-rate mortgages: Determines a fixed, predictable monthly payment for the life of the loan based on the mortgage rates at the time the loan is originated\n\nWhat are the requirements for a mobile home loan?\n\nThe requirements for a mobile home loan depend on the lender you choose. Most lenders offer loans to those with a credit score of 600 or above, and many offer 100% financing, so you don't have to provide a down payment. Some require collateral, which is the property that is used to secure the loan.\n\nHow to get a loan for a mobile home\n\nThe first step to securing a loan for a mobile home is to check your credit score and improve it as much as possible. Then, save for a down payment and choose a lender that offers the flexibility and benefits you need. Finally, research the lender\u2019s interest rates, loan terms, loan amounts and any other borrower qualifications.\n\nIf you have less-than-stellar credit, you may qualify for a mobile home or personal loan if you add a co-signer or co-borrower to your application. With another person applying with you, the lender will consider their income and credit, improving your odds of qualifying for a loan and securing a better rate.\n\nThe mobile home industry\n\nAlthough mobile homes have enjoyed an increase in popularity in recent years, there's plenty of room for growth. Currently, manufactured homes make up just 6% of the U.S. housing stock.\n\nThat percentage may change as demand for affordable housing and financing options continues. In fact, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the launch of a new loan program in 2024 which provides a Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured financing option for the purchase, refinance and renovation of manufactured homes.\n\nMobile home loans FAQs What are the current interest rates for mobile home loans? chevron-down chevron-up The current interest rate for a mobile home loan is determined by the Federal Reserve interest rate, other economic factors and each lender's policies. You can lower the rate by choosing shorter terms. The 10-year fixed rate on a mobile home will be lower than the 30-year fixed rate. A lower interest rate can lower your total cost. Who qualifies for a mobile home loan? chevron-down chevron-up Those with a credit score of 580 or above and a debt-to-income ratio that matches the lender's requirements can usually obtain a mobile home loan. In some cases, you must also provide evidence that you have a place to put your mobile home. What are the maximum loan amounts for a mobile home? chevron-down chevron-up This depends largely on the type of loan you choose. Many personal loans have a maximum of $50,000, while mortgage loans have much higher limits. Maximum loan amounts depend on your income, down payment, credit score and the mobile home's value. What is the difference between mobile and manufactured home loans? chevron-down chevron-up The terms mobile home and manufactured home are often used interchangeably. However, when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development updated its safety standards in 1976, it established a higher standard for manufactured homes. Structures built today are still sometimes called mobile homes but would more correctly be called manufactured homes. The same types of loans are used for both mobile and manufactured homes. These include personal, chattel, VA, FHA and conventional loans.\n\nHow we found the best mobile home loans\n\nTo find the best mobile home lenders, we studied a few crucial elements of each company:\n\nLoan types and terms: We checked the loan limits, the repayment terms and the types of mortgage loans each lender offers.\n\nOptions for different types of borrowers: We researched the best loans for people in various situations, such as those with no cash for a down payment, those with low credit scores and those looking for the best mortgage refinance terms.\n\nFinancing for homes with or without land: We investigated banks that finance mobile homes on purchased land and others that finance homes in mobile home parks or on leased land.\n\nBorrowers with low credit requirements: To help those with poor credit or no credit history, we also identified mortgage lenders willing to work with lower-than-average credit scores.\n\nSummary of the best mobile home loans of March 2025\n\nThe companies listed below are in alphabetical order.",

Finding cheap but reliable internet is essential for seniors and retirees needing a reliable internet connection that fits a fixed income budget.\n\nTo help you decide which internet deal is best for you, we've compiled a list of the top internet discounts based on cost, added fees, service details and military status and provided you with our top picks.\n\nRead more: Check out the best monthly internet deals.\n\nTips for choosing the best internet plan\n\nStart with government programs\n\nUnlike your local diner, internet service providers don't really offer senior discounts. Some ISP-specific deals are worth exploring (and we'll get into them later), but your best bet is to begin by taking advantage of federal programs. One in particular jumps to mind and has been around since 1985.\n\nLifeline is a decades-old program that can help eligible customers with phone or internet bills. While it's not specifically geared to older citizens, several of its qualifiers -- including participation in Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit -- apply to seniors. Lifeline aims to help low-income households, so retirees on an especially tight, fixed income, including those in Federal Public Housing Assistance or those using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, might also be able to participate.\n\nWhat do you get if you do qualify? Older people can get up to $9.25 a month off their internet bill or $111 a year off the cost of being connected at home.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nTry to avoid scams\n\nBeware of some ISP sites with \"senior deals\" pages, which are often ads masquerading as helpful tips. They're trying to sell you on higher-speed plans instead of showing you legitimate discounts or unveiling special deals. Unless you have some heavy streamers, gamers or remote workers in your house, you probably don't need all the speed offered in those plans. The Federal Communications Guideline advises at least 100 megabits per second in download speed and 30 megabits per second in upload speed, with a recommendation of at least 25Mbps for streaming in HD 4K.\n\nAlso, be sure to pay close attention to the fine print. If a \"senior deal\" doesn't explicitly mention data caps or additional fees, you might see some extra charges added to your bill. Know exactly what you're paying for before you buy. To avoid paying more, read our guide on how you can better spot those hidden fees.\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet service for older adults?\n\nOur top picks for the cheapest internet for seniors are Xfinity's Internet Essentials and Astound Broadband's Internet First plan. Both plans offer a 50-megabit-per-second plan for $10 monthly, targeted at low-income households and people over 65 who participate in Medicaid or SSI. With no data caps or required credit checks, these budget-friendly plans are perfect for households with light internet usage (like streaming, shopping online or checking your email).\n\nThe best internet deal for you depends on the one available at your address and that caters most to your specific needs.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nBest internet deals and discounts for seniors\n\n7 Internet providers SORT BY Recommended\n\nConnection Cable Speed range 50 - 100 Mbps Price range $10 - $30 per month Xfinity: Internet Essentials Best cheap seniors internet plan Our take - You may be eligible for Xfinity's Internet Essentials plan if you're a senior who participates in Medicaid or SSI, receives a VA pension and more.

Gaming, streaming and staying connected through social media aren't just a habit; they're effectively a need. Some older generations may be more apprehensive about getting online, especially with the never-ending developments and changes in technology that occur so frequently.\n\nInternet access can benefit seniors in many ways, including social connection and mental stimulation. Additionally, the absolute attachment of the internet to everyday life makes it increasingly difficult to pay bills, file taxes, or get help during an emergency without a reliable internet connection.\n\nHow can older adults stay connected online?\n\nTwo essential elements are required to stay connected online: a device for internet access and a reliable internet connection. Whether you opt for a cellphone, computer or tablet, accessing the internet from your household requires some kind of reliable service plan. There are multiple providers and options, but the right fit for you depends on availability and what type of internet plan you're looking for.\n\nWhat are the best social media apps for seniors?\n\nEmail is one of the most popular online tools that older generations use. It's a great option for efficiently communicating with loved ones, regardless of distance.\n\nUnlike email, social media outlets like Facebook, Pinterest and YouTube won't come already downloaded onto your phone. These three apps make it easy for older people to interact with family and friends.\n\nWhat's the easiest way for seniors to get internet on their phones?\n\nTo access the internet on your phone, you have two options: connecting to a home internet server or visiting a location that provides local Wi-Fi.\n\nSome providers offer a phone and internet bundle if you want a phone plan and a household internet service. Companies like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile offer plans that combine the two to save you money.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet deals for retirees\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn't end there: We use the FCC's website to check our data. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication. Once we have this information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answer to those questions is often layered and complex, but we recommend the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three. To explore our process in more depth, visit our explainer on how we test ISPs.\n\nWhat's the final word on senior internet deals?\n\nOlder adults have access to various deals and discounts regarding home internet connection. Some companies, like Xfinity, Optimum, Spectrum and Cox Communications, offer plans exclusively for people over 65, but others are more targeted toward low-income households.\n\nThe government program Lifeline is also a way to get money knocked off your monthly broadband bill. Even if you're unsure whether or not you're eligible for this program, it's worth checking out.\n\nIf you're looking for speedier plans, the option to bundle television or mobile devices with your internet, or if cost is not a major concern, be sure to explore all of your options before making a final decision. Pay attention to added fees, service terms and the fine print to maximize your savings and avoid being scammed.\n\nInternet deals for seniors FAQs\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet plan for older adults? Xfinity's Internet Essentials and Astound Broadband's Internet First tie for the cheapest plan: 50Mbps for $10 a month. Both plans come with no data caps and no credit checks, but Astound allows customers to try out the plan before they buy, with three months of service for free.\n\nWhat's the best type of internet plan for retirees? Ultimately, the best type of internet plan will come down to availability at your address and which one is best for your household needs. If you want the cheapest internet plan that's aimed toward older people, Xfinity or Astound are the providers who offer the best deals. If you want more speed or want to bundle your service with TV or mobile devices, you'll want to look into other plans.\n\nCan seniors get internet service for free? Technically, yes, but it'll take a few maneuvers. You must be eligible for the federal program, Lifeline. It's not explicitly for older adults, but if you participate in Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income or Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit, you may likely qualify. Once you do that, you become eligible to get up to $9.25 off the cost of phone, internet or bundled services, which may drop your bill close to $0 (depending on the cost of your internet plan). Show more\n\nDo any cable companies offer discounts for older adults? No, not specifically. Several cable internet companies feature discount programs and plans that can apply to seniors. For example, Optimum offers Optimum Advantage Internet, a 50Mbps plan for $15 a month that includes free installation, unlimited data, no contracts and a Wi-Fi router. Among the eligibility criteria are veterans receiving state or federal public assistance or people aged 65 and older who participate in Supplemental Security Income. Astound Broadband's Internet First program and Spectrum's Internet Assist also include the SSI participation qualification. Finally, Comcast Xfinity's Internet Essentials accepts SSI and participation in Medicaid or a VA pension. Show more\n\nDoes Xfinity offer discounts for older people? Xfinity does not offer a discount that's explicitly for older people or a 55-plus plan. Still, Comcast's Internet Essentials program has connected over 10 million low-income households to home broadband. This program features 50Mbps and 100Mbps plans for $10 and $30 a month, respectively. You'll also have free access to Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspots, including eligibility for older adults. Among the qualifications are participation in Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, public housing assistance and VA pension. Show more\n\nWhat are the best internet discounts for veterans? Rise Broadband is your way to go if you're seeking a veterans discount on any internet service plan. They offer 10% off any monthly plan for those active in or retired from the military. Other companies like Cox Communications and Optimum have specific plans at a discounted price for military personnel.",

Meanwhile, he says China will make up just around 5 percent, while the rest of the world, including other parts of America, would also make up just 5 percent.\n\nHe also predicted that that number would go up even further to nearly 100 percent, once SpaceX\u2019s reusable rocket is being launched more frequently.\n\n\u201cWhen Starship is launching at high rate, SpaceX will probably carry >99 percent of Earth\u2019s payload mass to orbit. This is necessary to make Mars a self-sustaining civilization,\u201d Musk added.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT SPACEX\u2019S STARSHIP: Texas awards SpaceX $17.3M grant to expand Bastrop tech hub\n\nTo be sure, Musk has been known to make ambitious claims about when his companies\u2019 products would achieve certain milestones. For example, Musk predicted in 2018 that SpaceX could launch a rocket to Mars with humans aboard by 2024, though SpaceX only began testing the company\u2019s reusable Starship in 2023.\n\nStill, the company has been routinely testing Starship since then, and with increasing frequency, and in October, SpaceX performed the first catch of the Starship\u2019s Super Heavy booster after liftoff to demonstrate the concept that a reusable rocket could be possible. In a launch earlier this month, SpaceX again successfully caught the Super Heavy Booster, though it lost the upper stage to a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d effectively meaning that it had exploded in air and showered surrounding areas with rocket parts.\n\nThe explosion was the second consecutive launch in which debris from Starship reigned down, highlighting the continued importance of testing as SpaceX aims to make the rocket a viable product for reusable space travel.\n\nOn Friday, SpaceX also launched its Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) to rescue astronauts that have been stuck on the orbital craft, after a Boeing launch was originally intended to bring them back to Earth. While SpaceX attempted to rescue the two astronauts in September, issues with the Starliner craft\u2019s thrusters discovered upon arrival made NASA hold off on approving the return mission.",

We aren't quite there yet, with T-Mobile and SpaceX being the only companies inching towards a rollout.

However, it could be a while beforeusers can text over satellite.According to someone who claims to be a T-Mobile employee , the beta trial is unlikely to begin before late January or early February.

You also won\u2019t get texting or an actual number.\n\nThe beta runs on T-Mobile\u2019s network so despite some setup hiccups and other growing pains, the experience shouldn\u2019t be too different from other prepaid carriers running on the Uncarrier\u2019s network.\n\nThere\u2019s a pretty solid chance you\u2019ve never heard of Mobi unless you happen to live in Hawaii, but it\u2019s time to sit up and pay attention as this current deal is pretty hard to beat. Right now if you pay Mobi just $50 you\u2019ll get 5GB of high-speed data per month on T-Mobile\u2019s network for a whole year and unlimited 1.5Mbps speeds after that.\n\nTo call this \u201cdirt cheap\u201d would be an understatement. Now to be clear, Mobi is an MVNO so you won\u2019t be getting service directly from T-Mobile, but the provider partners with T-Mobile for service. This means you should get a similar experience as you\u2019d find with prepaid providers like Mint Mobile and US Mobile.\n\nAre there any other catches here? A few, but none of them are dealbreakers when you consider the price tag. First, you have until 2025 to sign up for this promotional price, which is just over a day away. The bigger catch is that this is a beta program. As such, the experience might not be flawless. For instance, Mobi notes that setup is smooth for iPhones but can be trickier for some Android devices. The carrier vows it will help configure APN settings if needed, but just wants to make it clear that there might be some issues.\n\nThe beta\u2019s feature set is also basic \u2014 you won\u2019t get a phone number or texting. These features, along with extras like tablet sharing and standalone watch/tablet plans, will eventually be available for an additional fee.\n\nThis plan is ideal for those seeking a backup line and who are comfortable with occasional glitches. If you enjoy tinkering and troubleshooting, it\u2019s an excellent way to add T-Mobile coverage as a secondary option for areas where your primary carrier \u2014 like AT&T or Verizon \u2014 falls short.\n\nWho is Mobi, and should you trust them? Mobi is no fly-by-night operation and you can absolutely trust them. Established in Hawaii in 2006, the company has recently expanded beyond the islands by partnering with other networks. Mobi\u2019s coverage now includes the mainland US, Puerto Rico, and Canada. As part of the beta, you\u2019ll also have international access in the UK, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and India at no extra cost.\n\nYes, this deal is incredibly cheap \u2014 but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a beta test.

            "content": "A new partnership has been forged between SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, owned by Elon Musk, and Ukraine\u2019s top mobile operator, Kyivstar PJSC. This collaboration aims to provide satellite-based cellular services in Ukraine, enhancing the country\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nWhat Happened: Kyivstar has signed an agreement with Starlink to offer satellite connectivity, protecting telecom infrastructure from Russian attacks. This partnership will allow Kyivstar users to access space-based connectivity when the terrestrial network is compromised, Bloomberg reported on Monday.\n\nThe company plans to launch text messaging via this technology by the fourth quarter of 2025, with future expansions to include voice and data services. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian infrastructure, including telecommunications, has been frequently targeted.\n\nStarlink\u2019s portable terminals have become crucial for Ukraine\u2019s military and civilian communications, providing high-speed broadband internet. Earlier this year, SpaceX, Starlink\u2019s parent company, launched its first satellites to offer direct-to-cell service. The Federal Communications Commission in the U.S. recently approved SpaceX to provide some mobile phone coverage. The company has also partnered with T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS to reach customers in areas lacking coverage.\n\nSee Also: Nio\u2019s Death Cross Meets Tesla Competition: Could Onvo L60 SUV Spark A Bullish Comeback?\n\nVeon Ltd., the parent company of Kyivstar, committed to investing $1 billion over five years to rebuild Ukraine\u2019s digital infrastructure, further supporting the nation\u2019s connectivity amid ongoing challenges.\n\nWhy It Matters: The partnership between Starlink and Kyivstar is a significant development in Ukraine\u2019s ongoing efforts to maintain connectivity amid the conflict with Russia. Recently, Ukraine received 150 Starlink units from Poland, underscoring the importance of satellite technology in restoring communication in liberated regions. However, Musk has expressed concerns about the financial sustainability of providing these services for free.\n\nAdditionally, Russian state-backed hackers have targeted Ukrainian military devices using Starlink connections, highlighting the strategic importance of secure communications. To bolster Ukraine\u2019s defense capabilities, SpaceX secured a Pentagon contract to extend Ukraine\u2019s access to Starshield, a government-focused version of Starlink, further emphasizing the critical role of satellite technology in national security.\n\nInvestors can leverage Destiny Tech100 Inc. DXYZ and Cathie Wood\u2018s Ark Venture Fund ARKVX to participate in SpaceX\u2019s growth.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto by Wirestock Creators on Shutterstock",

            "content": "Three months after reports surfaced about a cyberattack, called Salt Typhoon, targeting internet service providers and US wiretapping infrastructure, two of the largest telecom companies say they've made progress securing their networks against the threat.\n\nAT&T and Verizon each released statements over the weekend addressing Salt Typhoon for the first time since working with federal law enforcement and other entities. AT&T said in its statement that, based on its investigation, China was targeting a \"small number of individuals of foreign intelligence interest\" and that the company is working to protect customer data.\n\nVerizon, meanwhile, said it has \"contained the cyber incident brought on by this nation-state threat actor\" and that it has \"not detected threat actor activity\" in its network for some time. It added that a third-party security firm has confirmed the containment.\n\nIn late September and early October, reports first described the Salt Typhoon attacks, which led the FBI to warn that some types of messaging, such as RCS texting between iOS and Android phones, may be at risk.\n\nIt now appears that Salt Typhoon has been a more targeted attack than was earlier believed, even though hundreds of millions of customers could have had their data and personal information at risk.\n\n\"In this incident, a small number of high-profile customers in government and politics were specifically targeted by the threat actor,\" Verizon said in its statement. \"Those customers have been notified of the activity.\"\n\nBoth Verizon and AT&T noted that they partnered with government and law enforcement agencies, telecommunications industry partners and private cybersecurity firms.\n\n\"In the relatively few instances in which an individual's information was impacted, we have complied with our notification obligations,\" AT&T said.\n\nOver the weekend, a ninth company affected by the hacking was said to be identified, but the White House didn't release the name of the company.\n\nT-Mobile reiterated Monday that it wasn't one of the nine referenced by the government, and it pointed to a T-Mobile blog post from late November, which offers details.",
