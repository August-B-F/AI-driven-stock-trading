He turned the White House into a showroom for the electric-car maker, which delivered five models to the presidential mansion and parked them along the driveway that winds around the South Lawn.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t really about a president buying a car. It was a choreographed event aimed at ending the backlash against Tesla and its owner, Elon Musk, who is leading Trump's campaign to slash the federal bureaucracy.\n\nEntire federal departments and agencies have been dismantled by Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, which he leads. Ten of thousands of government workers have been fired, although some have been rehired after court rulings that they were let go illegally.\n\nSome people across the country have reacted with violence and vandalism at Tesla dealerships \u2013 setting fires, smashing windshields and painting red X\u2019s on vehicles. Some Tesla car owners have placed bumper stickers on their vehicles that proclaim: \u201cI Bought This Before We Knew Elon was Crazy!\u201d\n\nMore problems: Tesla recalls 46,000 Cybertrucks in latest setback for Elon Musk's EV company\n\nTrump and his aides have stepped in to help Musk and Tesla weather the storm and boost the company\u2019s sagging stock, raising questions about the ethics \u2013 and the legality \u2013 of an administration actively working to benefit a business owned by the president's biggest financial backer.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said Richard Painter, who was the White House ethics chief under President George W. Bush. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the United States government promote a particular company.\u201d\n\nTrump buys a Tesla purchase amid Tesla stock drops President Donald Trump bought a Tesla in show of support of Elon Musk and said it'll be used at the White House.\n\nMusk\u2019s dual roles as private businessman and government cost-cutter also have raised concerns about conflicts of interest.\n\nMusk\u2019s businesses have received billions of dollars in government contracts, loans and tax credits. Through DOGE, Musk has worked to gut or scale back government agencies that have regulated or investigated his companies.\n\nIn another intersection of his private business and his work for the government, Musk was to receive a briefing from the Pentagon on Friday on the military\u2019s plan for any war that might break out with China, The New York Times reported. Musk, chief executive officer of both Tesla and the aerospace company SpaceX, is a supplier to the Pentagon and has financial interests in China.\n\nTrump denied the report, telling reporters he didn\u2019t want to share the Pentagon\u2019s plans with anyone, especially someone with Musk\u2019s business dealings in China.\n\nAt Tesla's South Lawn exhibition last week, Trump stood next to Musk and said the billionaire titan had been targeted unfairly. \u201cHe can't be penalized for being a patriot,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAsked whether his decision to purchase a Tesla might improve the company\u2019s stock and sales, Trump said, \u201cI hope it does.\u201d\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick went a step further last week, urging Americans to buy Tesla stock. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that this guy\u2019s stock is this cheap,\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019ll never be this cheap again.\u201d Tesla shares jumped by 5% on Friday but still ended at a loss for the ninth week in a row.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock plunges by half; is Elon Musk\u2019s EV party over? Tesla\u2019s stock has dropped by nearly half in three months, losing most of the gains it made following the U.S. election last year, when CEO Elon Musk helped fund the victory of President Donald Trump. Reuters\n\nThe Justice Department also rose to Musk\u2019s defense Thursday by following through on a threat to prosecute people who vandalize Tesla dealerships. Federal authorities charged three people with using Molotov cocktails to set Tesla cars and charging stations on fire.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said the arrests were a warning: \u201cIf you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\u201d\n\nBacklash: Tesla removed from Vancouver International Auto Show due to safety concerns\n\nThe White House defended its efforts on behalf of Musk and his company and hit back at Tesla critics like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic nominee for vice president. Walz told a crowd in Wisconsin last week that his mood often gets a \u201cboost\u201d from Tesla\u2019s plummeting stock.\n\n\u201cWhile deranged Democrats like Tim Walz are openly calling for the ruin of an iconic American company that employs tens of thousands of everyday Americans, the Trump administration is committed to unleashing prosperity for all of our companies, industries and workers,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said.\n\nBut government watchdogs said the administration\u2019s actions are a clear violation of government ethics rules.\n\n'Pure propaganda': Elon Musk calls for prosecutions of Pentagon staff who leaked to NYT\n\n\u201cUse of public office for private gain is prohibited for everyone at the executive branch,\u201d Painter said, citing the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n\u201cWe can argue about whether the president is strictly bound by that, but everyone else is, including the commerce secretary,\" Painter said. \"You cannot use your official position to promote any private organization, any company, any nonprofit, anybody. You simply cannot do that.\u201d\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit group that works to expose ethics violations and corruption in government, also said the administration\u2019s efforts on behalf of Musk are alarming.\n\n\u201cIt sure appears that the White House is playing favorites and trying to put its thumb on the scales for a business primarily owned and run by a member of the administration,\u201d said Jordan Libowitz, the group\u2019s spokesman.\n\nBiden and the Big Three\n\nTrump\u2019s defenders point out that former President Joe Biden also staged a White House event in 2021 to promote electric vehicles. Biden was joined on the South Lawn by executives from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, as well as leaders from the United Auto Workers union.\n\nAt that event, Biden signed an executive order setting a target for zero-emissions vehicles to account for half of all automobiles sold in the United States by 2030. He then got behind the wheel of an electric Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 4xE and took it for a test drive.\n\nBiden's short spin down the White House driveway was captured on video and plastered all over social media.\n\nThe 2021 Tesla snub\n\nMusk and Telsa were not invited to the Biden event \u2013 a snub that reportedly infuriated Musk. The next year, he announced he was switching his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican.\n\nBiden\u2019s auto show, however, was different from Trump\u2019s, Painter said, because it promoted the use of electric vehicles in general instead of a particular company.\n\nThough there have been cases when the government has bailed out specific automakers on the verge of financial collapse \u2013 Chrysler in 1979, for example, and General Motors and Chrysler in 2008 \u2013 the executive branch has never boosted a specific company in the same way Trump and his administration have been promoting Tesla, Painter said.\n\n\u201cHenry Ford never had the support from the government where they promoted his cars,\u201d said Painter, who is now a law professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cHe was all over politics, but they didn\u2019t promote his cars over General Motors. That\u2019s not the American way.\u201d\n\n'More harm than good'\n\nTrump\u2019s push to prop up Tesla seems to be having the opposite effect, said Daniel Ives, a financial analyst and technology expert with Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm based in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt has done more harm than good because the last thing investors want to see is Tesla become a political symbol,\u201d Ives said.\n\nBut because of Musk\u2019s work with DOGE and his association with Trump, more people have come to view Tesla as a political symbol, leading to the protests and violence targeting Tesla dealerships and owners, he said.\n\nCost cutter: 'We haven't seen anything quite like Musk.' Here's what's behind his government blitz.\n\nThe political turbulence also is affecting the company\u2019s financial picture.\n\nTesla stock has lost more than 40% of its value this year. Trump buying a Tesla on the White House South Lawn might be good political theater, Ives wrote in a company report Wednesday, but it won\u2019t resolve the brand crisis the company is facing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one person who can fix it,\u201d Ives said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not Trump. It\u2019s not Lutnick. It\u2019s Musk.\u201d\n\nMusk needs to take a step back from DOGE and start to lead Tesla again, Ives said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a politician,\u201d he said. \u201cHe's CEO of Tesla, as well as a lot of other ventures. And he needs to make sure that the brand damage doesn't become permanent.\u201d\n\nFollow Michael Collins on X @mcollinsNEWS.",

            "content": "Is there life after Tesla? All over the world, for various reasons, a lot of electric vehicle owners are asking themselves that question right now. While many competitors are catching up or even surpassing the Elon Musk-led automaker these days, most EVs on the road globally are from Tesla. Figuring out what's next is can be a big adjustment.\n\nYouTuber Robert Rosenfeld is one such owner who's asking himself that question. We have covered his videos before. He has only owned Tesla EVs since 2019, going from the Model Y to the Model X and now to a Cybertruck and building up his YouTube channel along the way. But when he got the chance to see how \"the other half lives,\" as he put it, he went for it, driving only a loaner 2025 Rivian R1S for a week.\n\nI'll spoil the ending a bit here. Rosenfeld likes the R1S, but decides to keep the Tesla for reasons we'll cover next. (It's also worth noting that he has a big audience of Tesla devotees and is slinging referral codes as part of his videos, so officially making the switch may have had bigger implications for what he does.)\n\nYet this is still a good look at the differences between two of the most advanced EVs for sale in America right now. Rivian and Tesla are the only two brands that I believe make truly software-defined vehicles for first-rate smartphone app integration and continual over-the-air updates. And anecdotally, when I talk to Tesla owners looking to move on, Rivian's EVs are often at the top of their list\u2014although right now, Rivian's choices are fewer and more expensive than Tesla's lineup. That should change next year with the debut of the $45,000 Rivian R2.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nIn terms of pricing, this R1S Tri-Motor Max Pack costs about $111,000, making on par with a well-equipped Cybertruck or Model X Plaid. This Rivian configuration would get 371 miles of range, handily beating the Model X's 314 miles and the Cybertruck's 325 or 301 miles, depending on its configuration.\n\nSo how do these two brands really stack up? First and foremost, Rosenfeld likes the customization and options of Rivian's R1S and R1T, including trim levels, colors and wheels. Tesla's configurability is far more sparse. But he likes the boxy design, versatility and SUV capability of the Rivian too. \"I've got a whole lot of room for hauling, which is nice,\" he said.\n\nPhoto by: YouTube Rivian YT Int\n\nRosenfeld is obviously a veteran of Tesla's \"very few buttons\" approach, so he's at home in the Rivian. (Personally, I wish both brands would add more physical controls.) He feels like it's a premium vehicle inside and said it \"checks most of the boxes,\" but admits Rivian's adventure-y vibe isn't quite his jam. To each their own.\n\nRosenfeld heaps a lot of praise on the 360-degree top-down camera system and said he wishes Tesla would adopt something similar. He also really loves the driving experience and admits that even Tesla fans would like the increased degree of customization over the R1S' driving dynamics: adjustable regenerative braking, customizable displays, different driving modes and so on. \"I'd have no qualms about taking this on a road trip,\" he added.\n\nPhoto by: YouTube Rivian Software YT 2\n\nBut Rosenfeld said that software is what keeps him loyal to Tesla. He doesn't love the Rivian's menu setups (in part because it's just different from what he's used to) and he feels like the maps and HVAC controls are clunky. Frankly, I'm not a fan of the climate controls on either car and wish both of them would add some air vents. He's also a big user of Full Self-Driving, which many Tesla owners are not, and said that not having a direct Rivian equivalent is a letdown. Right now Rivian is just now branching into hands-free highway driving assistance but has more plans for autonomy down the road.\n\nIn the end, Rosenfeld likens the experience to Apple vs. Android: one company tells you exactly what you're going to get, and the other offers a lot more options, customizations and configuration. It can be tough to switch ecosystems, but I'd argue it's a little easier for your car than it is for your smartphone and gadget universe.\n\nIf you want a second opinion, check out this video from YouTuber Darren Byrd, a pilot who normally makes content about aviation but just posted a video about trading in his Model X for a similar R1S. He explains the upsides and downsides in a very fair way, but overall, he's happy with his purchase. \"The R1S is a more normal car that happens to be electric\" than his Falcon Door-equipped SUV was, he said.\n\nIn the end, for those considering moving on from Tesla, I'd tell them to ask themselves this: what did you like most about your car? If it was range and ease of charging access, I'd recommend the new NACS-equipped Hyundai Ioniq 5. If was software, arguably Rivian is the closest Tesla competitor and likely to close any existing technology gaps soon enough. If it was performance, very few EVs are slow, but the Polestar 3 or the Porsche Taycan are always compelling options. And the entire field of options is getting better all of the time.\n\nContact the author: patrick.george@insideevs.com\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

To claim a complimentary adapter, eligible customers must have an active MyHyundai owner's account and must have opted to receive email communications. This Hyundai designed and authorized CCS-to-NACS adapter is essential for reliable charging at V3 Tesla Superchargers and other NACS DC fast charging stations. Eligible customers must complete the process within 60 days of receiving the email invitation to redeem their complimentary adapter.\n\nHow eligible owners can receive a fast-charging adapter:\n\nOwn an eligible Hyundai EV that was purchased/leased on or before January 31, 2025 . Have an active MyHyundai.com owner's account and have opted into receiving emails. Eligible, contactable customers will receive an email from Hyundai beginning the week of April 7 to verify that their customer information account (shipping address, vehicle model, vehicle model year) is correct. Customers must review and confirm the adapter offer and adapter usage terms and conditions. If the customer agrees to the terms and conditions and confirms the shipping address is correct, then the customer can click 'Yes, the above information is correct' and an adapter will be shipped to that address. If the shipping address is not correct, then the customer can click 'No, the above information is incorrect' and will be directed to MyHyundai.com to update the customer's shipping address. Updated addresses may take up to a week for a customer to receive a new email to redeem. Eligible customers will then receive a confirmation email and a subsequent email containing a tracking number once the adapter has shipped.\n\nLike the refreshed 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5, which already has access to the Tesla Supercharger network, all new and significantly updated Hyundai EV models will feature built-in NACS ports. The NACS ports eliminate the need for an adapter to access Tesla Superchargers and other DC fast charging stations. These NACS-native models do not need, and do not qualify for a complimentary adapter.\n\nThis complimentary-adapter offer applies to qualified Hyundai Motor America EV customers only. Hyundai Motor Canada will provide details regarding Supercharger access and adapter procurement for EV owners in its market later this year.\n\nFor more information, visit https://owners.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/resources/general-information/hyundai-nacs-adapter-terms.

Those responsible will be pursued, caught, and brought to justice,\u201d FBI Director Kash Patel said Monday.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi also described the anti-Tesla acts as \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d last week, after a person dressed in black shot and set fire to several Tesla vehicles at a repair facility in Las Vegas.\n\nMusk echoed that on his X social media platform on Monday, writing, \u201cThere is no doubt that shooting bullets into Tesla stores and burning down Superchargers are acts of terrorism.\u201d\n\nIn an X post last week responding to the violent acts aimed at Tesla facilities, Musk wrote, \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d\n\nThe FBI declined to say how many people will be assigned to the task force. The New York Post first reported about the new law enforcement initiative.\n\nBomb squad removes incendiary devices from Tesla dealer in Austin, Texas\n\nAmid the federal government\u2019s actions to contain these attacks, police in Austin, Texas, got a call Monday morning about possible hazardous materials found at a Tesla dealership.\n\nResponding officers reported \u201csuspicious devices\u201d and called in the bomb squad, which determined the devices to be \u201cincendiary\u201d and took them away without incident, Austin police said.\n\nPolice declined to release further details about the type of incendiary devices they found, saying, \u201cThis is an open and ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to Tesla for comment.\n\nTrump administration ramps up response\n\nIn addition to the new task force, the FBI released a public service announcement over the weekend urging the public to look out for signs of an attack on Tesla dealerships or Tesla-related entities. Those signs could include someone surveilling or trying to break into Tesla properties or making threats against the company online.\n\nAnti-Tesla incidents have happened in at least nine states, the FBI said, noting the pattern appears to be them occurring overnight, and \u201cconducted by lone offenders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese incidents have involved arson, gunfire, and vandalism, including graffiti expressing grievances against those the perpetrators perceive to be racists, fascists, or political opponents,\u201d the FBI said, asking anyone with information about these crimes to contact law enforcement.\n\nHere are some of the notable recent incidents involving Tesla vehicles and facilities:\n\nLas Vegas, March 18 : Surveillance video at a car repair shop showed a person dressed in black shooting at Tesla cars and igniting two of them with Molotov cocktails, according to police. The word \u2018Resist\u2019 was spray-painted on the front doors of the shop. No injuries were reported, and the fires were put out before they could reach the Teslas\u2019 batteries.

Three of the four largest markets in the EU, accounting for 64% of all battery-electric car registrations, recorded robust double-digit gains: Germany (+41%), Belgium (+38%), and the Netherlands (+25%). This contrasted with France, which saw a slight decline of 1.3%.\n\nIn the EU, EFTA, and UK markets, BEVs account for 17% of the entire auto market, with PHEVs adding another 7%.\n\nTesla had the worst performance of all automakers in the market:\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nTesla fans are holding on to the idea that this is not a real problem because it is mostly due to the Model Y changeover, but that\u2019s simply not true.\n\nModel 3 registrations are also down in most European markets, despite Tesla having a similar situation as Model Y for Model 3 during this time last year.\n\nIn fact, Model 3 is down 29.4% in Europe so far this year despite plenty of inventory.\n\nThe shift to the new Model Y design is certainly having an effect, but it cannot account for the 43% drop in deliveries.\n\nWith deliveries of the new Model Y having started this month in Europe, we can see Tesla is still suffering in markets that report registration daily.\n\nTesla has only delivered 655 cars so far in March in Sweden compared to 2,524 for the whole month of March in 2024.\n\nIn Norway, Tesla is at 1,444 deliveries compared to 2,334 units for the whole month of March in 2024.\n\nTesla is already down 20,000 units in Europe for the first two months of the year compared to its 2024 performance, and that number could grow to 30,000 units by the end of the quarter.",

But as the New York Times (NYT) reported Friday (March 21), the restaurant\u2019s opening has run into a roadblock: Tesla\u2019s CEO.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s involvement in the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has turned his car company into a lightning rod, sparking protests at Tesla dealerships as well as a few cases of vandalism. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s sales continue to slip.\n\nAccording to the NYT, this has made finding chefs something of a challenge. For example, Caroline Styne and Suzanne Goin, owners of the Lucques Group of restaurants in Los Angeles, decided against operating the diner in 2023.\n\nAt the time, the reasons were economic. But now, Styne said she\u2019s changed her mind about the car company, recently swapping her Tesla for an electric BMW.\n\nMax Block, founder of the Los Angeles hospitality-communications agency Carvingblock, told the NYT that any chef would need to factor in Musk\u2019s reputation before agreeing to cook for the Tesla diner.\n\nAt the same time, a diner where customers can watch movies while eating food brought by roller skate-wearing carhops \u2014 something Musk has suggested \u2014 would appeal to \u201ca culture where people dine for experiences,\u201d Block said.\n\nIn other electric vehicle (EV) news, PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster wrote last week about the \u201cpotential platform misfire\u201d facing the industry, driven by several factors. Chief among them: charge anxiety, the worry among consumers about EV\u2019s limited battery life and the scarceness of charging stations.\n\n\u201cAlthough critics dismiss this as overblown, the fear of running out of power without convenient charging options reflects legitimate infrastructure gaps in the EV ecosystem,\u201d Webster wrote.\n\nAmerican motorists, the report added, have become used to being able to fuel up in less than five minutes at the 145,000-plus gas stations, typically found in convenient locations, and offering a number of pumps.\n\n\u201cBy comparison, there are roughly 53,000 EV-friendly stations across the country \u2014 with 130,000 charging ports \u2014 and they\u2019re unevenly distributed and not so easy to find,\u201d wrote Webster. \u201cThis creates enormous uncertainty, which increases anxiety.\u201d",

The Shenzhen-based firm says revenue rose by 29% to come in at 777 billion yuan ($107bn; \u00a383bn), boosted by sales of its hybrid vehicles. This topped the $97.7bn reported by Elon Musk's Tesla. BYD has also just launched a lower-priced car to rival Tesla's Model 3, which has long been the top selling EV in China. It comes as Tesla faces a backlash around the world over Musk's ties to US President Donald Trump, while Chinese carmakers have been hit with tariffs in Western countries.\n\nBYD sold around the same number of EVs as Tesla last year \u2013 1.76 million compared to 1.79 million, respectively. But when sales of the Chinese company's hybrid cars are taken into account it is much bigger, selling a record 4.3 million vehicles globally in 2024. On Sunday, BYD announced a new model to take on Tesla. Its Qin L model has a starting price in China of 119,800 yuan, while a basic version of Tesla's Model 3 is priced at 235,500 yuan. It comes as Chinese consumers are cutting spending in the face of economic challenges, including a property crisis, slowing growth, and high local government debt. Last week, BYD's founder Wang Chuanfu announced new battery charging technology, which he said could charge an EV in five minutes. That compares with around 15 minutes to charge a Tesla using its supercharger system.

It is not clear whether he has a lawyer or when he is due to appear in court.\n\nOn his Facebook account, Dutil appeared to have shared content supporting President Donald Trump, including a video depicting Trump and Vice President JD Vance in a \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" parody video as \"The Dukes of Maga.\"\n\nHe also shared a considerable amount of veterans content and wears a military uniform in his profile picture.\n\nIn 2022, Dutil also seemed to share posts criticizing electric cars, writing in one post: \"Screw electric vehicles. If you drive one, welcome to 1995 where the technology of your car is from. More coal equals more electricity needed for electric vehicles.\"\n\nThe Palm Beach Post reported that Dutil was driving a black Nissan SUV and that the crowd numbered more than 100.\n\n\"He drove into a crowd of senior citizens.

We immediately called the cops,\" Mark Offerman, of the Democratic Progressive Caucus Palm Beach County, which organized the protest, told the newspaper.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe protest was one of several across the country in recent weeks to show opposition to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's politics and actions at the Department of Government Efficiency. Since January, DOGE has slashed government costs and fired thousands of federal workers.\n\nWhile some Republicans have cheered on his extreme methods, politicians and supporters of both parties have warned of the consequences of remaking the state in such a rapid, hard-line way.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Caucus Palm Beach County plans to protest at the same West Palm Beach dealership every Saturday for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Elon Musk is destroying our democracy, and he\u2019s using the fortune he built at Tesla to do it,\" the organizers wrote in a message advertising the demonstrations on an activist website.\n\nIt continued: \"We are taking action at Tesla to stop Musk\u2019s illegal coup AND send a vital message to the American People: we will not surrender democracy to the Trump-Vance-Musk regime to benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin or any dictator or oligarch.\"\n\nWhile many protests are peaceful, at least 80 cases of vandalism and damage affecting Tesla vehicles and charging stations have been reported, including cars and charging stations being damaged. At least 10 dealerships have been affected.\n\nThe FBI said Friday that protesters were targeting Tesla vehicles and dealerships across the country \"with arson, gunfire, and vandalism.\" But law enforcement officials and domestic terrorism expert said there was no evidence the attacks were coordinated.\n\nThe protests are having real-world consequences for Tesla. The company's stock price closed at $248.71 on Friday, having reached a 52-week high of $488.54 in December, although the price is higher than it was for much of 2024.\n\nMusk told his employees at a Tesla all-hands meeting last week that better days are ahead. \"Hang on to your stock,\" he urged them.",

            "content": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nSpinning bright red handkerchiefs and dancing in step to folk music, more than a dozen human-like robots took to China\u2019s biggest stage in January, making a splashy debut at the annual Lunar New Year gala.\n\nThe remarkable performance, watched by more than a billion people, is a high-profile reminder of how far Chinese humanoid robots have come. Over the past two months, videos of the country\u2019s humanoid robots pulling off moves such as bike rides, roundhouse kicks and side flips have blown up the internet, often amplified by state media as a key potential driver of economic growth.\n\nEven though very few of the humanoids are in mass production, competition with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, one of the acknowledged frontrunners in the field, is heating up. The promise of an \u201cI, Robot\u201d future, where machines handle household chores and serve as caregivers, has drawn nearly every major tech company in both the United States and China to bet on humanoids or robotics.\n\nMicrosoft, Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have invested in American humanoid maker Figure AI. Meanwhile, Meta is planning major investments in humanoids, according to a Bloomberg report last month.\n\nMusk, whose Optimus humanoid has sparked global interest since its debut in 2022, predicted last month that the project alone could generate more than $10 trillion in revenue.\n\nWhile it may take another five to 10 years for humanoid robots to make a real societal impact, they could eventually become the next widely adopted consumer electronics, according to Xi Ning, chair professor of robotics and automation at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cEverybody will need them, like automobiles, like cellphones, and the potential market volume will be huge,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nUnitree handout\n\nGoldman Sachs projected last year that the global humanoid robot market will be worth $38 billion by 2035. In five years, they estimate that 250,000 humanoid units, mainly for industrial use, will be shipped, while consumers will be buying about one million units a year in about a decade.\n\nBeijing, which is looking to replicate China\u2019s success in the electric vehicle (EV) market, wants to be at the forefront of that growth.\n\nIt\u2019s eager to position the country as a global tech powerhouse and build on the momentum of recent Chinese achievements in the field - such as AI startup DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning model that stunned the world in January - especially as the US tightens tech restrictions on Beijing.\n\nDespite entering the race later than American rivals including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Figure AI, experts say Chinese firms are rapidly closing the gap. With their preternatural ability to optimize supply chains and cut costs, Chinese firms are also accelerating the mass production of humanoids.\n\nPlaying catch-up\n\nChina already dominates the space for industrial robots, deploying more of them every year since 2021 than all other countries combined, according to the International Federation of Robotics, a Germany-based non-governmental organization.\n\nCompared to humanoids, industrial robots typically feature less advanced technology and perform less sophisticated tasks. They\u2019re widely used in industrial settings for manufacturing or transportation.\n\nAs with EVs, Tesla was one of the few big-name frontrunners for humanoids when Musk introduced the project in 2021 and showcased an Optimus prototype a year later. Since then, Beijing has publicly thrown its weight behind the humanoid robotics industry with increasing funding drives and government support.\n\nTesla's humanoid robot Optimus at its exhibition booth during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on July 5, 2024. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a 2023 policy document, China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology identified the humanoid robotics industry as a \u201cnew frontier in technological competition,\u201d setting a 2025 target for mass production and secure supply chains for core components.\n\n\u201cChina started relatively late, but it has its own advantages like a huge market and a relatively complete supply chain for the technology, which enables them to easily develop similar kind of robots at lower price,\u201d said Xi at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nOver the past three years, various local governments \u2013 including major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen \u2013 have announced plans to establish or have launched investment funds dedicated to developing robotics, totaling at least 73 billion yuan ($10 billion), according to a tally by CNN.\n\nLast month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping chaired a high-profile meeting with the country\u2019s top business executives. Among those seated in the front row was Wang Xingxing, CEO of Unitree, the company behind the viral dancing robots, an indication of Beijing\u2019s growing focus on this emerging sector.\n\nAside from Unitree, other major domestic players include Shenzhen-based UBTech, Chinese EV giant BYD-backed Agibot, Beijing-based Robotera and Shanghai-headquartered Fourier Intelligence, as well as EV maker XPeng.\n\nLack of core technologies\n\nExperts say China still trails the West in certain key technologies, even as it dominates the supply chain. About 56% of the humanoid robot supply chain companies are based in China, according to a Morgan Stanley research report last month.\n\nBut China still needs to achieve a breakthrough in \u201ccore technologies,\u201d such as processor chips, high-precision sensor and robot operating systems, to reduce its reliance on foreign technology, said Zhang Dan, chair professor of intelligent robotics and automation at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nArtificial intelligence chips underpin humanoids\u2019 operating systems, guiding their thinking, perception and motion. Many humanoid developers depend on AI chip giant Nvidia\u2019s products. At its annual developer conference last week, the company unveiled a new AI foundation model for humanoid robots.\n\nCiting national security concerns, the former Biden administration steadily tightened export restrictions on advanced chips that could power China\u2019s military. Beijing has sought to develop its domestic chip supply chain as part of its self-sufficiency drive.\n\nAdditionally, European, American and Japanese companies continue to dominate higher-end components such as sensors, as well as motors and screws that power robotic motions with higher precision and stability, according to a Morgan Stanley report last month.\n\nTo overcome those shortcomings, Chinese suppliers are actively trying to do business with Tesla. Many of them have sent component samples for Tesla\u2019s review, according to P.K. Tseng, a senior research manager at TrendForce, a market analysis firm.\n\n\u201cAfter Chinese supply chain manufacturers supply components to Tesla, they refine them based on testing feedback and then offer the improved versions to domestic manufacturers,\u201d he said.\n\nOver time, this creates a cycle of continuous technological advancements, enhancing the quality of the whole domestic humanoid robotics industry, he explained.\n\nPrice competitiveness\n\nWhile technological gaps remain, China has emerged as a price disrupter in the nascent industry.\n\nShenzhen-based Engine AI released its PM01 model late last year for just 88,000 yuan ($12,175), while Unitree\u2019s G1, capable of executing a roundhouse kick, followed at 99,000 yuan ($13,697).\n\nAt an event last year, Musk estimated Tesla\u2019s Optimus to be priced between $20,000 to $30,000. Lowering prices for humanoids would mark a major step to their eventual commercialization and wider adoption.\n\nBeyond startups, established EV players like BYD and XPeng have also ventured into the humanoids space. Experts said years of cutthroat competition and a price war in China have honed their ability to scale production rapidly while driving cost down.\n\nSince the manufacturing complexity of humanoid robots shares similarities to those of electric vehicles, particularly in components like sensors and batteries, EV makers have an advantage in this space, according to Brady Helwig, associate director for economy at Special Competitive Studies Project, a US thinktank.\n\nEngineAI PM01 humanoid robot makes an appearance at the Guangming Culture and Art Center on February 19, 2025 in Shenzhen, China. VCG/Visual China Group/Getty Images\n\nLate last year, XPeng unveiled its humanoid robot, Iron, with plans for mass production by the end of 2025. Around the same time, BYD launched a recruitment drive to develop its own version, having invested in other domestic humanoids makers.\n\nAs the country\u2019s demographic crisis worsens, the Chinese leadership sees humanoid robots as a potential solution to offset the shrinking working force, Helwig said. China\u2019s population has shrunk for three consecutive years.\n\n\u201cIf humanoid robots were able to be scaled and deployed widely across the economy, this is the kind of wild card that could really help alleviate that gap,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "This is a weird time in the automotive world, in many ways. The type of car one chooses has always telegraphed a lot about the person who buy it. But I think the implications and intensity of this concept are more intense now than ever, and an awful lot of that is thanks to Tesla. Over the past couple years or so, Tesla\u2019s identity has transformed from the car of choice for eco-minded futurist-types to\u2026something else. We all probably know the reasons why this is happening, but it\u2019s actually now having some real effect on Tesla\u2019s sales, which have been plummeting in markets all over the world.\n\nSo what is Tesla to do here? Should they just accept the alienation of what was once a core part of their market? And what about consumers who may actually want the sorts of cars Tesla offers, but just doesn\u2019t want to deal with all of the considerable baggage that comes with them, either because those beliefs differ to drastically from their own, or even just that lots of people just have no interest in a car that makes any sort of political statement. They just want a car.\n\nSo, what\u2019s to be done here? Well, all of you are in luck, because I\u2019m in the business of turning on your headlights instead of cursing the darkness. There is a solution here \u2013 one that automakers have known about for the better part of a century! A little bit of carmaker magic usually called badge engineering.\n\n(Image: Jason Torchinsky)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBadge engineering is process where one car gets re-badged and sold as another car. It\u2019s the same car, but it wears the make and model name of something else, something new. Sometimes this process can get wildly involved \u2013 for example, the Hillman Avenger was sold under 13 different names, including models from Plymouth and Volkswagen and Sunbeam, for example. The Suzuki Swift had at least 15 different names!\n\n(Image: Jason Torchinsky)\n\nSometimes the cars are just different brands under the same corporate umbrella, like Toyotas and Lexuses or any of the GM family (Chevy, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Cadillac, etc) but sometimes they can be re-badged under company names that are not affiliated in any other way, like how Mercedes-Benzes became Peugeots or Land Rovers became Hondas:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n(Image: Jason Torchinsky)\n\nAnd, somehow, all of this re-badging seemed to make money, at least to some degree, for both companies involved. That part I\u2019m a lot more fuzzy on, but they wouldn\u2019t keep doing it if it didn\u2019t make some money, right?\n\nI tell you all this just in case you\u2019re, improbably, unaware of the power of badge engineering. And I think at this moment, badge engineering has the potential to save two companies: Tesla and Stellantis.\n\nYes, Stellantis! So far, Stellantis really doesn\u2019t have much of a mainstream electric car lineup at all; they\u2019re working on things, and they have some, like the Dodge Charger Daytona and the Fiat 500e and Jeep Wagoneer S, and some more on the way, like the Jeep Recon, but there\u2019s nothing really established and mass-market just yet.\n\nTesla, though, has some of the best-selling mainstream EVs, like the Models 3 and Y. Those are perfectly fine EVs, with good range, acceleration, and features, but their name has become a liability. So what if those cars became Stellantis brands!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n(Image: Dodge)\n\nConsider this: What if the Model Y were re-badged as a re-born Dodge Neon? The Neon had personality and a distinctive, lovable look and appeal. Sure, it got diluted over the years and hasn\u2019t been around for a while, but the friendly, plucky Neon brand identity could be just what a re-badged Model Y needs!\n\n(Image: Jason Torchinsky)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI think this could work! The re-badging could be as basic as a new front fascia, maybe new taillights, and on-screen UX for the infotainment/instrument cluster display. There could be some de-contenting, like going to basic mechanical door handles instead of those complicated electric ones, and maybe options like Tesla\u2019s Full-Self Driving (FSD) wouldn\u2019t be offered.\n\nThe distinctive face is key here, really broadcasting the Neon identity, blinding people with the glow so they don\u2019t see the Tesla lurking beneath. Sure, car geeks like us will know, but mainstream car buyers \u2013 they don\u2019t care about this stuff. If it says Neon and has a big friendly face, it\u2019s a Neon.\n\nThat\u2019s my sorta-serious suggestion; there\u2019s more possibilities here, too, if we can get a hair more bonkers:\n\n(Image: Jason Torchinsky)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat about a new Plymouth Superbird? Bring back the old Plymouth name just for this car, give it the massive wing, and you\u2019re in business. With a Tesla Model S Plaid as the basis, this thing would haul plenty of ass to justify the name.\n\nOr, what about a luxury edition? Think Chrysler New Yorker!\n\n(Image: the Bishop)\n\nI have to thank The Bishop for this quick mockup, which would get the distinctive squared-off roofline of New Yorkers past via the same half-ass methods used before, sort of like how the 1980s New Yorkers used a boxy fiberglass cap inset into the rear window and covered the whole mess with a vinyl top:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOy, look at that mess! Picture something like that under the vinyl top of that former Model 3, only maybe a little better, if you\u2019re feeling generous. Tack on a chrome grille and opera lights and some opulent interior materials and boom, you have a terrific traditional-inspired compact premium EV sedan.\n\nI get these last two are a bit silly, and these are, of course, just quick, thrown-together Photoshops. But I think the basic idea has some merit; Tesla needs to sell cars, and so does Stellantis. Tesla has a tainted name right now to some who don\u2019t agree with his politics, and Stellantis just doesn\u2019t have the cars. Together, they could solve one another\u2019s seemingly intractable problems, and maybe everyone can win.\n\nOr at least not lose quite so hard. Isn\u2019t that what badge engineering is all about?",

Rush St., swelled into a group of at least 100 within an hour. The demonstrators filled the air with protest signs and chants like, \u201cFascists, KKK, Elon Musk \u2014 they\u2019re all the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are outraged and angry that the world\u2019s richest man, who happens to show sympathy for Nazi politics, is playing a central role in the U.S. government,\u201d said Joe Allen, who organized the Gold Coast protest.\n\nProtesters carry signs criticizing Elon Musk outside the Tesla dealership in the Gold Coast. Musk\u2019s support for far-right causes globally has come under scrutiny; on the day of Trump\u2019s second inauguration, Musk made a stiff-armed gesture that recalled a Nazi salute. Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times\n\nSince President Donald Trump appointed Musk to head the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Musk has moved to slash the size of the federal government.\n\nMusk\u2019s support for far-right causes globally has also come under scrutiny. On the day of Trump\u2019s second inauguration, Musk made a stiff-armed gesture that recalled a Nazi salute.\n\nAt the same time, Tesla\u2019s stock market value, sales and reputation have taken hits.\n\n\u201cIf Musk thinks he can do these things without there being a cost, I think our campaign over the last month has shown him otherwise,\u201d Allen said.\n\nTesla owners and dealers have reported vandalism and said they feel caught in the middle of the feud.\n\nProtester Jim Bloyd, a retired public health worker, says Musk\u2019s cuts to the federal government will affect vulnerable populations. Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times\n\nSaturday\u2019s demonstration included public health advocates, former federal workers and longtime activists.\n\nJim Bloyd, a retired public health worker, emphasized Musk\u2019s role in undermining government programs that support vulnerable populations.\n\n\u201cMusk and his ilk are targeting Social Security. They want to privatize Medicaid and Medicare, and they\u2019re attacking communities that are already vulnerable,\u201d Bloyd said.\n\nJonathan Bassett, who worked as a contract employee for the U.S. Department of Agriculture until recently, said he lost his job as part of federal cuts that he believes were influenced by Musk\u2019s pressure to shrink government agency staffing.\n\n\u201cElon took my job,\u201d Bassett said. \u201cMy contract was terminated because I was considered a \u2018non-essential\u2019 employee. But this is part of a larger effort to dismantle the federal government and make it weaker.\u201d\n\nJonathan Bassett, a former contract employee for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, holds a sign reading \u201cElon took my job.\u201d He said he lost his job as part of the federal government\u2019s restructuring under DOGE. Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times\n\nMany protesters also expressed frustration with Democratic leaders.\n\n\u201cThe response of the Democrats has been pathetic,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt\u2019s created a space for people to come out who normally don\u2019t see themselves protesting. We need stronger leadership, but instead, we see inaction.\u201d\n\nBassett echoed these concerns, criticizing prominent Democrats for failing to push back against Musk\u2019s influence and government cuts.\n\n\u201cThey need to be doing more,\u201d Bassett said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], Bernie Sanders and a few others stepping up, but people like Chuck Schumer and even our own senator, Dick Durbin, have been disappointments. They\u2019re not meeting the moment.\u201d\n\nThe demonstration at a Gold Coast Tesla dealership on Saturday was part of a movement of \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d protests happening across the country. Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times\n\nThe protest reflected a growing movement to hold Musk accountable for his political activities, and activists are urging consumers to reconsider buying Teslas.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t buy Tesla, and hit him where it hurts,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nAllen said he has protested outside the Tesla dealership every weekend for the last month, and participation has grown every week.\n\nAllen said the group is participating in an international day of action on March 29 when Tesla Takedown activists hope to stage actions outside at least 500 Tesla locations across the world.\n\n\u201cPeople are energized to come out and protest Musk\u2019s role in these really dangerous decisions of the Trump administration,\u201d Allen said.\n\nTesla Takedown protests were also planned Saturday in Northbrook and Lisle, where hundreds protested outside the west suburban dealership Tuesday evening.",

            "content": "Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) is stagnating with no real improvement in miles between disengagement in months just as CEO Elon Musk said it is going exponential.\n\nThe stagnation of FSD could be explained by Tesla making a pivot and focusing on its geo-fenced ride-hailing service instead of its long-standing promises.\n\nSince 2016, Tesla has claimed that all it vehicles produced onward have all the hardware capable of self-driving at a level enabling a robotaxi service and that a software update would eventually enable it.\n\nFor the past six years, CEO Elon Musk has claimed that Tesla would achieve that goal by the end of the year, and he has been wrong every time.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nLately, Musk has been focused on hyping Tesla\u2019s latest Supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) updates.\n\nFSD is technically a level 2 advanced driver assist system (ADAS). It requires driver supervision at all times, and Tesla takes no responsibility in the case of a crash.\n\nMiles between critical disengagement is the primary metric used to track progress with each FSD update. Tesla and Musk have both used the metric in the past.\n\nIn January, we reported on Musk sharing a crowdsourced FSD dataset, claiming that it showed Tesla had now reached \u201cexponential improvement\u201d with FSD v13. We noted that this was both false since exponential improvement would require an extra data point that he didn\u2019t have and misleading since he focused only on highway miles between disengagement and Tesla had just introduced its long-used city driving neural network stack to highway driving.\n\nFSD v13 has now been out for 3 months, and it received several point updates, but the same data praised by Musk a few months ago shows that it is stagnating \u2013 not going exponential:\n\nMusk had previously claimed that v13 would enable \u201ca 5 to 6x increase in miles between disengagement compared to v12.5.\u201d\n\nThe data now shows that v13 barely brought a 2x improvement, going from ~200 miles to ~400 miles.\n\nAfter over 33,000 miles reported through all versions of FSD v13, the datasets now point to 495 miles between critical disengagement on average:\n\nAshok Elluswamy, the head of FSD at Tesla, has previously stated that for Tesla to enable unsupervised self-driving, Tesla needs to achieve the average in miles per critical intervention \u201cequivalent of human miles between collision,\u201d which stands at 700,000 miles, according to NHTSA.\n\nMusk is moving the goal post on Tesla Full Self-Driving\n\nThe current stagnation is disappointing for Tesla fans and surprising even to critics. Even those who don\u2019t believe Musk\u2019s ambitious timelines for Tesla to achieve self-driving believed that the system would improve faster.\n\nIt needs to improve faster if Tesla wants to go from ~500 miles between critical disengagement to 700,000 miles \u2013 the company\u2019s own goal of being safer than humans.\n\nWe believe that a possible reason for the current stagnation is that Tesla is focusing on a new strategy for self-driving.\n\nLast month, we posted a report called \u2018Elon Musk is about to masterfully move the goalpost on Tesla Full Self-Driving\u2018. After years of being wrong about Tesla achieving unsupervised self-driving, Musk badly needs a win on that front.\n\nThat\u2019s why instead of delivering on its long-stated promise of consumer vehicles achieving unsupervised self-driving, Tesla is shifting to releasing a ride-hailing service in a geo-fenced area around Austin, Texas in June.\n\nUsing an internal fleet of vehicles helped by teleoperation in a limited area is a complete change of plan for Tesla self-driving, and it is a service similar to what Waymo has been offering for years. Musk has even thrown colder water on Waymo\u2019s approach, calling it \u201ctoo difficult to scale.\u201d\n\nWe believe that part of the reason why Tesla FSD is stagnating is that the automaker is currently using its engineering power as well as its training compute toward this new program rather than its broader FSD product.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nYou know my take on FSD. I think that if it was developed in a vacuum without Tesla selling it as \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and Musk promising that it would be unsupervised by the end of every year for the last 6 years, I think it would simply be praised as the best level 2 ADAS system out there.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not the case.\n\nInstead, Musk has tainted the product with lies and false promises and we are not even getting into HW3 in this post.\n\nI think Musk has been really successful at misleading people with FSD, and now he thinks that this pivot to a Waymo-style product will enable Tesla to claim a win on self-driving without most people realizing that it\u2019s actually a loss for millions of Tesla owners.\n\nHe might be able to pull it through, but we are going to keep reporting it for what it is on Electrek.",

The fact that he called Social Security a Ponzi scheme, you'd only call it something like that if you're planning to get rid of it, which would put I don't know how many seniors into poverty as well as disabled people,\" said Kennedy of Hazel Park.\n\nProtesters held bullhorns and signs including those with the word \"DOGE\" with a slash through it, \"Deport Musk\" and \"Stop Trump and Musk. This is Treason.\"\n\nThis is Kennedy's third time organizing a protest.\n\n\"Everything he says brings more people out to protest against him. What he says about unions, trans people, government employees,\" Kennedy said. \"I'd like to see him fired and these cuts reversed. I think that's the end goal and how we're doing that is we're aiming to damage his wallet ... so if that means people boycotting Tesla, divesting themselves of stock, if that's the only way we can fight back peacefully ... that's what we're doing.\"\n\nTesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election but has since shed all those gains.\n\nThe billionaire's recent involvement in the federal government alongside Trump, including executive orders, mass firings of federal employees and programs like Social Security have left many Americans, even those who once supported Trump, discontent. A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from Social Security systems that hold personal data on millions of Americans, calling their work there a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d\n\nMusk oversees the president\u2019s cost-cutting and downsizing operation, or DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, and has targeted the federal workforce of key government agencies in an effort to downsize the federal government and tackle spending. It has allowed the billionaire, who also owns the social media platform X, access to potentially sensitive data while he and the president have suggested slashes to Medicare programs and personnel.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to make the spending reductions because the federal government faces an annual estimated deficit of $1.9 trillion and an accumulated debt of about $36 trillion.\n\nAndi Costantini of Ferndale, 60, said she was scared that democracy would be destroyed so she protested Sunday. With her bullhorn, she called on youth to help the cause and to respond to a man who stopped on Big Beaver Road and called the crowd \"idiots.\"\n\n\"I want to see Trump impeached and Elon taken out of our government,\" Costantini said. \"I want to see their whole administration taken down. Project 2025, we knew it was coming ... They're getting rid of the Department of Education... it's scary.\"\n\nMany drivers honked and raised their fists in support of the protesters while some yelled \"Go Trump.\"\n\n\u25ba RELATED STORY: Man drives car into protesters outside a Tesla dealership, nobody hurt, sheriff says\n\nKate Goodin, 68, held a sign at traffic that said \"Delete Musk\" alongside many others. She said she was angry that Musk's influence on program and employee cuts comes without research and accountability to the public.\n\n\"We're only beginning to sense the hurt that's going to come. Things like this have two-fold purpose. One: they send to Washington a message that we're not happy and also it raises consciousness of the population that we interact with,\" Goodin said.\n\n\"I just don't believe that when people were voting (for) Trump, hoping the price of eggs would go down, they expected to see cuts to the National Forest Service, Social Security, the IRS. Irresponsible cuts. I don't fault Trump voters, I think they were duped like the rest of us,\" she said.\n\nRegina Cable of Troy, 71, said she wanted to show community members that they should be doing something instead of watching the federal government shrink and workers fired. \"I feel better being out here doing something.\"\n\nThe retired teacher said she did not vote to eliminate the Department of Education or give anyone access to personal data, Cable said.\n\nPeople around the country also protesting Musk and DOGE cuts in recent weeks by selling their Tesla sedans and SUVs in large numbers, in some cases announcing they are ditching the EV brand on social media.\n\nAuto information website Edmunds.com reported that Tesla owners have been trading in their vehicles at record-high levels in March. And February sales of Teslas fell 10% compared to the prior month, dragged down by declines of its Cybertruck, Model 3 and Model Y -- even as EV competitors such as BMW AG and Rivian Automotive Inc. saw their sales surge, Cox Automotive said.\n\nAttacks on property carrying the logo of Musk\u2019s car company have cropped up across the U.S. and overseas. No injuries have been reported, but Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. Prosecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \u201cNazi cars\u201d spray-painted on a building.\n\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston.\n\nSome of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.\n\nThe White House has thrown its weight behind Musk. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \u201cdomestic terror,\u201d and has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \u201cgoing to go through hell.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said she\u2019d opened an investigation \u201cto see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\u201d\n\nmjohnson@detroitnews.com\n\n@_myeshajohnson",

            "content": "Republicans need a rebrand on the environment. Tesla is the perfect vehicle. | Opinion If Republicans are going to tie themselves so closely to Elon Musk, why not become the party that leads the green energy revolution?\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Sen. Mark Kelly ditches his Tesla Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona says he didn't think owning a Tesla would become political, so he's getting rid of his.\n\nHistorically, the primary consumer of electric cars has been Democrats. In fact, Democrat-leaning voters were significantly more likely to purchase electric vehicles as recently as last year, and Republican politicians have historically been critical of the liberals' push for electric cars.\n\nThat all changed when Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined the American right in the culture war and cozied up to the second Trump administration. In deciding to delve into right-wing politics, Musk either miscalculated who Tesla\u2019s customer base was or didn\u2019t care about the short-term repercussions of left-wingers abandoning his vehicles.\n\nEither way, Tesla stocks have been in such a free fall that at least one major investor has demanded a new CEO.\n\nThis gives Musk and the Republican Party an opportunity, given how attached Musk is to President Donald Trump. By alienating his old liberal customer base, Musk may have a chance to expand into a new one. But Republican policymakers have work to do before that can happen.\n\nWill Republicans begin to embrace climate policy through EVs?\n\nThe potential for change on this issue goes deeper than just Tesla. The right has desperately needed a rebrand on the environment for years, and Tesla could be the perfect catalyst for their voters to come around on the issue.\n\nFor years, the attitude on climate change on the right ranged from outright denial to apathy. But in recent years, the Republican Party has become more open to policies geared toward clean energy. Even as Trump slashes regulations, a significant faction within the party is expressing support for clean energy tax credits.\n\nOpinion: Republican glee over Musk and DOGE is a smoke screen for failed budget policy\n\nThe climate initiatives of the left have become a punching bag for Republicans in the past, but recognizing the flaws in those policies could deliver wins for Republicans.\n\nDemocrats have allowed their own social justice platforms to interfere with coherent climate policy for years. They provide tax credits for electric vehicles but exempt manufacturers like Tesla for political reasons.\n\nSimilarly, Democrats have long been reluctant to embrace nuclear power, the only energy source that is both environmentally friendly and viable on a large scale. Republicans have highlighted this hypocrisy for years but are yet to incorporate a solidified counter to that into their platform.\n\nThere is room for Republican leaders to sell their constituents on green energy and vehicles. By contrasting the Democrats as insincere vessels for such policy, motivated by culture rather than actual green change, they can differentiate themselves on an issue extremely important to young Americans.\n\nMusk embracing the MAGA movement could be a catalyst for that to happen. The more Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz associate themselves with Tesla, the more the brand of top-of-the-line electric vehicles becomes intertwined in the GOP as a status symbol.\n\nOpinion: Why do I criticize Trump so much if I'm conservative? I expect better from GOP.\n\nMusk is causing waves throughout the GOP base in some places, and politicians should be wary of attaching any long-term policy goal to such a volatile figure.\n\nHopefully, these industries will find ways to market themselves to Republicans. Regardless, the GOP should embrace green energy in order to appeal to young Americans.\n\nYoung voters care about climate. Republicans should keep pursuing them.\n\nRoughly 85% of Americans ages 16-25 note climate as a top issue for them, and Republicans have historically underperformed on the issue.\n\nFor a long time, voters saw Republicans as diametrically opposed to climate action, but some groups show that is not the case. While organizations like the American Conservation Coalition have been around for years, putting together coherent conservative policy on global warming, the GOP has yet to run on climate issues.\n\nIf the Republican Party wants to continue expanding its influence over young voters, the next step is to embrace green policies that fit within the conservative framework. Embracing smart solutions to climate, such as nuclear energy, is the way to do that.\n\nIn order to convince this group of voters that conservatives can be trusted on the issue, they need to explain why the left is misguided on the matter of climate and how they will do things differently rather than simply opposing the actions of Democrats.\n\nIf they want to keep expanding their voter base into the youth voters of America, conservatives should embrace issues that are important to them. It seems that Republican leaders are intent on doing so, so they should look to climate policy as one of the next frontiers for the party.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science.",

Caught in the middle are millions of customers whose electric vehicles increasingly are viewed as political symbols.\n\nThe public displays of anger, stemming from Musk\u2019s outsize role in the administration, has led the president\u2019s backers to step up their response. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said this week that attacks on Tesla property were \u201cnothing short of domestic terrorism.\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urged Fox News viewers to buy Tesla, describing the stock as a bargain.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself recently made a show of purchasing one of the vehicles outside of the White House. Trump came out on Friday vowing to retaliate against people who vandalized Teslas and give them \u201c20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla.\u201d\n\nMusk, on his X platform, has repeatedly railed against \u201cviolence\u201d and said Thursday that Tesla has turned on a security feature on all vehicles at its showrooms. Late in the evening, he streamed a surprise all-hands meeting, where he said the company is \u201coverall good\u201d despite media coverage of burning vehicles making it feel like \u201cArmageddon.\u201d\n\nHe also urged employees to \u201chang on to your stock\u201d after it plunged by half in three months.\n\nFrom Brooklyn to Austin to the Bay Area, coordinated weekend protests at showrooms are attracting more people each week. The organizers, a decentralized group called Tesla Takedown, held a mobilization call Wednesday that included celebrities, politicians and academics and said it is targeting March 29 as the biggest day of action yet, with a goal to have same-day protests at 500 locations worldwide. The group has condemned destruction and stressed that demonstrations should be nonviolent.\n\nTaken together, the backlash has reached levels that are unprecedented for corporate America, said Mike Paul, chief executive officer of Reputation Doctor, a firm that advises brands on crises and reputation. Unlike typical consumer outcry that might show up through a boycott, every Tesla showroom, vehicle and charging station is a reminder of the brand and marks a place for potential protest.\n\n\u201cI believe we\u2019re going to see more Teslas on fire, I believe we\u2019re going to see a lot more protests at showrooms all over the world, and I think anyone that owns a Tesla who has it parked on the street is at risk,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going away anytime soon.\u201d\n\nTeslas Set On Fire At Service Center In Las Vegas\n\nInvestigators look over the scene at a Tesla collision center after it was vandalized and several vehicles were set on fire in Las Vegas on March 18.\n\nThat\u2019s affecting Tesla owners such as Avi Benhamo, who was standing on a Brooklyn street corner last week when he noticed a stranger approaching his Cybertruck. He watched as the man wrote a message into the dust coating his vehicle: \u201cElon Musk equals swastika.\u201d\n\nBenhamo said the incident highlighted an unsettling new dynamic \u2014 owning a Tesla now means becoming a political target.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for Elon Musk,\u201d Benhamo said. \u201cI like the car, and I am driving the car. You have your own agenda, go online. Say whatever you want online. Don\u2019t draw your swastika on my car.\u201d\n\nOther incidents have been more extreme. In Salem, Oregon, a man was charged after he allegedly threw Molotov cocktails at a Tesla showroom, according to a criminal complaint. In Loveland, Colorado, a woman faces federal charges after surveillance video allegedly captured her throwing gasoline-filled Smirnoff Ice bottles at parked Teslas at a showroom and spray-painting an expletive across its doors, federal prosecutors said.\n\nAuthorities in North Charleston, South Carolina, charged a man for damaging Tesla Superchargers with vandalism targeting Trump and writing \u201cLong Live Ukraine,\u201d before igniting beer bottles fashioned into firebombs.\n\nFires involving EVs with lithium-ion batteries can be especially difficult to extinguish, posing risks to bystanders and emergency responders.\n\nDefendants in those cases face penalties of as much as 20 years in prison, the Department of Justice said.\n\nThe acts have stretched north to Canada, where Trump\u2019s tariffs and expansionary rhetoric have sparked deep-seated anger among residents. Police in Hamilton, Ontario, said Thursday that more than 80 vehicles were damaged at a Tesla dealership, including scratches and punctured tires. This week, a car show in Vancouver removed Tesla as an exhibitor, citing safety concerns.\n\nSales Declines\n\nOwners such as Benhamo, who said he has no intention of giving up his truck, show how it\u2019s difficult to measure the effect of the anger on Tesla sales. Consumers are unlikely to switch a car they\u2019ve already purchased based on political leanings, while conservative buyers may be eager to support Musk.\n\nSome owners have taken to placing anti-Musk stickers on their vehicles rather than selling. Meanwhile, prices for used Teslas are cratering, meaning that any owners who want to get rid of their cars potentially will have to do so at big losses.\n\n\u201cUnlike switching smartphone brands or streaming services, replacing a car is a major financial decision, and even the most disillusioned Tesla owners will likely hold onto their vehicles out of necessity,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.\n\nStill, data from Edmunds found that this month marked the highest share on record of Teslas being traded in at dealerships toward purchases of new or used vehicles from other car brands. Last month, Tesla new-model shopping consideration on Edmunds dropped to 1.8%, the lowest since October 2022.\n\nTesla shares have plunged more than 50% from a December high. At the all-hands meeting Thursday evening, Musk said that despite \u201crocky moments\u201d employees should expect better times ahead. He made lofty predictions about the company\u2019s future, including that autonomous Tesla products would be global in five years.\n\nLast year marked the EV maker\u2019s first annual drop in vehicle deliveries in more than a decade. Sales and shipments have dropped precipitously in key markets including Europe and China. Market researcher Kelley Blue Book estimates the company sold about 43,650 vehicles in the US in February, among its lowest monthly totals of the past three years.\n\nIn research notes, a number of analysts have called out Musk\u2019s politics as a potential issue for the company. Analysts at Oppenheimer & Co. said this week that Tesla\u2019s stock price would partly be determined by the company\u2019s ability to replace some of its consumer base.\n\n\u201cWhile we see potential for a conservative customer base to emerge, we believe the company\u2019s product line is not a great match,\u201d the analysts wrote, noting Tesla\u2019s dealer and service infrastructure isn\u2019t well set up geographically for that demographic.\n\nA separate note from TD Cowen said increased EV adoption in conservative regions may bolster the company\u2019s sales. The shift could result in a net gain for Tesla of about 107,000 units over time, the analysts wrote.\n\nStephen Hahn of RepTrak, a reputation advisory firm, said his firm\u2019s measure of Tesla\u2019s reputation, based on a proprietary system of data points, has dropped 29 points from \u201cstrong\u201d in September 2021 to \u201cvulnerable\u201d in February 2025. If it falls further to \u201cpoor\u201d it could be considered a crisis that\u2019s hard to come back from, he said.\n\n\u201cIt would suggest there are some challenges ahead for Tesla, not just based on reputation, but how that translates to people making purchasing decisions and otherwise now looking at alternative EVs,\u201d Hahn said.\n\n\u2018All on Elon\u2019\n\nThe attention on the company is increasing from both sides of the political aisle. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate in the 2024 election, joked that he tracks Tesla\u2019s falling share price on an iPhone app for a \u201cboost\u201d and quipped about pulling off its logo from cars with dental floss. Musk fired back on social media, referencing Walz and Harris\u2019 election defeat.\n\nOn a podcast released Thursday, Vice President JD Vance called the vandalism terrorism and said the administration \u201cwon\u2019t stand for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to do everything we can,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we identify people who are committing crimes we are going to prosecute them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla Takedown is looking to amplify its movement even more. The group has about 115 events listed on its website for this upcoming weekend. About 70 are already registered for March 29.\n\nWednesday\u2019s group call attracted speakers including Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett and actors Alex Winter and John Cusack. Winter, best known for his role in Bill & Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure, pushed back on unsubstantiated comments that Musk and others have made about dark money funding the backlash.\n\n\u201cElon Musk only has himself to blame for tanking this company,\u201d Winter said. \u201cIt\u2019s all on Elon. There is no conspiracy. There is no well-funded cabal. It is just Elon Musk who has taken Tesla down, and meanwhile, the protests will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nA group called Planet Over Profit is taking part in a protest at a Tesla showroom in Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District this weekend, said Sophie Shepherd, one of the organizers. At the first event on March 8, attendees gathered with signs, chants and speeches against Musk.\n\n\u201cWe want to make him toxic,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people doing business with him, we don\u2019t want him to have the power he has in the federal government.\u201d\n\nBetween 300 and 350 people attended the first protest, Shepherd said. She expects at least the same this Saturday.\n\nTop photo: Investigators look over the scene at a Tesla collision center after it was vandalized and several vehicles were set on fire in Las Vegas on March 18.\n\nCopyright 2025 Bloomberg.",

Forbes estimates his net worth to be just under $200 billion.\n\n\u201cIf we can go ahead and continue to protest Tesla as strong as we possibly can and let the world know it\u2019s a toxic brand that fuels him, that\u2019s when you start putting pressure on someone.

Maya Eaglin / NBC News\n\nThe push against the electric car company appears to have had real consequences. The company\u2019s stock closed at $248.71 on Friday compared to its 52-week high of $488.54 in December, though it is still valued higher than it was for much of 2024.\n\nMusk spoke at a Tesla all-hands meeting this week and told his employees there are better days ahead. \u201cHang on to your stock,\u201d he urged his staff.\n\nAside from the peaceful protests across the country, at least 80 reported cases of vandalism or arson of Tesla vehicles have made headlines in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe FBI released a statement addressing the spike in crimes that have led to three people facing federal charges, and said the \u201ccriminal actions appear to have been conducted by lone offenders.\u201d\n\nStill, the agency is encouraging the public \u201cto exercise vigilance and to look out for suspicious activity\u201d near and around Tesla dealerships.\n\nSeveral Tesla owners have said they\u2019ve been targeted since Musk endorsed Donald Trump for president and have faced harassment, violence or threats from the public. Others have gotten rid of the vehicles.\n\nDr. Kumait Jaroje, who owns two Teslas, said Saturday that the \u201cpeak of the harassment\u201d was the death threats he has received toward him and his family.\n\nHe said someone sent him a comment that \u201csomebody will cut me off and pull up a gun and shoot me and my family.\u201d\n\nJaroje said he\u2019s even had to move his cars away from his home in Massachusetts because he feared for his family\u2019s safety.\n\n\u201cElon Musk is trying to do something good, I believe, saving the government, cutting down the waste, it\u2019s something good, you know,\u201d he said.\n\nWinsome Pendergrass speaks at a protest outside a Tesla showroom in New York on Saturday. Luigi W Morris\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything he\u2019s doing, you know, but at the end of the day, I bought a truck before. It\u2019s a personal choice,\u201d Jaroje said.\n\nWinsome Pendergrass, a speaker at the Saturday\u2019s protest with Planet Over Profit, said she believes all Americans are at risk of losing critical funding and resources thanks to Musk\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to be silent, we are not going to sit back and allow him to just run over us. We\u2019re going to stand up. We\u2019re going to fight,\u201d Pendergrass said.\n\n\u201cAmericans have done it before. \u2026 They have shut down the Montgomery Bus Company, so we can shut it down again, and we can shut down all this foolishness that they\u2019re going on with, and we can rebuild an America that is for everyone, America that is inclusive of all of us,\u201d she said.",

This moment was different, though. As you can see from the photo, the Cybertruck had a freakin' Nyan Cat wrap on it.\n\n\"I thought we left Nyan Cat back in 2011,\" I can hear you saying, and I thought so too. I'll even concede that maybe you thought Nyan Cat was still funny and cute in, like, 2016. We're in 2025 now, though, and this sh*t is just bleak. If you're still stuck in the land of epic memes, you need help. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised \u2014 Elon Musk is the king of using (and misusing) memes long after their popularity peak, so of course Cybertruck owners are as well. No one loves the tilted crying laughing emoji more than Tesla people.\n\nGetting hit by any Cybertruck would suck, especially if any of its stainless-steel body panels are falling off, but getting hit by a Cybertruck with Nyan Cat plastered on it?

There are now local organizers in about 28 states and Washington, DC, and the Tesla showrooms have drawn a growing number of demonstrators, who have carried signs like \u201cHonk if you hate Elon\u201d and \u201cSell your swasticar.\u201d\n\nTesla did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDOGE has not slowed down in its sweeping efforts to dismantle or overhaul federal agencies. On Monday, the department attempted to shut down the United States Institute of Peace, an independent nonprofit agency, and CNN reported on March 13 that DOGE had proposed cutting 20% of the staff at the Internal Revenue Service by May 15.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no walk of life that DOGE doesn\u2019t touch,\u201d Donovan told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s reflected in the diversity of people that come to these protests.\u201d\n\nA demonstration that began at about 11 a.m. ET outside a Tesla showroom in Rockville, Maryland, drew a crowd of over 400 people \u2014 roughly the same attendance as last week but a sharp uptick since the start of the campaign, according to demonstrators who spoke to CNN.\n\nOne of the demonstrators in Rockville was Karen Metchis, a 72-year-old former employee at the Environmental Protection Agency. Metchis told CNN the demonstration was much larger than the first one she attended in Rockville. She said it\u2019s important for the public to see a movement, even if there is no immediate impact on Musk and President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIt lets the public know that they\u2019re not alone in their feelings and hopefully it builds a mass movement where it\u2019s just not tenable for (the Trump\u2019s administration) to continue doing what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she said.\n\nMike Murray, who works in public relations, said it was his first time attending a demonstration at a Tesla showroom. He called the demonstrations an example of \u201cthe American spirit at work.\u201d\n\nGlenn Popson, a 54-year-old who works in the tech sector, said Tesla drivers selling their vehicles and Tesla shareholders selling their stock will help convince Musk that Americans\u2019 rights should be protected.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest person, owns about 411 million shares of Tesla, or a 13% stake in the company. He told employees Thursday in a meeting that was broadcast on his social media platform X to \u201chang on to your stock.\u201d Shares of Tesla (TSLA) peaked at $479.86 on December 17 but have since seen a 48% decline, closing at $248.71 on Friday.\n\nFrom March 1 to March 16, Tesla vehicles from model year 2017 or newer made up 1.4% of overall trade-ins \u2014 more than triple the rate (0.4%) for March 2024, according to data from automotive site Edmunds.\n\n\u201cIt shows that we\u2019re getting to him,\u201d said Popson.",

Experts say while the singling out of individual vehicles is unusual, activists focusing ire on a corporation has a long history in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one has been seriously hurt in the incidents, but they have heightened alarm from both law enforcement officials and experts in political extremism about where this is heading.\n\n\u201cWe have a continuum of activity, some of which we rightfully tolerate, such as boisterous and passionate protests,\u201d said Brian Levin, a professor emeritus at Cal State San Bernardino and an expert on extremism. \u201cBut now we\u2019re getting to another level of this kind of directed arson and violence, which, to be sure, has an intimidation effect.\u201d\n\nThe Tesla attacks have been scattered and do not appear to be coordinated. But the one thing they seem to have in common is disdain for Tesla owner Elon Musk and his efforts to fire federal workers and shrink the size of government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Las Vegas was hit with a spate of Tesla attacks, Spencer Evans, FBI special agent in charge of the Las Vegas bureau, issued a warning to would-be political vandals.\n\n\u201cSpecifically to those who might think that something like this is justifiable or potentially even admirable, we want to let you know it\u2019s a federal crime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will come after you, we will find you, and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law. I encourage anyone that\u2019s considering something like this to seriously reconsider.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time corporations or even car brands have been the target of political protest, and sometimes vandalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtests over Energy Transfer\u2019s construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota drew national attention and thousands of people to months-long encampments in 2016 and 2017. A jury this week awarded damages of more than $660 million to the pipeline company in its lawsuit against Greenpeace over the environmental organization\u2019s role in the protests.\n\nIn 2003, activists set fire to a Chevrolet dealership and destroyed or defaced dozens of Hummers and other sport utility vehicles, scrawling many with the word \u201cpolluter.\u201d Earth Liberation Front, an association of militant environmentalists, claimed responsibility for the attacks at the time, saying it had been intended to take the profit motive away from the companies responsible for pollution.\n\nThe same group was suspected to be involved in a fire that tore through a construction site in San Diego that same year, according to a Times report from 2003.\n\n\u201cOver the last decade ideologically motivated militants from across a spectrum, as well as some unstable and idiosyncratic types, have targeted their broadening attacks not only against traditional, governmental, communication and academic enterprises, but also increasingly against powerful corporate or defense industry targets who they regard as political co-conspirators of their adversaries,\u201d Levin said.\n\nThere have been growing concerns about political extremism in the United States in the Trump era, especially after rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to prevent Congress from certifying election results.\n\nOn his first day in office, President Trump granted sweeping pardons or commutations to more than 1,500 people convicted of Jan. 6 offenses. The pardons and now the efforts to protect Tesla have sent out a conflicting message about how the Trump administration will handle targeted political violence, Levin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIf the Trump administration is going to talk the talk, they need to walk the walk with respect to targeted violence. You can\u2019t just pick and choose which particular ideology you prefer when it comes to having a legal response to acts of targeted violence.\u201d\n\nAtty. Gen. Pam Bondi labeled the attacks on Tesla dealerships this week as \u201cnothing short of domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nBondi promised to impose severe consequences on those involved in the Tesla attacks, including \u201cthose operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Trump suggested Friday that Tesla attackers should be sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nWhile domestic terrorism is defined in federal law, it\u2019s not an official criminal statute that carries a specific penalty. Those arrested in the attacks have so far been charged under other federal statutes that can carry significant jail time.\n\nUnder federal statutes, conspiracy and malicious destruction counts each carry a mandatory minimum of five years in prison and a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison. A count of possession of an unregistered destructive device is punishable by up to 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, said applying terror charges to Tesla attacks is possible, but it\u2019s not how terrorism charges have been filed in the past.\n\n\u201cAmericans have not been charged with terrorism because it can be difficult to get inside a criminal defendant\u2019s head and prove why they committed the violent act. It\u2019s much easier if they are a member of or have pledged allegiance to a foreign terrorist organization,\u201d Rahmani said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just showrooms that are on alert. A website, Dogequest, allegedly published the personal information of Tesla owners across the United States, raising privacy and safety concerns for those who own the electric vehicles.

One of the organizers, who told the Telegram & Gazette his name was Jim but declined to give his last name, said he started the protest because he wanted to raise awareness to what he believes are harmful actions being taken by Musk, who is currently running the Department of Government Efficiency as part of President Donald Trump's administration.\n\n\"I was too late for Vietnam; I grew up my whole life just being kind of sheltered and I think now is my time,\" he said.\n\nMusk, who reportedly donated close to $300 million during the 2024 election, has been a central figure during the first few months of Trump's administration. The DOGE has been criticized for cutting funding and jobs throughout the federal government, which Musk, Trump and other Republicans have labeled as cost-cutting maneuvers to end government waste.\n\n\"There is no sitting back anymore; you can't just sit back and let things happen. If this doesn't stop, I totally believe there is going to be some kind of revolution,\" said Gary Hunter, a Worcester resident who joined the protest. \"I protested during the Vietnam War. I protested for civil rights and I think it feels even more serious now.\"\n\nMany of the signs held during the protest Saturday mocked Musk for his Nazi-related controversies, with signs reading things such as \"No excuse for the Nazi salute.\"\n\n\"Being in front of a Tesla charging station represents him and it shows how we feel about him,\" said Tracy Wheeler, a resident of Rutland who held up a sign reading, \"Bad DOGE, leave us elone!\"\n\n\"They are dismantling the Department of Education and I just wonder how my grandchildren are going to go to school?\" Caryn Stewart of Rutland said. \"I work for a state organization and I wonder what is going to happen to my job and what is going to happen to the people that I serve in my job?\"\n\nIn some instances, protesters have been accused of destroying Teslas, which organizers of the protest in Auburn said is not encouraged.\n\nDuring the protest Saturday afternoon, participants were focused on cars driving in and out of the Auburn Mall. Auburn police officers were on hand, parked in the lot near the charging stations. Many drivers honked in support of the protests, while a few others expressed criticism toward the protests.\n\n\"You guys are crazy, all of you,\" one cyclist said while riding by the protest.",

            "content": "Imagine completing your daily errands and returning to your car to find it vandalized. Now, imagine realizing that the person who carried out the attack followed you, and it might have been because of the type of car you drive.\n\nUnfortunately, for many Tesla owners, this is becoming a harsh reality. Tesla vehicles have become the target of increasing vandalism across the country, and recent incidents in Houston have drawn attention to the growing trend.\n\nIn at least nine states, including Texas, right here in Houston, there have been reported attacks on Teslas. The FBI has now issued a public warning, urging Tesla owners to remain vigilant. The rise in these incidents is partly attributed to the current political climate, with some individuals targeting Tesla owners due to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s involvement with cryptocurrency and his political views.\n\nA growing trend of targeted attacks\n\nTesla\u2019s advanced security features, including multiple cameras that record surrounding activity, have not stopped perpetrators from vandalizing these high-tech vehicles. Recently, an alarming discovery by the FBI revealed websites where the names and locations of Tesla owners are shared\u2014likely to facilitate these targeted attacks. In response, President Trump has condemned the attacks, labeling them as a form of domestic terrorism\n\nA local incident in Houston\n\nOne Houston woman shared her experience of having her Tesla vandalized in broad daylight. That attack was recorded by her Tesla\u2019s camera system. She was shopping at a local Whole Foods when she returned to find a long scratch on the side of her car, along with damage to the door handle. After reviewing footage from her Tesla\u2019s cameras, she was stunned to see a man following her into the parking lot and walking alongside her car, seemingly touching it. The footage clearly showed him tagging along from her drive on Highway 290 to 610.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the video, I was in shock,\u201d the Tesla owner said. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly astonishing. No matter what your political viewpoint is, damaging someone else\u2019s property is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe woman, who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons, admitted she no longer feels secure driving her Tesla. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to keep my identity hidden,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe anymore.\u201d\n\nPolitical motives behind the attacks\n\nFBI officials suggest that these attacks are linked to a response against Elon Musk\u2019s political influence. The FBI has now issued a warning, highlighting the need for Tesla owners to remain alert, especially in light of the fact that attacks against these vehicles have spiked significantly.\n\nNational concern and growing numbers\n\nAccording to data from Edmunds shared with Reuters, Tesla vehicles from 2017 and newer made up 1.4% of all vehicles traded in through mid-March, a number that is more than three times higher than it was at this time last year. This rise in Tesla ownership coincides with an uptick in these targeted attacks, raising concerns about the safety of car owners nationwide.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also weighed in on the issue, calling those responsible for the attacks \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d He pointed to other instances of destruction, comparing these attacks to acts of terrorism and highlighting the destruction of multiple vehicles in violent incidents.\n\nWhat\u2019s being done?\n\nThe FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) are both investigating the growing number of Tesla vandalism cases. While officials have confirmed that these incidents are not coordinated, they are stressing the importance of addressing this issue before it escalates further.\n\nHouston Police Department (HPD) is also investigating the specific case of the local Tesla vandalism. The victim is urging local authorities to act swiftly to prevent these incidents from becoming more widespread. \u201cNow is the time to nip it in the bud before it gets worse,\u201d the victim stated.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nAs the FBI\u2019s warning suggests, if you notice suspicious behavior near your Tesla, it\u2019s important to report it.\n\nHPD is currently investigating the incident in Houston, and if anyone recognizes the man in the video footage, they are encouraged to contact the Property and Financial Crimes Unit at 713-308-2500.",

On its website, stated goals from the organizers included \u201cSell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Elon Musk to run the Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE) to make widespread cuts to the federal government workforce and agencies.\n\nMuch of Musk\u2019s efforts so far have been challenged in courts, with some judges pausing or overturning DOGE\u2019s work. Still, supporters have applauded his attempts to bring down government spending.\n\nRegardless, those in Colorado Springs said they turned out to protest everything from the dismantling of the Department of Education to cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and fears that Social Security benefits could be taken away.\n\n\u201cWe're teachers. They're closing down the Department of Education,\u201d said Pueblo teachers Debie and Michael Champ, who attended Saturday\u2019s protest. \u201cThey're telling us two people here that are both over 65 that have done their whole life providing into Social Security. They're now telling us that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview on the Joe Rogen podcast, Musk did refer to Social Security as a Ponzi scheme, prompting fears he may soon target the benefits.\n\nErick Miller, a US Army veteran at the Tesla protest, said he fears his disability benefits and support from the VA could be on the chopping block.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to understand and appreciate that it's happening now after I've been in the military and after I've gotten out of the military, survived in the military, and suddenly all my benefits, particularly my care I received from the VA, is at risk,\u201d said Miller. \u201cIt's absurd that at this point in my life, I suddenly have to worry about receiving my benefit payments and my healthcare. I don't understand what's happened.\u201d\n\nThis protest comes as the Tesla brand has become a target nationwide as Tesla charging stations, dealerships, and the vehicles themselves have been vandalized, hit with graffiti, and in some cases, shot at or set on fire.\n\nOn Friday, the FBI issued a public alert warning about increased hostility towards the Tesla brand.\n\n\u201cThe FBI urges the public to exercise vigilance and to look out for suspicious activity in areas occupied by Tesla dealerships or Tesla-related entities,\u201d the bulletin said.\n\nIn Las Vegas, police increased their patrols and presence at a local dealership and Elon Musk\u2019s Boring Company tunnels in the city after several Tesla cars were set ablaze.\n\nIn Colorado Springs, police said they have not dedicated extra patrols for now. But CSPD noted they\u2019re actively monitoring the situation and encouraged officers to have situational awareness and patrol the area of the Springs Tesla dealership \u201ca bit more\u201d if they have time or \u201cSee fit.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d organizers directly addressed the violence seen nationwide.\n\n\u201cTesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement.

For reference, the base price to purchase a 2025 Polestar 3 is $73,400, excluding the $1,400 destination charge, the Free Press reported in September. That's for the long-range dual-motor version. The long-range single-motor version starts at $67,500.\n\nThe conquest bonus is available for eligible customers who own or lease a Tesla vehicle, but a trade-in is not required to get the deal, according to Mike Ofiara, a Polestar spokesman, who said in an email that \u201cwe have not done anything like this in the past with specific automakers.\u201d\n\nThe deal, which launched Feb. 21 and was extended beyond February based on the response, has been positive for Polestar, Ofiara said, noting that \u201ccustomer handovers\u201d (when a customer takes delivery of a Polestar) for the last week of February were 60% of the monthly total.\n\nMore: Protesters target Tesla, Musk at West Bloomfield store: 'Honk if you hate Nazis'\n\nIn addition, he said \u201cPolestar USA has seen significant increases in search and leads.\"\n\nOfiara didn\u2019t weigh in on a question about why Polestar was targeting Tesla now. The Free Press did reach out to Tesla for comment at a company email address that receives news media inquiries but had not received a response.\n\nEven with so much attention on Musk and recent stories about declining sales, however, it\u2019s not clear how vulnerable Tesla is to this kind of targeting. The automaker still has many loyal customers, and it remains a U.S.-based company, with significant vehicle manufacturing operations in California and Texas, in addition to its global footprint.\n\nMore: Polestar luxury EV brand opens 1st standalone dealership in metro Detroit\n\nPolestar began life as a Swedish racing team that tuned up Volvos. The Swedish brand acquired it and made it the company's performance line before Geely, the Chinese automaker that owns Volvo, decided to separate Polestar as a maker of performance EVs.\n\nIt builds vehicles in China, Europe and South Carolina, and is rapidly expanding its model line into new segments. The Ridgeville, S.C., plant, which also builds Volvos, plays a key role in the company's plans for U.S. growth, as does building its least expensive model, the EX30, in Europe to avoid tariffs targeting Chinese-built EVs.\n\nPolestar's a small brand, selling 44,851 vehicles globally last year, but its access to Volvo design and engineering, and electric motors and batteries developed by the group, helped it gain credibility quickly. It's working to develop a more independent profile.\n\nJoseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst for Edmunds, called the Tesla conquest incentive a \"smart play by a premium EV brand launching multiple models in the next few years.\"\n\nThe brand's starting price means the target demographic would be upscale Model S and X shoppers rather than Model 3 or Y buyers, he said.\n\n\"Tesla's aggressive price cuts over the last few years, while beneficial for new buyers, have negatively impacted trade-in values, leaving some owners with significant negative equity. The Polestar incentives could be viewed as a clever and compelling reason for underwater Tesla owners to consider a switch,\" Yoon said.\n\nContact Eric D. Lawrence: elawrence@freepress.com.

I\u2019m going to stop them \u2026 because they\u2019re harming a great American company,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you hurt an American company, especially a company like this that supplies so many jobs that others are unable to do.\u201d\n\nHouse DOGE Subcommittee Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., also said last week that she and her committee colleagues sent a letter to Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel asking for an investigation into the \u201corganized\u201d attacks against Musk, Tesla and the DOGE effort.\n\nTrump and his administration\u2019s backing of Musk comes as Tesla stock continues to dip significantly, dropping by 50% since December. JPMorgan analysts attribute the steep decline to the struggling EV market, a decrease in global sales, and branding issues stemming from Musk\u2019s political endeavors, including him being the unofficial leader of DOGE, Business Insider reported.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Tesla stock is around $233 per share, a roughly $127 drop from a month ago, according to NASDAQ.\n\nTesla dealerships vandalized across the country\n\nThe backlash against Musk and his efforts with DOGE has impacted Tesla dealerships across the country, including in Fort Lauderdale, where local police said 34 new Cybertrucks were damaged while in an area parking lot and tagged with the message \u201c(expletive) Elon,\u201d WPLG reported.\n\nLast month, federal authorities announced they were investigating vandalism at a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colorado. An individual or individuals smashed windows, painted Cybertruck windshields with large red X\u2019s and tried to ignite a fire. Local media also reported that someone painted \u201cNazi Cars\u201d on vehicles at the dealership, which said it was the third attack of its kind so far in 2025.\n\nThis week, Las Vegas police said Molotov cocktails and a gun were used to destroy Tesla cars during a \u201ctargeted attack\u201d at a Tesla Collision Center. Police said they believe the suspect shot at the vehicles at least three times in addition to using the improvised explosives to ignite the fires.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force has been tapped to aid the investigation, though it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to definitively classify the incident as a terrorist act, FBI Special Agent in Charge Spencer Evans said during a briefing. However, he did tell media members that the incident had \u201csome of the hallmarks\u201d of being classifiable as such.\n\n\u201cViolent acts like this are unacceptable, regardless of where they occur,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt\u2019s a federal crime. We will come after you. We will find you and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\nContributing: USA TODAY\u2019s Mary Walrath-Holdridge, Trevor Hughes & Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy",

            "content": "Despite the political firestorm over the potential demise of the federal clean vehicle credit and the looming threats of tariffs on car imports, American appetite for EVs isn\u2019t fading. Not yet, at least. The U.S. set a new record for February EV sales, even though month-over-month sales dipped by 5.9% and the market share for battery powered vehicles declined marginally to 7.7%.\n\nAccording to Cox Automotive, EV sales in the U.S. increased 10.5% in February year-over-year to 95,692 units. BMW and Rivian saw some of the biggest gains in terms of percentages, both selling over 4,000 units. BMW\u2019s EV sales grew 21% whereas Rivian witnessed 34% growth month-over-month. The top-five selling EVs in February were the Tesla Model Y, Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Honda Prologue and the Rivian R1S.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs\n\nTesla may still be on top, but its dominance is dwindling. Tesla sales were down 10% compared to the previous month, with the Model Y dropping 3.1%, Model 3 falling 17.5% and the Cybertruck plunging 32.5%. Note that the Model Y was down less than the overall EV market month-over-month, but the others fared far worse.\n\nThis comes as CEO Elon Musk has been on a rampage, dismantling key U.S. agencies under his newly formed Department of Government Efficiency and firing thousands of American workers.\n\nThe DOGE leader\u2019s alignment with far-right politics is also having a ripple effect on his own company, with Tesla sales plummeting worldwide. Protests against Musk have erupted across the world and Canada has even started locking Tesla out of key incentive programs.\n\nNow signs are emerging that the U.S. could be another market where Tesla sales fall.\n\nTesla is an EV behemoth and its decline could be troubling for the broader EV market, especially in the U.S., where it still accounts for 39.9% of EV sales, per Cox. But other automakers are seemingly absorbing Tesla\u2019s slack.\n\nPhoto by: Rivian\n\nAs InsideEVs reported last week, Ford EVs were up 15% year-over-year in February. American Honda sold nearly 3,000 Prologues and 1,500 Acura ZDXs last month. Hyundai and Kia\u2019s hot streak continued with the Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and EV9 witnessing year-over-year gains. And the Volkswagen ID.4 was the third best-selling EV in the U.S. in January.\n\nWe\u2019re not counting Tesla out just yet. The automaker has a busy year ahead for product launches and technology upgrades. Deliveries of the refreshed Model Y have started in the U.S., upgrades are reportedly coming to the Model S and Model X later this year and Robotaxi launch is due in June. Tesla also plans to install a new dry cathode battery in the Cybertruck in the coming months.\n\nNo one really expected this one-in-a-lifetime shift in mobility to be easy. It\u2019s full of roadblocks, twists and turns, but one thing seems increasingly clear: Electrification is here to stay, in one form or the other.\n\nDo you work at Tesla, or are a former employee and have a story to share?

There are a lot of Tesla owners out there regretting their purchases and looking to get out. But what model of car should they replace them with?\n\nNone!\n\nTake this frustrating experience and turn it into a potentially life-changing personal or family challenge. I know how nervous it feels to get rid of a car, but I also know the immense relief of no longer being responsible for such a big liability. I was terrified of selling my car because I was worried I was giving up some of my personal freedom, but since watching my car\u2019s new owner drive away I have never regretted it for even a moment. Instead, I found so much more of the world opened up to me as soon as I stopped defaulting to the car and the same old boring traffic jams. Even after having a kid (now in 1st grade), we have never once wished we owned a car. Committing to walking, biking and taking transit is far more empowering than my ball-and-chain of a car ever was.\n\n\u2014 Advertisement \u2014\n\n\n\nThe question you need to answer for yourself is: Do you actually, truly need a car? Perhaps it\u2019s time to find out if you should join the growing trend of car-free households in Seattle. Issue yourself a 30-day car-free challenge and stick with it. 30 days is roughly the amount of time it takes to develop and change long-term habits, such as unlearning the instinct to reach for the car keys any time you have an errand to run. That\u2019s why you see a lot of 30-day fitness or stop-smoking challenges. Ending a driving habit and quitting smoking have a lot in common, though as someone who has done both I can say that quitting cigarettes was much more difficult and much less fun. 30 days is also enough time to work out the kinks in your new car-free transportation patterns. Having a larger goal helps people work through those tough moments when you just want to give up and go back to what you\u2019re used to.\n\nThe benefits on the other side of those 30 days are huge. Life without a car is so much more interesting. Every time I end up in a car in Seattle, I am shocked by how ugly the city looks from the city\u2019s busy car-centric streets and highways. Do people who drive everywhere think this is what our city looks like? The Seattle you see if you walk or bike is flourishing with color and animated with interesting people and wildlife. I am still stumbling across stunning places in Seattle I\u2019ve never been before just by biking a slightly different route than usual. You could bike every day for the rest of your life and never see all the wonder that exists just within the city limits let alone across the region.\n\nBut biking is not always practical for every trip, at least on its own. That\u2019s where the region\u2019s excellent transit service comes in. Yes, light rail is great and all, but King County Metro does the real heavy lifting to keep the city and region moving. By the end of the 30-day challenge, you are going to love the bus (and have 100 opinions on how it could be better).\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll suggest some rules for your 30-day challenge and include some resources to make it easier. If you have dependents who rely on you for transportation, then you\u2019ll have some additional work to do (including talking this over with them and seeing if they want to commit to it with you). For the sake of simplicity, I have written this assuming you are the primary driver, and you mostly drive yourself. However, this is your challenge, so talk to the people you drive with and modify the details to fit into your lives. If you have any questions, post them in the comments below.\n\nThe 30 Car-Free Days Challenge\n\nInspired by Disability Rights Washington\u2019s A Week Without Driving challenge, we\u2019re taking things to the next level. Rather than leaving your car at home and choosing not to drive, you\u2019re gonna sell your car on day 1. You\u2019re doing this for real. Here are some suggested rules:\n\nSell your Tesla for cash, not trade-in\n\nTurn that money pit made by the Nazi-saluting, government-destroying, protester-threatening fascist\u2019s car company into a nice chunk of cash in your bank account. Due to so many other people selling their Teslas right now, you might get less than you\u2019d want. But if you stick with this challenge and turn it into a car-free lifestyle, you will more than make up for any losses. Don\u2019t forget to cancel your car insurance! That\u2019s like $230 a month right there. Go have a nice dinner.\n\nInvest a fraction of that cash into an everyday bicycle\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have a bicycle that is ready to carry stuff rain or shine, then it\u2019s time to head to a local bike shop. I highly recommend going to a brick-and-mortar shop since they will warranty both the bike and their service, and those warranties will likely cover the entire 30-day challenge. Their knowledgeable staff will also be able to tell you which models are up to your everyday tasks, including all-weather grocery shopping, and can make sure it is outfitted with the correct accessories like lights, fenders, a rack and bags. Also get a good lock since you\u2019ll want to feel comfortable locking your bike just about anywhere in town (I do). If you are planning on biking for most trips, an e-bike could be a good option. But if you want to combine biking and transit (especially useful if you regularly travel longer distances throughout the region), then you\u2019ll want a bike that can travel on the front of a bus. Again, your local bike shop employee should be able to help make sure your bike meets the bus requirements.\n\nAs an added bonus, a bike outfitted to haul groceries in the rain is also outfitted to go bike camping. So start daydreaming about your summer adventures.\n\nCycling Sojourner Washington by Ellee Thalheimer is out of print, but you can probably still track down a copy. I am also working on getting copies to sell in the Seattle Bike Blog shop, so stay tuned.\n\nInvest in quality rain gear\n\nYou do not need to be uncomfortable in the rain. Investing in a quality rain jacket, rain pants and waterproof gloves will make rainy weather biking much more comfortable, and you will make your money back through the savings you earn by biking. You may even learn to enjoy it. For specific rainy weather biking suggestions, see our previous posts on the topic.\n\nGet an ORCA card\n\nIf your workplace has a free or discount ORCA pass program, you definitely want to use it. If not, I recommend getting an ORCA card, then setting up autopay to reload your card\u2019s \u201ce-purse.\u201d Once you have your card, you can set that all up on the MyOrca.com website or the MyOrca mobile app. Then just use the card as though you have an unlimited pass. You will likely save money versus buying a pass, especially if you\u2019re biking and and walking for a lot of trips. If you use transit every day, then a pass is probably a better deal. People who make up to 200% of the federal poverty level, are 65+, are on Medicare, or receive certain other state benefits also quality for steeply discounted passes or fares.\n\nGet the Transit App\n\nThis is a story that\u2019s been on my to-write list for a while now: The Transit App is not just the best real-time transit-routing app, but it\u2019s also now the best bike routing app for general use in my opinion. And no, this post is not sponsored. Google Maps has officially blown their once-insurmountable lead as the go-to bike directions app by letting the feature fall into a slow downward spiral in which it has been getting worse as time goes on. Meanwhile, a recent Transit App update totally overhauled their system for calculating and displaying bike directions, and it is pretty good. Not only does it often do a better job of suggesting routes (though like all of the bike routing apps it is far from perfect), it also does a better job of displaying the comfort levels of different route segments so you can make a more informed decision. I was impressed that the default route it suggests from Suzzalo Library on UW campus to Lumen Field is to bike the longer but much more comfortable route to the Fremont Bridge even though it will add 6 minutes on top of the faster route options that require more climbing and more mixed-traffic riding. If I were to give a new bike rider directions, this is the route I would suggest. Neither Google nor Apple Maps even suggest the Fremont Bridge as an option, let alone make it the default. Especially for someone who is new to biking, its cautious approach is more likely to lead to good experiences. Sure, you can save time by white-knuckling down Eastlake Ave (or Rainier Ave, as Google loves to suggest), but you don\u2019t need an app to tell you that.\n\nThe primary downside to the Transit App bike directions versus Google or Apple Maps is that you can\u2019t pull up the satellite or street view images to investigate tricky-looking spots. Never fully trust any routing app. If something seems off, pull over and reassess.\n\nHowever, the real magic of the Transit App for this 30-day challenge is their Transit+ functionality. Make sure both \u201cpersonal bike\u201d and the bike share options are selected in the \u201ctwo wheels\u201d section of the settings page (also make sure all the transit agencies are selected under public transit and that Uber is turned off). Then when it calculates route options to your destination, it will also calculate bike + transit options. These multimodal options are nearly always the fastest. The app doesn\u2019t (yet) have a setting for taking your bike with you on transit (it assumes you lock it up at the station/bus stop), but even still you can see the power of combining biking and transit. These travel times often rival or even beat driving, especially when you add in the time it takes to park and the extra distance you have to walk from the parking spot to your destination.\n\nExperiment, explore and have fun\n\nLiving without a car is all about finding and mixing together solutions that work for you. Give yourself plenty of time at first in case some part of your journey doesn\u2019t go as you planned. Once you\u2019ve done it a couple times, you\u2019ll learn exactly how long things take. The nice thing about biking especially is that trip times are far more reliable than driving. Bike routes bypass most traffic jams, so you don\u2019t need to constantly worry about whether it is rush hour or whether you need to give yourself a 20-minute buffer in case there\u2019s a jam on I-5. Even getting stuck at a draw bridge doesn\u2019t take that long, and it\u2019s actually kind of whimsical on a bike because you can hop off and watch the boats go by.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to let go of trip time comparisons, especially for regional trips you are used to doing by car. Within Seattle, biking and transit can often be time competitive with driving. But the more of a trip that can be done via freeway, the wider the gap will grow between drive times and biking or transit. That\u2019s just the reality of living in a region with car-centric infrastructure and development patterns. However, time on transit is not wasted the same way time spent driving is. You can read, message friends, play video games, knit, watch TV shows, or any number of other things while on a bus or train. You\u2019re also still among community, which makes travel by transit more interesting, engaging and, sure, sometimes challenging. But it\u2019s real. Time on a bike also is not wasted. You get to see and experience so much more of your city than you ever could otherwise, and you\u2019re getting a lot of what I like to call \u201caccidental exercise.\u201d I have never been a gym person who can set aside time dedicated solely to exercising for the sake of exercising. When I\u2019m biking for transportation, I\u2019m getting daily exercise as a byproduct. Your doctor will love to hear you\u2019ve taken up cycling.\n\nEvery time I write something suggesting that more people can give up their cars, some people respond with knee-jerk defensive reactions and a laundry list of use cases for why they (or some other hypothetical person) need a car. We live in a region where a lot of the spaces were built without walking, biking or transit in mind, and it\u2019s true that some trips are genuinely impractical without a car. This post is not me saying all of you can and should sell your cars. Instead, I am challenging you to challenge yourself. Ask yourself whether you need or even want a car. Are you really getting enough value from your car to justify how much you are putting into it? Is it holding you back? Only you can answer these questions.\n\nEnjoy your adventure.",

            "content": "During a strange publicly livestreamed \u201call-hands\u201d meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said once again that he\u2019s working on a \u201cMaster Plan Part 4\u201d for the company, which is currently on part 3 of its master plan. But the problem is, even part 2 is not yet complete.\n\nTesla\u2019s \u201cmaster plans\u201d have guided the company for years, showing a general outline of what direction it plans to go.\n\nThe first installment of Tesla\u2019s master plan was posted in 2006, titled \u201cThe Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)\u201d (it has since been deleted from the website).\n\nThe blog post was a tongue in cheek list of Tesla\u2019s priorities for the future, with four steps laid out:\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nBuild sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that money to build an even more affordable car. While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options.\n\nTesla managed to finish all of those steps, by releasing the Roadster, Model S, and Model 3. It also purchased SolarCity and sells solar panel installations today, so, job completed. And completed quite well, considering Tesla was nothing in 2006 and hadn\u2019t sold a single car, and is now a global powerhouse changing the entire auto industry.\n\nTen years after that original blog post, the \u201cplan\u201d was updated in 2016 with \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux\u201d (which has also since been deleted from the website). That plan was summarized as:\n\nCreate stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning Enable your car to make money for you when you aren\u2019t using it\n\nThis plan has not been quite as successful as the original secret master plan.\n\nA progress check on master plan part 2\n\nFirst, Tesla\u2019s \u201csolar roof\u201d business has turned more into the company providing solar panel systems to independent installers. These are integrated well through software with Tesla\u2019s Powerwall system (and additional features like Virtual Power Plants, Storm Watch, and so on). But Tesla\u2019s solar roof project didn\u2019t quite turn out as planned \u2013 it\u2019s a single design instead of the four designs originally promised, and deployment of that design was\u2026 rocky, to say the least.\n\nSecond, Tesla has expanded its product line to cover two (or three) more segments: mid-size SUVs, with the Model Y; something kinda sorta approximating a truck, with the Cybertruck; and heavy trucking, with the Tesla Semi.\n\nThese are the \u201cmajor\u201d segments it said it would address in the blog post, so they get partial credit there \u2013 except that the Semi is still yet to reach any significant volume numbers, and Tesla has not released a promised \u201chigh passenger-density urban transport\u201d (the closest thing there is the recently-announced Robovan, which is absolutely nowhere near production).\n\nThird, Tesla has not successfully deployed self-driving capability that is 10X safer, even by its own numbers. Tesla\u2019s Autopilot Safety Report, which the company only occasionally releases, says that Autopilot is a bit more than 5X safer than a human \u2013 but this comes with the caveat that the system will typically spend more time activated in situations where it\u2019s more capable, and drivers will choose to take over when they think the system isn\u2019t going to be able to do something.\n\nTesla doesn\u2019t publicize data on how much safer FSD is than human drivers, rather referring to \u201cmiles between critical disengagement\u201d and other moving goalposts.\n\nSo those are three steps which haven\u2019t really gotten finished, but, we can perhaps give some credit for movement in the direction of each of them.\n\nThe fourth step, however, has simply not happened. This referred to an idea which at the time was called \u201cTesla Network,\u201d which was supposed to be a ride-hailing app that Tesla owners could send their cars out to make money with \u2013 and the source of Musk\u2019s \u201cappreciating asset\u201d comments.\n\nNot only has that not happened, but even autonomy has not happened. Tesla FSD is still level 2, and while it claims it will have level 4 capable vehicles this year in Austin, we\u2019ve yet to see that.\n\nSo, partial credit for master plan part 2, but we\u2019re still in progress.\n\nPart 3 goes in another direction, is huge in scope\n\nAfter that, Tesla released Master Plan Part 3 in 2023, an entirely different sort of document than the last two. Instead of just being a snarky blog post, this was a 40-page white paper with calculations showing that the world could transition to renewable energy and solve climate change with the resources and technology available to us today.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting read, and despite the weird analogues to Musk\u2019s personal beliefs about population growth, the calculations, while optimistic and self-serving for an EV/sustainable tech company, do make sense. It lays out the case about how to transition the entire world to sustainability, and I think it does so pretty persuasively. I\u2019ve recommended it to many as a way to lay out the potential green transition.\n\n\u2026But, clearly, that has not happened yet either.\n\nMusk drops hints at Tesla Master Plan 4\n\nThen, with two plans still in progress, and only a bit more than a year after unveiling the third part, Musk announced last June that he is \u201cworking on Tesla Master Plan 4.\u201d\n\nNine months later, we\u2019ve yet to hear more details about that idea, but today during his presentation, he did refer back to it again.\n\nToday, he was asked a question by one of the\u2026 uh\u2026 employees? assembled for his\u2026 uh\u2026 all-hands meeting/stock pumping livestream?, and the question went thusly (the question was hard to hear, so here\u2019s the meat of it):\n\n\u201cWhat phase of the plan are we in and how long will it go?\u201d\n\nTo which Musk responded:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at phase 3 of the master plan, since master plan 1 and 2 have been completed. Now, master plan part 3 is a very long master plan, because it\u2019s basically making all energy on earth sustainable. And I actually need to supplement it with the, sort of, \u2018abundance for all.\u2019 Maybe thats master plan 4. I\u2019ve kinda described master plan 4 essentially. Which is autonomous cars, autonomous humanoid robots, combine that with solar and battery storage, and I think the future\u2019s gonna be incredible.\u201d\n\nSo, we now have an idea of what Musk thinks master plan part 4 will be, at least, which is similar to what Electrek\u2019s Fred Lambert predicted it would be back in June: robots and self-driving.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nBut what about them? We know this is what Musk has been talking about recently, and a lot of those ideas haven\u2019t really turned out \u2013 at least not yet.\n\nFirst of all, we already know about the solar and battery storage, and the autonomous cars. Those were in previous parts of the master plan, and Musk has been promising them next year for ten years, so there\u2019s nothing new there.\n\nIn particular, the autonomous car reaches all the way back to part 2, initiated in 2016, and is still incomplete \u2013 despite Musk\u2019s incorrect statement today saying that it has been completed. This either suggests he doesn\u2019t know what is going on with his company, or he\u2019s lying. Neither is a great option.\n\nAnd robots, the only new portion of the proposed master plan part 4, are definitely not quite what they\u2019re cracked up to be \u2013 yet, at least. But that\u2019s the point of a master plan, to start heading in that direction, not to already be there \u2013 so, fair enough.\n\nBut are Musk\u2019s predictions about robotics realistic?\n\nMusk has also stated that humanoid robots will be worth $20-30 trillion to Tesla\u2019s market cap, because everyone in the world will have two personal robots. This seems unlikely on its face, but especially so when Musk says that AGI \u2013 Artificial General Intelligence, where a single computer is capable of accomplishing all the same tasks as a human \u2013 is coming this year.\n\nBeyond AGI, Musk has claimed that Tesla will change the world in several other ways this year, but thats quite a packed release schedule given Tesla\u2019s recent history (and its leadership\u2019s current distractions and anti-sustainability actions). Musk is known for overpromising, and this feels like another example of such.\n\nThe idea that Tesla, a car company, will somehow be the first in the world to accomplish AGI, scaling humanoid robots to the point where everyone in the world can have two, alongside everything else, and on such a short timeline, seems unlikely.\n\nIt seems perhaps a little more likely that this meeting, and a potential part 4 of the plan, are both an attempt to reframe the current conversation about Tesla, which is quite negative as sales drop drastically amid Musk\u2019s meddling in anti-sustainability and white supremacist politics.\n\nCharge your electric vehicle at home using rooftop solar panels.

Not yet, at least. The U.S. set a new record for February EV sales, even though month-over-month sales dipped by 5.9% and the market share for battery powered vehicles declined marginally to 7.7%.\n\nAccording to Cox Automotive, EV sales in the U.S. increased 10.5% in February year-over-year to 95,692 units. BMW and Rivian saw some of the biggest gains in terms of percentages, both selling over 4,000 units. BMW\u2019s EV sales grew 21% whereas Rivian witnessed 34% growth month-over-month. The top-five selling EVs in February were the Tesla Model Y, Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Honda Prologue and the Rivian R1S.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs\n\nTesla may still be on top, but its dominance is dwindling. Tesla sales were down 10% compared to the previous month, with the Model Y dropping 3.1%, Model 3 falling 17.5% and the Cybertruck plunging 32.5%. Note that the Model Y was down less than the overall EV market month-over-month, but the others fared far worse.\n\nThis comes as CEO Elon Musk has been on a rampage, dismantling key U.S. agencies under his newly formed Department of Government Efficiency and firing thousands of American workers.\n\nThe DOGE leader\u2019s alignment with far-right politics is also having a ripple effect on his own company, with Tesla sales plummeting worldwide. Protests against Musk have erupted across the world and Canada has even started locking Tesla out of key incentive programs.\n\nNow signs are emerging that the U.S. could be another market where Tesla sales fall.\n\nTesla is an EV behemoth and its decline could be troubling for the broader EV market, especially in the U.S., where it still accounts for 39.9% of EV sales, per Cox. But other automakers are seemingly absorbing Tesla\u2019s slack.\n\nPhoto by: Rivian\n\nAs InsideEVs reported last week, Ford EVs were up 15% year-over-year in February. American Honda sold nearly 3,000 Prologues and 1,500 Acura ZDXs last month. Hyundai and Kia\u2019s hot streak continued with the Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and EV9 witnessing year-over-year gains. And the Volkswagen ID.4 was the third best-selling EV in the U.S. in January.\n\nWe\u2019re not counting Tesla out just yet. The automaker has a busy year ahead for product launches and technology upgrades. Deliveries of the refreshed Model Y have started in the U.S., upgrades are reportedly coming to the Model S and Model X later this year and Robotaxi launch is due in June. Tesla also plans to install a new dry cathode battery in the Cybertruck in the coming months.\n\nNo one really expected this one-in-a-lifetime shift in mobility to be easy. It\u2019s full of roadblocks, twists and turns, but one thing seems increasingly clear: Electrification is here to stay, in one form or the other.\n\nDo you work at Tesla, or are a former employee and have a story to share?

            "content": "Since late January 2025, a series of attacks have targeted Tesla facilities and vehicles across the United States, prompting federal investigations into possible domestic terrorism.\n\nIn Loveland, Colorado, a Tesla dealership was targeted in a series of five attacks with graffiti and Molotov cocktails throughout January, February, and March. Two suspects have been arrested for the attacks. On January 20 and February 19, an individual attacked a Tesla dealership in Salem, Oregon, with Molotov cocktails and gunfire. On March 3, seven Tesla charging stations were set on fire at a shopping center outside Boston. On March 6 and 13, a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Oregon, was targeted with gunfire, causing damage to vehicles and the building. On March 7 in North Charleston, South Carolina, a suspect threw Molotov cocktails at a Tesla charging station, accidentally setting himself on fire before being arrested. On March 9, four Cybertrucks were burned in a parking lot in Seattle, Washington. On March 18, two separate incidents occurred. In Las Vegas, a Tesla service center was damaged with gunfire and set ablaze with Molotov cocktails and in Kansas City, Missouri, two Tesla Cybertrucks burned at a Tesla dealership.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), are investigating these incidents, increasing security around Tesla facilities, and working to determine whether these attacks are coordinated. Attorney General Pam Bondi condemned the attacks as domestic terrorism and vowed to prosecute those responsible. The Department of Justice has announced charges against multiple suspects. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have both criticized the attacks as domestic terrorism and suggested that larger forces are at work coordinating and funding the attacks.\n\nQ1: What are the challenges of defining domestic terrorism?\n\nA1: The recent attacks on Tesla have brought renewed attention to a long-standing debate among policymakers, scholars, and law enforcement over what qualifies as terrorism. Some argue for a broader definition of terrorism, contending that any ideologically motivated violence should be classified as terrorism if it seeks to further political, social, religious, or other ideological goals. The FBI reflects this perspective, defining domestic terrorism as \u201cviolent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\u201d By this definition, several of the Tesla attacks could be considered domestic terrorism.\n\nOthers have argued that terrorism should be defined more narrowly to exclude attacks that do not direct violence toward individuals. Under this view, incidents where perpetrators do not target people\u2014such as some acts of economic sabotage or property destruction\u2014may not meet the threshold for terrorism. The recent attacks on Tesla facilities and vehicles in the United States appear to have been carried out in a manner that deliberately minimized the likelihood of human casualties. For instance, all of the violent incidents at dealerships have occurred outside of business hours when facilities were almost always unoccupied by workers and shoppers. None of the attacks have targeted occupied vehicles and most have used incendiary devices, which are far less efficient at causing casualties compared to firearms. These patterns suggest that while the attackers intended to damage property and convey their opposition to Tesla and Elon Musk, they took measures to avoid causing physical harm to people.\n\nUnlike international terrorism charges, there is no stand-alone federal charge for \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d in the United States. Instead, prosecutors rely on existing criminal statutes such as arson, destruction of property, and weapons charges to prosecute those responsible. In some cases, authorities may apply terrorism sentencing enhancements if they can demonstrate that the crimes were intended to intimidate a civilian population or influence government policy. Evidence of ideological motives\u2014such as a manifesto, group affiliation, or explicit political statements\u2014would bolster prosecutors\u2019 ability to pursue enhancements in the Tesla cases. Arson and vandalism cases without casualties have not consistently received such enhancements in the past. However, given that President Trump and Attorney General Bondi have framed these attacks as domestic terrorism, there may be political pressure to pursue such enhancements.\n\nQ2: Who is committing the Tesla attacks and why?\n\nA2: Recent attacks on Tesla in the United States have been linked to individuals expressing opposition to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s political affiliations, particularly his role and actions in the Trump administration. During one of her arson attacks against a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colorado, Lucy Grace Nelson spray-painted \u201cNazi\u201d and \u201cFuck Musk\u201d on the property. In North Charleston, South Carolina, Daniel Clarke-Pounder spray-painted the phrases \u201cFuck Trump\u201d and \u201cLong Live Ukraine\u201d before he attempted to burn down a Tesla charging station using Molotov cocktails. In the Las Vegas attack, the unknown suspect spray-painted \u201cResist\u201d on the facility\u2019s doors before shooting multiple cars and setting them ablaze.\n\nAlthough in most cases suspects have not been publicly identified and their motivations remain uncertain, plausible explanations include political opposition to Elon Musk\u2019s actions as part of the Trump administration and broader dissatisfaction with the Trump administration\u2019s actions and policies. Although authorities are still investigating whether these attacks are connected, they collectively indicate a growing trend of politically motivated violence.\n\nQ3: What is the left-wing terrorist threat in the United States?\n\nA3: In recent years, a series of violent incidents linked to left-wing extremist ideologies have underscored the persistent but often overlooked threat of left-wing terrorism in the United States. According to CSIS data, left-wing domestic terrorism in recent years has been driven by a range of ideological motivations, including pro-choice extremism, anti-government extremism, and partisan extremism, with perpetrators often framing their actions as resistance to perceived institutional oppression or state violence. Left-wing terrorists have targeted government institutions, businesses, demonstrators, law enforcement, and transportation infrastructure using weapons like explosives and incendiaries, firearms, and vehicles.\n\nLeft-wing domestic terrorism in the United States has historically been characterized by relatively low lethality, with most incidents involving property destruction, arson, and sabotage rather than mass-casualty attacks. The recent attacks on Tesla most closely resemble past left-wing movements that used property destruction as a form of protest, such as environmental extremism in the 1990s and early 2000s and violent incidents during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nQ4: What are the greatest terrorist threats in the United States?\n\nA4: The greatest terrorist threat to the United States today comes from domestic extremists rather than foreign Salafi-jihadist organizations. While Salafi-jihadist ideology continues to inspire occasional mass-casualty attacks, such as the 2025 New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans, overall trends show a decline in jihadist plots in the United States since the Islamic State\u2019s territorial defeat in 2019. In contrast, according to CSIS data, white supremacist terrorism has become the deadliest and most active terrorist ideology in the United States in recent years, driven by racial and social grievances. Though white supremacist terrorists typically have limited operational capabilities, their grievances reflect mainstream cultural and political debates, which amplifies their impact by fueling societal polarization and political tensions.\n\nPartisan extremism represents the fastest growing domestic terrorist threat, with attacks targeting elected officials, political candidates, political party officials, and political workers from terrorists with opposing political views. According to CSIS data, the number of domestic terrorist attacks and plots against government targets motivated by partisan extremism in the past 5 years is nearly triple the number of such incidents in the previous 25 years combined. These extremists do not neatly align with mainstream political parties and often hold contradictory ideological beliefs. Like most U.S. terrorism, partisan attacks tend to be unsophisticated, carried out by individuals or small groups using readily available weapons. However, their focus on political leaders and government institutions means they pose a disproportionate threat to political stability.\n\nOverall, the United States has strong counterterrorism measures that effectively limit the threat of terrorism, including advanced intelligence capabilities, well-funded law enforcement agencies, and comprehensive counterterrorism laws. These efforts have successfully constrained both foreign terrorist organizations and domestic extremists, though not eliminated them entirely. Additionally, the United States benefits from structural factors that reduce the spread of terrorism, such as stable political institutions, low ethno-religious divisions, geographic distance from active conflict zones, border security measures, and widespread economic opportunity. Although terrorism remains a concern in the United States, its overall prevalence and impact is significantly mitigated by these factors.\n\nRiley McCabe is an associate fellow for the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.",

Are such acts domestic terrorism?\n\ntoggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nThe Department of Justice announced charges Thursday against three people it says are allegedly responsible for violent incidents targeting Elon Musk's Tesla cars, showrooms and charging stations across the country.\n\nThe Justice Department says three people \u2014 in Charleston, S.C., Loveland, Colo., and Salem, Ore. \u2014 are facing criminal charges that carry a minimum penalty of five years and up to 20 years in prison for a range of violent acts. They include using Molotov cocktails to set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations and possessing other \"incendiary devices\" and a suppressed AR-15 rifle, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\" Bondi said. \"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\"\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe strong statement came less than two days after Bondi promised that such attacks on Tesla also would be considered \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" A representative for the DOJ didn't immediately respond to NPR's additional questions on what the agency plans to do next on this issue.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump, for his part, has criticized the attacks and efforts to boycott Musk's companies and, last week, said he would purchase a Tesla vehicle to support his advisor.\n\nIn Las Vegas, police said Tuesday that five Teslas were damaged in an attack on a sales and service center. Police believe the suspect also shot a gun at the cars and spray-painted the word \"RESIST\" on the entrance. No one was injured, which was also the case in the Colorado, Oregon and South Carolina incidents.\n\nWhile no one has been injured or killed by these attacks, three professors and researchers of domestic terrorism and extremism tell NPR that they consider these cases to be acts of domestic terrorism.\n\n\"It's absolutely domestic terrorism. I know that may discomfort many people. But vandalism is a crime that if it's committed with a political motive, can certainly be defined as terrorism,\" says Bruce Hoffman, senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations. He is the co-author of the forthcoming book, God, Guns, and Sedition: Far-Right Terrorism in America.\n\nThese days, the concept of domestic terrorism has become increasingly complex, Hoffman says. While there are official definitions of domestic terrorism, there is no federal law on the matter. Here's a breakdown of what constitutes domestic terrorism, how the U.S. has approached this issue in the past, and why it's important despite the lack of a specific law.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhy are Tesla and Musk the target of vandalism?\n\nPublic anger toward Musk, a White House advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO and one of the world's richest men, is growing as he leads efforts to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency team. So far, this Trump administration entity has orchestrated the mass firings of thousands of government workers across multiple agencies in the past month.\n\nIn response, a grassroots protest has emerged in the form of the #TeslaTakedown movement. It is calling on Tesla drivers to sell their cars, dump company stock and join picket lines at Tesla showrooms.\n\ntoggle caption Manuel Valdes/AP\n\nBut in some cases \u2014 including one of the people included in Bondi's announcement Thursday \u2014 the protests have taken a more violent turn. Two people have been arrested and are now facing state and federal charges tied to two separate attacks on a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colo., which involved throwing Molotov cocktails at the cars and, in one instance, spray-painting expletive-ridden messages on the showroom's windows. No one was killed or injured during either incident.\n\n\n\nWho is facing charges?\n\nLucy Grace Nelson, Daniel Brendan Kurt Clarke-Pounder and Adam Matthew Lansky are facing charges tied to their alleged vandalism of Tesla cars and dealerships in Colorado, South Carolina and Oregon, respectively.\n\nNelson is facing two charges of possession of an unregistered firearm and the malicious (attempted) destruction of property. She could face up to 30 years in prison.\n\nCourt documents allege that Nelson traveled to a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colo., on multiple nights in January and February, allegedly lighting Molotov cocktails and throwing them in the dealership's parking lot and spraying graffiti on the building's windows and walls.\n\nNelson's attorney, Mary V. Butterton, declined to comment on her client's case.\n\nLansky is facing one charge of unlawful possession of an unregistered firearm. But an affidavit alleges he is also responsible for throwing Molotov cocktails and shooting a gun at Tesla vehicles and dealership facilities in Salem, Ore., on at least two separate occasions in January and February. Lansky's attorney, Mark Patrick Ahlemeyer, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCourt documents allege that witnesses say they saw Clarke-Pounder on March 7 using red spray paint to write obscenities against Trump and \"Long Live Ukraine\" on a Tesla charging station parking spot in North Charleston, S.C. Clarke-Pounder then allegedly started lighting bottles on fire and throwing them at the Tesla charging stations, according to court documents. He's facing one charge of arson affecting interstate commerce.\n\nPatrick Chisum, Clarke-Pounder's attorney, told NPR that Clarke-Pounder is feeling overwhelmed.\n\n\"He's being accused of something that's very, very serious. And I think that the realization of how serious it's being taken, especially with Attorney General Bondi's statements, is kind of becoming self-evident. Both he and his family are very, very concerned and very scared,\" Chisum said.\n\nHe added that his client \"is a troubled young man who's been suffering from multiple mental health issues.\"\n\n\n\nWhat falls under 'domestic terrorism'\n\nThe U.S. doesn't have a stand-alone federal domestic terrorism law. But at least 32 states and Washington, D.C., have their own state-level domestic terrorism laws. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as, \"Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\"\n\nPeople might look at vandalism at a Tesla dealership and question whether it's terrorism, says Hoffman.\n\nBut going back to the 1990s, the FBI, as the lead agency responsible for investigating terrorism in the United States, has investigated acts of vandalism and arson like those committed by eco-terrorism groups and treated them as domestic terrorism, he says.\n\nOne of the more famous cases of eco-terrorism was committed by the group known as The Family. The FBI says the group has been linked to more than 40 criminal acts between 1995 and 2001, including arson and vandalism, causing more than $45 million in damages. The group's most notorious act was the 1998 arson attack on a ski resort in Vail, Colo. \u2014 which caused around $26 million in damages.\n\n\"To me, regardless of one's opinions of Tesla cars, and its owner, this isn't new,\" Hoffman says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA key element in determining what is domestic terrorism is the intent of the perpetrator. That can include a desire to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence government policy, or affect government conduct, says Faiza Patel, senior director of the Brennan Center For Justice's Liberty and National Security Program.\n\nAnd the intent of the Tesla vandals falls under this umbrella, she says.\n\n\"The whole point ... is that [the vandals] are trying to influence government conduct. Everybody knows that Elon Musk is not only a federal employee, but is at the center of a lot of controversies about what the government is doing right now,\" Patel says.\n\nThe act would also have to fall under one of the laws listed in the federal code as a domestic terrorism offense. These include attacks that use certain types of weapons \u2014 for example, weapons of mass destruction \u2014 or include acts such as hostage-taking or involve special federal interest, such as attacks on federal officials.\n\nOther protesters have spray-painted swastikas and smashed windows of Tesla showrooms. But Patel says it's unlikely authorities will consider those cases of petty vandalism \u2014 or of someone keying a Tesla \u2014 to be domestic terrorism.\n\ntoggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nWhy the U.S. doesn't have a federal domestic terrorism law\n\nExtremism experts have long warned that domestic terrorism, mainly coming from far-right and white supremacy groups, posed a far greater threat than foreign terrorism. Still, despite sporadic efforts to do so, no federal domestic terrorism law has been created due to a lack of consensus.\n\nBecause of this, people involved in acts determined to be domestic terrorism are still just charged with offenses such as arson, murder, kidnapping and assault.\n\nThe perpetrators of the most famous incident of U.S. domestic terrorism, the Oklahoma City Bombing that killed 168 people, were never actually charged with domestic terrorism. Rather, Timothy McVeigh and his co-conspirator Terry L. Nichols were found guilty of several counts of murder and the use of a weapon of mass destruction or conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nAlthough there is no federal domestic terrorism law, prosecutors can point to a perpetrator's motive to classify a crime as terrorism during a trial and sentencing, which can affect a convicted person's punishment, says Laura Dugan, a professor of human security and professor of sociology at The Ohio State University. If a crime is determined to be an act of terrorism, a perpetrator could receive additional years on their sentence.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEven after the Oklahoma City bombing, there was never enough agreement in Congress to support a domestic terrorism law, Hoffman says. It was always considered a highly politicized issue, he says.\n\n\"When you walked into a room going back to the 1990s and you talked about domestic terrorism there was a half of the room that immediately thought far-left radicals. And there was another half of the room that immediately thought white supremacists or seditious-minded conspiracy [believers],\" Hoffman says.\n\nHoffman believes it's \"a huge problem\" that the U.S. has no domestic terrorism statute. But Patel, whose Brennan Center has long opposed such a law, says this would only be weaponized by the federal government and would make it too easy for \"an administration to label unpopular groups or political enemies as a domestic terrorist outfit.\"\n\n\"I don't see how it benefits anybody,\" she says. \"Given how polarized our current political environment is, it seems to me a particularly bad idea.\"",

Bondi said the damage to Tesla cars, dealerships and charging stations was \"domestic terrorism\". Arrests and charges against the three suspects were previously announced by prosecutors.

Waves of protests have targeted Tesla facilities in the U.S. and beyond. Other criminal acts of vandalism and arson have targeted Tesla stores, vehicles and charging stations across the U.S.\n\nIn addition, Tesla is facing increased competition from EV makers. In January, S&P Global Mobility found Tesla sales declined about 11% year over year in the U.S., while Ford , Chevrolet and Volkswagen bolstered their sales of EVs, picking up market share.\n\n\"Shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,\" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, wrote in an email. \"As Tesla brand loyalty and interest wavers, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.\"\n\nThe Tesla brand, more than that of any other automaker, is tightly tied to its CEO.

Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn\u2019t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.\n\nMore recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump\u2019s 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk attends the opening of the Tesla factory Berlin Brandenburg in Gruenheide, Germany, March 22, 2022.

Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \u201cdomestic terror,\u201d and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \u201cgoing to go through hell.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said she\u2019d opened an investigation \u201cto see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we\u2019re coming after you,\u201d Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network.

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nDriving has never been the problem. It\u2019s the other people out there, the minivan crowd on their phones, the hyper-caffeinated lane jockeys, and the oblivious left-laners, that turn a simple commute into a battlefield. In the twisted metal opera of modern motoring, the rise of self-driving technology has become less of a Silicon Valley fever dream and more of a grim necessity. And in this peculiar moment in time, it\u2019s Tesla, with all its controversies and cult-like aura, that keeps emerging as the reluctant protagonist in this techno-thriller.\n\nNavigating the Modern Road Battlefield\n\nNow, before the purists choke on their octane, let\u2019s talk about the cold truth: driving is dangerous. The U.S. Department of Transportation reports over 40,000 traffic fatalities per year in America alone. China, Canada, and Russia aren\u2019t far behind in statistical bloodshed. Millions of commuters trudge through soul-sucking, hour-long drives each day just to earn the right to sit in another ergonomic death trap called an office chair. This isn\u2019t a niche issue, this is a global epidemic. And in that context, the appeal of a machine that can shoulder some of the cognitive load starts to look less like laziness and more like survival.\n\nConfronting a Global Traffic Crisis with Autonomous Solutions\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: there aren\u2019t many players in the autonomous game who\u2019ve actually figured it out. Tesla, for all its flaws, leads the pack by sheer mileage and machine learning data. Hyundai has thrown its hat into the ring with respectable progress in its Highway Driving Assist systems. Volvo\u2019s Pilot Assist and GM\u2019s Super Cruise? Polished, yes, but still limited by geo-fencing and infrastructure. The harsh reality is that unless you\u2019re willing to trust your life to a robot chauffeur with a few bugs still in the code, Tesla and Hyundai are the only real contenders at this moment in the tech arms race.\n\nAdvanced Sensors, Data, and Over-the-Air Innovations\n\nTesla vehicles are equipped with a comprehensive array of sensors, including eight cameras providing 360-degree visibility, ultrasonic sensors, and a forward-facing radar (in models produced before 2021). This sensor suite is integrated with Tesla's custom-designed Full Self-Driving (FSD) computer, capable of processing vast amounts of data in real-time. This hardware configuration enables features like Autosteer, traffic-aware cruise control, and autonomous lane changes, contributing to a robust semi-autonomous driving experience. \u200b\n\nTesla leverages data from its global fleet, which has collectively driven billions of miles, to continuously improve its self-driving algorithms. This extensive data collection allows Tesla to train its neural networks on a wide variety of real-world scenarios, enhancing the system's ability to handle diverse driving conditions and unexpected situations. This approach accelerates the development and refinement of Tesla's autonomous driving capabilities. \u200b\n\nTesla's commitment to continuous improvement is evident through its over-the-air software updates, which regularly introduce new features and enhancements to existing functionalities. This capability ensures that Tesla owners benefit from the latest advancements in self-driving technology without the need for physical modifications to their vehicles. The iterative development process allows Tesla to rapidly deploy improvements and maintain a leading position in the autonomous driving market.\n\nThat brings us to one particularly poignant post from the digital campfire known as Reddit.\n\nA user in the Tesla Lounge asks:\n\n\u201cAs the title suggest I'm thinking of getting a Tesla to help with my long drives to visit family and girlfriend. What model would be ideal? Is there any reason to get from the dealership rather than a used car lot for EVs? I'm a simple person who has had a combustion engine Volkswagen since I was 18 (same car) so I'm not sure if there is anything different given all the electronics? Anyway any advice is appreciated just yes please no politics, sometimes you have to separate the art from the artist.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the musings of a tech evangelist or a hedge fund cowboy, just a regular driver trying to claw back some sanity from the jaws of highway tedium.\n\nReddit's Real-World Advice on EV Selection\n\nThe response? Overwhelmingly practical and refreshingly honest. Veteran owners and EV newcomers alike chimed in with measured takes. The Model 3 and Model Y, particularly those equipped with Hardware 4 (HW4), are the clear front-runners for this kind of use case. \u201cGet the cheapest Hardware 4 Model 3 or Model Y you can find,\u201d one user advised, emphasizing that Autopilot is included, and Full Self Driving (FSD) can be tested via monthly subscription.\n\nOther comments broke it down further: the Model S is a ballistic missile wrapped in a luxury shell, the Model X is a rolling Star Trek cosplay with gull-wing flair, but the Y is the versatile workhorse, enough range, enough room, and just enough refinement for the everyday commuter.\n\nWhy Model 3 & Model Y Dominate Long-Distance Driving\n\nAnd while some insisted the Model S is more than just a \"roomy sedan\", calling it a \u201cpowerful beast, even at the Base LR model\u201d, there\u2019s no denying that the Model 3\u2019s new Highland refresh presents a compelling case. Sharper design, a quieter ride, and more tech than most drivers will ever use. And for those still crunching the numbers, there\u2019s the elephant in the room: buying new versus used. Dealership purchases give you the assurance of the latest software, hardware, and warranty coverage, not to mention better resale value. But don\u2019t dismiss the used market entirely, especially with EVs showing battery longevity that often outlasts their gasoline counterparts. Just steer clear of early-production units lacking modern features like heat pumps and improved cameras.\n\nTesla Model Showdown\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the culture shift, moving from pistons to pixels. Owning an EV isn\u2019t just a change in drivetrain; it\u2019s an entirely new philosophy. No more oil changes, no more timing belts, no more morning ritual of praying your alternator hasn\u2019t given up in the night. Charging becomes part of life, regen braking rewires your instincts, and over-the-air updates feel more like software patches than automotive maintenance. It\u2019s cleaner, quieter, and more precise, but it\u2019s not without its own learning curve, especially for someone trading in a two-decade-old German relic.\n\nEmbracing the EV Revolution and Digital Driving Culture\n\nSo where does that leave our humble Reddit poster? Somewhere between nostalgia and necessity, straddling the past and future like a driver caught in a slow left-lane merge. The Reddit consensus offers a roadmap: start with Autopilot, test FSD through subscription, and don\u2019t be afraid of the learning curve. As one user said, \u201cDon\u2019t test drive a Model S\u2026 you will be stuck having to buy one! They are amazing!\u201d It\u2019s hard to argue with passion that strong, especially when it\u2019s grounded in hundreds of real-world miles and real-world frustration.\n\nCharting a Smart Path to Tesla Autopilot Adoption\n\nIn the end, Tesla may not be perfect, it may not even be sane. But for those navigating the mental grind of 1,000 monthly highway miles, it\u2019s a lifeline disguised as a luxury. It\u2019s a flawed but functional co-pilot in a world where the biggest threat on the road isn\u2019t a computer glitch, it\u2019s the driver texting two lanes over. So go ahead, retire that old VW.\n\nNoah Washington is an automotive journalist based in Atlanta, Georgia.

So we would like Democrats to also come out and condemn this heinous violence that we have seen,\" Leavitt said.\n\nThe statements from Bondi and Leavitt came after the latest incident in which five Tesla vehicles were damaged when a fire was started at a Tesla Collision Center in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning. That was the latest in a wave of incidents aimed at the electric vehicle company, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n\"This was a targeted attack against a Tesla facility,\" said Dori Koren, assistant sheriff for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nAlong with the burning vehicles, officials said the word \"RESIST\" was spray-painted across the doors of the facility and three rounds of shots were fired at the additional Teslas. The suspect approached the business wearing black clothing and is believed to have used Molotov cocktails and a firearm to conduct his attack, police said.\n\nOfficials received notice that an individual had \"set several vehicles on fire in the parking lot and caused damage to the property.\"\n\nPolice and the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force are investigating this incident, which they believe was an isolated attack. Authorities are still searching for a suspect.\n\nA grab from a video released by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department shows the word \"RESIST\" on the doors of a Tesla facility. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\n\nTwo Tesla Cybertrucks also caught on fire at a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on Monday evening, according to the Kansas City Police Department.\n\nTesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations have been vandalized, suffered arson and faced protests in recent weeks since the company's CEO Elon Musk began his work at the White House spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nIn the statement Tuesday, Bondi said, \"The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" In some of the cases, she said the Justice Department is charging perpetrators with crimes that carry five-year mandatory minimum sentences.\n\n\"We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,\" she said in the statement.\n\nIn the Kansas incident, a police officer in the area spotted smoke coming from one Cybertruck at a Tesla dealership on State Line Road shortly before midnight. The officer attempted to put out the flames using a fire extinguisher, but the fire spread to a second Cybertruck parked next to the original one, police said.\n\nThe Kansas City Fire Department ordered the bomb and arson unit to assist on the scene, the fire department said. Officials were able to put out the flames and the vehicles were \"covered with a fire blanket to prevent reignition,\" the fire department said.\n\n\"The circumstances are under investigation but preliminarily the fire is being investigated for the potential of being an arson,\" police said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThere have been no arrests made for this incident, police said. The FBI is assisting the Kansas City Police Department in this investigation.\n\nThis follows a spree of similar incidents that have occurred across the country in the last few weeks.\n\nLast week, \"more than a dozen\" shots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Oregon, according to Kelsey Anderson, the public information officer at the Tigard Police Department.\n\nAdditionally, three Teslas were vandalized in Dedham, Massachusetts on March 11, according to the Dedham Police Department. Officials said \"words had been spray-painted\" on two Tesla Cybertrucks, with all four tires of the trucks and a Tesla Model S being \"reportedly damaged.\"\n\nChalk graffiti is displayed on the outside of a Tesla dealership during a rally in San Francisco, March 15, 2025. Josh Edelson/AP\n\nEarlier this month, a Tesla charging station was targeted in South Carolina, where an individual spray-painted an expletive directed at President Trump along with \"LONG LIVE UKRAINE\" on the ground in red paint and threw homemade Molotov cocktails at the station, according to the North Charleston Police Department.\n\nFederal ATF agents arrested 24-year-old Daniel Clarke-Pounder in that incident, charging him with arson of property in interstate commerce.\n\nDuring a search of his apartment, agents said they found a purple composition notebook that contained a three-page handwritten statement which asserted anti-government beliefs and statements opposed to DOGE.\n\n\"The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs and was signed with the initials 'DC,'\" court records said.\n\nProtests against the company have also occurred at dealerships nationwide. Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs told ABC News the demonstrations and the company's plummeting stocks \u2014 which have tumbled nearly 48% this year \u2014 can all \"be tied to [Musk's] time at DOGE.\"\n\nATF investigators inspect burned Tesla Cybertrucks at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.

            "content": "In summary The permit lays the groundwork toward a driverless taxi service. Tesla has said it will launch such a service in Austin, Texas in June.\n\nTesla Inc. received permission from state regulators this week to begin a charter service that will use Tesla-employed drivers to ferry its employees in company-owned vehicles for prearranged rides, a step toward its plans for driverless Tesla taxis.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission, one of the state regulators that oversees hired vehicles, granted Tesla approval for what is known as a \u201ctransportation charter-party carrier\u201d permit on Tuesday, acting on a November 2024 application from the company.\n\nThe permit does not allow Tesla to operate a rideshare service like Uber or Lyft, nor does it give Tesla permission to run driverless taxis. And Tesla hasn\u2019t applied for permitting for either of those functions.\n\n\u201cThe only reasonable explanation I can come up with for why they\u2019ve got this (permit) is to allow them to test some of the operational backend services required to run a mobility service,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at communications firm Telemetry and an auto industry analyst.\n\nTo eventually provide rideshare services \u2013 with or without a driver \u2013 Tesla would need software that allows riders to request a ride, send out a vehicle to meet them, and take that rider to their destination. This charter service permit, Abuelsamid said, may be a way for the company to test out this kind of software.\n\nTesla did not respond to emailed questions.\n\nTesla\u2019s application, which the CPUC did not provide to CalMatters as of publication time, referred to transporting its employees as its \u201cinitial\u201d use for the permit. It is not clear where in California the company would run the charter service. The company did not respond to a question regarding the operating location or what it expects to use the permit for after initial use.\n\nDeploying driverless taxis to the public is a long regulatory road. The company would require permits from both the utility commission and the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which oversees safety for such rides. Among the required steps are testing unpaid rides with a safety driver, paid rides with a safety driver and paid rides with no driver at all.\n\nWaymo currently offers driverless rides to the public in a limited number of areas around the state.\n\nElon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a late January call with investors that the company would launch driverless vehicles in Austin in June.\n\n\u201cThis is not some far-off, mythical situation,\u201d he said about the Texas launch. \u201cIt\u2019s literally five, six months away.\u201d",

            "content": "The Brief Attorney General Pam Bondi labeled the recent attacks on Tesla showrooms and vehicles acts of \"domestic terrorism\". There has been a surge in attacks on Tesla properties since President Trump took office and empowered Elon Musk to head the new Department of Government Efficiency. On Monday, San Jose police announced they made an arrest in a Tesla vandalism incident.\n\n\n\nCybertrucks set ablaze. Bullets and Molotov cocktails aimed at Tesla showrooms.\n\nAttacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk\u2019s electric car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.\n\nThere\u2019s been a clear uptick since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that\u2019s slashing government spending.\n\n\u2018Domestic terrorism\u2019\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi called the spate of recent attacks acts of \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\n\"The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism. The Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators with that in mind, including in cases that involve charges with five-year mandatory minimum sentences. We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,\" Bondi said in a statement.\n\nExperts on domestic extremism say it\u2019s impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s first term, his properties in New York, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.\n\n\"Tesla is an easy target,\" said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \"They\u2019re rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\"\n\nFeatured article\n\nMusk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.\n\nBut the attacks are keeping law enforcement busy.\n\nSan Jose police announced on Monday the arrest of a man who keyed a Tesla in a Costco parking lot on charges of felony vandalism.\n\nProsecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \"Nazi cars\" spray-painted on a building.\n\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.\n\n\"The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\" the agent wrote.\n\nIn Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \"resist\" was also painted in red across the building\u2019s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.\n\n\"Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\" Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \"None of those factors are lost on us.\"\n\nTesla becomes a target for the left\n\nDig deeper:\n\nTesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn\u2019t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.\n\nMore recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump\u2019s 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.\n\nMusk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Trump\u2019s adviser.\n\nTesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election but has since shed all those gains.\n\nTrump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric-vehicle showroom. He promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s podcast, saying \"at least some of it is organized and paid for\" by \"left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\"\n\n\"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",

A fresh set of headlines may have weighed on the stock today, with Chinese EV maker BYD unveiling an ultra-fast charger and some Wall Street analysts offering up skeptical takes on Tesla stock.\n\nTesla shares, which rallied sharply after November\u2019s election on expectations that the company would benefit from Musk\u2019s close ties with President Trump, have given back all those gains.

The price could encounter selling pressure in this area near peaks that developed on the chart in July, September and October last year.\n\nFinally, a decisive close above this level could drive a move up to around $360. Investors may look to offload Tesla shares in this region near November\u2019s twin peaks and last month\u2019s countertrend high.

Officials were able to put out the flames and the vehicles were \"covered with a fire blanket to prevent reignition,\" the fire department said.\n\n\"The circumstances are under investigation but preliminarily the fire is being investigated for the potential of being an arson,\" police said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThere have been no arrests made for this incident, police said. The FBI is assisting the Kansas City Police Department in this investigation.\n\nThis follows a spree of similar incidents that have occurred across the country in the last few weeks.\n\nLast week, \"more than a dozen\" shots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Oregon, according to Kelsey Anderson, the public information officer at the Tigard Police Department.\n\nAdditionally, three Teslas were vandalized in Dedham, Massachusetts on March 11, according to the Dedham Police Department. Officials said \"words had been spray-painted\" on two Tesla Cybertrucks, with all four tires of the trucks and a Tesla Model S being \"reportedly damaged.\"\n\nATF investigators inspect burned Tesla Cybertrucks at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.

Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs told ABC News the demonstrations and the company's plummeting stocks \u2014 which have tumbled nearly 48% this year \u2014 can all \"be tied to [Musk's] time at DOGE.\"\n\n\"It has been a distraction for the company and it's been a problem for the brand,\" Frerichs said.\n\nIn recent weeks, four top officers at the company have sold off $100 million in stock, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMusk, the owner of X, said on Monday that his companies \"make great products that people love and I've never physically hurt anyone, so why the hate and violence against me?\"\n\n\"Because I am a deadly threat to the woke mind parasite and the humans it controls,\" Musk said on X.\n\nMusk has also reposted reactions that criticized previous Tesla attacks, including one that said those responsible for the Las Vegas attack are \"terrorists and should be treated accordingly.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",

Officials say five vehicles were damaged in the incident, including the two that were set on fire.\n\nFBI Las Vegas Special Agent in Charge Spencer Evans told reporters on Tuesday that the incident \"certainly has some of the hallmarks\" of a terrorist attack, but that it was still too early to say for sure.

Joe Lombardo (R) posted that the attack is \"despicable,\" adding that \"those responsible will be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nEvans was asked about the possibility of the incident being politically motivated, given Musk\u2019s ties to the Trump administration, but he would not confirm whether that was the bureau\u2019s current theory.\n\nLas Vegas Metropolitan PD (LVMPD) Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren said law enforcement believes \"the suspect approached the business wearing all black clothing and he used what appear to be Molotov cocktails and a firearm to conduct his attack.\"\n\nKoren said police found an \"unignited Molotov cocktail\" at the scene, as well as evidence that the suspect fired \"at least three rounds into different\" Teslas. He also said that at this time police believe the incident was isolated and there is no further threat to public safety.\n\nAt approximately 2:45 a.m. PDT, Las Vegas police received several calls about fires at a Tesla service station. When law enforcement arrived at the scene, multiple vehicles had been damaged including two that were \"engulfed in flames,\" according to Koren. Assistant Fire Chief Jennifer Wyatt said the fires were contained to two of the vehicles and were extinguished before they reached the battery compartment of the vehicles.\n\nDEM SENATOR MOCKED ONLINE FOR DITCHING HIS TESLA TO PROTEST 'A--HOLE' MUSK\n\nWhile one suspect was caught on camera, Koren said that law enforcement isn\u2019t ruling out the possibility that there are multiple people involved. As of now, LVMPD is still working to determine who owns the damaged vehicles.\n\nWhen asked whether police are concerned about the Tesla Cybertruck fleet they are expecting, Koren said that they will not allow \"criminals or any potential bad actors dictate\" operations. He insisted that the Cybertruck fleet will \"make crime fighting more effective.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFederal authorities are also investigating an incident in which two Tesla Cybertrucks were damaged in Kansas City, Mo.

He did it on X, the social media platform headed by Elon Musk, who took over as CEO of the electric vehicle company in 2008.\n\nKelly made his reason for abandoning the car that one time represented progress and automotive and environmental achievement: Musk and his politics.\n\n\u201cEvery time I get in this car in the last 60 days or so, it reminds me of just how much damage Elon Musk and Donald Trump is doing to our country,\u201d Kelly posted.\n\nOther well-known figures have dumped Teslas as well, including actor Jason Bateman, who said driving it was like \u201cdriving around with a Trump sticker\u201d back in October.\n\nMusic star Sheryl Crow made a video to announce she had sold her Tesla. She donated the money from the sale to NPR, posting: \u201cMy parents always said \u2026 you are who you hang out with. There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long, Tesla.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s connection to President Donald Trump and the emergence of the Department of Government Efficiency and its vast federal government job cuts were the tipping points for many progressives who owned the EV, which remains the top-selling electric car in the country.\n\nBut Musk\u2019s influence within conservative politics has inspired a growing segment of people to ditch their Tesla, as they don\u2019t want to be connected to Musk and had tied his political actions to their ownership of vehicles produced by his company. It is a connection many have said they want to disengage by getting rid of their once-beloved groundbreaking cars.\n\nTesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nTeslas still make up 42% of electric vehicle sales in the U.S., even with recent dips.\n\nBut anecdotal and automotive data indicate that the Tesla brand is taking a hit.. S&P Global Mobility numbers showed that Tesla registrations dropped 11% in January, while other manufacturers like Ford, Chevrolet and Volkswagen, saw a 44% increase in electric vehicle registrations.\n\nRonnie and Tarita Bagley purchased a Tesla Y a year ago, thinking Musk was an environmental revolutionary. But one month into DOGE\u2019s work under the Trump administration, the Bagleys determined the fate of the EV in their garage.\n\n\u201cWe had to get rid of that car,\u201d Ronnie Bagley said. \u201cOur personal morals and values were at odds with what he represents, which is divisiveness, inequality and chaos.\u201d\n\nAnd so, two weeks ago, they traded in their Tesla for a Cadillac Lyric, an electric SUV.\n\n\u201cIt was refreshing to get that Tesla off our hands,\u201d he said.\n\nMegan Paulus, a preschool teacher in New Jersey, took over her husband\u2019s Tesla Y when he died in December 2021. Paulus said her husband was a \u201chuge Elon and Tesla fan. He even owned stock.\u201d\n\nShe said they sold the stock to buy the car. As the owner now, Paulus said, \u201cI\u2019m very much connected to the story of how we got the car, that it was my husband\u2019s car.\u201d\n\nBut Musk\u2019s movements concern her. More importantly, she\u2019s worried about being tied to him and his politics by driving a Tesla. The company\u2019s dealerships and the cars themselves have been targets of vandalism in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cI no longer wish to be associated with these people. I no longer want to be associated with Elon Musk,\u201d Paulus said. While she said she is \u201cvery happy with the car as a car,\u201d the actions of Tesla\u2019s CEO loom over the vehicle, so much so that Paulus said she needed to distance herself from the man as she drives the car.\n\n\u201cI got one of those magnets-slash-bumper stickers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt says: \u2018I bought the car before I knew how awful Elon Musk was.\u2019 I did that as a placeholder, because I have thought very much about selling the car.\u201d\n\nWhile Musk\u2019s public image has disappointed many, emergency room physician Jerel Chacko, said he is able to separate the CEO\u2019s actions from the vehicle.\n\nChacko, of Holmdel, New Jersey, bought his Tesla Y in 2020. \u201cMusk wasn\u2019t the same type of public figure then as he is today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe perception back then was that he focused on the environment, sustainability and space travel.\u201d\n\nChacko said \u201cit\u2019s a shame\u201d that more people can\u2019t follow suit. \u201cDoes he make outlandish statements? Yes,\u201d he said. But he bought the car because it\u2019s \u201ca good product. In my head, he and Tesla are two completely separate entities.\u201d\n\nIt was disturbing to some Tesla owners that Trump acted as a car salesman last week, having a fleet of Musk\u2019s cars on display on the White House lawn.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d said Andrew Johnson, of Scottsdale, Arizona. He rents his Tesla out through the Turo car app. \u201cThat display made me sick, from the standpoint of why is the president of the United States pushing cars for the richest man in the world? That was it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even drive it, but I don\u2019t even want it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a man who totally flipped. His car was, in my eyes, a sort of symbol of progress. Now, with him killing people\u2019s jobs \u2026 I can\u2019t. And I won\u2019t. I just don\u2019t feel right within myself.\u201d\n\nWhich was also Bagley\u2019s point in selling their Tesla. \u201cYou have to take a moral stand,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, you can say it\u2019s just a car. But it\u2019s really representing you. And we just couldn\u2019t bear that.\u201d\n\nNeither could Tonya Parker of Atlanta. She bought a Tesla a year ago and included all the upgrades. \u201cIt was tricked out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut still, I never loved the car.\u201d\n\nWhen Musk began campaigning for Trump and espousing his disdain for diversity, equity and inclusion, Parker\u2019s dislike of her car \u2014 and the man \u2014 intensified.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make a statement,\u201d she said after selling her Tesla a couple of weeks ago. \u201cSome of my friends were disappointed in me that I bought the Tesla in the first place. And I understand. I came to the point where I did not want to be associated with him. I don\u2019t like his politics. I don\u2019t like anything about him. I don\u2019t like the person, Trump, that he co-chairs with. I wanted out.\u201d\n\nPaulus, the teacher, seems to want out, too, but she\u2019s in the process of purchasing a home and concerned about the resale value of her car. If she does move on from Tesla, she plans to get another EV.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sold on electric vehicles,\u201d she said.\n\nTamaira Johnson, who lives near San Diego, is also sold on EVs, calling the Tesla\u2019s capabilities \u201cgenius.\u201d\n\n\u201cTesla is still running circles around its counterparts, performancewise, and with its infrastructure network of quick-charging capabilities,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Johnson added, \u201cdo I like representing an Elon Musk vehicle? Hell, no.\u201d\n\nShe owns two Teslas and interchangeably rents out one for passive income via Turo and drives the other.\n\nThe financial and business considerations are where it gets tricky for her. \u201cMany like me have to ride it out for a couple reasons,\u201d she explained, adding that the 2020 to 2023 models\u2019 value, in some cases, has depreciated, making a trade-in problematic. \u201cAnd with Elon\u2019s unfavorable popularity, the brand\u2019s value is subject to taking a larger dive,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo being stuck in a vehicle with upside-down value is what it leaves me with.\u201d\n\nBagley and Parker said they were \u201cfortunate\u201d to get deals in which they sold their Teslas that allowed them to pay off their loans.\n\nJohnson, though, said she likes her cars and considers them reliable. \u201cIf it was just about Musk, you\u2019d see them abandoned on the side of the road all over the place,\u201d she said. \u201cBut until the competitors catch up with the technology, it\u2019s going to be tough. Tesla is still the one to beat in the EV industry, regardless of his politics.\u201d",

Economists overwhelmingly expect the central bank to leave its benchmark rate unchanged, according to CME FedWatch. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be asked if policymakers see signs that the Trump administration's tariffs could boost inflation, which remains well above the central bank's 2% annual target.\n\nStill, Wall Street analysts expect more volatility in the weeks ahead amid ongoing uncertainty caused by global trade spats. The Trump administration has threatened on April 2 to impose matching tariffs on countries that tax the U.S. That's also the date 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been delayed for a month to allow for negotiations, are set to take effect.\n\n\"While financial markets appear to be stabilizing, investors are wrestling with the decision of whether to buy the dips or sell the rallies in an environment of exceptionally high policy uncertainty,\" Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a report Monday. \"A game-theoretic assessment of potential tariff outcomes suggests that Trump's optimal strategy is to announce reciprocal tariffs on 2 April, and then begin to negotiate them lower.\"\n\ncontributed to this report.",

Musk last week also announced that Tesla would double vehicle production at its U.S. factories.",

            "content": "Hundreds of people protested at Tesla dealerships across the US over the weekend, as the backlash against Elon Musk and the Trump administration continued despite a warning from the attorney general that the government would be \u201ccoming after\u201d protesters.\n\nThe protests, in cities including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston and New York, have come as Musk has seen his net worth plunge and the sales of Teslas plummet in Europe. In Brooklyn, New York, about 50 people gathered outside a Tesla showroom on Saturday afternoon to loudly make their displeasure clear, the fourth such protest in the last four weeks.\n\nOther anti-Tesla actions have seen bullets fired through a dealership window and molotov cocktails thrown at a charging station. But this was a rather more genteel protest, as evidenced by the signs on show. \u201cOnce to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,\u201d read one, channeling a poem by the American poet James Russell Lowell.\n\nOne banner said: \u201cMusk is too brusque,\u201d another: \u201cVery uncool.\u201d One sign, however, offered a more prosaic example of the anger on display, riffing on a Dead Kennedys song: \u201cNazi trucks fuck off.\u201d\n\nAs protesters chanted: \u201cHands off our data,\u201d and \u201cArrest Elon Musk,\u201d there certainly seemed to be plenty of support from passersby. People in cars and trucks repeatedly blasted their horns \u2013 including, at one point, a man driving a Tesla.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most consequential moment in US history since, I don\u2019t know, the civil war. I don\u2019t know what to liken it to, but we\u2019re on a precipice, and so I can\u2019t actually concentrate on anything right now except protesting,\u201d said Kirsten Hassenfeld, a 53-year-old artist and editor who lives in Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cI think there are people that haven\u2019t woken up to this yet, but I think that we\u2019re sliding into a full-on authoritarian state. I\u2019m terrified,\u201d she said.\n\nMusk has witnessed a mass sell-off of Teslas in recent weeks, in protest against his unprecedented intrusion into the US government through the so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d. Sales of new vehicles have declined around the world, with February sales in Australia down about 72% compared with the same month in 2024; in Germany sales were down 76% for the same period, while Tesla\u2019s stock price has lost almost half its value since December.\n\nAs protests have grown, the White House has rallied round Musk. Last week Donald Trump claimed the boycott was \u201cillegal\u201d, while Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said on Friday she would launch an investigation into vandalism against Tesla vehicles and showrooms.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we\u2019re coming after you. And if you\u2019re funding this, we\u2019re coming after you. We\u2019re going to find out who you are,\u201d Bondi told Fox Business.\n\nIn Brooklyn, people were apparently undeterred by the threat. Teslas driving past the protest were treated to a volley of boos, and lusty chants of \u201cSell your Tesla\u201d. The demonstration certainly appeared to have restricted the number of people entering the dealership: the Guardian counted three customers in the space of an hour and a half.\n\nDonna C, who asked not to give her last name, said it was her fourth time protesting at that dealership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for me because Elon Musk has carte blanche to destroy our country, destroy our democracy, destroy the institutions that millions of New Yorkers and millions of Americans rely on. Donald Trump has allowed him to buy his way into the government with hundreds of millions of dollars of contributions,\u201d Donna said.\n\n\u201cI think what these protests are doing is opening the eyes of Americans in their millions across the US to what is actually going on,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents grew up in fascism in Italy under Mussolini. I\u2019ve seen what can happen. We know the history, the same steps are being taken.\u201d\n\nNearly 20 Tesla showrooms and charging stations have seen deliberate fires set over the past few weeks, while dozens of owners have had their cars variously egged, used as receptacles for dog feces, or coated with Kraft cheese singles. The protests on Saturday seem to have largely remained calm, however, despite the anger of those attending.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pissed off and furious for a while, and a friend of mine told me, \u2018If you want to come and scream and shout at Tesla, then show up on Saturday,\u2019\u201d said Yedon Thonden, 57.\n\n\u201cTesla is a good target. You know, their stock prices are sinking. Their leadership is cashing out their investments. And I think Elon is obviously worried about his company,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think that this administration is going to realize pretty quickly that the economy is tanking. So the more we can highlight that, the better.\u201d",

Kind of.\n\nIn the video, the Tesla Model Y on Autopilot successfully detected a child mannequin in front of the car, one that appeared with less than a second of braking time, and another standing in front of the vehicle amid bright lights to simulate sunset conditions.\n\nHowever, it failed to avoid hitting the mannequin when obscured by intense fog, heavy rain, and a Wile E. Coyote-style Roadrunner-painted wall.\n\nRober drove through the Wile E Coyote Roadrunner wall with the Tesla. screenshot/YouTube\n\nThe alternative car, a Lexus with LiDAR in its self-driving system, passed every test in Rober's video.\n\nMost cars with self-driving technology use LiDAR to map roadways, other cars, and possible obstructions around the vehicle. LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is similar to radio detection and ranging, but uses laser lights invisible to the human eye instead of radio waves.\n\nMusk said in the company's last earnings call in January that \"obviously, humans drive without shooting lasers out of their eyes.\" The Tesla CEO said that humans rely on their eyes and biological neural networks to navigate while driving, and the digital counterpart to that is cameras and digital neural nets, or AI.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said that \"the entire road system was designed for passive optical neural nets.\"\n\n\"Look, we even have a radar in the car and we turned it off,\" Musk said.\n\nRober said the last test, in which he drove the Tesla through the fake road wall at 40 miles per hour, was the \"only one that matters.\"\n\n\"While that looks sort of convincing, the image processing in our brain is advanced enough that we pick up on minor visual inconsistencies, and we wouldn't hit it,\" Rober said about the wall.\n\nThe rain and fog conditions obstructed the view of the child mannequin. screenshot/YouTube/Photojoiner\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nRelated stories\n\nWhile the fake-wall test highlighted that Tesla's Autopilot cameras and AI system still have a ways to go in some scenarios, it's also highly unlikely that a human would ever face such an illusion in real life.\n\nThe weather tests, which were closer to reality, also created smoke and rain conditions so dense that a human wouldn't be able to see through it. However, the goal of self-driving systems is to create technology so advanced that it detects potential incidents faster than a human driver, increasing road safety.\n\nIn response to the YouTuber's test, some Tesla fans and others on social media criticized the video and Rober's decision to use Autopilot instead of the more advanced Full-Self-Driving beta software, which is a paid upgrade.\n\nRober responded to some of the criticism by sharing what he described as the raw footage of the test.\n\nMusk has previously said that a Tesla on Autopilot is almost 10 times less likely to crash than the average car, a claim that some experts have said is misleading.",

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI bought a Tesla Model Y in 2022.\n\nMy previous car \u2014 a convertible \u2014 looked amazing, but as a gadget enthusiast, I felt I was missing out on technology and the user experience. There was no touchscreen, integration with my phone, or smart driving.\n\nI was drawn to a Tesla because it had all the things I wanted. It was easy to use and environmentally friendly. I liked the idea of never having to go to a gas station again. The safety features, like assisted driving and situational awareness, also drew me.\n\nI spent around \u00a365,000 on my Model Y, and it's performed over and above my expectations. However, last week, I was confronted by a man who was mocking my Tesla. I've also been seeing negative sentiment toward Elon Musk online.\n\nThe sentiments have made me concerned about the resale value of my Tesla, but I still like the car and plan to buy another Tesla soon.\n\nA man approached me in a parking lot and confronted me about my Tesla\n\nSince I've had my Tesla, most people who've gotten into my car easily draw the connection between my love of technology and the car.\n\nLast week, I experienced the first negative reaction to my Tesla. I went to a concert in London, and while I was in the parking lot, I saw a guy with his wife and daughter pointing at my car and laughing.\n\nThe guy came up to me in a very confrontational way and said, \"Do you support Elon Musk, then, driving a Tesla?\"\n\nI was quite aghast. I felt quite violated by the question and didn't know what to say.\n\nI've always admired Elon Musk because I think that a lot of the technology he creates is for betterment. I hadn't considered the impact his work at DOGE was having on the US government; as someone based in the UK, I'm somewhat removed from what's happening. I think Trump has brought in someone who will look at the situation through the lens of a CEO.\n\nBut it made me realize how the perception of Musk impacts his brands \u2014 which led me to post about the incident on LinkedIn.\n\nThe post attracted a lot of attention. There was a lot of polarization between people in the comments; many were negative. Some people were astounded that I said I admired Musk and that I'd damaged my personal brand because of the post.\n\nI respect Elon Musk and like his data-driven businesses\n\nMy current business specializes in building AI for marketing purposes, but I've worked in technology for 30 years and have built and sold several technology businesses.\n\nI respect Elon Musk and like that his businesses are data-driven, whether it's Neuralink, SpaceX, or Tesla.Tesla is a pioneer company. Musk is setting new standards for the industry.\n\nEveryone is allowed an opinion, but I'm proud of the fact that I don't conform to the crowd and choose my personal preferences over listening to what everyone else says.\n\nI plan to buy another Tesla\n\nI'm aware that some Tesla owners are trying to distance themselves from the brand. I've seen a trend where people are buying bumper stickers for their Teslas that say things like, \"I bought this before Musk went crazy.\"\n\nThis turn of events has made me think, but it hasn't put me off from buying another Tesla. I'm waiting for the new Model Y to arrive in the UK, and then I'll place my order.\n\nMaybe I'll make more of a loss than I thought when I try to get rid of my old Tesla, but that doesn't bother me.\n\nBeing in a vehicle that I feel will save my life in an accident is more important to me than the personality or brand of Elon Musk.\n\nI bought the car for the experience, safety, and technology, and that hasn't changed.",

Mark Kelly ditches his Tesla Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona says he didn't think owning a Tesla would become political, so he's getting rid of his.\n\nA Democratic senator is seemingly so fed up with Elon Musk and his actions as the unofficial leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that he is dumping his Telsa and getting a new ride.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-AZ, posted a video Friday on X, the social media platform Musk owns, explaining how when he bought his Tesla he didn't think it would become a \"political issue.\"\n\n\"Every time I get in this car, in the last 60 days or so, it reminds me of just how much damage Elon Musk and Donald Trump is doing to our country,\" Kelly said in the roughly minute-long video.\n\nThe 61-year-old senator and retired astronaut also commented on Musk and President Donald Trump's efforts to reduce federal spending by \"slashing Social Security,\" \"firing veterans\" and \"cutting health care benefits for poor people and seniors.\" He added: \"It's one bad thing after the next.\"\n\nWhile standing in front of his Tesla, Kelly said in the clip that he \"thinks it's time for an upgrade\" and that he is \"doing the right thing\" by \"getting rid of\" his electric vehicle.\n\nThe caption of the X post reads: \"I bought a Tesla because it was fast like a rocket ship. But now every time I drive it, I feel like a rolling billboard for a man dismantling our government and hurting people. So Tesla, you\u2019re fired! New ride coming soon.\"\n\nHave Teslas become a political statement?\n\nSeparating Musk from Tesla has been challenging for many as owners of the EV vehicles have reported feeling attacked and harassed online by various social media groups.\n\nThe scrutiny has even escalated to multiple dealerships being targeted by anti-Musk vandals, according to local news outlets, including WPLG. Fort Lauderdale police said 34 new Tesla Cybertrucks were damaged while in an area parking lot, and tagged with the message, \"(expletive) Elon,\" the TV station reported.\n\nLast month, federal agents announced they were investigating vandalism at a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colorado. Someone smashed windows, painted Cybertruck windshields with large red X's and tried to ignite a fire. Local media also reported that someone painted \"Nazi Cars\" at the dealership, which said it was the third attack of its kind so far this year.\n\nBen Kallo, an analyst at financial service firm Baird, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d on Monday that recent reports of vandalism could hurt demand for Tesla vehicles.\n\n\u201cWhen people\u2019s cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent Musk, might think twice about buying a Tesla,\u201d Kallo said, per CNBC.\n\nLiberals, who have advocated for driving EV vehicles like Tesla sedans for decades, have turned their backs on Musk's company of late. Statistics further prove this as Cybertruck registrations have surged in predominantly conservative-voting states like Texas and Florida, according to data compiled by S&P Global Mobility.\n\nTrump stands by Musk amid Tesla stock decline\n\nTrump, while standing next to Musk and five Tesla vehicles on the White House\u2019s South Lawn on Tuesday, said he could consider labeling anyone committing violence against Tesla owners and dealerships \"domestic terrorists.\"\n\n\u201cI'll do it. I'm going to stop them \u2026 because they're harming a great American company,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you hurt an American company, especially a company like this that supplies so many jobs that others are unable to do.\u201d\n\nHouse DOGE Subcommittee Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., announced on Wednesday that she and her committee colleagues sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel asking for an investigation into the \u201corganized\u201d attacks against Musk, Tesla and the DOGE effort.\n\nSince December, Tesla stock has dropped by 50%. The struggling EV market, a global decline in sales, and branding issues stemming from Musk's newfound political influence, may be the culprits behind the steep decline, JPMorgan analysts said, according to Business Insider.\n\n\"We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\" JPMorgan analysts stated, adding that the closest example was when Japanese and Korean car brands lost sales during \"diplomatic disputes\" with China in 2012 and 2017.\n\nAround 3 p.m. on Friday, Tesla's stock was up about $10 and valued at around $250 per share, according to NASDAQ.\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes & Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy/ USA TODAY",

Nothing immediately came to mind for Musk during the early 2020 meeting, details of which have not been previously reported.\n\nBut last week, Trump appeared to deliver a fantastic favor to the billionaire tech entrepreneur, the biggest donor of the 2024 election cycle and his closest ally. In an unprecedented event \u2014 part news conference, part infomercial \u2014 the president showcased Tesla vehicles on a White House driveway and announced that he had selected one of them \u2014 a cherry red Model S \u2014 for himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe event sparked a wave of conservative support for Tesla, a company facing a plummeting stock price, investor frustration, consumer boycotts and sometimes violent protests at facilities across the country. As Tesla shareholders press Musk to return his attention to the firm that made him the world\u2019s richest person, the event also highlighted how Musk\u2019s deepening alliance with Trump has been boon and burden to his expansive business empire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTrump and his deputies are threatening those who vandalize Teslas, saying they will classify anti-Tesla protesters as domestic terrorists. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we\u2019re coming after you,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a Friday interview on Fox Business. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re funding this, we\u2019re coming after you. We\u2019re going to find out who you are.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Republican politicians and MAGA influencers are urging their supporters to purchase Musk\u2019s EVs. Gesturing at a Tesla in a Friday X post, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said: \u201cThis may be the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe campaign has triggered an uptick in searches for \u201cBuy a Tesla\u201d in many traditionally red states, according to Google Trends data, and Tesla\u2019s stock has rebounded slightly. But it risks alienating the liberal customers who spawned its early success. And as Tesla falters, some of its executives have eyed opportunities outside the company in recent days, according to a person familiar with the matter, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cMusk\u2019s bet that serving \u2014 and helping to lead \u2014 the MAGA onslaught will benefit him economically is risky to say the least,\u201d said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Stern Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. \u201cMusk\u2019s companies may get so tainted in the eyes of many ordinary citizens that they will suffer irreparable damage to their reputations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe danger for Musk is that he becomes the embodiment of crony capitalism,\u201d Barrett said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk\u2019s alliance with the president has grown since he poured almost $290 million into electing Trump and other Republican candidates in 2024, culminating in repeated joint appearances and Musk\u2019s role overseeing the U.S. DOGE Service. Its cost-cutting efforts \u2014 and Musk\u2019s position \u2014 have been deeply polarizing, however. Almost half of Americans disapprove of Musk\u2019s work within the federal government, according to a Washington Post-Ipsos poll.\n\nUntil recently, Musk\u2019s involvement with Trump has helped his business empire. But Tesla\u2019s stock is down nearly 35 percent this year, erasing the gains it made after Trump won the election, when investors saw Musk\u2019s proximity to the commander in chief as a coup for the business.\n\nIn response to the recent wave of vandalism and protests, Trump supporters are lining up to help reverse the declines.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLily Tang Williams, who is running for Congress in New Hampshire, posted a video on X of herself in the driver\u2019s seat of a Tesla on Monday.\u201cRadical leftists Marxist communists, they want to shut you down if you do not comply to them, if you\u2019re a threat,\u201d she said to the more than 247,000 followers of her @Lily4Liberty account.\n\nAnother activist, former Ohio Republican congressional candidate JR Majewski, posted a photo of a new Tesla with the caption, \u201cModel S Plaid. Thank you Tesla and Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity announced on his cable show that he would buy a Model S, in what he called \u201ca gesture\u201d of solidarity with Musk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a way of saying, you know, look what they\u2019re doing to this guy,\u201d he said. \u201cLook what\u2019s going to happen to the workers at Tesla, the salespeople, the people on the line that are going to lose their job.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome business leaders on the right, including pharmaceutical executive and Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, have posited that a range of companies could become wildly successful catering only to conservative audiences. While Fox News has capitalized on the premise, investors including Peter Thiel and Omeed Malik, a partner in an investment firm with Donald Trump Jr., have argued an entire \u201canti-woke\u201d or \u201cparallel\u201d economy is waiting to be tapped.\n\nBut some analysts say the conservative support probably is not enough to reverse the decline at Tesla, which has outpaced broader markets by roughly 30 percent.\n\n\u201cIf in fact Tesla\u2019s deliveries are down year over year, I think it is related to brand damage that\u2019s happened,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cBecause I think people have strong opinions about Elon and they\u2019ve gotten even stronger over the past two months.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives boosted the narrative this week in a note to investors titled \u201cA \u2018Moment of Truth\u2019 for Musk and Tesla With DOGE,\u201d noting that while Trump\u2019s election was expected to clear the path for autonomous vehicles, it has also \u201cintertwined Tesla into this brewing political firestorm.\u201d\n\nThe Tesla event at the White House on Tuesday was the culmination of a year-long transformation in the nation\u2019s most powerful political relationship. Five years ago, toward the end of his first term, Trump was eager to push Musk to commit to building his next Tesla factory in the United States \u2014 securing a win for domestic manufacturing.\n\nA skeptic of electric vehicles, Trump told Musk in the Oval Office meeting that he owned Teslas, but there was nowhere to charge them. Musk prompted a Tesla executive in the room to show Trump the vast network of Tesla superchargers, mapped in a sea of red dots on his phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe meeting, which included the offer of a favor, was cordial and focused on Trump\u2019s goals for his agenda, according to two people, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private matter, who confirmed aspects of the conversation. But privately, according to one of the people, Trump would mock the extent to which Musk\u2019s wealth \u2014 largely tied up in his companies and used as collateral for loans \u2014 was leveraged, in addition to the fact that Musk\u2019s companies thrived off government subsidies and contracts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI could have said, \u201cdrop to your knees and beg,\u201d and he would have done it \u2026\u201d Trump later said of Musk in that meeting, in a Truth Social post.\n\nDespite his electric vehicle skepticism and occasionally difficult relationship with Musk, in his 2024 campaign, Trump would come to rely on the entrepreneur\u2019s massive wealth to propel him and Republican candidates to office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Musk critics, the news conference looked like the ultimate favor from Trump, a harbinger for a broader range of conflict of interest concerns around Musk\u2019s business. Trump officials already appear to be providing help to Musk\u2019s internet provider Starlink. After employees of its parent company SpaceX took on roles at the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency examined deploying Starlink satellite internet terminals in place of an existing communications contract, The Post has previously reported.\n\nFour Senate Democrats have asked the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to recommend that Musk and Trump\u2019s promotion of Tesla be investigated. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia), the top member of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to Trump\u2019s counsel David Warrington on Wednesday, inquiring about potential ethics violations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nConnolly asked the White House to identify which government employees helped stage the event. He is also seeking to know what communications White House officials had with Tesla before the event and who in the White House has a financial interest in the car company and what role, if any, they played in organizing the event. The White House has until March 26 to reply.\n\n\u201cAmericans are struggling to afford groceries, childcare, and housing,\u201d Connolly wrote. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s solution to the mounting economic crises is a car ad that he hoped would boost the stock price of Tesla, a company headed by one of his biggest campaign donors who is also a federal employee, Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nOne person in Musk\u2019s social circle, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private relationship, said he doubted that the pressure on Tesla would cause Musk to shift his attention away from DOGE, which is under instructions to complete its work by July 4, 2026.",

The vehicle has been hit with more than half a dozen recalls in less than a year of being on the road, highlighting the EV maker's shoddy design work and questionable quality control.\n\nProspective owners are noting on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum that their delivery dates have been canceled, with dealerships informing them that the truck \"needs additional inspection.\"\n\nWhile Tesla has yet to \u2014 and likely won't \u2014 comment on the matter publicly, some users of the forum were informed that it's an issue related to the Cybertruck's \"cantrail\" trim, a massive exterior piece of stainless steel that arcs over the top of the vehicle's driver and passenger windows.\n\nWe've already come across plenty of incidents involving the nine-foot piece of boomerang-shaped window flying off, seemingly as the result of a botched gluing job.\n\n\"I ran a quick errand tonight,\" one driver complained in a post on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum last month, \"and while merging and accelerating on the interstate in normal traffic, at about 70 mph, I heard a loud ripping sound and the metal panel liberates and flew into traffic behind me.\"\n\n\"I was not able to stop as I was in the middle of a highway split,\" they continued. \"I rolled the window down and felt for it, and yes, the trim was gone.\"\n\nCar enthusiast publication Road & Track identified multiple cases of the same panel peeling off its adhesive.\n\nIn a video published last month, YouTuber and Cybertruck owner Reid Tomasko warned that the panel can easily fall off, especially when exposed to freezing temperatures.\n\n\"This is actually really dangerous,\" he said. \"I've seen quite a few people online where these have come off on the highway.\"\n\nWhile his hadn't detached on its own, he voluntarily ripped it off so it wouldn't come unstuck at highway speeds.\n\nAnd it's not just the cantrail panel. The truck's massive front plate has also been glued on by the carmaker, and images circulating online show how easily the panel can be ripped off.\n\nAs Electrek points out, Tesla has yet to issue a public service bulletin related to the issue and it remains unclear if the cantrail trim piece is indeed the reason why deliveries are being halted.\n\nBut as many owners have found out the hard way, it's a glaring problem that the EV maker will have to address one way or the other.\n\nMore on the Cybertruck: Cybertruck Goes to Mardi Gras Parade, Gets Bombarded by Trash and Flees in Shame",

            "content": "Investors are questioning the tech billionaire's involvement in Trump's administration, while shares in his Tesla electric-car company plummet.\n\nIt was perhaps the clearest sign yet that Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s political maneuvering has backfired. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump stood alongside the tech billionaire and a red Tesla Model S outside the White House, declaring he was buying the electric car for his staff to use and paying full price.\n\nTrump\u2019s unprecedented endorsement of the electric vehicle (EV) giant comes after months of mounting criticism over Musk\u2019s deepening involvement in both US and foreign politics \u2014 including support for far-right parties in Europe \u2014 and after billions of dollars were wiped off Tesla's shares.\n\nThat Musk sought the president\u2019s public backing suggests that protests, consumer boycotts and even sabotage attacks on Tesla vehicles, charging stations and production plants have unsettled the world\u2019s wealthiest man and spooked Tesla investors. Trump condemned those incidents as cases of \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nCould politics be blamed for falling Tesla sales?\n\nTesla\u2019s plunging sales have added to the pressure. In Germany, where Musk used his social media platform X to endorse the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party ahead of last month\u2019s national elections, Tesla registrations fell 76% in February compared to the previous year. EV registrations overall in Germany surged by nearly a third over the same period.\n\nA similar trend is emerging elsewhere, including France where Tesla sales fell by 45% in the first two months of the year, while Australia saw sales fall by more than a third in the four months since Trump's reelection.\n\nIn California, the biggest US market for EVs, Tesla sales fell for the fifth consecutive quarter, according to the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA). In 2024, Tesla registrations in the Golden State dropped by 11.6%.\n\nConsumers appear to be steering clear of Musk's EV brand amid accusations of political interference and a too-cozy relationship with Trump. Many Tesla owners have put stickers on their EVs in opposition to Musk's shift to the right, with slogans that read: \"Vintage Tesla \u2014 Pre-Madness Edition\" and \"I Bought This Car Before Elon Lost His Mind.\"\n\nTesla owners have come up with fun ways to express their disapproval with Musk Image: Tobias Schwarz/AFP\n\n\"Musk thinks he can say anything he wants to and doesn\u2019t think Tesla will suffer any consequences,\" Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein told the Associated Press last week. \"Tesla was in the sweet spot. Now it has competition.\"\n\nA recent Strategic Vision survey asked Americans to name their favorite vehicle and while both Republican and Democrat voters chose an EV over combustion-engine models, neither picked Tesla.\n\nDaniel A. Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan and the author of an upcoming book about Tesla, noted how, until recently, the carmaker was \"heavily identified with environmentalist concerns,\" and how Tesla drivers \"skewed left politically.\"\n\n\"In the last two years, Musk has pretty much burned his bridges with those constituencies. Also, given the arrival on the market of many other EVs [startups like Rivian and Lucid and legacy automakers], people who want to drive an EV for climate reasons no longer have to buy a Tesla,\" Crane told DW.\n\nCrane said while Musk may think Tesla can instead target Trump supporters on the right, \"MAGA folks tend to be the most EV-skeptical.\"\n\nDays numbered for 'Teflon Elon' monicker\n\nThe intense rivalry between EV makers has sparked a major selloff in Tesla stock. Over the past three months, shares in Musk's carmaker have fallen by almost half. Musk's net worth has dropped by $144 billion (\u20ac132 billion) over the same period amid growing skepticism of Tesla's promise to deliver autonomous driving harnessing artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company's valuation peaked at more than $1.5 trillion after the US presidential election but on Monday alone, Tesla stock dropped 15%, in a market selloff prompted by fears of a looming US recession.\n\nMusk backed Trump's campaign to the tune of $250 million and has since become his top advisor on slashing government waste through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nHis involvement has spurred daily reports of slashed public-sector spending, welcomed by many US voters but criticized by activists, academics and lawmakers as lacking proper oversight.\n\nGrowing outrage over Musk's role in DOGE\n\nTesla Takedown protests have erupted at dealerships across the US recently over Musk's role in DOGE, which has so far canceled around $60 billion of contracts that fund humanitarian programs around the world.\n\nAmericans are witnessing \"an extraordinary centralization of power in someone who lacks a top-level security clearance and has not been subject to any Senate confirmation process,\" Don Moynihan, a professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, told Reuters news agency last month.\n\nMoynihan said Musk's access to sensitive government data without adequate monitoring was \"concerning\" and \"unprecedented.\"\n\nWhere are US Democrats as Trump, Musk gut gov't agencies? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMusk's other holdings still growing\n\nAs well as Tesla, Musk owns Space X, the first private space company. His other ventures include Neuralink, which is developing an interface implanted in the brain, xAI, which created the AI chatbot Grok and the social media platform X. The infrastructure, tunnel construction and equipment firm named The Boring Company is also owned by Musk. He also has ambitions to colonize Mars.\n\nUnlike Tesla, these firms are not publicly listed but can still be traded by investors on the secondary market. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that while Tesla's value has plummeted, the collective valuation of four of Musk\u2019s private firms is up 45% since the election, citing analysis from trading platform Caplight. xAI's share price has increased 110% since November 5.\n\nBetween them, Musk's firms have contracts worth between $18 billion and $22 billion with the federal government, according to US media reports, although those figures may not paint the full picture as many of the deals are classified.\n\nThose contracts and the fact Musk's firms have been investigated or fined more than 30 times by 11 US government agencies, according to the New York Times, have raised alarm bells about possible conflicts of interest with his involvement with DOGE.\n\nEven before he became a close advisor to Trump, investors had also questioned whether Musk had spread himself too thin.\n\nIs Musk's time up at Tesla's helm?\n\nLast month, Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, who oversees employee pension funds that own Tesla shares worth $1.25 billion, told the New York Times that Musk should step down as Tesla CEO but remain on the board. This, he said, would return the EV maker to the \"basic model of shareholder governance in America.\"\n\nInvestors are concerned that Musk's political work is distracting him from tending to his cash cow Image: AP/dpa/picture alliance\n\nWhile Musk has said publicly that his involvement with DOGE is likely to last another year, one of Telsa's most bullish investors of Wall Street, Dan Ives, now thinks he should quit his commitment to the Trump administration.\n\n\"The clock has struck midnight for Musk and DOGE \u2026 he needs to also wear his hat as Tesla CEO,\" Ives, who is global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told DW. \"Balance will be key and that\u2019s what Musk needs to do to stop the bleeding in Tesla stock.\"\n\nA poll by US investment bank Morgan Stanley published Wednesday found that 85% of investors thought Musk's move into politics has either had a \"negative\" or \"extremely negative\" impact on Tesla's business.\n\nMusk himself has admitted having a tough time juggling his many commitments, telling Fox Business on Monday that he was running his businesses \"with great difficulty.\"\n\nDespite this, he appeared to double down in his support for Trump's presidency. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Musk is planning a further financial boost to Trump's political operation worth $100 million, citing several people familiar with the plan.\n\nThe newspaper said the donation was an \"unheard-of\" move by a White House staffer.\n\nWhile pictured alongside Trump, Musk told reporters on Tuesday he would stay in Washington as long as he was useful, but said he would remain as Tesla's CEO.\n\nEdited by: Uwe Hessler",

Year to date, Tesla\u2019s stock has plunged 36% \u2014 though it is still up by some 54% over the past 12 months.\n\nFor Musk, Tesla\u2019s shares remain his primary source of paper wealth, though he has also turned his stake in SpaceX into a personal lending tool. But it was proceeds from selling Tesla shares that helped Musk complete his acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.\n\nMusk\u2019s wealth also allowed him to help vault Donald Trump into a second presidential term. Even as Musk\u2019s net worth has diminished as a result of Tesla\u2019s recent share-price declines, data suggests he is in no danger of losing his title as the world\u2019s wealthiest person.\n\nMusk has said on X that he is not concerned about Tesla\u2019s recent drop in value. Still, evidence suggests the company is entering a period of transition.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk\u2019s wealth has propelled him to a global presence that lacks precedent \u2014 and has polarized world opinion about the tech entrepreneur in the process. Any weakening of his financial position, therefore, could undercut his influence in the political and tech spaces where he now commands outsize attention.According to Bank of America, Tesla\u2019s European sales plummeted by about 50% in January compared with the same month a year prior.\n\nSome say this is attributable to a growing distaste for Musk, who has begun dabbling in the continent\u2019s politics in the wake of his successful support of Trump\u2019s candidacy last year.\n\nOthers note Tesla\u2019s European market is facing increased competition from the Chinese electric-vehicle maker BYD, which has telegraphed ambitious plans for expansion on the continent.\n\nA more decisive blow to Tesla\u2019s near-term fortunes may be emanating from China itself. There, Tesla\u2019s shipments plunged 49% in February from a year earlier, to just 30,688 vehicles, according to official data cited by Bloomberg News. That\u2019s the lowest monthly figure registered since July 2022 \u2014 amid the throes of Covid-19 \u2014 when it shipped just 28,217 EVs, Bloomberg said.\n\nDonald Trump accompanied by Elon Musk speaks Tuesday next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nTesla is now facing intense competition from other Chinese EV makers, including BYD.\n\nYet even there, a Chinese official also warned about the impact of Musk\u2019s high-profile politicking.\n\n\u201cAs a successful businessman, one should be embracing 100% of the market: Treat everyone nicely, and everyone will be nice in return,\u201d the secretary of China\u2019s Passenger Car Association, said in a briefing Monday, Bloomberg reported. \u201cBut if you look at it in terms of voting, then half of voters will be friendly to you and half of them won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the unavoidable risk that\u2019s come after he got his personal glory,\u201d the secretary, Cui Dongshu, said Monday, referring to Musk.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters reported Tesla was planning to sell a Model Y costing at least 20% less to produce to defend its China share.\n\nAnd in the U.S., Tesla\u2019s January sales were down about 11%, according to data from the S&P Global analytics group \u2014 an outlier at a time when EV sales for all other brands are trending higher in America.\n\nThough he has long worn multiple proverbial hats, Musk\u2019s role in the White House as nominal head of the Department of Government Efficiency may be his most consequential. And having influence with the Trump administration could be critical to Tesla\u2019s fortunes. This week, Trump promised he would purchase a Tesla in a showy presentation on the White House lawn, seemingly further cementing the Trump-Musk alliance.\n\nOn X \u2014 the social media platform he owns \u2014 Musk\u2019s frenetic posting is increasingly focused on politics and America\u2019s culture wars, with an occasional nod to SpaceX launches.\n\nHis apparently undiminished role in the Trump administration \u2014 he was seen leaving the White House last weekend alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2014 has sparked boycotts in Europe, as well as protests and even acts of vandalism against auto owners in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhen people\u2019s cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent to Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,\u201d Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d on Monday.\n\nIn a note to clients this week downgrading its estimate of deliveries, analysts with JPMorgan said the damage to Tesla\u2019s brand has been serious.\n\n\u201cWe struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\u201d they wrote.\n\nTesla itself is warning about the fallout from retaliatory measures taken by countries targeted by Trump\u2019s tariffs, saying in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative this week that the company may be \u201cexposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions.\u201d\n\nAlready, the Canadian province of British Columbia has announced it was ending subsidies for Tesla\u2019s products.\n\nFor all the oxygen Musk has taken up with his political activities, concerns about Tesla products themselves are equally keeping investors and analysts up at night.\n\nMusk has \u201cneglect[ed] the rest of Tesla\u2019s automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving \u2014 automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles,\u201d Fred Lambert, who covers the company for the Electrek electric vehicle blog, wrote in a recent post.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk decided to kill Tesla\u2019s cheaper, $25,000 model while going all-in on the Cybertruck, whose sales have yet to take off, Lambert said.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s core business remains selling cars and batteries,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the business of selling cars is not going well for Tesla right now, and under Musk, there\u2019s no clear path to improvement.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, many analysts continue to take a much longer view of Tesla\u2019s outlook. In his most recent note to clients about the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the most closely watched observers of Tesla, summarized the long-term outlook that he says continues to justify the company\u2019s eye-watering valuation.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive \u2018pure play\u2019 to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\u201d he wrote in a note March 2.\n\nWhile that was before the most recent sell-off intensified, Jonas said he was already discounting market gyrations.\n\n\u201cWhile the journey may be volatile and non-linear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,\u201d he wrote.",

It is still nearly down 50% since its all time high on December 17.\n\nJPMorgan predicts that Tesla will deliver about 355,000 units, down 20% of its original prediction of 444,000.\n\nThe firm also thinks that Tesla stock will eventually drop to $120 per share.\n\nI think anyone involved in the auto industry in some way is kind of burnt out with the constant changes that are now the hallmark of the second Trump administration. A lot of these changes seem to be at the behest of Elon Musk himself, either directly through President Donald Trump or via his DOGE para-government apparatus.\n\nThese changes aren\u2019t exactly popular amongst the base that would normally purchase Tesla vehicles, and thus, it seems like it is once again time for Musk and Tesla to pay the piper. This week JP organ issued a not-so-good prediction for the brand: this will be the worst result for deliveries that Tesla has seen in three years.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nSpecifically, JPMorgan cut Tesla\u2019s delivery forecast down by 20% to 355,000 units, down from the initial analyst projection of 444,000. The firm's initial projection was already a little higher than the 430,000 units that most everyone else in this arena had already agreed upon. It also thinks that Tesla\u2019s stock still has a long way to go, with the potential to hit $120 per share, or about half of what it is now.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. For starters, the Trump administration's wanton bludgeoning of the U.S. market via tariffs has only served to hurt car companies, including Tesla. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what tariffs car companies and all associated suppliers will eventually be subject to. Today, it could be nothing. Or, if Canada, Mexico, the European Union or China somehow slight Trump in any way, then the tariffs are on. That\u2019s no good for any functional company that wants to plan for the future.\n\nNext, Elon Musk\u2019s right-wing exploits on X (n\u00e9e Twitter) and in real-life politics are now completely unignorable. His words and speech have moved past simple inflammatory tweets on social media, and well into the realm of influencing global politics. His influence is commonly perceived as dangerous by any sort of minority or non-right-wing person. He straight up called Canada \"not a real country,\" feeding into the growing not-a-call-but-actually-a-call for the annexation of America's neighbor to the north. That\u2019s only emboldened Canadians (and others across the globe) to boycott the brand.\n\nMoreover, sales have started to collapse in much of Europe. The Chinese market\u2019s sales are still somewhat strong, but that won\u2019t be enough to keep that momentum. Also, plenty of Chinese brands have been encroaching on Tesla\u2019s market share, something even the New York Times covered this week.\n\nPhoto by: BYD BYD Sealion 7\n\nAlso, the cars are just kind of old. The Model 3 and Model Y may have been updated, the latter much more recently, but they\u2019re essentially not all that much different than the cars they replaced. Add in Musk\u2019s behavior, inflation and high interest rates and Tesla has the perfect storm for reduced sales.\n\nTesla\u2019s woes have come out right in the middle of Q1, so we probably won\u2019t know for sure what the damage is until Q2 numbers are released in a few weeks. Either way, it\u2019s not looking so good for Tesla. JPMorgan says that Tesla\u2019s fall currently \u201chas no equal\u201d in the automotive market.\n\n\u201cWe struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\" the firm said.\n\nContact the author: Kevin.Williams@InsideEVs.com\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "The SU7 Ultra, Xiaomi\u2019s new flagship electric vehicle, went against a Tesla Model S Plaid in a drag race and it smoked it.\n\nThe car is ridiculously powerful, and it\u2019s about 35% cheaper than the Plaid, which is already affordable relative to its supercar performance.\n\nWe recently released a report about how impressed we are by Xiaomi\u2019s incredible rise in the EV market in China.\n\nIts first vehicle, the SU7, is a smash hit. It now consistently delivers over 20,000 units a month, it has surpassed the Tesla Model 3, its closest competitor, and has a more than 30-week-long backlog of orders.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nThe vehicle achieves more range and is cheaper than Model 3 while having additional features.\n\nLast month, Xiaomi launched a new top-of-the-line version of the SU7: the SU7 Ultra.\n\nThe headline is that the $72,800 (529,900 RMB) has a powertrain packing up 1,526 horsepower. That\u2019s absolutely insane. Xiaomi quotes a 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) acceleration in just 1.98 seconds.\n\nWhile the SU7 is meant more as a Model 3 competitor, the SU7 Ultra actually competes with Tesla\u2019s flagship Model S Plaid in terms of performance.\n\nThey organized a drag race between the SU7 Ultra and Model S Plaid. Here it is:\n\nAs you can see, the SU7 Ultra slipped at the start, which is not surprising considering how much power it outputs, but it still managed to catch up and beat the Model S Plaid.\n\nAt over 1,000 horsepower, many, myself included, thought that it was a bit mad to offer a vehicle like the Model S Plaid with such supercar power for a relatively cheap price \u2013 RMB 814,900 (approximately $112,000 USD) in China and just $95,000 in the US.\n\nBut now, Xiaomi shakes things up even more by offering 1,500 horses for just a little more than $70,000. It\u2019s mad.\n\nNow, I can hear your thoughts: \u201cbut it\u2019s just good in a straight line drag race like other EVs.\u201d Think again, the SU7 Ultra prototype claimed the title as the fastest four-door sedan at the famous Nurburgring race track in Germany.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nDamn, the Chinese are good. Xiaomi has come hard with the SU7, but the crazy thing is that it\u2019s just one of several Chinese top-of-the-line EVs coming out. Nio has the ET7, BYD has the U7, and there are many more.\n\nThese vehicles are all impressive in their own rights.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why American automakers are so scared and lobbied the US government for 100% tariffs on them.",

            "content": "Elon Musk began the week of 10 March with a friendly sit-down interview on Fox Business to talk about his work with the so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge) and the state of his businesses. Already, it had been a trying few days for the world\u2019s richest man, who was facing a Tesla stock selloff and fierce backlash over his attempts to radically overhaul the federal government. His net worth declined over $22bn on Monday alone.\n\nAfter Musk jokingly brushed off initial questions about the mounting pressure, host Larry Kudlow asked the Tesla and SpaceX CEO how he was managing to run his numerous companies amid the chaos.\n\n\u201cWith great difficulty,\u201d Musk answered, at first chuckling then taking a long sigh and staring off into the middle distance. \u201cI mean \u2026 yeah\u201d.\n\nThe past 10 days have marked several of the most significant setbacks for Musk in months. Tesla, arguably his marquee company, continued to fall in value as investors worried about the threat of trade war and possible recession \u2013 as well as declining profits. Escalating protests against the company over the billionaire\u2019s role in the government also grew in number and intensity across the US, coupled with rising cases of vandalism and social stigma against his cars. SpaceX has also struggled, with one of its rockets dramatically exploding in midflight last week and then an announcement on Wednesday that it was delaying a rescue mission to retrieve \u201cstranded\u201d astronauts. The company tried again two days later.\n\nAdding to Musk\u2019s headaches, his social media platform, X, experienced widespread outages throughout the day on Monday. During his Fox Business interview, he claimed that it was the result of a \u201cmassive cyberattack\u201d that the company had traced to the area of Ukraine.\n\nMusk is also dealing with increasing pushback over his role at Doge. Multiple outlets reported that the \u201cfirst buddy\u201d, as he\u2019s christened himself, got into a heated exchange with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, during a White House meeting last week, which ended with Donald Trump appearing to rein in Musk\u2019s power to make staffing decisions at government agencies with a Truth social post. A federal judge in California also issued a preliminary injunction on Thursday to reinstate thousands of the workers that Doge mass fired. Meanwhile, polling this week from Quinnipiac University shows that despite Musk repeatedly declaring that the public loves what Doge is doing, a strong majority of people disapprove of his initiative.\n\nAfter a long string of victories for Musk that included soaring share prices and a period of seemingly unchecked power following Trump\u2019s inauguration, some signs of strain are beginning to show on his grip on his empire. He has lost around $119bn this year so far, although staggeringly still boasts a fortune $100bn greater than the next richest man in the world, and faces questions from investors on whether his political activity is hurting his companies.\n\nRather than step away from his role in the White House, however, Musk appears to be doubling down.\n\nMusk turns to Maga world to turn Tesla\u2019s fortunes around\n\nTwo days after his labored appearance on Fox Business, Musk was once again in front of the cameras. This time, he was smiling alongside Trump on the White House lawn as the president cooed over a new red Tesla Model S and gushed to reporters about what a wonderful car it was.\n\n\u201cEverything is computer,\u201d Trump said, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful!\u201d\n\nAt the climax of the transformation of the White House into a car dealership, Trump announced that he had bought the Model S. He likewise spoke out in support of Musk and told reporters that Americans should \u201ccherish\u201d the billionaire. Others in the Maga world soon followed suit, declaring their backing for Tesla and urging their followers to do the same.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the display also gave the impression that Musk needed Trump to reverse his string of losses and quell the backlash against him. Trump stated at the event that he would label demonstrations against Tesla showrooms as domestic terrorism. Attorney general Pam Bondi announced on Friday she would launch an investigation into vandalism targeting the company.\n\n\u201cThey fought the law and the law won,\u201d Musk posted on X above news that Bondi was threatening vandals with up to 20 years in prison for attacking Tesla dealerships.\n\nThe backlash against Tesla does not appear to be slowing; more protests against Tesla are set for the coming week. In response, Musk is deepening his embrace with the Maga world, including its most distasteful denizens. He spent a sizable part of Friday afternoon posting support for Tesla and Doge from rightwing media influencer accounts and Fox News clips. At one point, he retweeted a post that compared attacks against Tesla vehicles and dealerships to Kristallnacht, the infamous Nazi pogrom against Jewish-owned businesses that took place at the onset of the Holocaust.",

Musk, who pumped millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s election and now oversees the so-called Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, didn\u2019t start Tesla when it formed in 2003, but as CEO he oversaw its rise as the dominant player in the EV space, although that\u2019s faced increasing challenge.\n\nDuring trips around parts of the metro area, the rented Tesla appeared to draw little notice aside from one possible minor incident.\n\nA driver in a pickup on Mack Avenue in Grosse Pointe Woods blasted his horn as he passed the Tesla, which was parked at a meter. A reporter, who was on the sidewalk, couldn\u2019t see any obvious reason for the blast other than the car.\n\nThe drive itself was marred by a vehicle with more than 120,000 apparently very rough miles in need of repair and a deep cleaning, that pulled to the left as it drove, seemed to lose its charge a bit too quickly and that came equipped with an air freshener hanging by the driver\u2019s side rear window that might only have enhanced what was hard to describe as anything other than an at times overpowering smell of marijuana. The acceleration, however, was as punchy and immediate as expected.\n\nThe car did give the reporter the opportunity to drive to a Meijer at East 13 Mile and Little Mack to charge up (as simple as plugging it in and waiting) and connect with a few fellow Tesla drivers. The location had what appeared to be eight Superchargers, and numerous Teslas pulled in and out during the stop.\n\nSeveral drivers declined to talk, although one man waiting inside his cousin\u2019s Cybertruck, which he\u2019d been driving, offered that he loved it. The truck, he said, \u201cfeels like a spaceship.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about Elon,\u201d he noted.\n\nSitting at a Supercharger in her Model Y, Laila Custovic, 28, of Fraser, said she loves the car, although charging it is annoying. She said it\u2019s a short trip to the Meijer from her home, though.\n\nAs for Musk, Custovic said she\u2019s \u201ctrying to stay out of it because it stresses me out.\u201d She\u2019s focused instead on her own life and her family.\n\nShe and her boyfriend got the car in September, and even though people have suggested she take it back, she noted that she\u2019s in a three-year lease.\n\nContact Eric D.

            "content": "\u201cWe struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\u201d wrote JP Morgan analysts this week. They were describing the reputation crisis facing Tesla, one of the world\u2019s leading electric vehicle manufacturers. The problem for Tesla is straightforward: their CEO, Elon Musk, has embraced hard-right politics. He has supported the neo-Nazi-friendly AfD party in Germany and even made a gesture that looked an awful lot like a Nazi salute at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. (Nazis were certainly thrilled by it.) Musk has a leading role in a presidential administration that is waging war on the civil service and gutting climate and environmental policies.\n\nMusk\u2019s political swing is a brand disaster for Tesla, because their product is electric cars. That means that their most likely consumers are Democrats. The Republican Party broadly dislikes electric cars and has promised a fossil future. While Tesla owners have a mix of politics, Gallup polling has found that 71 percent of Republicans \u201cwould not consider owning an electric vehicle\u201d (compared with 17 percent of Democrats). It\u2019s not purely ideological, because \u201cRepublicans are more likely to live in areas with less charging infrastructure [while] [c]ities and areas with more progressive governments typically have more plugs available.\u201d But because Teslas are expensive and charging an electric car can be inconvenient, climate consciousness and \u201cthe appeal of the \u2018green\u2019 movement\u201d is a major reason why people buy them. With their combination of luxury and eco-friendliness, Teslas long ago became \u201cthe car of choice for virtue-signaling Democrats,\u201d and in fact a major problem for EVs is that they are \u201cseen as political statements, not as cars.\u201d\n\nMusk has now made sure \u201cvirtue-signaling Democrats\u201d want nothing to do with his company. He couldn\u2019t have more enthusiastically embraced the MAGA movement. He spent hundreds of millions of dollars on getting Trump back into power and is personally supervising Trump\u2019s attack on regulatory agencies. In doing so, Musk is showing contempt for the very people most likely to want to buy his cars (professional class Democrats), and he\u2019s poisoning his brand. Driving a Tesla is now \u201clike driving a big red MAGA hat,\u201d and some have nicknamed it the \u201cSwasticar.\u201d (As with the hats, its best use might be as a people repellent.) The press is full of stories quoting Tesla owners who became embarrassed by their cars:\n\n\"I got it because it was great for the environment, and at the time he was more on the liberal side of politics,\" [said one owner.] But, she added, she felt that Musk by last fall had become \"volatile and turned radically right.\" \"I wouldn't want people to think I was a Trumper or that I am associated with Elon, because he is so tied to the brand\u2026 I am so happy I sold it, because if I was driving it today, in the current climate I would be so embarrassed.\"\n\nOf course, these are just anecdotes. But Tesla has taken a serious hit to its stock price, which was only temporarily reversed when Donald Trump turned the White House lawn into a Tesla showroom. (Ironically, Trump\u2019s endorsement may have actually hurt Tesla even more, because it only exacerbated the very problem facing the company.) Financial publications report that \u201cMusk has done little to reassure investors\u201d and patience is \u201cwearing thin\u201d even among Musk\u2019s most bullish supporters.\n\nTesla\u2019s stockholders and board members have long tolerated the fact that Musk doesn\u2019t give Tesla his full attention, since he\u2019s also the CEO of three other companies (SpaceX, Twitter/X, and xAI, as well as being involved in two others, Neuralink and The Boring Company). His inattention was immaterial as long as the share price kept going up, which for a long time it did, to the point where it looked like an unsustainable bubble. The interest of Tesla shareholders is in making money, not in efficiently and effectively bringing about a green transition. They therefore had no reason to object when Musk demanded a $50 billion pay package or created the world\u2019s ugliest truck, which has been recalled multiple times and is seeing its demand dry up. (To me, the Cybertruck looks like the car of choice for a death squad in a dystopian movie.)\n\nIt\u2019s a different story when Musk\u2019s antics begin to affect the bottom line, which is why investors are getting spooked. Eighty-five percent of them now believe Musk\u2019s politics are having a negative or very negative effect on the company, and they stand to lose quite a bit of money if he continues to show no interest in fixing the brand. Protests have now broken out at Tesla dealerships, flyers have appeared in the Bay Area demanding that owners sell their cars, liberal owners have put stickers on their Teslas disavowing Elon, and Teslas have even been vandalized.\n\nBoycotts are not always an effective weapon, but in the case of Tesla, protesters may have found an important way in which the world\u2019s richest man can be pressured, or at least punished, over his politics. If Elon Musk\u2019s presence harms Tesla enough, a huge portion of his own net worth will be wiped out, and with it some of his power, because Musk uses Tesla stock as collateral for loans and sells the stock in order to buy things. A collapsing Tesla stock genuinely erodes Elon\u2019s economic power. If the stock is hurt enough, Tesla\u2019s board will have no choice but to remove Musk as CEO in order to save the company.\n\nThis makes a strong case for an organized, disciplined, and total boycott of Tesla. Musk is doing catastrophic damage to the United States right now by helping a president who wants to destroy the social safety net, consumer protection, and the environment. Musk putting USAID into the \u201cwood chipper\u201d has already destroyed vital social programs in developing countries and has likely consigned many vulnerable poor people to disease and death. (That he did this with glee shows that he is a deeply evil man.) There are not many levers of power that the dissatisfied can use to stop or slow down Musk and Trump. But the boycott may be surprisingly powerful.\n\nThe method is simple: first, don\u2019t buy a Tesla. Very easy, because most of us weren\u2019t considering it anyway. There are other electric cars on the market. Many are cheaper than Teslas. But then go further. Friends don\u2019t let friends buy Teslas. If you know someone with a Tesla, encourage them to sell it. Don\u2019t even take a ride in a Tesla. It should feel like driving a big red MAGA hat. Protests outside dealerships should escalate.\n\nThis is a peaceful method of registering dissatisfaction. (No, do not destroy cars and Tesla dealerships! A protest becomes popular when it has the clear moral high ground.) It shows that Musk cannot rely on the public to continue buying his cars while he slashes federal programs. It will make Elon Musk panic, even if he doesn\u2019t show it. It will severely undermine his empire. It might even bring an end to \u201cDOGE,\u201d if it truly threatens the future of his company and he decides to prioritize saving Tesla over serving Trump.\n\nRepublicans are clearly alarmed by a Tesla boycott. Trump denounced it as \u201cillegal,\u201d which it is not, since anyone can decide what car they\u2019d like to buy. They are already trying to portray a Tesla boycott as hypocritical or somehow internally inconsistent. Oh ho ho, you are in favor of EV mandates and yet you boycott the leading EV manufacturer. Guess you don\u2019t care about climate change! But it\u2019s precisely because we care about climate change that we don\u2019t want the EPA destroyed, and Musk has allied himself with climate deniers and exposed that he never really cared about the effects of global warming. It\u2019s no different to boycott Tesla than it would have been to boycott Ford because Henry Ford was pro-Nazi. That wouldn\u2019t have meant an opposition to combustion engines, and boycotting Tesla says nothing about one\u2019s stance on EVs or climate. At the same time as we try to undermine Tesla specifically, we should be demanding a real Green New Deal that will lead America full speed ahead toward a complete switch to renewable energy, which must include a rapid and dramatic reduction in fossil fuel emissions.\n\nMusk has saddled himself to a movement that wants to undermine the EV transition. That\u2019s pretty foolish. His cars should, by now, have a virtually nonexistent customer base: is the Cybertruck supposed to appeal to \u201cpeople who vote Trump but also care about the climate\u201d? Good luck finding those people\u2014and getting them to shell out $100,000 for an ugly, poorly-made truck, one that people will throw eggs at, and will be booed and pelted with Mardi Gras beads if it tries to join a parade in New Orleans. Who wants the grief of being a Tesla owner in the Trump era?\n\nAs we know, capitalist companies are amoral in their pursuit of profit. It is therefore up to us, the public, to punish this company by peacefully stigmatizing the purchase of Musk\u2019s products and doing everything we can to drive the stock price to zero.",

To my friends who have sent me links to articles on the worldwide Tesla boycott \u2014 which could be one reason why U.S. Tesla sales fell 7% in 2024 even as electric vehicle industry sales increased 25%, and why Tesla stock has plunged 47% since December \u2014 I get it. But I\u2019m not changing my mind. Not even after President Donald Trump turned the White House into a Tesla showroom on Wednesday in an effort to get his followers to buy the cars \u2014 after spending three campaigns deriding EVs.\n\nForwarding the News Thoughtful, balanced reporting from the Forward and around the web, bringing you updated news and analysis each day. Terms (Required) I agree to the Forward's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Email (Required)\n\nI think there are better ways to register my opposition to what Musk is doing. And I do oppose him. But I believe that in order to be effective, \u201cthe Resistance\u201d needs to cool it on performative ideological litmus tests \u2014 like, say, protesting Trump\u2019s address to Congress last week by holding up sad little signs and dressing in pink \u2014 and put forth actual better ideas for improving the lives of all Americans. The best way to fight Musk\u2019s wrecking ball approach is to create more efficient, sustainable and affordable communities under Democratic control. Show, don\u2019t tell.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to hate Musk. It\u2019s not just the pseudo-Nazi salute he displayed amid inauguration festivities, or the fact that his Department of Government Efficiency has wreaked havoc on government efficiency and destroyed services that are, as in the case of USAID and the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, life-saving. He remains the largest single private donor to President Donald Trump, whose executive actions are stress-testing democracy. He\u2019s also reinstated neo-Nazis, misogynists, transphobes and attention-seeking antisemites like Kanye West, now known as Ye, and Jake Shields back to X, the social media platform he owns.\n\nBut when it comes to building a sustainable future? That\u2019s complicated. My personal politics have long compelled me to buy and support EVs. I owned one of the first Nissan Leafs sold in California, even when it meant an hour drive to pick my kids up at Jewish summer camp took three hours, including recharging. Those were the pioneer days of electric vehicles, kids, when just to eke out 65 miles of range between charges meant driving in August triple-digit heat with no air-conditioning.\n\nOK, yes, part of why my EV today is a Tesla is because I leased my Tesla Model Y in April 2024, long before Musk went MAGA, let alone full DOGE. In March 2024, while I was car shopping, Musk declared he would not donate to either candidate. Oops. And I have two years left on my lease, meaning the buyout and early termination fees would be a very costly political statement \u2014 even more so since Trump\u2019s chaos-economy has tanked the Dow.\n\nBut I also think it\u2019s worth separating the politics of Tesla from the politics of its owner. Yes, Musk benefits from every Tesla sold. But how about the rest of us?\n\nTesla changed everything. It created a car that non-EV diehards wanted. By creating a great car-owning experience, it incentivized an EV revolution, prompting massive improvements in EV infrastructure that have made my struggles as an early Leaf owner a thing of the distant past. The truth is that without Tesla, paving the way to a future in which climate change isn\u2019t further accelerated by fossil fuels consumed by personal cars would be much, much harder.\n\n\u201cTesla restarted the electric vehicle revolution,\u201d Martin Eberhard, who co-founded Tesla in 2003, said in a CNBC interview. \u201cWithout Tesla, there would not be electric cars today.\u201d\n\nMusk bought into Tesla in 2004, pushing the founders out by 2008. Tesla sold 147 cars that year. In 2024, it sold 1.79 million. In 2023, the Model Y, which I drive, was the world\u2019s best-selling vehicle, period.\n\nThat works out to approximately 6.27 million metric tons of CO\u2082 saved annually. If the world operated on Tesla Powerwalls hooked to Tesla Solar panels, those savings would go up to 8.2 million metric tons per year \u2014 about what 373 million trees, or 4,000 Central Parks worth of trees, absorb in a year.\n\nI get why everyone around me is eager to stop contributing to Musk\u2019s already unfathomable wealth. Yes, his net worth has fallen since Trump took office \u2014 after skyrocketing post-election \u2014 but it\u2019s still near the $400 billion mark. Realistically, no boycott on earth is going to make a material enough change in his portfolio to push him to switch course. Remember, X \u2014 formerly Twitter \u2014 has depreciated by close to 80% since Musk purchased it in 2022. If that loss has in any way prompted Musk to think twice about the consequences of his political actions, well, I haven\u2019t seen the evidence.\n\nAnd what about the engineers, designers, even the really nice Tesla service dude who just installed my car\u2019s optional HEPA filter? Do they deserve to be rewarded for their earth-saving work?\n\nI think yes. I understand not everyone agrees with me. \u201cWon\u2019t you please consider getting rid of your Tesla vehicle,\u201d read that letter dropped at our doorstep last week. \u201cThe message you are sending at this point is, \u2018I am a Nazi too.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt least one other Tesla owner on our block got the same letter, which suspiciously carries a non-existent return address. I\u2019m not sure who is behind the ingenious PR campaign of getting your neighbors to change by calling them Nazis, but I have questions:\n\nIf you drive any gas-powered car, aren\u2019t you sending dollars to autocratic petro-states and oil companies who are drill-baby-drilling us toward climate disaster?\n\nIf you buy anything made in China, aren\u2019t you helping fund a regime that is enslaving the Uyghurs, destroying Tibetan culture, threatening Taiwanese independence and sending political protesters to gulags?\n\nDo you know the politics of every CEO of every company you buy from, and choose accordingly? Have you checked in on Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos lately as he neuters The Washington Post?\n\nThat\u2019s not to say I won\u2019t fight against DOGE, X and Musk\u2019s overreach elsewhere, through my journalism, my vote, shareholder activism, and standing side-by-side with unnecessarily fired workers. My wonderful neighbors and I, meanwhile, worked out a simple solution: I got one of those bumper stickers that reads, \u201cI Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy.\u201d (And yes, I bought it on Amazon).\n\nAs for Musk, I ask him to consider the trajectory he\u2019s on. Even unlimited wealth can\u2019t buy you a good name. And neither can doing Donald Trump\u2019s bidding. Just ask Rudy Giuliani.",

Can Tesla win them over, too?\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nOnce upon a time, owning a Tesla signaled that a driver was tech-savvy, eco-conscious, or just plain rich. Now, for many people, it signals something different: an endorsement of Elon Musk's politics.\n\nMusk's rightward turn \u2014 including his embrace of President Trump, his central role in slashing and dismantling government agencies, a litany of controversial remarks and one lightning rod of a gesture \u2014 has triggered a remarkable backlash, analysts say.\n\nMassive protests at Tesla dealerships. Owners with buyers' remorse and apologetic bumper stickers. People calling Teslas \"swasticars.\" Vandalism, and sometimes violence, against Tesla vehicles, chargers and storefronts.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut, of course, there are also many Americans who celebrate Musk's actions. Could Republican support \u2014 in some cases, a backlash to the backlash \u2014 make up for lost sales?\n\nPresident Trump seems to hope so: Despite his previous scathing criticisms of electric vehicles over price and travel range, this week, he said that he'd buy a Tesla as a \"show of support\" for his adviser. In a photo op at the White House, he sat in a red Model S and told reporters he hoped his purchase would boost Tesla sales.\n\nSurvey data does clearly show that the Tesla brand is soaring in popularity among Republicans and conservatives. But there's a problem for the auto company: The liberals, moderates and independents that Musk is driving away are more likely to consider an electric vehicle. The new fans he's winning over \u2014 for now \u2014 not so much. Some surveys have found a gap of more than 20 percentage points.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"There are going to be no explosion of sales that recover the losses that Tesla has been enduring because of this political shift,\" says Alexander Edwards, the head of Strategic Vision, a company that surveys new vehicle buyers. \"All they've done is alienate their primary consumer,\" and won new fans who aren't in a position to buy an EV, he says.\n\nMike Murphy, a Republican political consultant, is more optimistic. Slightly. \"He could help make Republicans consider EVs more, take a little of the political stigma away,\" he says. \"But it has nowhere near the short-term impact upon Tesla that Elon's Bond villain status among Democrats and among Harris voters has.\"\n\n\n\nFor some conservatives, Musk is a reason to buy\n\nThe backlash against Musk has been brewing at least since 2022, when he announced his plans to buy Twitter and his social media posting, often on political topics, increased significantly. And from the beginning, responses did cut both ways.\n\nAt the time, Norman Pieni\u0105\u017cek was beyond frustrated with Twitter and other social media platforms. In the 1980s, Pieni\u0105\u017cek had been an underground publisher in Poland, fighting against censorship after the government imposed martial law there. He later moved to the U.S., and when his posts challenging the science around COVID were taken down by Facebook and Twitter, it felt like censorship all over again.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThen Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter to unlock its potential as \"the platform for free speech around the globe.\"\n\n\"I said 'Okay, that's my guy,'\" Pieni\u0105\u017cek recalled. He needed a new car anyway, and was planning to get a gas-powered one. But he changed his mind. \"My heart is with him,\" he remembers thinking. \"I have to put my money where my heart is.\"\n\nHe bought a Model X.\n\ntoggle caption Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, some conservative buyers are motivated by disgust with the backlash against Musk and Trump, which they consider unfair.\n\n\"It's honestly made me want to buy more cars from Tesla,\" says Kamali Wright, who works in marketing in Florida. He owns a Model 3 and calls Musk and Trump his two favorite people.\n\n\"If everybody's going to hate on this guy,\" he says, \"that's going to make me buy even more.\"\n\nWright wants to get a Cybertruck next.\n\n\n\nData shows Republican support is rising\n\nThe investment banking company Stifel, working with polling firm Morning Consult, found that among Republicans, favorable opinions of Tesla started rising in February 2024, while interest in buying one picked up that August. Among Democrats, net positive views of Tesla dropped 22 percentage points from February; among Republicans, they rose 16 percentage points. Democratic net purchase consideration dropped 12 percentage points since August; among Republicans, it increased 13 percentage points.\n\n\"It's pretty eye-opening,\" says analyst Stephen Gengaro, who wrote a report on the findings.\n\nBut then he pulls up a different chart, showing how political partisanship lines up with overall interest in buying an EV. And there, Democrats hovered 10 percentage points above Republicans throughout the last four years, through January 2025.\n\nAnd that's not just a question of ideological opposition to battery-powered cars. It's also about what Republicans tend to prefer in a vehicle. EVs' towing problems, for instance, can be an issue for Republican buyers, who are \"significantly more likely to be in a truck and using their vehicle for work,\" notes Edwards, of Strategic Vision. And charging infrastructure tends to be concentrated in cities; rural areas tend Republican. Even outside cities, states with progressive governments have been more interested in building out EV infrastructure as part of fighting climate change. Add it up, and it tips the scale against EVs for some buyers.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Tesla has gained a large number of Republican fans who love what Mr. Musk is doing, both politically and with the brand of vehicle and with social media,\" says Edwards. \"But they have little interest in an electrified vehicle.\"\n\nEdwards has been asking Tesla buyers about their political affiliations for the last decade. Last year, for the first time the data showed that the average Tesla buyer was more likely to be a Republican than a Democrat.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut that wasn't because Republican purchases were surging; it was because Democrats were fleeing the brand.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats continue to dominate among buyers of other electric vehicles.\n\nLoading...\n\nEdwards thinks this political shift also explains a trend among car shoppers overall. His data shows the number of buyers who would \"definitely consider\" a Tesla dropped by nearly two-thirds between October 2021 and December 2024.\n\nIn short, it's a problem for Tesla that the demographic that's the most interested in EVs \u2014 liberals and progressives \u2014 is finding the most successful EV-maker in America repellent.\n\nAfter the election, Murphy, the Republican strategist, conducted a national poll focused on Musk. \"If you voted for Kamala Harris, you give Elon a 76% negative rating and only a 5% positive rating \u2014 which is saying something, because the margin of error on the poll is 4%,\" he says. \"So scientifically, [we] can't even quite prove there are Harris voters who like Elon on the planet.\"\n\n\n\nPolitics don't explain all Tesla's woes\n\nTesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment, but Musk has previously said it's the quality of the product that matters, not a CEO's views.\n\nBut Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the car data company Edmunds, says that Tesla is different from other car companies. Most Americans probably couldn't name another auto CEO, she points out.\n\nShe thinks it's certainly true that some new Republican buyers will make up for some lost sales to Democrats. But Tesla's problem is more profound than that, she says: \"Why would you ever want to alienate current customers \u2014 or just potential buyers in general?\"\n\nLoading...\n\nStill, it's possible to overstate the role of politics in Tesla's flagging sales. There's more competition for the brand, as companies like General Motors, Ford, Honda and Hyundai ramp up their EV production (and globally, Chinese automakers take a huge slice of the EV market). Tesla is also rolling out an update to the Model Y, giving shoppers a reason to wait a few months; analysts say that's currently pulling pull sales down.\n\nThere are also plenty of drivers who say their feelings about Musk have nothing to do with what's in their driveway. Some people are outraged by Musk but still think Teslas are superior vehicles. Some Trump fans love Musk but can't give up the growl of an engine. And there's Nancy Baroody, who is a big fan of Musk \u2014 when I ask if that played any role in her decision to buy a Tesla last fall, she's a little baffled.\" I really don't let politics influence what kind of a product I like,\" she says.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFor EVs, politicization isn't new\n\nPolitics aren't everything for a car brand \u2014 but they're still something. And that's especially true for EVs.\n\nMurphy, who has launched a group called the American EV Jobs Alliance to try to build bipartisan support for electric vehicles, has spent years pondering why more Republicans won't buy them. He argues that long before Musk's political turn, EVs were already politicized \u2014 as symbols of \"green,\" liberal values.\n\n\"They were seen as political statements, not as cars,\" he says. \"And that's not good for selling more electric vehicles.\"\n\ntoggle caption Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nMurphy would like to see EVs sold on their merits: The gas savings, the quick acceleration, the smooth and quiet ride, never having to do another oil change. Yes, they're better for the climate, and that motivates many buyers to seek them out. But leave that out of the marketing, he urges automakers.\n\n\"Take the politics out of it,\" he says, \"and let people with clear eyes pick the car that's best for them.\" If they did, he thinks, a lot more of them would pick EVs.\n\nBut right now, Murphy says, the politics of buying an EV aren't going away \u2014 just getting more complicated. What Musk is doing, he says, is a little bit like pouring gasoline on a battery fire.",

            "content": "On Saturday morning, I woke up to a nightmare of notifications. On Sunday, it got worse. Elon Musk had tweeted and amplified inflammatory lies about me and Tesla Takedown, a growing national grassroots movement peacefully protesting at Tesla showrooms that I\u2019m proudly a part of. Musk tweeted: \u201cCosta is committing crimes.\u201d\n\nAs a longtime local activist and organizer in Seattle, I\u2019m accustomed to some conflict with powerful forces. The intention of the Tesla Takedown movement is to make a strong public stand against the tech oligarchy behind the Trump administration\u2019s cruel and illegal actions, and to encourage Americans to sell their Teslas and dump the company\u2019s stock. Protests like these \u2013 peaceful, locally organized, and spreading across the world \u2013 are at the heart of free speech in a democracy and a cornerstone of US political traditions. So it\u2019s telling that the response from so-called \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk has been to single out individuals \u2013 and spread lies about us and our movement. The harassment that has followed his post has been frightening.\n\nIt\u2019s also proof that the Tesla Takedown campaign is working.\n\nI\u2019d like to address the lies spread about me by the world\u2019s richest man and X users. I have not committed any crimes. I have not been funded by ActBlue, or by George Soros \u2013 that name is simply a tired antisemitic dog whistle. I\u2019m not inspired by Luigi Mangione nor have I ever said that I am. I am not encouraging any vandalism. Nobody is getting paid to come to these protests. I am not the leader of Tesla Takedown. In fact, no one is.\n\nIf we can\u2019t show our opposition to what the government is doing, then we\u2019re living in a dictatorship\n\nHere is the truth: Tesla Takedown is a completely decentralized movement with hundreds of protests taking place around the globe, drawing many thousands of people out of their homes and on to the public sidewalks to stand up for programs that support poor people, older people, veterans, the sick. Out of care and concern for others \u2013 a foreign concept to those currently in power \u2013 people are offering what they can to help. I\u2019ve offered to schlep supplies, and helped someone find a bullhorn. The environmentally focused Seattle organization I\u2019m a part of, Troublemakers, hosts a map where other people and groups can post the locations of forthcoming demonstrations. Troublemakers has about $3,500 in its bank accounts. All of this is a bare-bones, low-budget, people-powered movement \u2013 which is exactly why Musk is afraid of it, and casting about to find a villain.\n\nThere are currently 91 Tesla Takedown protests planned across the world this coming weekend, and there will be more the weekend after that. If there isn\u2019t one at the Tesla showroom nearest you, you can start one just by showing up with some friends or family, maybe making some cardboard signs. This exercise of our fundamental first amendment right to peaceably assemble is giving an effective outlet to the outrage this administration has caused here and around the globe, and we\u2019re making a difference. Tesla stock has fallen precipitously, losing a quarter of its value in the months since the protests began. On Wednesday, JP Morgan analysts told Quartz: \u201cWe struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly.\u201d Donald Trump even got on X this week to defensively claim that he\u2019ll be buying a Tesla to support his good friend Musk. More and more people are unloading the company\u2019s stock and selling their cars. The movement is growing and the administration is taking notice. When enough of us come together to do what we can, this is what effective opposition can be.\n\nMusk\u2019s false accusations against me won\u2019t stop this movement, because he is inflicting real harm on the American public and people around the world. In fact, Musk and Trump are the ones committing crimes. Just this week they have announced their intentions to slash social security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and food stamps. They are gutting public institutions, stripping environmental protections, destabilizing the economy and people\u2019s lives. Musk is openly and gleefully firing federal workers en masse and dismantling programs that serve millions at home and across the globe. They\u2019ve ignored multiple judicial orders, and refused to restart payments that they were ordered to. The unofficial agency Musk leads, the \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d, is digging into systems and pushing out public servants, when its own staff hasn\u2019t received so much as a background check. Musk\u2019s conflicts of interest are piling up without any disclosures. All of the programs this administration is destroying are paid for by people like you and me through our taxes. Tesla \u2013 a billion-dollar company \u2013 shelled out zero income tax last year. Justice through government processes will be slow, if it comes at all.\n\nIf we can\u2019t show our opposition to what the government is doing, we are living in a dictatorship. If we are criminalized for calling out the rich and powerful for their illegal actions, that is a dictatorship. I don\u2019t want to live in a dictatorship.\n\nMake no mistake, it\u2019s scary to be personally called out by the richest man in the world on the platform he owns. It\u2019s scary to be targeted by a seemingly endless number of his devoted trolls and bots. To be doxxed, to have one\u2019s life pored over and exposed, to be smeared, attacked and falsely accused. It\u2019s scarier still when the FBI director gets tagged into the threads and asked to investigate. But I\u2019m not backing down \u2013 and even if I did, it wouldn\u2019t make a dent in this movement. Hundreds if not thousands of people have participated in the ways that I have.\n\nThe truth is, the people are powerful. I\u2019ve always believed that. And now we know that Elon Musk does too.",

Even after rebounding since Monday, perhaps with some help from Donald Trump\u2019s South Lawn salesmanship, Tesla\u2019s stock price is down almost 40 percent since January 1.\n\nSome of that drop is down to concrete issues with Tesla\u2019s core car business: Sales last year fell for the first time in more than a decade, and Wall Street analysts are now estimating that they will have fallen again in the most recent quarter. Tesla is facing fierce price competition in China, where its year-over-year sales fell by 49 percent in February, and steeply declining sales in Western Europe. Although the company has promised that it will be rolling out new, more affordable models later this year, details have been sparse at best.\n\nThe most important driver of Tesla\u2019s share slump, however, can be summed up in two words: Elon Musk. Tesla has always been a \u201cstory stock,\u201d which is to say the sort of investment whose price depends less on a company\u2019s economic fundamentals and more on a story of what its future will be. Tesla\u2019s problem right now is that the hero, and narrator, of its story has gone AWOL.\n\nInvestor expectations of what Tesla is going to achieve have certainly changed over time. In the past, investors were focused on Tesla\u2019s potential to corner the global electric-vehicle market. Today, that ambition has receded, as competition\u2014particularly from China\u2014has intensified. Instead, investors now envision the company dominating the future market for self-driving cars and AI robotics. But the throughline of the Tesla story has always remained the same: the idea of Musk\u2019s genius and ability to guide the company into the future. \u201cIt is almost impossible to separate Tesla, the company, from Musk,\u201d the finance professor Aswath Damodaran has written previously. \u201cWhat you believe about one will drive what you believe about the other.\u201d And it\u2019s because investors have bought into Musk\u2019s over-the-top visions of Tesla\u2019s future that, even now, the company\u2019s shares trade at an outrageous price-to-earnings ratio, and its market cap is greater than that of the next nine biggest car companies combined.\n\nThe problem for Tesla at the moment is that investors\u2019 faith in Musk has been shaken. His political activities\u2014not only his work for the Trump administration but also his public support of the far-right AfD party in Germany\u2014have led to a backlash against Tesla that certainly seems to have depressed sales in the United States and Europe. His mercurial social-media habits and goofy displays such as waving around a chain saw onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference are not reassuring to major investors. The reverse: A new Morgan Stanley investor survey found that 85 percent of respondents think that Musk\u2019s political involvement is having \u201ca negative or extremely negative impact on Tesla\u2019s business fundamentals.\u201d\n\nAside from all the noise, the simple reality is that Tesla now seems to be far down on the list of Musk\u2019s priorities, behind DOGE, SpaceX, his new AI venture, and X. Musk is running a government agency, serving as the CEO of three companies, funding political campaigns, threatening politicians with potential primaries, and posting nonstop on social media. In the most literal sense, he just isn\u2019t showing that much interest in building cars anymore. Since the beginning of the year, he has offered no real vision of how Tesla will deal with challenges such as the global rise of highly competitive EV manufacturers such as China\u2019s BYD. In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he conceded that he was having \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d running all of his enterprises; about the best he could offer investors was a quote from a Monty Python movie: \u201cAlways look on the bright side of life.\u201d Musk\u2019s seeming indifference to the car business has become so noticeable that in a note to investors this week, the Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives\u2014arguably the biggest Tesla bull on Wall Street\u2014criticized him for \u201cshowing no attention to Tesla during this turbulent time.\u201d\n\nThe appearance at the White House with Trump on Tuesday for what was effectively a car commercial seemed like an implicit recognition by Musk that he needs to change his ways (or at least pretend to do so). As Trump posed in a Tesla Model S that he said he was buying, Musk promised that the company would double its U.S. production over the next two years. Neither man has a great record of keeping promises, but the event was a sign that Musk was doing something to stop the bleeding. Some investors, at least, liked the story: By market close yesterday, Tesla\u2019s stock was up more than 10 percent from its Monday low.\n\nWhether that will be enough to make up for the losses of the past four months is another question. Tesla investors are used to volatility; since 2018, the company\u2019s stock price has fallen 40 percent or more on eight different occasions. And story stocks can bounce back quickly if they can recapture investors\u2019 attention and belief. But that will require Musk to demonstrate more conviction and interest in the way he talks about, and runs, Tesla. Right now, he looks like a storyteller who\u2019s lost the plot.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nThis evening, while strolling through the \u201cRIVIAN Electric Vehicles Discussion\u201d group on Facebook, I came across a post by Kevin Brady. Kevin is considering the Rivian R1S to replace his 2018 Tesla Model 3. He currently owns a Model Y, but space is becoming a challenge with three growing kids and a love for camping and skiing. He shared his thoughts, saying:\n\n\u201cWe love road trips, skiing, and camping, but the Model Y is getting tight. We use a cargo box and a hitch carrier, and it still feels like we\u2019re maxing out space. I need a detailed comparison of the R1S trim levels and options to make the best decision for my family.\u201d\n\nKevin\u2019s dilemma is one that many EV enthusiasts face when upgrading to a larger vehicle. The Tesla Model Y is a fantastic electric SUV that offers efficiency, technology, and access to Tesla's Supercharger network. However, the Rivian R1S presents itself as a rugged, adventure-ready SUV with ample space and off-road capability. Let\u2019s dive into a detailed comparison to help Kevin and others in his situation make an informed decision.\n\nRivian R1S vs. Tesla Model Y: Key Differences\n\nStorage and Space\n\nOne of the biggest concerns for Kevin is cargo space. The Model Y has 76 cubic feet of total cargo space, while the Rivian R1S boasts 104 cubic feet. Additionally, the R1S features a sizable frunk, under-floor storage, and a tailgate that makes loading and unloading gear easier.\n\nNicholas, a member of the Facebook group, shared his experience:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a Tesla, but I\u2019ve owned and currently have a Gen 1 Rivian R1S after having an iX. In terms of storage and capability, the Rivian is superior. With all the storage space and a roof box, there\u2019s no issue fitting 4-5 people along with their gear, skis, etc.\u201d\n\nFor a family that frequently travels with extra equipment, the R1S offers a clear advantage. Here\u2019s why a Rivian R1S owner loves the storage and comfort on long trips.\n\nTrim Levels and Battery Options\n\nThe Tesla Model Y comes in two primary configurations: Long Range AWD and Performance, offering 310-330 miles of range. The Rivian R1S, on the other hand, has multiple battery pack options:\n\nStandard Pack (270 miles range)\n\n(270 miles range) Large Pack (352 miles range)\n\n(352 miles range) Max Pack (400+ miles range)\n\nNicholas pointed out a key difference:\n\n\u201cYes, the Gen 2 frunk is slightly smaller than my launch edition, but you can opt for a bigger battery. I\u2019ve road-tripped to ski country and had no issues with range, especially with some planning, but since you\u2019re already an experienced EV family, I can\u2019t imagine it being a problem. One key difference: the Rivian isn\u2019t as efficient as Tesla or most other EVs, so you\u2019ll use more energy regardless. But I love it.\u201d\n\nWhile the Model Y is more energy-efficient, the R1S compensates with larger battery packs and higher off-road capabilities. A Rivian R1S owner tested range and charging capabilities over a 1,300-mile trip.\n\nAdventure and Off-Road Capability\n\nIf off-road adventures are part of your lifestyle, the R1S is the clear winner. It comes with:\n\nQuad-Motor AWD (available in the Gen 1 model)\n\nAdaptive air suspension with 14.9 inches of ground clearance\n\nDrive modes for snow, sand, and mud\n\nKevin\u2019s love for skiing makes this an important factor. The Model Y has AWD but lacks the same off-road versatility. Another R1S owner shares why the vehicle\u2019s smooth ride and adventure readiness made it their top choice.\n\nCharging and Road Trips\n\nTesla\u2019s Supercharger network is unmatched, making the Model Y a better option for frequent long-distance travelers. However, recent developments allow Rivian owners to access Tesla Superchargers, mitigating this advantage.\n\nFor instance, one Rivian owner took a 1,300-mile road trip using Tesla chargers, which proves the infrastructure is improving for non-Tesla EVs. Read more about this experience here.\n\nMy Opinion\n\nAs someone who follows EV developments closely, I think Kevin\u2019s choice ultimately depends on his family\u2019s lifestyle. If efficiency, lower cost, and a more refined software experience are the top priorities, the Model Y is still an outstanding choice. However, if he truly values adventure, cargo space, and rugged capability, the R1S is the better fit. Personally, I find the R1S far more exciting, it\u2019s built for adventure, can handle rough terrain, and still provides ample luxury. While it might not be as energy efficient as the Model Y, the trade-offs in space and capability make it a vehicle that can grow with a family over the years. Plus, the thrill of knowing you can tackle any terrain is an underrated factor that makes driving more enjoyable.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Which SUV Is Right for Kevin?\n\nFor efficiency, ease of charging, and compact size, the Tesla Model Y remains a great all-around EV. However, given Kevin\u2019s needs for more space, better cargo management, and adventure capabilities, the Rivian R1S emerges as the ultimate family SUV.\n\nKevin\u2019s dilemma is common among growing families who need to balance efficiency, storage, and adventure-readiness. The choice comes down to whether the superior range and efficiency of the Model Y outweigh the R1S\u2019s extra space, ruggedness, and towing capabilities. If you\u2019re considering the R1S, check out insights on the latest Gen 2 features.\n\nMoral Lesson\n\nChoosing the right vehicle isn\u2019t just about range and price. It\u2019s about lifestyle. A car should enhance your adventures, not limit them. Think long-term about how your needs will evolve.\n\nYour Turn\n\nWhat factors influenced your decision between a Tesla and a Rivian? If you own an R1S or Model Y, how has it worked for your family and road trips?\n\nPlease share your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nNarek Hareyan is a young automotive journalist with experience in a golf cart dealership and an interest in the automotive industry.

Without factoring in the federal incentives that Trump is trying to get rid of, the new Model Y starts at $59,990 for the Launch Series long range dual-motor version, which is the only kind of Model Y facelift currently available to order. (A pre-facelift rear-wheel-drive Model Y costs $44,990; add $3,000 for AWD and $8,000 for FSD, which is standard on the new Launch model.) A 327-mile range and 4.1-second 0-to-60-mph time for the new Model Y is good, sure, but no longer class-leading or impressive. The Model Y's charging speeds also aren't as good as other EVs with 800-volt architecture.\n\nI could list a lot of similarly priced or segmented EVs that I'd rather have than a Model Y, and I will: Chevrolet Equinox EV, Kia EV6, Polestar 2, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Mercedes-Benz EQB, Cadillac Lyriq, Volvo EX40. I could go on. There are also a bunch of electric cars on sale that might have less range and fewer features than the Tesla, and that might not be fantastic cars in general, but I would still rather drive than a Model Y. I don't really want to drive a Toyota BZ4X, but at least it's not a Tesla. And there are more great new EVs coming out all the time, across various segments and price points.\n\nReally, there is one EV that should put the nail in the coffin to any Model Y considerations: the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Newly face-lifted for 2025, the Ioniq 5 is quicker, more efficient, has a longer range, more features, better technology and even better styling than before. It's vastly nicer to look at and be in than the Model Y. Plus, it now has the Tesla-style NACS port, so you have access to the Tesla Supercharger network for easier road tripping. While spending money to charge at Tesla stations is still putting money into Musk's pocket, and you won't get the Ioniq 5's max charge speeds at a Tesla charger anyway, I do support owners of non-Tesla EVs hogging all of the spots at Tesla stations. The Ioniq 5 is now built in the U.S., too, so you're supporting American manufacturing. Just don't buy the damn Model Y.",

Some are embarrassed or ashamed by the association with Musk, they said, and several have slapped on bumper stickers that let people know they purchased the car before Musk took on his new public role.\n\nBateman has put a bumper sticker on the back window of his Tesla stating, \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy.\u201d (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Musk and Tesla still dominate the electric-vehicle market, the backlash against Musk\u2019s conservative politics could be contributing to Tesla\u2019s plunging stock price and falling resale values, especially in liberal-leaning California, industry experts said.\n\nTesla stock has dropped 26% over the last month and has fallen 37% year to date, reflecting concerns among some investors that Musk is not spending enough time tending to his highest-profile business.\n\nThe protests come at a pivotal time for Tesla, which already was facing a slowdown.\n\nVehicle sales declined for the first time in the company\u2019s history last year, the company reported in January.

It was a show of loyalty to Musk that will certainly earn Tesla some fans on the right side of the political spectrum, according to experts, but is sure to alienate others.

Resale prices for used Teslas could suggest there is plunging demand for the vehicles, he said.\n\nIn February, Tesla topped the list of brands that lost the most resale value year over year, followed by Maserati and Chrysler, according to data provided by Brauer. The price of a used Tesla Model S and Model Y each dropped by about 16% last month from a year earlier. The price of a used Model 3 dropped 13.5% over the same period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPrice is a reflection of supply and demand,\u201d Brauer said. \u201cSo it could be that nobody wants to buy them anymore, or that there\u2019s a massive influx of them available, or both.\u201d\n\nAmid the investor worries, opponents of Trump have been organizing against Musk and his car company, holding protests across the country to encourage people to get rid of their Teslas and denounce Musk. Others have taken out their frustration by vandalising or destroying the electric vehicles and their charging stations.\n\nIn San Francisco, fliers posted around the city feature a photo of Musk allegedly performing a Nazi salute and advise readers to \u201csell your swasticar.\u201d\n\nMusk dismissed accusations that the salute was a Nazi-era gesture and accused the liberal news media of misconstruing his actions.\n\nPolitics Musk says his gestures at Trump inauguration event weren\u2019t Nazi salutes Musk made the gestures during a giddy speech celebrating Trump\u2019s return to power at a rally Monday at Capital One Arena in Washington. Many condemn the gestures, but not the ADL.\n\npolitical activism against a vehicle brand isn\u2019t common, Brauer said, it has happened before. In the mid-2000s, as awareness of climate change rose, many began protesting large gas-guzzling vehicles such as Hummers by throwing eggs at them.\n\nMusk has other ventures apart from electric vehicles, including spacecraft maker SpaceX, internet service provider Starlink and neurotechnology company Neuralink. But his conservative image is most closely tied to Teslas, and the cars have become inseparable from his personal brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMusk is going to have to do a better job of balancing his DOGE and Trump responsibilities versus being chief executive of Tesla,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has a buy rating on Tesla stock. \u201cWhen you\u2019re so synonymous with a brand, it\u2019s a careful balance and it\u2019s almost reached a tipping point.\u201d\n\nIves estimated that fewer than 5% of Tesla owners would be dissuaded from buying another Tesla because of Musk\u2019s political actions. But the poor reputation could hurt the company\u2019s bottom line, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re selling a mass-market vehicle and you take a political affiliation like this, there\u2019s a downside to it,\u201d Ives said.\n\nMusk has lost favor with many customers he once appealed to, including Tesla driver Dan Bateman, 75.\n\nBateman, a retired Diamond Bar resident who has driven a Tesla for five years, said he\u2019s no longer happy with the image the car portrays. He identifies politically as center-left and wanted an electric vehicle to help get gas cars off the road, he said.\n\n\u201cMy original statement was that I\u2019m doing my small part toward ending climate change,\u201d Bateman said. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be electric cars on the road without Elon and it seems like he\u2019s turned his back on that. I feel like I\u2019ve been betrayed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA number of bumper stickers are available online for Tesla drivers who want to show their disapproval of Musk and his politics. (Peter Morgan / Associated Press)\n\nBateman doesn\u2019t plan to sell his Tesla, but he did put on a bumper sticker that reads, \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy.\u201d\n\nSeveral similar bumper stickers are available online for Tesla drivers who want to show their disapproval. \u201cThis is my last Tesla,\u201d one of them says.\n\nBateman said he\u2019s frustrated by Musk\u2019s actions, but the resale value of his car has plummeted too much to make sense to sell. He purchased it for about $90,000, he said, and estimates it\u2019s now worth $13,000.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to scrap it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just feel so disappointed by him.\u201d\n\nTesla has been the most prominent option among electric vehicles for years and was once the only mainstream option, said Sam Abuelsamid from the transportation technology company Telemetry Insights. Early EV adopters who were passionate about the climate change aspect probably were drawn to the brand, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople who buy EVs have been somewhat more left-leaning politically,\u201d Abuelsamid said. \u201cThey\u2019re generally more inclined to believe that climate change is an issue and that we need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Bateman, many Tesla drivers believe that Musk has lost sight of the mission that attracted them to the vehicles in the first place, he said.\n\nBateman said he\u2019s frustrated by Musk\u2019s actions, but the resale value of his car has plummeted too much to make sense to sell. He purchased it for about $90,000, he said, and estimates it\u2019s now worth $13,000. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cAs they\u2019ve seen Musk show his true colors of his personal politics and his personal attitudes, they have decided that this is not someone that they want to support with their dollars,\u201d Abuelsamid said.\n\nMusk\u2019s public persona is creating problems for all Tesla drivers, not just those who oppose DOGE and the Trump administration. A Cybertruck driver, who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation, said someone recently left a crude message drawn in dust on his vehicle.\n\nThe 44-year-old Ventura County resident ordered his Cybertruck in 2019, just days after preorders became available. He received it in September 2024 and said he never had political motivations for making the $130,000 purchase.\n\n\u201cMusk is going to do what he wants and what he thinks is right and I\u2019m not necessarily judging him for that,\u201d the Cybertruck driver said. \u201cBut he is alienating a big portion of consumers and potentially resulting in backlash against existing customers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe worries about his truck being damaged when he leaves it parked for long periods, but he doesn\u2019t feel ashamed to drive it around.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t buy it as a political symbol,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have political things on the truck or anything like that. So why should I feel embarrassed?\u201d",

She hurled more Molotov cocktails, attempted to set the dealership ablaze and spray-painted the words \u201cnazi cars\u201d on the building, before ultimately being arrested last week, Loveland police said. Musk has been accused of supporting antisemitic claims and insulting victims of Nazism.\n\nAbout 2,000 miles east, more than half a dozen Tesla charging stations were intentionally set on fire near Boston, police said last week. At a Tesla dealership in nearby Dedham, Massachusetts, police said Tuesday that a man spray-painted three vehicles, marking the second time the dealership was tagged within the last two weeks.\n\nOn the West Coast, in Tigard, Oregon, police said last week that at least seven shots were fired at a Tesla dealership there that morning, damaging three cars and shattering windows.\n\nAnd on Friday, a man ignited beer bottles and hurled the bottles at a Tesla charging stations in North Charleston, according to police. While doing so, the man accidentally lit his clothes on fire, police said.\n\nNo injuries were reported in any of the incidents. An attorney for Nelson could not be reached for comment and a voicemail for Colorado\u2019s federal public defender\u2019s office said it does not comment on pending cases.\n\nTesla did not immediately return a request for comment. In response to a video showing a man vandalizing Teslas, posted by authorities in Maryland, Musk replied: \u201cDamaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech!\u201d\n\nPrior to the attacks at the Tesla dealership, Loveland Police Chief Tim Doran said he couldn\u2019t recall a time when a single business in the community \u2014 roughly 45 miles north of the state capital Denver \u2014 similarly attracted repeated acts of violence.\n\nHe said his department has no indication that the vandalism at the Colorado dealership is connected to the acts of vandalism elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis is absolutely not the way to make a statement,\u201d Doran said in an interview. \u201cPutting people\u2019s lives at risk is never the way to do this.\u201d\n\nNBC Boston\n\nIn January, President Donald Trump tapped Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nDOGE \u2014 previously known as the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 has been slashing the federal workforce and government programs at an unprecedented pace in recent weeks. As civil servants have been abruptly laid off en masse, in-person GOP town halls have turned heated, with many constituents lashing out at lawmakers over the cuts.\n\nMusk\u2019s appointment to the agency and his designation as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d \u2014 which circumvents the more onerous vetting requirements for full-time government employees \u2014 has raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest.

Tigard Police Department via AP\n\nThe attacks at Tesla dealerships also coincide with a decline in sales for the electric-car maker. Recent data show increasing sales growth of electric-battery vehicles in Europe, but new Tesla vehicle registrations in Europe are down 45% year over year for January, and down in China as well.\n\nMusk\u2019s foray into politics appears to have hit his personal fortune as well. From mid-December, the tech titan\u2019s net worth dropped more than $100 billion, or approximately 25%, fueled by a sell-off of Tesla shares. As of Saturday, Tesla shares are down more than 30% since the start of the year.\n\nMichael Morris, a professor at Columbia Business School who authored \u201cTribal,\u201d a book about cultural divides, said he predicts the cultural blowback will eventually force Musk to resign from DOGE if his businesses continue to suffer.\n\n\u201cIt would be a tragedy for the world if Elon Musk\u2019s good work at Tesla and his good work at SpaceX, and his good work at his solar company got derailed by cultural blowback against his somewhat amateurish attempts to reform government,\u201d Morris said.\n\nThe disruptions at Tesla facilities don\u2019t appear to be slowing down.\n\nOn Friday, the same Colorado Tesla dealership was again set on fire, according to police. Police said in a statement that the new case does not appear to be related to Nelson, but suggested that she inspired a copycat. Nelson was charged with use of explosives or incendiary devices during a felony, criminal mischief and criminal attempt to commit a Class 3 felony, and is out of jail on a personal recognizance bond.\n\nAnd on Saturday in New York City, police arrested nine protesters who demonstrated inside a Tesla showroom, according to a spokesperson for the New York City Police Department.",

Though Tesla retained the top spot in terms of US market share at 42.5%, it represented a whopping drop of 12 percentage points from a year ago.

The recent pop in Tesla shares follows an over 39% drop year to date.\n\nThe US sales data follows weakness in Europe, where sales dropped a precipitous 45% in January, and a 49% plunge in China the following month as new EV competition and backlash to Musk's political activities may be hurting sales both here and abroad.\n\nLooking across Tesla\u2019s product lines, registrations of the Model Y crossover \u2014 the No. 1 EV in the US (and the top-selling vehicle in the world last year) \u2014 fell 26% in January compared to a year ago at 23,898 units.

The other is apathetic.\n\nNeither are concerned about violence, even in the wake of escalating \u201ctakedown\u201d nationwide protests against Elon Musk, and Sunday night\u2019s Seattle fire, which destroyed four Tesla Cybertrucks in a lot near Second Avenue and Spokane Street.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that more than a dozen violent acts have been directed at Tesla facilities since President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration Jan. 20. Musk has lost an estimated $125 billion during that time, and company stock has dropped almost 40%. There\u2019s even speculation that his unpopularity as head of the Department of Government Efficiency may cost him his status as the world\u2019s richest person.\n\nAs for my neighbors, one says other drivers sometimes randomly flip him off. His wife told me one group even gave her a Nazi salute as she drove by. But they like the car (which they purchased about two years ago for about $80,000) and realize they wouldn\u2019t get much value if they sold it today.\n\n\u201cWould I buy it again today? Probably not,\u201d my neighbor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good car, easy to drive. Maybe this will pass. But I don\u2019t feel unsafe in it, or when it\u2019s on the street.\u201d\n\nMy other neighbor is more dismissive. He says he doesn\u2019t care whether people like the car or not. The same goes for the few people who\u2019ve given him the middle-finger salute. \u201cIt\u2019s none of their business,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have nothing to do with Elon Musk. But I like how it handles. The engine\u2019s quiet.\u201d\n\nHe went on to add that selling the car would make no difference to anything Trump does. \u201cNot my way of protest,\u201d he said. \u201cI get why people are angry, I guess, but get a life.\u201d\n\nI was surprised to learn recently that Teslas are now the most popular car in Seattle, displacing the Toyota RAV4 (I\u2019ve read other reports that say the Subaru Outback is the most popular car here).\n\nAdmittedly, I\u2019m not a car guy. I drive a 15-year-old Honda CRV. Do I have a right to judge those who drive Teslas? Not really. Do I? Yes, I do. I realize most did so before Musk began his great chainsaw massacre to the federal budget (have you seen the bumper stickers saying, \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy?\u201d) but it still rankles me.\n\nI\u2019m not about to flip someone off. And no way am I giving a Nazi salute. But seeing Teslas around town reminds me of the cruelty happening across America right now.\n\nNote: Both the owner of the publication and our CFO drive Teslas, and are wondering if they\u2019re being judged by the executive editor. I\u2019ll take the Fifth on that!",

Trump called Musk a \u201cpatriot\u201d and announced that he had even bought one of his cars \u2014 a show of support that may have helped Tesla stock close higher for the day after a plunge a day earlier.\n\nBut experts warn the unusual presidential backing of a private company could backfire.\n\n\u201cTesla is becoming a political symbol of Trump and DOGE, and that is a bad thing for the brand,\u201d said Wedbush Securities financial analyst Dan Ives, referring to the advisory group in charge of cutting government spending led by Musk. \u201cYou think it\u2019s helping, but it\u2019s actually hurting.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s stock began rising from the opening Tuesday after Trump posted overnight on his Truth Social platform that Musk was \u201cputting it on the line\u201d to help the country. Trump claimed in the post that \u201cRadical Left Lunatics\u201d were attempting to \u201cillegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World\u2019s great automakers, and Elon\u2019s \u2019baby.\u2019\u201d\n\nA few hours later, Tesla stock surged even higher as Trump announced at the White House that he had bought a Tesla himself.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening to you,\u201d said Trump, before picking a red Model S, which retails for $80,000. As he eased into the driver seat, he exclaimed, \u201cWow. That\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe stock ended up closing up nearly 4% on Tuesday after one of the worst single day sell-offs in Tesla\u2019s history a day earlier.\n\nTesla has been pummeled this year under competition from rival electric vehicles, particularly out of China. Numerous auto industry analysts have also pointed to Musk\u2019s close association with Trump and with far right causes globally. Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters and its vehicles vandalized on the street. Tesla owners, perhaps in a bid to avoid being targeted, have placed bumper stickers on their cars with messages like, \u201cI bought it before Elon went nuts.\u201d\n\nShares have plummeted 45% in 2025 and on Monday tumbled more than 15% to $222.15, the lowest since late October, reflecting newfound pessimism as sales crater around the globe.\n\nMusk pumped $270 million into Trump\u2019s campaign heading into the 2024 election, appeared on stage with him and cheered Trump\u2019s victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November. Tesla shares soared to $479 per share by mid-December, but are now trading around $230 per share.\n\nThat drop could hurt the company in the coming year in two ways.\n\nFirst, Tesla offers many of its workers the chance to buy shares at a discounted price as a way of incentivizing them. But with the stock down sharply, this discounted price offered last year is in many cases higher than the stock is currently trading, meaning there is no discount at all and the incentive is worthless.\n\nSecond, the price drop could limit Tesla\u2019s ability to raise money by selling newly created shares to investors to fund research and expansion. In 2020, the company sold $12 billion worth of shares as it was building factories in Berlin and Texas and pouring money into self-driving technology. A falling stock price means it will get far less in proceeds in any future so-called secondary offerings, though slumping sales means it may not need to expand soon.\n\nMusk has become the face of the Trump administration\u2019s slash-and-burn government downsizing efforts, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The department has promised massive federal worker layoffs and aims to drastically reduce government spending. Musk\u2019s involvement has raised a familiar issue for Tesla shareholders: That the CEO, who also runs several other companies, is too distracted to fully focus on his EV company.\n\nSome of those other companies have also run into trouble recently. His X social media platform crashed several times on Monday, which Musk claimed was a \u201cmassive\u201d cyberattack. But like the clear-cutting he\u2019s done with federal jobs, Musk slashed the number of employees at X and technology experts warned of increased vulnerability.\n\nLast week, a rocket launched by Musk\u2019s SpaceX exploded and broke apart over Florida, about two months after another of the company\u2019s rockets failed.",

However, the CEO of Toyota, Koji Sato, is such a controversial figure that people harass you because they don't like him. You don't feel safe driving your car because it might get keyed, egged, spat on, and you constantly get the middle finger from other drivers on the It's. It's getting so bad that you want to get rid of your favorite car.\n\nThe hate is not against you. It's because of the Toyota CEO's political views. You are ready to get rid of your Toyota. What would you do?\n\nWhile browsing the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y Owners Club Facebook page, researching the Model 3, I ran across Karen Grimmett's post. She says it's gotten so bad that she and her husband will have to sell their Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y, which they love, because they are now targets of hate against Elon Musk.\n\nKaren and her husband disagree with Elon Musk, yet they pay the price for his political views.\n\nHere is Karen's story\n\nShe says, \"My husband and I own two Teslas. A Model 3 and a Model Y. We love our cars. Still, we are increasingly concerned about our safety when driving them and with the company, given that Elon remains involved. He is a lightning rod, and when we drive our Tesla cars, we are becoming targets for hate, even if we individually think his politics are \"crap.\"\n\n\"Who thinks the board needs to take a serious look at removing Elon so they don't suffer even more than they are right now?\"\n\n\"We will ditch our Teslas if Elon stays involved with politics and the Tesla car company. What are others thinking?\"\n\nThose Are Great Questions\n\nWhat are other Tesla Model 3 owners saying? Surprisingly, most Tesla owners are keeping their cars.\n\nMichael - I think the world around me isn't nearly as bad as the internet makes it be, so I'll keep driving the car I love.\n\nMitchell Lancas - I don't worry about it. I stopped following the news, and my life has been less stressful.\n\nIvan Gould - We are on our 4th Tesla. No worries.\n\nOn Reddit, these were the comments,\n\n\"We love our 2024 LR Model Y. I planned on getting the new Model Y to refresh next year, but if the rumor is true about people dumping their vehicles because of politics, I'll buy used ones if the price is right?\"\n\n\"I am not dumping the 2024 Model Y. I want another one because we will need to add a vehicle to our family now that kid #2 is driving. I was going to get myself the new Juniper in 2025, but if there is a glut in the market from people dumping their Teslas for political stances, I will buy used and take advantage.\n\nAnothercynic2112 - I'm sure some are making statements by doing that; most people live their lives and don't have the luxury of losing thousands for political stances.\n\nSRRWD - I won't be selling either of my Teslas, But I won't buy another either, so...I suspect this has longer-term consequences for Tesla. Still, his political behavior is only a tiny part of my reasoning; it's how Tesla is run; their after-sale support and service are horrible, and as a car enthusiast, the build quality and materials choices are poor, too.\n\nThe good news is these have plenty of years left; when the time to replace them comes, the market will have many excellent alternatives. It won't miss me. I'm thankful for what the company Tesla did for the EV market and all the people who made that happen.\n\nA report from the New York Post says that only one in three Tesla owners plan to sell their cars because of Elon Musk\u201470% plan on keeping their Tesla models.\n\nThe report says, \"For Tesla's innovation far outweighed his questionable behavior. However, the survey revealed a loyal fan base despite the flood of used Teslas and negative sentiment. Over half of Musk's actions have little impact on their feelings toward the automaker.\"\n\n\"There are composers who made beautiful music but did terrible things. It doesn't make their music any less beautiful,\" LightningJC said.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI agree with the comment on Facebook that his life got much less stressful when he stopped watching the news. When was the last time you saw any positive news? The media knows that negative news sells and positive news doesn't.\n\nRay Williams wrote an excellent piece on Linkedin that says,\n\n\"Bad news can evoke emotions such as fear, anger, rage, sadness, grief, and despair. Yet we continue to watch.\"\n\n\"Local newspapers and television stations have understood our addiction to the bad, and as long as there has been news, it's a truth we don't talk about nearly enough. In the media, this fact is so well known you've probably heard the industry adage, \"If it bleeds, it leads.\"\n\nIt's Your Turn\n\nWhat's your take on this?

During an interview this week, Musk addressed the difficulties.\n\n\"You're giving up your other stuff,\" Fox Business' Larry Kudlow asked Musk during an interview. \"How are you running your other businesses?\"\n\n\"With great difficulty,\" Musk replied with a sigh.\n\nOn Monday, Tesla stock closed down 15% after its worst trading day in five years. Stock in the company has dropped every week since Musk went to Washington, wiping out more than $700 billion in market value. And Musk's personal net worth has dropped $148 billion since Inauguration Day, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.\n\nBut it's not just Musk who is taking a hit. The stock plunge has caused outrage among some shareholders, who have publicly questioned Musk's commitment to his electric vehicle company or called on the Tesla board to replace him.\n\nAnother group that's now sounding the alarm: pension fund managers.\n\n\"This is a real cost to real people,\" Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs told ABC News. \"We're talking about firefighters, police officers, nurses who work in public. Their retirement dollars are at stake.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Advisor Elon Musk walks to the White House after landing in Marine One on the South Lawn with President Donald Trump, Mar. 9, 2025 in Washington. Oliver Contreras/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFrerichs, a Democrat, said he believes the drop in stock is due to Musk's work leading the governmental cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. It's deeply political work, Frerichs says, that's driving half the country away from buying his cars.\n\n\"Michael Jordan was famous here for not being involved in Democrat politics, because, as he said, even Republicans buy sneakers, and he knew he didn't want to lose those customers,\" Frerichs said.\n\nNew York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees approximately $1.2 billion in Tesla stock through the city's pension funds, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"There's no real leadership. It is at the bottom of his list. And so we have not had at Tesla a CEO focused on selling EVs, on growing the company, on making money and returns for shareholders,\" Lander told ABC News.\n\nLander, a Democrat who is running for mayor in New York City, said he still has faith in the Tesla stock -- but that it won't be endless.\n\n\"But look, if they can't count on this stock, you know, and we have to look elsewhere in the marketplace, that's how this works,\" Lander said.\n\nTesla representatives did not reply to a request for comment from ABC News\n\nIts not just Democrats who have called for answers from Musk. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy -- who supported Trump in the 2024 election -- said he had to \"raise his eyebrows\" as a stockholder himself.\n\n\"I like DOGE, I like what they're doing,\" Portnoy said in an interview on Fox Business last month. \"But let me tell you this. If you are going to send out -- and you got to call it both ways -- if you are going to send emails to federal workers and say, 'What have you done for the last five days,' I think Tesla shareholders are entitled to ask their CEO, Elon Musk, 'What have you done for Tesla the last five days?'\"\n\n\"Seemingly all he cares about right now is DOGE,\" Portnoy said. \"Now, could it be coincidence the stock is down 25% since he really started this? I guess. But I think it's fair as a shareholder of Tesla to say, 'What are you doing for shareholders?'\"\n\nSome who are critical of Musk's role in cutting the federal workforce have targeted Tesla, vandalizing vehicles and protesting at dealerships around the country.\n\n\"We're here today rallying against Elon and what he's done,\" one Florida protester, Jeff Finkelstein, told a local news outlet. \"Ever since Trump's been in, it's been more about Musk than Trump and we're just showing our frustration.\"\n\nIn Massachusetts, police asked the public for help after a suspect allegedly vandalized Teslas with images of Musk. The suspect, when confronted, said he had a right to do so because it's his \"free speech,\" according to a social media post.\n\nMusk himself replied to the post, writing, \"Damaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech!\"",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nElectric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive named Sreela Venkataratnam \u2014 an 11-year alum of EV competitor Tesla \u2014 to the role of its chief accounting officer effective Monday, the Irvine, California-based company said in a Friday securities filing and press release.\n\nVenkataratnam, who most recently served as vice president of finance and business operations at the Austin, Texas-based Tesla, will receive an annual base salary of $425,000 in association with her appointment and will be eligible for an annual target bonus opportunity of 50% of her base, according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. She will also receive a restricted stock unit award with an aggregate value of $6 million, and a one-time cash singing bonus of $20,000, the company said.\n\nThe appointment comes as EV players, both Rivian and Tesla, seek to adjust their strategies amid changing regulation regarding the industry under the Trump administration, as well as to the potential impact of tariffs and other pricing pressures on their supply chains.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nVenkataratnam will take over for Rivian CFO Claire McDonough as the company\u2019s principal accounting officer, with McDonough having occupied that role on an interim basis, according to the filing. In her role as CAO, Venkataratnam will report directly to McDonough.\n\n\u201cAfter spending over a decade at Tesla, where I had the privilege of scaling the organization, I\u2019m eager to bring my experience to Rivian,\u201d Venkataratnam wrote in a Friday LinkedIn post. \u201cI look forward to strengthening the finance and accounting functions at Rivian \u2014 driving scalable and efficient processes, leveraging technology for financial transformation, and supporting the company\u2019s long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe appointment comes at a time of uncertainty both for Venkataratnam\u2019s former employer Tesla and for the broader EV space, which is grappling with economic headwinds and a pullback of Biden-era policies which championed electric vehicles.\n\nShares of Tesla plummeted by 15% on Monday, its steepest drop in five years. While Tesla originally saw a boost in its valuation after President Donald Trump won the presidential election, the EV maker\u2019s stock price has rapidly slid in the early months of the Trump administration \u2014 with more than half of its value since its Dec. 17 spike evaporating, representing about $800 billion in market capitalization, CNBC reported Monday. The nosedive comes among an international backlash to Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s activities and close ties with the Trump presidency, with Tesla sales across Europe and other markets seeing sharp declines, CFO Dive previously reported.\n\nHowever, the Musk-led EV company is also being buffeted by ongoing uncertainty that is impacting the broader industry, including shifts in regulatory policy: in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term, Trump detailed plans to \u201celiminate the electric vehicle (EV) mandate and promote true consumer choice,\u201d an order which could have significant impacts on the industry such as potentially scrapping an EV tax credit which made the vehicles more affordable to consumers, CFO Dive previously reported.\n\nTesla\u2019s CFO, Vaibhav Taneja, also expressed concerns on a recent earnings call over how potential tariffs that could be levied by the Trump administration could impact their supply chains and profitability, CFO Dive previously reported.\n\nMeanwhile, lessening demand, rising competition by legacy players and a shortage of key infrastructure have led to a spat of recent bankruptcies in the EV space, with one-time EV darling Nikola filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month after warning investors of dwindling cash reserves.\n\nRivian has not proved immune to recent headwinds affecting the EV industry, with the company expecting \u201cexternal factors\u201d to impact its 2025 results, including \u201cchanges to government policies and regulations, and a challenging demand environment,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter for its Q4 2024 earnings results.\n\nThe company expects to see a dip in vehicle deliveries for its full-year 2025, anticipating between 46,000 to 51,000 deliveries for the year, it said. For its full-year 2024, Rivian produced 49,476 vehicles and delivered 51,579 vehicles, according to its shareholder letter.\n\nHowever, for its Q4 ended Dec. 31, the EV maker also posted its first profitable quarter \u2014 reporting $170 million in gross profit driven primarily by \u201cimprovements in variable costs, revenue per delivered unit, and fixed costs,\u201d according to its earnings results. During its fourth quarter, Rivian also closed a joint venture with Volkswagen Group, a $5.8 billion partnership launched in November in which the two companies will collaborate to create EVs, according to company announcements.\n\nIts Q4 gross profit was also driven by its \u201ctransition\u201d to its \u201cGen 2\u201d vehicles, and by sales in its software and services segment, CFO McDonough said Friday in an online Q&A. The software segment was responsible for $60 million of its gross profit for Q4 and will be a \u201ckey revenue driver\u201d moving into 2025, she said.\n\nIn January \u2014 just prior to Trump assuming the presidency \u2014 the EV maker also received a $6.5 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy for the construction of an EV manufacturing facility in Georgia. The loan, made to company subsidiary Rivian New Horizon, LLC along with an equity investment from Rivian, \u201creinforces the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to strengthen the nation\u2019s manufacturing competitiveness, helping ensure American businesses remain global leaders in the rapidly expanding EV industry,\u201d the DOE said in a press release at the time.\n\nRivian declined to comment on Venkataratnam\u2019s appointment as CAO beyond its press release.",

            "content": "I'm not a car person and could drive whatever, but my husband loves cars.\n\nAfter doing tons of research, he decided we needed a Tesla Model Y.\n\nInsuring it is very expensive, so we are selling it and looking for a hybrid.\n\nAdmittedly, I've never been a car person. If it was up to me, I'd still be driving the 1979 Monte Carlo I learned to drive in. That behemoth had a red-faded-to-pink interior, and I could easily cram all my friends and our cheerleading gear into the back.\n\nBut alas, I married a car guy. If he sees a car's headlights or taillights from a block away, he can name the make, model, and current value on the Kelley Blue Book.\n\nHe'd been dreaming of a Tesla for years since he took a road trip in a friend's Model S. \"It's so fast and sleek. And there's so much storage because there's no engine,\" he crooned. As Teslas became more popular, it became like our family's version of the Slug Bug game. \"There's a Tesla!\" our sons would cry from the back of our Nissan Pathfinder.\n\nWe bought a Model Y\n\nAs more electric vehicles entered the market, we decided to join the club. So, my husband did what he does best \u2014 research. After considering Rivians and Polestars, he landed on the Tesla Model Y.\n\nIt had a decent range and a great charging infrastructure. Most of our driving was done in the city, but we did take occasional road trips to visit family in Iowa or up north for a family vacation. It also had the needed storage capacity for our family of four, our dog, and luggage for a week away. When we took our first test drive, I also fell in love with the Model Y.\n\nRelated stories\n\nI learned to love it\n\nThe Tesla came with a learning curve. On our first longer trip, my husband and I experienced a tense 30 miles because we didn't stop to charge when the car told us to. We did the math and figured we could make it to our destination. We did make it\u2014 after we turned off the air conditioning and radio and slowed to 40 mph on the interstate to save battery. Luckily, our marriage survived. Needless to say, we always stopped to charge after that.\n\nIt also took some practice with one-pedal driving, but I soon loved it. I also enjoyed the acceleration in my Model Y, resulting in my first speeding ticket since 1999. I'm sure the bright red color made me an easy target.\n\nWhile it was sometimes annoying to stop for a charge on a road trip, we got used to the slight inconvenience and used the time to go for a short walk, peruse strange convenience store wares, and play silly car games.\n\nSoon we discovered a major drawback\n\nWhen we saw the final insurance quote, we thought there had to be a mistake. But no \u2014 it really was going to cost almost as much as our monthly grocery bill.\n\nWe knew our insurance premiums would be high because we have two young adult son drivers, but we had no idea adding a Tesla would be sell-a-kidney expensive.\n\nElectric cars generally cost more to insure than gas vehicles, and Teslas have some of the highest premiums. With our current policy, the Tesla costs over $333 a month, while our gas-powered Audi costs half that.\n\nWe've since learned that Teslas are outrageously expensive to insure because they're costly to repair, and the company corners the market on parts. Because the repair process can take a long time, insurance companies are stuck footing the bill for longer-term rentals. We also learned that because Teslas drive so fast, their insurance risk rating is just below that of a performance vehicle.\n\nOf course, we've also had several conversations about the Musk controversy, but at the end of the day our pocketbook and family needs dictate the decision to sell our Tesla this spring.\n\nNow we're shopping for a plug-in hybrid\n\nThese are all factors we had no idea we should consider before we made our purchase, but they are definitely on my husband's new list as he researches our next vehicle. Now we're in the market for a plug-in hybrid, as they are a fraction of the price to insure and offer many of the same environmental and cost benefits we enjoyed with our Tesla \u2014 especially since most of our driving is within a few miles of our city home.\n\nI'm still not a car person. So while my husband dives into research on plug-in hybrids, I'll be here, hoping our next car is just as easy to drive, is cheap to insure, and \u2014 if I'm really lucky \u2014 comes in a color that doesn't result in a speeding ticket. I may never get my Monte Carlo back, but at least I'll be driving something that won't require us to take out a second mortgage just for insurance.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nThe Lucid Air is a vehicle so exquisitely engineered and maddeningly niche that it might as well come with a copy of War and Peace and a hotline to a therapist.\n\nRedefining Luxury Electric Sedans for a Modern Era\n\nThis isn\u2019t your father\u2019s luxury sedan, hell, it\u2019s not even your older cousin\u2019s Tesla. The Air is a rolling statement piece, a kind of automotive haute couture wrapped in California minimalism and Silicon Valley software smarts. It\u2019s aimed not at the masses but at the meticulous, the buyer who refers to over-the-air updates like rules and discusses regenerative braking over single-origin coffee.\n\nStill, reality has a way of catching up with romance. Consider the following anxious post from a newly minted buyer on the r/LucidMotors subreddit:\n\n\"Hey everyone! I just put my deposit down and secured financial approval for a 2025 Touring. While initially ecstatic, I\u2019ve been scrolling through this community for the last week, and I seem to notice a large amount of complaints about so many different aspects of these cars. It makes me nervous, as I\u2019m coming from Tesla, who also came across as a quirky tech start up with good ideas at the time, which later turned into a horribly built car with tons of mechanical and software issues. I noticed quite a few panel gap issues on my car, which they agreed to immediately fix prior to delivery. Just rings familiar.. if you get my point. If options matter, I opted for Fathom Blue, Stealth, and SSP (heard too many horror stories about the standard sound system). I\u2019ve gone from 'wow, Lucid, that\u2019d be the dream' in 2023 to 'I hope I haven\u2019t made a mistake' in 2025.\"\n\nLucid Air Owner Insights and Honest Reviews\n\nYou can practically hear the hesitation bleeding through the screen, an emotional cocktail of excitement, skepticism, and PTSD from years of Tesla ownership. And to be fair, it\u2019s not entirely unfounded. Lucid, like its spiritual sibling Rivian, lives in that precarious in-between space, brilliant engineering hamstrung by growing pains. The Air drives like a symphony, smooth, silent, breathtaking, but it still exists in a world where service centers are as rare as honest politicians.\n\nAnd when something does go wrong, the internet doesn\u2019t whisper, it shouts. Every frunk sensor glitch or trim rattle becomes a Reddit headline, and yes, we in the media are sometimes complicit in magnifying what are, in many cases, early-adopter teething issues.\n\nLucid Air Owner Insights and Honest Reviews\n\nBut dive deeper into the subreddit comments and a different story starts to take shape. Owners like Best-Yogurt-3134 cut through the noise, \u201cThe vocal crowd is usually the one that has complaints, not praise\u2026 Lucid is really good at fixing those issues and actually cares about your ownership.\u201d Others, like flugame206, gush about their 2025 Touring and its serene ride quality, well-appointed cabin, and overall satisfaction. The truth, it seems, is far more balanced than the loudest headlines suggest. It\u2019s not a car without quirks, it\u2019s a car whose owners are patient enough to see the quirks through. As one commenter aptly put it: \u201cIt\u2019s like a Mercedes S-Class in comparison to Model 3.\u201d\n\nPeter Rawlinson Steps Down as Lucid Charts a New Course\n\nPeter Rawlinson, the founder and CEO of Lucid Motors, has stepped down from his role and transitioned to the position of Strategic Technical Advisor to the Chairman of the Board. Marc Winterhoff, the current Chief Operating Officer, is serving as interim CEO while the company searches for a new chief executive. This change comes as Lucid aims to double its production in the coming year, planning to sell 20,000 vehicles in 2025 compared to the 10,241 EVs sold in 2024. \u200b\n\nLucid has unveiled its first SUV, the Gravity Grand Touring, in an effort to attract more customers and boost earnings. The new SUV, available for order starting November 7 at $94,900, claims a range exceeding 440 miles, positioning it among the top in its class. A less expensive model ($79,900) is expected to follow in late 2025. \u200b\n\nLucid has commenced production of its new Gravity SUV at its Arizona factory, and the vehicle has achieved an EPA-rated range of 450 miles on a full charge, surpassing the initially advertised 440 miles. The Gravity SUV features three rows of seating and is the company's first model to include a NACS port for Tesla Supercharger compatibility.\n\nThis brings us to the heart of the matter, the Lucid Air is a beta-test Bentley, a high-speed tech demo draped in luxury suede and brushed metal. The issues, whether real or perceived, are magnified not just because they exist but because of who they happen to. This isn\u2019t a Camry owner noticing a creaky seatbelt; this is a six-figure buyer who expects perfection.\n\nAnd yet, despite the occasional gripe about infotainment bugs or mediocre sound systems, the overwhelming feedback is positive, if you know what you\u2019re signing up for. Lucid doesn\u2019t build commuter cars. It builds halo cars for people who appreciate the subtle tactility of recycled alpaca wool on a headliner.\n\nA Halo Car for the Elite, Not the Masses\n\nMuch like Rivian\u2019s rugged-luxe R1T, Lucid suffers from what we might call the expectation gap. The product is excellent, and the service team is attentive, but the logistical network hasn\u2019t caught up. Service centers are sparse, mobile technicians are stretched thin, and parts availability can be hit or miss. But when things do go sideways, Lucid\u2019s customer care, by most owner accounts, goes above and beyond. Overnight parts shipments, concierge communication, and follow-ups that actually feel human. The catch? You might be waiting weeks for a fix, even if that fix comes with a latte and a heartfelt apology.\n\nBalancing Innovation with Practical Service\n\nUltimately, the Lucid Air lives in the rarefied stratosphere of cars designed not to move the masses but to move the bar. It\u2019s for those who want exclusivity, not ubiquity. For buyers who would rather endure occasional headaches than settle for compromise.\n\nAnd in a modern car market where even a base Civic offers wireless CarPlay and adaptive cruise, Lucid\u2019s true value isn\u2019t in specs, it\u2019s in identity. It\u2019s a statement, a rebellion against the mainstream. The kind of car you buy when you want your vehicle to say something about you, even when it\u2019s parked.\n\nSo to the new owner wrestling with regret, take a breath. You didn\u2019t make a mistake. You just stepped into the future a little early, and that\u2019s never a smooth road.\n\nNoah Washington is an automotive journalist based in Atlanta, Georgia.

It\u2019s an Elon Musk problem, said climate economist Gernot Wagner at Columbia Business School.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here, you can probably explain through the politics and the optics,\u201d said Wagner.\n\nWagner said Tesla stock exploded after the November election because of Elon Musk\u2019s proximity to President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThat proximity has not turned into Tesla sales, at least not yet, and maybe never,\u201d said Wagner.\n\nSo EV drivers are buying other cars.

Is Tesla going to dominate the robotaxi field? Because we know who does that is going to be an extremely profitable company,\u201d said Caldwell.\n\nWhether Tesla dominates the field will depend on whether it makes good on its promise to have autonomous vehicles on the road starting in June.",

So that let's get Elon off the hook.\"\n\nJeff didn't want to use his last name for this interview but told NBC Bay Area that he has zig-zagged across the Bay Area to protest Musk and President Donald Trump at eight different events. He said he also decided to cover up the Tesla logo on his vehicle and added a very blunt sign to his bumper.\n\n\"It says, 'I bought this car when Elon was sane.' Down below, it says 'dog inside' too because sometimes, my dog is in there,\" he said.\n\nThat request to protect Jeff's dog may seem extreme. But it comes after multiple reports of vandalism at some Tesla owned sites including a suspected arson at a Massachusetts Tesla charging station last week.\n\nThere is no hard data on how many people are selling their Teslas in protest. But on Facebook Marketplace, there were plenty of Teslas that were listed for sale by owners. NBC Bay Area noticed there was more than a few Teslas that were listed on Monday and several vehicles had already marked down their prices.\n\nGet a weekly recap of the latest San Francisco Bay Area housing news.

A similar one was held in San Francisco on Sunday and several have been organized over the last few weeks around the Bay Area and across the country.",

            "content": "Since 2014, a state program to subsidize electric cars has delivered over $90 million in payments to subsidize Tesla, Elon Musk's car company \u2013 and the pace of those payments has been increasing under Governor Healey's administration.\n\nThe Commonwealth's MOR-EV program has doled out over $162 million in subsidies to new-car buyers as of February 2025. In the decade-long history of the program, more than half of its payments \u2013 $90.5 million \u2013 have gone to subsidize cars sold by Tesla, Inc.\n\nBut in past 18 months, as Musk has consolidated more power in Washington D.C. and made threats to major government programs, an even higher share of the program's payments has bankrolled Tesla sales.\n\nIn just the three months between Election Day and February 5th (the last date for which data is currently available), Massachusetts sent $8.6 million in direct payments to buyers at Tesla dealerships.\n\nTaxpayers helping millionaires helping Elon Musk\n\nThe ostensible aim of the MOR-EV program is to reduce climate-heating pollution from Massachusetts roadways by encouraging people to buy electric cars.\n\nHowever, as we've previously reported, new car buyers are usually from wealthier households, and a majority of the MOR-EV program's payments have historically gone disproportionately to high-wealth suburban ZIP codes like Weston and Lexington.\n\nAdditionally, a 2022 cost-effectiveness study of the program concluded that more than half of subsidy recipients were \"free riders\" who would have bought a new electric car with or without a check from the government.\n\nIn August 2023, Governor Healey's administration introduced a number of reforms to the program in an effort to address these problems. The program started offering an additional $1,500 subsidy for lower-income households, and also made rebates available to used car purchases.\n\nMore significantly, the Commonwealth boosted its subsidies from $2,500 to $3,500, and started offering rebates at the \"point of sale\" \u2013 that is, at the car dealership.\n\nThose changes fueled a surge in MOR-EV payouts \u2013 and they were especially lucrative for Tesla.\n\nIn the nine years before August 2023, when those changes went into effect, Tesla buyers collected $35.6 million, which accounted for 44 percent of the MOR-EV program's payments.\n\nIn the 18 months since August 2023, the Commonwealth has spent $54.9 million on Tesla subsidies, which accounts more than two-thirds of the program's spending in that period.\n\nLawmakers don't want to talk about it\n\nIn January, after Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered what many of his own supporters interpreted as a Nazi salute at the inauguration of President Donald Trump, StreetsblogMASS reached out to a number of lawmakers to ask them whether they thought the subsidies for Tesla are still an appropriate use of the state's funds.\n\nWe sent multiple email inquiries to the Governor's office, Assistant Senate Majority Leader Mike Barrett of Lexington, and House Ways and Means Chair Rep. Aaron Michlewitz of Boston.\n\nNone of them responded or acknowledged our inquiries (we'll update this story if they decide to get back to us).\n\nYou can look up how to contact your lawmakers here.\n\nIf your local lawmakers have an opinion on this issue, please let us know in the comments section below, or email mass.editor@streetsblog.org.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nTesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja sold $1.7 million in shares of common stock for the electric vehicle manufacturer earlier this week, while Board Chair Robyn Denholm sold about $33 million in shares, according to March 3 securities filings.\n\nThe sales represent the second offloading of stock by the two executives in as many months, with both Taneja and Denholm, as well as Tesla board member Kimbal Musk, the brother of CEO Elon Musk, having collectively sold tens of millions in shares of company stock in early February, CFO Dive previously reported. Taneja sold $2.8 million in stock at the time, while Denholm sold shares for approximately $43 million. In January Denholm, Musk, and other board members of the Austin, Texas-based EV maker agreed to pay back a collective $919 million to Tesla in a court settlement stemming from a shareholder lawsuit that asserted the directors had overpaid themselves, CFO Dive reported.\n\nTaneja and Denholm\u2019s stock sales this week also took place as the EV maker has continued to see its stock price plummet, amid both slumping global sales and uncertainty surrounding potential tariffs and their impact on the EV space, both in the U.S. and in countries such as Canada, according to reports.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTesla\u2019s stock value has sunk rapidly in recent weeks after an initial spike in the days following President Donald Trump\u2019s election to a second term.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s stock spiked 84% following the election to just before Christmas, Tesla shares have lost approximately a third of their value since Trump officially took office, according to a report by CNN \u2014 with the company therefore losing about 87% of its election boost.\n\nDespite the close relationship between Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the EV maker could potentially be among the companies hit hard by looming tariffs, with Taneja warning such tariffs could have a negative impact on the company\u2019s bottom line during an earnings call in January. The company remains \u201cvery reliant\u201d on parts sourced outside of the U.S., Taneja said, noting tariffs could therefore hurt Tesla\u2019s profitability.\n\nContinued uncertainty surrounding tariffs, as well as the industries and countries to be affected, has only compounded economic headwinds facing Tesla and fellow competitors in the auto industry.\n\nOn March 4, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico then on March 6 announced a one-month pause on all imports that are compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement until April 2.\n\nOutside of the U.S., lawmakers in countries such as Canada have proposed plans to impose their own tariffs in response to the U.S., which could also potentially hurt Tesla. In February, Canadian lawmaker Chrystia Freeland, who is running as a potential candidate for prime minister, vowed \u201csurgical\u201d reprisals to U.S. tariffs on the country, including a 100% tariff on Tesla\u2019s cars, The Independent reported.\n\nBoth the sales of stock by Tesla executives and the broadening trade war are occurring as the EV maker sees its global sales nosedive, impacted by an international backlash against Elon Musk\u2019s political activities in the U.S., a glut of rising competition in the space from legacy automakers, and shifting consumer spending habits regarding automotive sales, according to reports. For instance, Tesla sales in Australia plunged 72% in February compared to the prior year period, The Guardian reported.\n\nIn a breakdown of Tesla sales across global markets by Newsweek, meanwhile, the publication cited data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association which found Tesla sales across the European Union, United Kingdom, and European Free Trade Association fell by 45% last month as compared to January 2024. Tesla also saw a shrinking of market share in that region to 1% from 1.8%, despite overall EV vehicle sales growing by 34% over the same period, Newsweek reported.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

Trump claimed in the post that \u201cRadical Left Lunatics\u201d were attempting to \u201cillegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's \u2018baby.\"\n\nThe stock climbed more than 3% before the market open on Tuesday.\n\nNumerous auto industry analysts have attributed Tesla's recent sagging stock \u2014 and auto sales \u2014 to Musk's support of Trump and other far right candidates around the world. In recent days, Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized on the street. Tesla owners, perhaps in a bid to avoid being targeted, have placed bumper stickers on their cars with messages like, \u201cI bought it before Elon went nuts.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors charged a woman in connection with a string of vandalism against a Colorado Tesla dealership, which included Molotov cocktails being thrown at vehicles and the words \u201cNazi cars\u201d spray painted on the building.\n\nMusk pumped $270 million into Trump's campaign heading into the 2024 election, appeared on stage with him and cheered Trump's victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November. Tesla stock soared to $479 per share by mid-December, but have since lost 45% of their value.\n\nMusk has become the face of the Trump administration's slash-and-burn government downsizing efforts, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The department has promised massive federal worker layoffs and aims to drastically reduce government spending.\n\nAnalysts have said Musk's shift to right-wing politics doesn't appear to sit well with potential Tesla buyers, generally perceived to be wealthy and progressive consumers.\n\nTesla sales are falling precipitously in California, the company's biggest U.S. market, and the company recorded its first annual global sales decline last year. Similarly, Tesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France.\n\nThe latest auto sales figure from China show that Tesla sales there have been nearly halved from February a year ago, although the decline is largely due increased competition from domestic EV companies.\n\nBut sales in the U.S. have fallen due to competition, and a country sharply divided about Trump.\n\nU.S. Analysts at UBS Global Research expect deliveries to fall 5% in the first quarter and full year compared to the same periods for 2024.\n\n\u201cOur UBS Evidence Lab data shows low delivery times for the Model 3 and Model Y (generally within two weeks) in key markets which we believe is indicative of softer demand,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn addition to backing Trump, Musk has also shown support for the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d and called Canada \u2014 a major Tesla market \u2014\"not a real country.\u201d\n\nTesla is not the only Musk-led company to run into trouble recently. His X social media platform crashed several times on Monday, which Musk claimed was a \u201cmassive\" cyberattack. But like the clear-cutting he's done with federal jobs, Musk slashed the number of employees at X and technology experts warned of increased vulnerability.\n\nLast week, a rocket launched by Musk's SpaceX exploded and broke apart over Florida, about two months after another of the company's rockets failed.",

            "content": "Tesla's most expensive model is actually the most affordable to insure in the entire lineup\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck costs 30% less to insure on average than a Model 3.\n\nA key factor is that two-thirds of Cybertruck owners have excellent credit.\n\nEven so, its insurance cost remains 45% higher than the national average.\n\nYou\u2019d think the most affordable car in an automaker\u2019s lineup would also be the cheapest to insure. Makes sense, right? Well, not for Tesla. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite\u2014the Cybertruck, that giant stainless steel wedge, is actually the least expensive Tesla to insure, with significantly lower rates than the entry-level Model 3 sedan.\n\nAccording to a recent study compiled by Insurify, full-coverage insurance for the Cybertruck costs an average of $3,392 per year. That\u2019s 45% more than the national average ($2,336) and 17% higher than the typical EV ($2,892), but still cheaper than insuring any other model in Tesla\u2019s current lineup.\n\nMore: Tariffs Could Make Your Car Insurance Even More Expensive\n\nIn fact, the Model 3 has the highest insurance rates in the Tesla lineup with an average of $4,347. That means insuring Tesla\u2019s most affordable model costs 28% more than the Cybertruck, which starts at $79,990, even though the Model 3 is 53% cheaper to buy in its base form at $42,990 before federal and state credits, delivery fees, and taxes.\n\nAs for the rest of the pack, full-coverage insurance averages $3,510 for the Model S, $3,658 for the Model X, and $3,832 for the Model Y.\n\nInsurance Costs Across Tesla and EV Models\n\nModel Starting\n\n\n\nMSRP* Avg. Annual Cost\n\n\n\nOf Full Coverage Share of Drivers\n\n\n\nw/ Excellent Credit Ford F-150 Lightning $62,995 $3,193 18% Tesla Cybertruck $79,990 $3,392 66% Tesla Model S $79,990 $3,510 34% Tesla Model X $84,990 $3,658 49% Tesla Model Y $44,990 $3,832 50% Tesla Model 3 $42,490 $4,347 13% EV Average $56,351 $2,892 35% National Average $48,397 $2,336 13% Source: Insurify / * Before tax credits SWIPE\n\nWhy Is the Cybertruck Cheaper to Insure?\n\nSo, what\u2019s behind this insurance pricing paradox? A big factor is credit scores. Insurify found that 66% of Cybertruck drivers have an excellent credit score, compared to just 13% of Model 3 drivers and 35% of EV drivers overall. The Model 3\u2019s lower credit score average is likely tied to its mass-market appeal\u2014Tesla sells a lot more of them, and its buyers tend to be younger and/or have riskier financial profiles.\n\nIn particular, half of Cybertruck owners (50%) are in their 40s, while only 14% of Model 3 owners fall into that age group. Since older drivers generally pose less of an insurance risk, this helps keep Cybertruck rates in check.\n\nMore: EV Crash Claims Jump 38%, And Repairs Are Pricier Than Ever\n\nEven with its relatively low insurance costs, the Cybertruck still isn\u2019t the cheapest electric truck to insure. That title goes to the Ford F-150 Lightning, which averages $3,193 per year or 6% less than the Cybertruck. The Lightning\u2019s lower insurance costs are likely due to its more affordable starting price and cheaper repair costs, despite the fact that only 18% of Lightning owners have excellent credit (compared to the Cybertruck\u2019s 66%).\n\nWill Cybertruck Insurance Rates Stay Low?\n\nThat depends. If Tesla lowers the Cybertruck\u2019s entry price, it could attract a younger, riskier demographic, which would likely push insurance rates higher. At the same time, rising EV repair costs could add even more pressure, making premiums climb further. Since EVs are already more expensive to fix than gas-powered cars, any increase in repair expenses could have an outsized impact on insurance pricing.\n\nMore: Insurance Companies Are Writing Off Cars Faster Than Ever After Accidents\n\nBroadly speaking, EVs cost more to insure because post-accident repair costs are 30% higher on average, and they\u2019re more likely to be deemed total losses. Batteries, advanced sensors, and proprietary parts make even minor collisions costly. That trend isn\u2019t unique to Tesla, but given its vehicles\u2019 repair complexities, it\u2019s a key factor in the company\u2019s insurance rates.\n\nFor now, though, the Cybertruck remains an insurance outlier, one of the rare cases where a high-priced vehicle is cheaper to insure than its budget-friendly sibling. Whether that trend holds depends on how Tesla\u2019s sales, pricing, and repair costs evolve in the years ahead.\n\nTesla",

Among the updates, Lars Moravy told the Ride the Lightning podcast, via Teslarati, that the cars will be able to benefit from wireless charging, making them \"road trip capable.\"\n\n\"You saw it, we have wireless charging, right?\" Moravy asked. \"It's coming for the Cybercab and I think that's ultimately, if you're going to put a bunch of design effort into something, why put this really complex, moving device to move a cable, when you can have no moving parts.\"\n\nThis aspect will further remove the need for human intervention from the car journey. It could also help to solve another problem.\n\nElectric vehicle drivers have often been frustrated when arriving at charging stations only to find that cables have been cut. The reason for this vandalism is unclear, but some have speculated that selling the metal at scrap yards could be the motivation, while others have suggested that it might be a form of protest against the rise of EVs \u2014 which may spell the end for the internal combustion engine car.\n\nWhatever the reason, this might be giving motorists pause when deciding to swap their gas-guzzler for an EV. Wireless technology, an increase in charging infrastructure, and being able to charge at home can mitigate these issues, though, helping to steer us further away from vehicles that rely on dirty fuels and contribute to our planet's overheating.\n\nRising global temperatures are leading to an increase in the length, strength, and likelihood of extreme weather events. EVs are a huge part of the effort to reduce the pollution that exacerbates floods, droughts, and deadly storms.\n\nTo demonstrate that impact, a study published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, shared by Science Direct, found that the electrification of vehicles in Florida led to a 22.6% decrease in the state's carbon footprint.\n\nTesla has suggested the Cybercab could enter production by 2026, as The Verge observed, and it's not the only example of public transportation that's being electrified.\n\nIn Hamburg, the use of hydrogen- or electric-powered taxis has now been mandated, with financial support offered to companies as they make the switch, per Hamburg News.\n\nMeanwhile, in New York, rideshare services like Lyft and Uber must only use EVs by 2030.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

Since mid-February, Tesla showrooms have attracted protesters in 100 or so cities across the US, eager to let passersby know their feelings about the chainsaw-wielding Musk.\n\nThese largely good-natured, sidewalk-staged protests\u2014some with Mariachi bands, puppeteers, and large cardboard Cybertrucks to decorate\u2014have been organized by a website called TeslaTakedown, and they attracted plenty of media coverage in the process.\n\nAlex Winter, a Los Angeles-based documentary maker\u2014and the titular Bill from 1988 time-travel comedy Bill & Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure\u2014is the creator of the website. He tells WIRED that the TeslaTakedown movement wants to topple Musk: \u201cWe aim to devalue the brand. It\u2019s a very simple and effective means for people to get onto the street and protest.\u201d Media coverage amplifies the movement\u2019s message, says Winter. \u201cWe want to spread verifiable, factual information on Musk, DOGE, and why Tesla should be devalued.\u201d\n\n\u201cMusk himself is toxifying the Tesla brand,\u201d Winter says. \u201cWe\u2019re just helping him.\u201d\n\nTeslaTakedown started last month, kicked off by a February 10 posting on Bluesky by Joan Donovan, a disinformation researcher and assistant professor of journalism and emerging media studies at Boston University. \u201cCome out and participate in an international picket #TeslaTakeover locally,\u201d she wrote, later agreeing with renaming the movement.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, what was I willing to physically do to raise awareness [about Musk]? Well, I\u2019m willing to go out on Saturdays and protest in front of a Tesla dealership,\u201d Donovan tells WIRED. \u201cI made a flyer and started circulating it online. Alex saw my post, and we started texting about what to do; it all came together super fast.\u201d\n\nAt the first demonstration in Boston on February 15, there were 50 people. By the third week, this had risen to 300. \u201cI\u2019ve met teachers, people who work in public health, people who are retired, students at universities\u2014all Americans who want to see DOGE disappear,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a strategic boycott of Tesla, it\u2019s a polyvocal protest where lots of grievances are aired.\u201d\n\nElon Musk and Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nErica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard University, has studied over 300 modern uprisings worldwide and found that change usually becomes inevitable when just 3.5 percent of a population join a movement.\n\n\u201cThere are typically far more people who sympathize with movements than people who actively participate in them,\u201d Chenoweth tells WIRED.\n\nSo might TeslaTakedown work quickly? \u201cInstead of thinking about how long it takes,\u201d she says, \u201cI typically look to see whether a movement is building pressure and momentum with each subsequent action.\n\n\"In the social science of these movements, many people talk about eliciting defections\u2014making people within different pillars of support shift their loyalty away from the status quo. In the case of corporations, those pillars can include shareholders, workers, suppliers, distributors, advertisers, consumers, and those around them.\u201d\n\nLosing Loyalties\n\nThose pillars may already be showing signs of instability.

Singer Sheryl Crow was one of the more high-profile among them, who posted an Instagram video on Valentine\u2019s Day wishing good riddance to her Tesla as it was driven away on a flatbed truck.\n\n\u201cThere comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with.

Just a few weeks earlier, investigators say, the same man attacked the same dealership by throwing molotov cocktails at Tesla vehicles and through the store window. He caused an estimated $500,000 in damage, according to court documents.\n\nThe destruction adds to the woes of a carmaker already in turmoil. Its stock has fallen by more than 35 percent since Trump\u2019s inauguration, and last year, the company suffered its first annual sales drop in more than a decade. In Germany, Tesla car sales plummeted by 76 percent in February compared with a year earlier, according to figures released Wednesday. And some owners have expressed buyer\u2019s remorse over owning a car some now see as a symbol of far-right politics, a stark departure from the environmental consciousness it once epitomized.\n\nRoss Gerber, a longtime Tesla investor and Musk critic, said the reports of destruction against Tesla storefronts, cars and superchargers could create a \u201cchilling effect.\u201d Customers \u201cmay not want to associate \u2026 with Elon and deal with vandalism,\u201d he said.\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s car company is no stranger to public ire. Last year, the Tesla factory near Berlin lost power after a far-left environmental organization, the Volcano Group, claimed responsibility for setting fire to an electricity pylon near the plant. Months later, around 800 environmental activists attempted to storm the same factory. Some employees and investors have begun to speak out about Musk, worried that his alliance with Trump is harming beyond repair the company\u2019s reputation and mission of building a more sustainable future.\n\nBut Musk\u2019s political perch since Trump took office has increased polarized views about him. He has forged relationships with far-right politicians in Europe and made a gesture resembling a Nazi salute. Demonstrators have gathered outside Tesla showrooms across the United States to protest Musk\u2019s dramatic cuts to federal government through the U.S. DOGE Service.\n\n\u201cWhether it is politically motivated or not, arson and destruction of property is not the way to get your point across,\u201d said Matthew Pinard, the police chief of Littleton, where several Tesla chargers were lit on fire this past week.\n\nMusk and Tesla did not return requests for comment. In response to a photo posted on social media of a supercharger spray-painted with the word \u201cNazi\u201d last month, an official Tesla social media account said the company \u201cwill press charges for vandalism at Superchargers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharred Tesla\n\nAdam Choi and his wife were leaving church Sunday morning in Brookline, Massachusetts, when they noticed their Tesla had been vandalized with a sticker of Musk in his now notorious raised-arm pose. Choi, 37, spotted the suspected vandal across the parking lot and pulled out his phone.\n\n\u201cWhy do you think you have the right to do that?\u201d Choi said in the video, shared with The Post.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my free speech,\u201d the man said before riding off on his bicycle. Choi called the Brookline Police Department, who have since identified the man but have not made an arrest.\n\nIn response to Choi\u2019s video, shared by the Brookline police on X, Musk chimed in: \u201cDamaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDamaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech! \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 4, 2025\n\nAbout 30 miles away in Littleton early the next morning, a Tesla supercharger station in an outdoor shopping center was doused with an accelerant and lit on fire, police said. The incident is being investigated as an act of arson, but no suspect has been identified.\n\nElsewhere across the country, the vandalism has sometimes taken a terrorizing turn.\n\nIn the early morning hours of Inauguration Day, a Tesla driver charging his vehicle near a dealership in Salem, Oregon, saw a man in black brandishing what appeared to be an AR-style rifle. He saw the man light an object on fire and throw it at a red Tesla SUV, according to a federal court complaint.\n\nAs the man \u2014 later identified by police as Adam Matthew Lansky \u2014 continued to hurl what appeared to be molotov cocktails at other parked Tesla vehicles, the driver quickly unplugged his vehicle and began to drive away. According to the complaint, Lansky dropped an ignited molotov cocktail and pointed his gun toward the man inside the Tesla.\n\nThen, Lansky threw a rock that shattered the showroom window and tossed an ignited device into the store before throwing molotov cocktails at two more vehicles and leaving, according to police. Photos of the damage provided in court documents show a charred Tesla hollowed out by a fire, and a shattered store window. Seven Tesla vehicles sustained damage from the attack, with one destroyed, according to the complaint.\n\nA few weeks later, Lansky allegedly returned to the same dealership and shot at the storefront and a parked vehicle inside the store. Bullets were recovered inside the store, in an area \u201cthat would be populated with customers and employees during business hours.\u201d Lansky was arrested Tuesday and jailed pending charges and arraignment. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrand worries\n\nThe violent acts come as Musk courts controversy on the national stage. The billionaire used to largely stay away from politics, more focused on his mission of creating a more sustainable future with Tesla and sending rockets into space with his other company, SpaceX. But Musk quickly ascended to Trump\u2019s inner circle this summer as he funneled at least $288 million to help elect him and other Republican candidates, becoming the cycle\u2019s largest political donor.\n\nMusk\u2019s polarizing politics and anti-Tesla vandalism are having a negative effect on the brand, said Gerber, the Tesla investor. \u201cIt could all be fixed very easily,\u201d he said, \u201cwith somebody else taking over and running Tesla.\u201d\n\nSome say Musk\u2019s massive bet on Trump is bound to pay off despite the current backlash against Tesla. Investors and analysts expect that the electric-vehicle company will benefit significantly from streamlined regulation on autonomous driving, which Musk has said is critical for the future of the company.\n\nDan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said that even though Musk and Trump\u2019s relationship has created \u201cmajor brand worries for Tesla,\u201d it will ultimately benefit.\n\n\u201cSome of these distraction issues will fade,\u201d he said Thursday in an investors note. \u201cThe best thing that ever happened to Musk and Tesla was Trump in the White House as this will create a deregulatory environment with a federal autonomous roadmap central to the Tesla golden strategic vision.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, however, local law enforcement officials worry it\u2019s a matter of time before someone becomes seriously injured in violence against Teslas. Nelson, who is also listed in court documents as Justin Thomas Nelson, is estimated to have caused at least $5,000 in damage at the Colorado dealership, documents show.\n\n\u201cWhether you like Musk or you don\u2019t, this is not the right way to do it,\u201d said Paul Campbell, deputy superintendent of the Brookline Police Department. \u201cWe\u2019re all grown-ups who learn at a very young age to not touch things that don\u2019t belong to you.\u201d\n\nChoi, the Tesla owner in Brookline whose car was vandalized, said he voted for Trump and is \u201cneutral\u201d on Musk\u2019s work at DOGE. While he understands the animus against Musk as he makes aggressive changes to the federal workforce, he said it was still \u201cshocking and disturbing\u201d to have his car vandalized outside his church.\n\nHe said he loves his Tesla, considering it the best \u2014 and cheapest \u2014 option for a quality electric vehicle in the United States. But the incident in the church parking lot has made him wary of driving his car now, for fear of it being attacked again.\n\n\u201cI think the motivation for [the suspect] was to send a message to Elon,\u201d Choi said. \u201cThe message I got was that I was penalized because I bought a green car.\u201d",

Gregory Meeks of New York, the ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Relations, and Jared Moskowitz of Florida, who's the top Democrat on the committee's oversight subcommittee, said the plans represent \"a serious violation of federal procurement laws\" that would \"unlawfully enrich Mr. Musk,\" the billionaire tech mogul serving as a top official in the White House.\n\nEarlier this week, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut also wrote Rubio a letter demanding details about plans to purchase Teslas.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTo Musk's critics, the apparent plan for the State Department to buy hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of armored Teslas, presumably the company's Cybertruck model, fueled concerns that the billionaire could use his position in the White House to self-deal and boost his business empire.\n\nLast month, a State Department spokesperson told NPR the $400 million figure was \"an estimate,\" and that there are now no plans of moving forward with the purchase. The spokesperson said a plan to begin studying the viability of using Teslas as armored vehicles first started in the Biden administration.\n\nA document from the Biden White House obtained by NPR shows that the State Department planned to spend $483,000 on electric vehicle acquisition in 2025, less than 1% of the $400 million estimated expenditure that first showed up in a spreadsheet of expected State Department contracts. When reports first circulated of the spreadsheet item, a State official edited the document to say the award was for \"armored electric vehicles,\" not \"armored Tesla,\" which the lawmakers homed in on in their letter to Rubio on Friday.\n\n\"This raises serious questions about whether the Department not only scrubbed the document to remove any references to Tesla but also may have backdated the publicly available documentation to give the false impression that every element of these procurement plans \u2013 including the $400 million value \u2013 originated in the prior Administration,\" wrote the Democratic congressmen.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe State Department and Musk did not return requests for comment.\n\nThe lawmakers ask Rubio if State Department officials intentionally changed the electric vehicle purchase amount from $483,000 to $400 million, who oversaw the change and for proof that the contract has been \"definitively abandoned.\"\n\nWhile the Biden administration document obtained by NPR appears to show the push for the government to buy $400 million of Teslas started under Trump, who exactly put the item in the spreadsheet, and at whose direction, remains unclear.\n\nHave information you want to share about the ongoing changes across the federal government?

            "content": "If the price tag on that new Tesla is giving you second thoughts, you might want to take a look at some new longevity data published in Nature Energy.\n\nThe data was collected from vehicle inspections in the United Kingdom, and it found that the electric vehicle brand consistently ranked first for lifespan and mileage, Teslarati reported. While the average electric car is expected to cover approximately 124,000 miles in its lifetime, Tesla cars consistently cover an average of 204,000 miles, per a new report from Allt Om Elbil.\n\nIf you tend to evaluate purchases based on usable years rather than miles, Tesla is ahead there too. Its average EV lifespan is 20.3 years, whereas the average electric vehicle has a lifespan of 18.4 years. By comparison, the average gas-powered vehicle's lifespan is 18.7 years.\n\nIf you were going to purchase an EV, which of these factors would be most important to you? Cost Battery range Power and speed The way it looks Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nElectric cars are catching up to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles across the board. As Teslarati explained, while early EVs may have lagged behind in reliability and longevity, they're quickly closing \u2014 and in many facets, have already closed \u2014 that gap.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, Tesla batteries are now expected to outlast their vehicles. This fact has prompted researchers to examine how these batteries could be repurposed to extend their usable lifetimes. Utility Dive reported that used EV batteries are now being put to use as grid storage to extend clean energy in the transportation sector and beyond. According to the report, a used EV battery may still have several years of viable use in such a placement.\n\nWhile the study's biggest numbers were favorable for Tesla, the news is encouraging for the EV landscape more broadly as well, with other brands beginning to make ground on Tesla in market share and ratings from expert outlets such as Consumer Reports. When it comes to consumer benefits, the advancement of EV technology will continue to provide cost savings.\n\nFor example, while the average diesel driver spends roughly $9,500 on fuel over five years, a comparable EV driver spends closer to $4,000. The more charging stations that are built \u2014 and the more efficient they are \u2014 the more affordable that charging will become as well.\n\nAnd considering the fact that significant tax rebates and incentives are still available, that EV price tag can start to look less intimidating \u2014 and more like an excellent and worthwhile way to spend money wisely, reducing your own environmental footprint at the same time.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

According to data from government and industry associations viewed by the WSJ, new Tesla registrations plummeted a whopping 76 percent in Germany last month. In France, those numbers fell by a smaller but still substantial margin, with new registrations down 26 percent compared to figures from that period last year. Even Australians are turning against the brand, with sales dropping a catastrophic 70 percent compared to last year.\n\nThough some analysts suggest that these drops in sales could be linked to increased EV competition and the wait for Tesla's refreshed Model Y, the writing seems very much to be on the wall.\n\n\"When you play politics, there is always a risk,\" Felipe Munoz, an analyst with the automotive consultancy JATO Dynamics, told the newspaper.\n\nThat might be an understatement given that Democrats \u2014 the demographic that used to be more likely to purchase EVs, and Teslas specifically, than any other \u2014 have signaled in multiple polls that they're now spurning Teslas. According to research from Morning Consult that was shared with the WSJ, only 13 percent of Dems said they would consider buying a Tesla when polled in February, a figure down a startling 10 percent from August 2023.\n\nNew Tesla registrations for this year have taken hits in blue cities like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, per S&P Global figures the WSJ viewed. Ironically, there's reportedly been an uptick in more conservative cities like Las Vegas and Salt Lake City \u2014 a sign that Musk's right-wing politicking is paying off for him in some ways, though it's unclear whether the bump could ever be enough to offset the buyers he's losing.\n\nAs we've seen time and again, it's obvious that Musk's increasingly upsetting political maneuvers are hurting his bottom line \u2014 and it's unclear whether his heart is even still in it.\n\nMore on Tesla: Arsonists Set Fire to a Dozen Teslas, Charging Stations Amid \"Anti-Capitalist Coordination to Target Tesla\"",

The latest example of the company's slide comes from Australia, where Tesla sales have backslid a remarkable 72%, but while reading The Guardian's report on those statistics I was reminded of something else that has been bugging me for a while about these cars and their owners.\n\nThe story doesn't just revel in the massive sales decline--\"Australian Tesla owners [are] troubled by the increasingly extreme rightwing politics of the company\u2019s co-founder, Elon Musk\"--but also interviews a few people who are recent Tesla buyers and who, in the wake of DOGE and Nazi salutes and everything else, suddenly feel ashamed to be driving a Tesla around. This is not the first or only interview of this type; people all over Europe and North America are also waking up to the reality that they've spent a lot of money on a car that is now seen by a lot of other people as a symbol of white supremacy and an unchecked oligarchy. Womp.\n\nNot content with being inwardly regretful, though, some of these Tesla owners with a particularly milquetoast strain of buyer's remorse have started putting stickers on their cars that say stuff like \"Anti Elon Tesla Club\" and \"I bought this before Elon went crazy\".\n\nThese people are the most perfect encapsulation of the dire state of political and media literacy that has helped lead us to these Bad Times. Elon Musk called a cave rescue hero a paedophile seven years ago. The company has faced multiple lawsuits and investigations over everything from lying about its dangerous autopilot features to exaggerating their specs and stats (in particular the range of the cars) to privacy violations related to Tesla's inbuilt security cameras.\n\nTo their credit, some owners feeling strongly enough about current events ARE selling their cars, as this Guardian story reports.\n\nMusk went full Nazi as far back as 2022, when he purchased Twitter, reinstated a bunch of previously-banned abusers and fascists and began promoting white supremacist propaganda. When it comes to Musk being a Nazi, and the company being more of a stock market con than a car manufacturer, the writing has been on the wall for a very long time.\n\nUnless you bought a Tesla a very long time ago, you don't get to do this. Their cars have always sucked, have been outmatched by rivals since at least 2021, and Musk has been very publicly heading down this path for a lot longer than many of these suddenly-regretful idiots have owned their cars. If you bought a Tesla in 2021-25 you made a bad decision, you don't read enough, you don't do basic market research, and now you're stuck with the consequences of that decision.\n\nIf these sticker-buying Tesla owners truly had a conscience, if they really felt that his Nazi sympathies were going to impact their own personal lives by association, they'd simply sell their cars, and if there was a financial hit to take, they would take it. Putting a sticker on the back while continuing to drive and pay for a Tesla is exactly the kind of empty gesture you'd expect from a liberal in 2025, the most meaningless act possible in the face of something that calls for genuine action, and it deserves as much mockery and scorn as...driving a Tesla.",

Tesla and BYD, the world\u2019s largest EV companies, have each adopted one of these chemistries. Chinese carmaker BYD uses LFP batteries, and Tesla chose NMC.\n\nTo determine how the two rivals\u2019 batteries stack up against each other, a team of engineers and materials scientists in Germany took apart one cell from each company\u2019s battery pack, which contain dozens of cells (Cell Rep. Phys. Sci. 2025, DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrp.2025.102453). The cells\u2019 materials and designs held some surprises.\n\nEV makers guard battery technology tightly.

Battery engineers Jonas Gorsch and Moritz Frieges of RWTH Aachen University and their colleagues took a scientific sledgehammer to Tesla and BYD battery cells and did a detailed side-by-side analysis of materials composition, thermal and electrical performance, and mechanical design. \u201cMost teardowns focus on some specific aspect,\u201d Gorsch says. \u201cWe wanted a holistic comparison.\u201d\n\nThis is the type of research that \u201chelps researchers keep abreast of what\u2019s happening commercially so they can target their early-stage R&D decisions appropriately,\u201d says Micah S. Ziegler, who studies energy technology innovation at the Georgia Institute of Technology and was not involved in the work.\n\nGorsch, Frieges, and colleagues disassembled a 2022 Tesla 4680 cell and a 2023 BYD blade cell. Both cell designs entered the market in 2020. Tesla\u2019s is a 46 mm wide, 80 mm long cylindrical cell that looks like a bulked-up AA battery. BYD\u2019s cell, in contrast, looks like a roughly 1 m long flat blade. BYD claims that the space-efficient design boosts safety\u2014the flat design dissipates heat better\u2014and energy density.\n\nThe researchers found that anodes in both batteries were based on graphite. Neither used silicon. There is speculation that Tesla and other top-tier EV makers will add silicon to anodes to increase energy density, but that\u2019s not the case for these relatively new cells, Gorsch says. Tesla has replaced the typical polyvinylidene fluoride binder that glues the graphite to a conductive copper foil with polyacrylic acid and polyethylene oxide.\n\nCredit: BYD Europe\n\nAt both electrodes, particles in the BYD cell were smaller than those in Tesla\u2019s. \"Smaller particles are not ideal for energy density, as they can decrease packing density,\u201d he says. That aligns with BYD batteries\u2019 lower energy density of 160 W\u00b7h /kg compared with Tesla\u2019s 241 W\u00b7h /kg.\n\nBut there\u2019s an upside to the smaller particles. Their higher surface-to-volume ratio means lithium ions flow through them easily, leading to better charging capabilities and lower resistance. Indeed, when the researchers charged the cells at various charging rates, the Tesla NMC cell got significantly hotter than BYD\u2019s LFP cell. Gorsch says that the LFP cell\u2019s improved electrical performance could pave the way for faster charging, and in addition to lower cost could be why carmakers are turning to LFP chemistry after chasing NMC for years.\n\nAnother surprise was that both companies used lasers to weld the coated copper foils to their cell\u2019s external contact. State-of-the-art large batteries typically use ultrasonic welding, which uses heat produced by high-frequency sound waves to melt and fuse metals, he says. Copper\u2019s high light reflectivity makes it difficult to laser-weld. It requires special high-power green or blue lasers operated very precisely, he says. \u201cFor large-volume production, those small differences can make huge impacts on production costs.\u201d",

            "content": "As robotaxis become a more familiar sight on the streets of Los Angeles, Tesla has taken a step that could bring it closer to building its own fleet of self-driving electric vehicles, the California Public Utilities Commission confirmed last week.\n\nIn November, Tesla applied for a permit that would allow the electric-vehicle manufacturing giant to deploy transportation services with company-owned vehicles and human drivers. The permit would be required for Tesla to advance to autonomous cabs.\n\nChief Executive Elon Musk has long made clear his ambitions for a robotaxi service powered by Tesla vehicles, though his company has been criticized by the U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency for making statements that its vehicles can drive themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, the automaker is still a long way off before it can launch a service.\n\nAnd it\u2019s still playing catch-up. Although Waymo has put driverless vehicles on the road in cities including Los Angeles and San Francisco, industry experts say Tesla is still far from offering a robotaxi service.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know:\n\nWhat\u2019s the permit for?\n\nA transportation charter-party carrier permit, or TCP. Companies that charter buses for sporting events or limousines for special occasions use this permit, according to the CPUC\u2019s website.\n\nIf granted, the permit by itself would not allow Tesla to run any autonomous vehicle rides, with or without someone behind the wheel. Rather, the permit is a prerequisite for the commission\u2019s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service, which would give Tesla permission to deploy driverless taxis in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, only a handful of companies are permitted to deploy driverless taxis in California \u2014 Waymo, WeRide AI and Zoox. Cruise, which was stopped by General Motors after causing serious injury to a pedestrian, had its permit suspended.\n\nWhat is Tesla planning?\n\nThere\u2019s no direct connection between obtaining a TCP and operating a fleet of robotaxis, said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina who specializes in emerging transportation technology.\n\nBut Musk probably is trying to signal a move toward autonomous services, he said.\n\n\u201cOne possibility is that it has truly nothing to do with robotaxis, and they really just want to operate a bunch of Tesla party buses,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObtaining a TCP could help Tesla lay the groundwork for a future fleet, said Sam Abuelsamid, who researches emerging transportation technology for Telemetry Insights.\n\n\u201cThey probably want to do some real-world testing of their dispatch system, looking down the road at when they hope to maybe launch a robotaxi service,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk said in an earnings call in January that there were huge gains to be made by utilizing autonomous driving, claiming older cars will attract more value overnight with a software update. \u201cVery few people understand the value of full self driving and our ability to monetize the fleet,\u201d he said.\n\nHow soon could driverless Tesla taxis hit the road?\n\nThe timeline for driverless Tesla cabs in California is unclear. The company must be approved for a TCP permit and also apply and be accepted into the CPUC autonomous vehicle program. The California Department of Motor Vehicles also has required permits for testing and eventually deploying driverless vehicles.\n\nAutonomous Teslas could hit the roads sooner in Austin, Texas, where regulations are less strict. Tesla reached out to Austin officials in charge of its autonomous vehicle task force in May, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe regulatory process in California could take up to a year, assuming that Tesla\u2019s technology proves to be safe, Smith said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk said in the January earnings call that Tesla would put Cybertrucks, Model 3s and Model Ys using unsupervised \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d technology on the road in Texas and California as early as this year. Guests in October took rides on a closed track in Cybercab and Cybervan prototypes, which lack steering wheels, rear view mirrors and gas or brake pedals.\n\n\u201cI tend to be a little optimistic with time frames,\u201d Musk told the crowd in a Tesla keynote speech in Burbank in October. Musk has promised fully autonomous driving as far back as 2014. He also has exaggerated the abilities of Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving mode, according to Abuelsamid and other experts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect robotaxis to happen for Tesla for a long time,\u201d Abuelsamid said. \u201cI don\u2019t think their technology is going to be suitable for that until they make some fundamental changes.\u201d\n\nIs the technology safe?\n\nTesla\u2019s supervised Full Self-Driving mode does not currently function without a human at the wheel, and was being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for safety concerns after multiple crashes, including one that killed a pedestrian.\n\nTesla tells drivers that they must be ready to intervene immediately while using Full-Self Driving mode, and one driver who struck a train while using autopilot admitted that the crash was his fault, NBC reported.\n\nThe NHTSA\u2019s autonomous car regulators suffered layoffs after the Elon Musk-led, so-called Department of Government Efficiency cuts targeted that team, the Washington Post reported.\n\nA study by ISeeCars.com released in November said that Tesla had the highest rate of fatal accidents of all car brands between 2017 and 2022 despite its use of driver assistance technology and high crash safety ratings by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. A Tesla executive called the study \u201cclickbait\u201d in an X post and said the study used an estimated mileage number which wasn\u2019t accurate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla\u2019s autonomous driving technology differs from Waymo\u2019s in several ways, Abuelsamid said. Waymo vehicles use cameras as well as radar and a type of laser-based radar called lidar to navigate the roads. Musk has repeatedly denounced the use of lidar, but his heavy reliance on cameras has made Full Self-Driving mode less safe, according to Abuelsamid.\n\nSmith also noted factors that differentiate the operational Waymo driverless technology from Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving mode. Waymo vehicles use a more advanced map to navigate, he said, and more often rely on a modular learning process that allows them to react to the environment around them.\n\n\u201cEvery announcement that Musk makes is aimed at trying to build the narrative around Tesla autonomy,\u201d Abuelsamid said. \u201cWhen you actually look at the technology, it just doesn\u2019t hold up.\u201d",

Credit: Dominika Zarzycka/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nOf all Elon Musk's companies, the most successful and lucrative business has easily been his EV car company, Tesla. For many, the brand name \"Tesla\" has become synonymous with electric cars.\n\nUnfortunately for the company, \"Tesla\" is also becoming synonymous with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's embrace of the far-right.\n\nNumerous reports have shown that Tesla's sales have plummeted worldwide as Musk ties himself to the Trump administration and fires federal workers under DOGE. EV outlet Electrek reports that Tesla's sales are worse in Europe. Last month, deliveries in Europe dropped by 50 percent compared to the same timeframe one year earlier.\n\nCertain acts, like the so-called \"Roman salute\" gesture that Musk performed on Inauguration Day, have also affected Tesla's sales.\n\nSEE ALSO: DOGE tech employees jointly resign in protest of Elon Musk\n\nAccording to a new report on Wednesday, sales in Europe continue to decline. For example, Tesla has seen a sales decline of 76 percent in Germany. In February 2025, Tesla only delivered 1,429 new vehicles in Germany, compared to more than 6,000 in February 2024. This data is especially concerning for Tesla, as Germany is Europe's largest EV market. Musk recently backed Germany's far-right AfD party in the country's recent elections.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

It's not just Europe, either.\n\nTesla sales in Australia fell by nearly 72 percent in February. The company only sold 1,592 vehicles last month compared to the 5,665 it sold the previous year.\n\nIt appears that Tesla sales are slumping in the U.S., too. According to the California New Car Dealers Association, Tesla registered fewer cars in the state in all four quarters of 2024. California is the largest EV market in the U.S. Tesla sales fell by 8 percent in the fourth quarter and 12 percent for the whole year.\n\nRecently, The New York Times reported on now-former Tesla owners who recently sold their EVs due to Musk's actions and the associated consequences of being seen as supporters of Musk's for driving a Tesla vehicle.\n\nAs long as Musk works with Trump, Tesla's business will likely continue to decline. After all, the consumers most likely to buy an electric vehicle are environmentally conscious, often liberal individuals. Even if the Trump-Musk relationship ends, it might be too late for Tesla to redeem itself in the eyes of many of those consumers.",

            "content": "Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla\u2019s Chief Designer, spoke about the company\u2019s upcoming budget EV (unofficially christened the \u2018Tesla Model Q\u2018) among a raft of other topics on the Ride The Lightning podcast, published March 2, 2025 (we highly recommend that you listen). While he wouldn\u2019t give out the specifics, he spoke about the design philosophy and intentions behind the affordable model.\n\nVon Holzhausen said Tesla wants every product to feel worth more than its price: \u201cI think we want you to feel like you\u2019ve gotten the upgrade, even though you didn\u2019t pay for it.\u201d The highly awaited upcoming model is expected to face off with the next-gen Chevrolet Bolt EUV.\n\nThe Model Q, despite its compact footprint, is expected to offer enough space for four adults and three large suitcases. It should sport the new family look, with the signature front light band.\n\nThe design chief dismissed the idea that affordability means lower quality. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s this idea that more affordable equals cheap\u2014cheap plastic, cheap whatever. That\u2019s never been our intention,\u201d he told host Ryan McCaffrey.\n\nTesla wants the Model Q (unofficial moniker) to also feel more premium than its price suggests. Von Holzhausen said the company is finding design solutions that enhance the experience without raising costs. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking to design a way around ideas that can make the products feel more premium than the price point you pay for,\u201d he added.\n\nTypical Tesla touches like ambient lighting, a large central touchscreen, hidden air vents, clever color coding, and even vegan leather upholstery could contribute to the feel of a more premium vehicle. Pictured is the Model 3\n\nUnlike other launches, Tesla is faced with the challenge of balancing affordability, range, and its brand identity with its next car. Von Holzhausen said that the company will pay attention to offering better value and space than the price suggests, maintaining this approach across its models.\n\nTesla will introduce its most affordable car by June 2025. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja confirmed on the Q4 earnings call, held on January 29, 2025, \u201cWe are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025.\u201d Tesla\u2019s Q4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Results report highlighted that the car will use components or modules of the next-gen platform, but will be built on existing production lines, like the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nA more efficient 48V auxiliary battery, V2L, LFP battery pack, and optional FSD are expected in Tesla\u2019s entry-level car, which is expected to be priced starting at $30,000-35,000.\n\nSpeculation about the Model 2/Model Q\u2019s specifications has been rife since Tesla\u2019s April 2023 \u2018Master Plan 3\u2019 document. It suggested a compact EV with a 53 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery. LFP cells are cheaper but bulkier than nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, which could mean a more modest range. LFP will keep costs down and set the Model Q apart from pricier models, delivering around 250 miles of range.\n\nAlso See: 2025 Tesla Model Y: 17 Confirmed Changes/Improvements that you should know about\n\nFeatured image: TopElectricSUV\u2019s illustration of the affordable Tesla car.",

            "content": "The Tesla lineup was always intended to dump a high tech product on the market that is advanced enough to not need any updates for a few years longer than your standard car's refresh cycle, but some have complained that the automaker's wares are growing a bit too stale\u2014particularly its earlier efforts, the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. These larger offerings are the oldest vehicles on sale from Tesla, having seen only minor updates over the years; the S, for example, is nearly 13 years old. That could change later in 2025 with updates to both models, if a guy on a podcast is supposed to be believed.\n\nIt's not just some guy on some podcast, however. The quote comes from Tesla's Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, Lars Moravy on the Ride the Lightning podcast. He claims \"The upgrade [to the Model S and X] a few years ago was bigger than most people thought in terms of architecture and structure. We\u2019ll give it some love later this year. Everyone here has a little place in their heart for S/X. They are not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nThose updates a few years back he's referring to included some styling tweaks, particularly to the S, along with some under-the-skin changes, most of which would be considered equivalent to a typical mid-cycle refresh, not a total redesign. There was also the addition of the super powerful, super quick Plaid variants of both the S and X. So, what are these fresh changes we expect, with what little information we have? Well for the Model S, beyond standard improvements to range and the interior materials, we expect the turn indicators to move to the steering wheel, as they have on the Model 3 and Y, and on the exterior there is sure to be at least one, if not two full light bars, front and rear to mimic the recent updates to the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The Model S will have fresh competition from Volvo's coming ES90 sedan that debuts in March, expected to offer more than 400 miles of range, but the Volvo isn't likely to be as quick and sporty as the Tesla.\n\nThe Model X is where we could potentially see the biggest and most dramatic changes, namely the long overdue elimination of the troublesome power-operated \"falcon wing\" rear doors on the SUV. It's possible Tesla could simplify the vehicle with traditional rear doors, however, retooling for that could be cost prohibitive and it may be more affordable, and better marketing, to keep the funky door setup as is and make changes elsewhere. Those other changes likely include improvements to the interior materials, a moving of the indicators, and an exterior refresh in line with the Model 3 and Model Y look with light bars front and rear.\n\nTesla is now in sales decline in the U.S., rapidly losing market share and sales to new competitors, and the company now has to deal with a very political CEO. Like him or not, it means more spotlight and more potential for backlash. Updating the S and X could improve sales of both vehicles, which surely generate higher profits than Tesla's more affordable cars, but not enough to reverse Tesla's unfortunate trends. Still, it should make for better product on the road, and we look forward to testing them out when they go on sale.",

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk\u2019s car company is required each year to report to investors all the bad things that could happen to it, and the latest version lists every imaginable threat from costly lawsuits to out-of-control battery fires to war and another epidemic.\n\nBut there\u2019s barely any mention in the latest annual update of Musk\u2019s full-bore entry into right-wing politics, which some experts say is turning off potential customers who don\u2019t share his views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s marketing 101: Don\u2019t involve yourself in politics,\u201d said New York brand consultant Robert Passikoff. \u201cPeople will stop buying your products.\u201d\n\nIt may be too late.\n\nTesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. That comes after a report of falling sales in California, its biggest U.S. market, and the first annual drop globally for the company last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to drive it,\u201d said Model 3 owner John Parnell, a Democrat from Ross, California, adding that he also is cancelling his order for the company\u2019s Cybertruck, losing a $100 deposit. \u201cHe\u2019s destroying the brand with his politics.\u201d\n\nCar industry analysts say it\u2019s too early to say for sure how much damage Musk is causing to Tesla because so many other factors could explain its current troubles. It\u2019s best selling vehicle, the Model Y, is coming out with a new version this year, leading potential Tesla buyers to hold off purchases right now. And European and Chinese manufacturers are finally catching up to the world\u2019s EV leader, offering cars with battery life and dependability that are competitive.\n\nBut, if anything, that makes Musk\u2019s political comments even more reckless, auto analysts say.\n\n\u201cMusk thinks he can say anything he wants to and doesn\u2019t think Tesla will suffer any consequences,\u201c said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cTesla was in the sweet spot. Now it has competition.\u201d\n\nThe sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France in January, down roughly 60% each, more than the average decline for the more than two-dozen European countries surveyed. Sales in France fell another 26% in February.\n\nMore worrisome was the breakdown for Tesla\u2019s individual models. Sales of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 dropped 33% across all European countries even though that car is not being updated and there is no reason for buyers to wait\n\n\u201cPart of the population is not happy with his views, his political activism,\u201d said Jato senior analyst Felipe Munoz who had shrugged off the boycott threat earlier this year, but is now having second thoughts.\n\nMany Tesla buyers used to be wealthy, environmentally-conscious professionals, often liberal, who were attracted to Musk\u2019s talk about how his EVs could help save the planet from fossil-fuel destruction.\n\nNot anymore.\n\n\u201cI used to be adored by the left,\u201d Musk said in an interview with Tucker Carlson on February 18 as his stock was halfway through a nearly 30% plunge for the month. \u201cLess so these days.\u201d\n\nHis decision to spend $270 million on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and publicly back him was risky enough for his business. Then he doubled down, pursuing a slash-and-burn strategy as head of Trump\u2019s government efficiency team and taking his political revolution and incendiary talk abroad.\n\nHe has backed the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who runs a \u201cpolice state,\u201d and stated recently about a U.S. neighbor and major Tesla market, \u201cCanada is not a real country.\u201d\n\nThe backlash has been fierce.\n\nTesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized and bumper stickers appearing on its cars with sayings such as, \u201cI bought it before Elon went nuts.\u201d\n\nAn effigy of Musk was hung in Milan and image of him doing a straight-arm salute projected on a Tesla factory outside Berlin. In London, a bus stop poster of him above the word \u201cswasticars\u201d lit up social media. A Polish government minister called for a Tesla boycott.\n\n\u201cI will not buy a Tesla again,\u201d said Jens Fischer, a 50-year-old microscope salesman in Witten, Germany, who thinks Musk is \u201cdestabilizing democracy\u201d and has slapped one of those \u201cElon went nuts\u201d stickers on his Model 3. \u201cI\u2019d sell if I got a good offer.\u201d\n\nTesla investor Ross Gerber says Musk has somehow managed to marry the world\u2019s best product with the world\u2019s worst marketing.\n\n\u201cPeople want to buy stuff that makes them feel good, you don\u2019t want politics involved,\u201d said Gerber, a money manager whose portfolios hold nearly $60 million in Tesla stock. \u201cIt\u2019s even worse when you have such divisive issues, whether it\u2019s firing climate scientists or taking aid away from starving African children.\u201d\n\nBoycotts have a habit of fizzling out, and Morningstar\u2019s Goldstein says that buying a car is too big a decision and costs too much to make them successful targets, anyway.\n\nOne Tesla owner, Londoner Harry Chathli, is unmoved by the backlash, saying he has no intention of getting rid of his Tesla S. He has nothing but praise for Musk who he calls a visionary for transforming \u201cthe way we think about transportation and the future of our planet.\u201d\n\nBut if Tesla\u2019s stock is any indicator, the company\u2019s prospects are deteriorating, and Musk\u2019s position in the Trump administration isn\u2019t helping. As of Friday, it has dropped 37% since its Inauguration Day, a loss of $550 billion in investor wealth.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAP Business Writers Pan Pylas in London and David McHugh in Frankfurt contributed to this story.",

Email Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nMusk is backing Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, the conservative candidate in the race and former state attorney general. The April 1 election pits Schimel against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the race.\n\nMusk\u2019s money has helped tip the funding scales in conservatives\u2019 favor, but it comes as Tesla is suing the state over a decision that prevented the company from opening dealerships in Wisconsin.\n\nLast year, the state denied Tesla\u2019s request for dealer licenses, saying the company did not qualify for an exemption to a state law prohibiting manufacturers from owning dealerships. The company had hoped to convert its galleries in Madison and Milwaukee into dealerships, and had additional plans for dealerships in Glendale and the Fox Cities.\n\nIn January, Tesla filed a petition for a judicial review in Outagamie County Circuit Court seeking to overturn the decision. A hearing is scheduled for later this month on whether the case should remain in Outagamie County or transfer to either Dane or Milwaukee County.\n\nA Tesla electric vehicle is charged on Wednesday, May 10, 2023, in Westlake, Calif. Mark J. Terrill/AP Photo\n\nTesla case could reach the state Supreme Court\n\nTesla\u2019s case could hypothetically make its way to the state Supreme Court. But it\u2019s not clear if it\u2019s the type of case the court typically takes up, said Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.\n\nIf Tesla doesn\u2019t like the circuit court\u2019s decision, it could appeal the case to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. After the appeals court, Godar says the state Supreme Court would choose whether to take the case.\n\n\u201cThe types of cases that they decide to take up are kind of limited,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet whether this Tesla case would raise the types of issues that the court is accustomed to hearing.\u201d\n\nTesla public relations, as well as attorneys listed in its petition for judicial review, did not immediately respond to requests for comment about whether the company plans to fight its case all the way up to the state\u2019s high court.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s code of judicial conduct says a judge shall not be required to recuse solely based on an endorsement or on legal campaign contributions. Godar says that provision was added in 2010 and \u201cinsulates judges and justices from having to recuse\u201d because of financing they get during the campaign, like the contributions from Musk\u2019s PAC.\n\nThere\u2019s a general ethics provision that tells judges to recuse if it appears they cannot be impartial, but it\u2019s up to state Supreme Court justices to decide whether they will be able to rule impartially.\n\nThere have been high-profile cases in Wisconsin where this issue has come up in recent decades, with justices of both partisan leanings declining to recuse themselves, Godar said.\n\nIn 2023, liberal Justice Janet Protasiewicz declined to recuse from a redistricting case after being criticized for receiving campaign contributions from the state Democratic Party. In 2007, conservative Justice Annette Ziegler, now the chief justice, declined to recuse from a case where Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce participated after spending $2.2 million on her behalf.\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office at the White House, Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2025, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP Photo\n\nLegal experts weigh in on Musk donations, Tesla case\n\nStephen Gillers, an emeritus law professor at New York University Law School, said he sees Musk as no different from any other organization that anticipates making repeat appearances before state courts, or anticipates issues facing the court could affect them.\n\n\u201cThey want to influence how the state court rules, and they want to do that by generously supporting candidates whose votes, once elected, are likely \u2014 in their prediction \u2014 to favor the positions they have,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are not wild donations. They\u2019re calculated.\u201d\n\nJames Sample is a law professor at the Maurice A. Deane School of Law at Hofstra University in New York state. He said Wisconsin\u2019s model of allowing justices to decide whether or not they can be impartial is a \u201cfundamental flaw\u201d in the system.\n\nHe said Musk\u2019s campaign spending could reasonably be viewed as a conflict of interest for Schimel if Tesla\u2019s case reaches the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIf Elon Musk\u2019s personal expenditures end up being one of the primary forces that supports the campaign of a judge, and then Elon Musk \u2014 in his corporate capacity \u2014 effectively appears before the Wisconsin Supreme Court, ask yourself the question: Might it be reasonable to question the impartiality of the judge whom he supported?\u201d Sample asked.\n\n\u201cIf you are on the other side of a case in which the justice received millions of dollars in campaign support from your opponent, would anyone truly believe that they were getting a fair hearing? If the answer to that question is no, as I think it most definitely is, that speaks to the flaw in the system,\u201d he continued.\n\nWith Musk\u2019s powerful position in the Trump White House, the tech billionaire\u2019s spending in the state Supreme Court race could seek to expand his influence into the courts, Sample said.\n\n\u201cWhether an oligarch is conservative or liberal, it is a concern when the oligarchy takes over our politics and our courts,\u201d he said.\n\nElon Musk speaks as President Donald Trump holds a Cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. Pool Photo Courtesy of the Associated Press\n\nCampaigns trade barbs over campaign backers\n\nThe Crawford campaign has been critical of Musk\u2019s involvement in the race, framing it as an attempt by the world\u2019s richest man to buy a seat on the court. Meanwhile, the Schimel campaign has been critical of Crawford\u2019s backing from liberal megadonors like billionaire George Soros.\n\nIf elected, Schimel said in a statement that he will search his conscience to ensure he can truthfully remain objective in every case that comes before the court. He also criticized Crawford for her support from big donors, and her decision to appear at a recent Democratic donor briefing.\n\n\u201cUnlike Susan Crawford, who was caught offering two congressional seats to out-of-state Democrat billionaires and has received the backing of George Soros, Reid Hoffman, and JB Pritzker, I will not prejudge cases,\u201d Schimel said in a statement.\n\nCrawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman said it\u2019s no surprise Musk is spending millions of dollars to support Schimel\u2019s campaign after his company sued Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cWisconsinites deserve a Supreme Court Justice that puts fairness and impartiality first \u2014 not a career politician like Schimel who\u2019s always for sale to the highest bidder,\u201d Honeyman said in a statement.",

Some Cybertruck owners report being harassed, and news reports nationally show multiple dealerships have been targeted by anti-Musk vandals.\n\nLast week, protesters across the country showed up at Tesla dealerships for a \"Tesla Takedown,\" a demonstration against Musk, Tesla's CEO, and his efforts to shrink and remake American government, his controversial posts and the rightward tilt of the social media platform X under his stewardship, and his outsized influence on federal spending.\n\nSome, though, have crossed the line from peaceful protests as people vandalize the cars that helped make Musk a household name long before his foray into American politics.\n\nCybertruck owners have shared displays of hostility from other motorists on a Facebook page, including vulgar notes left on their vehicles and obscene gestures directed at them from passing cars. Etsy offers several stickers for Tesla owners to affix to their bumpers with messages including \"This Tesla does not endorse Elon Musk,\" \"Anti Elon Tesla Club\" and \"I bought this before Elon went crazy.\"\n\nAnd Tesla owners are asking Musk and the vehicle manufacturer to help fend off potential vandals, according to a media outlet focused on Tesla, SpaceX and other Musk-owned companies.\n\nHere's a look at some of the incidents involving Teslas.\n\nHow are Teslas being targeted?\n\nIn Colorado, a 42-year-old woman, Lucy Grace Nelson, was charged with malicious destruction of property after being accused of spray-painting graffiti on signs and vehicles at a Loveland Tesla dealership, CBS News reported. Nelson, authorities said, painted messages mentioning Musk and his support of right-wing figures in the U.S., Germany and elsewhere.\n\nThe photos from the federal arrest documents also show small fires on the lot of the dealership that are believed to have been started by molotov cocktails inside vodka bottles; the suspect is seen throwing the explosives across the lot in some of the photos, CBS reported.\n\nNine people were arrested during a protest Saturday outside a Tesla dealership in New York City, Reuters reported. In Maryland, another Tesla dealership was vandalized, WMAR-TV reported, with the words \"No Musk\" and an \"X\" spray painted on the Ownings Mills dealership's windows.\n\nPolice in Massachusetts are investigating fires Monday at Tesla charging stations outside a shopping center in Littleton, CBS News reported, noting that police believe the fires were set intentionally.\n\nIn Salem, Oregon, gunshots were fired at the windows of a Tesla dealership, according to a story on the Salem Reporter's website. It wasn't the first time the dealership was targeted, the Reporter said; police also are investigating a suspected arson on Jan. 20.\n\nLast month, a Tennessee man was charged with threatening to burn down a Musk-owned data center in Memphis.\n\nWhy are Teslas being targeted?\n\nMusk, Tesla's CEO and co-founder, has emerged as one of the most polarizing figures in the U.S. and Europe as his political engagement, stewardship of the social platform X (which he renamed after buying Twitter in 2022) and provocative public statements have escalated.\n\nThe richest man in the world, Musk became a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump during Trump's 2024 campaign and has become a central figure in implementing Trump's agenda.\n\nHe has created an agency that has fired thousands of government employees, referred to Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme\" and called for the dissolution of entire government agencies. He also has supported right-wing parties in Germany and called on Germans to \"move beyond\" its past, including the Holocaust. Musk has also drawn criticism for what some believe was a Nazi-like salute during a Trump inaugural event; Musk has denied the accusation.\n\nWhat features might Tesla add to its vehicles to prevent vandalism?\n\nIn a March 3 post, Teslarati reported that the electric vehicle maker is \"adding a new feature that will aim to fight off vandals as anti-Elon Musk protests continue to be a true threat to the company's owners and employees.\"\n\nThe post wasn't clear what that feature will be, however.\n\nAnother post on X \u2212 also owned and heavily influenced by Musk \u2212 is from a driver asking if there is \"any way of getting in a software update an (sic) alarm to protect from keying the car.\"\n\n\"The car could tell the criminal before they start that they are being filmed and reported to the authorities,\" the user, Alexandra Merz, suggests.\n\nAmong the more than 250 replies is one from Musk himself: \"Car could honk at people if you want.\"\n\nThe update, Teslarati wrote, \"seems like an easy fix, and it can be installed through an Over-the-Air update.\"\n\nTeslas are already equipped with security features including cabin cameras, alarms if the trunk or doors are opened without a key, and Sentry Mode, which monitors the environment around unattended cars. That feature can use external cameras and switch on alerts and alarms to dissuade potential thieves or vandals \u2212 and alert owners via a mobile app that something is happening.",

Across the continent, the story is the same: fewer Tesla sales, more competition and a CEO who keeps making headlines for all of the wrong reasons. The numbers don't lie\u2014while Europe's overall EV sales are up, deliveries for Tesla are down hard, continuing the trend from a rather brutal January, and things don't look like they're letting up anytime soon.\n\nCountries like Norway (which was once Tesla's Scandinavian stronghold) have seemingly lost the love for the American automaker. Sales there are down 48% year-over-year. That's roughly the same as the European-wide drop of 45.2% in January. Denmark and Sweden also saw year-over-year drops of more than 40% for February, while France saw a lesser 25% drop year-over-year according to data first reported by Electrek.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs/Andrei Nedelea\n\nDespite European deliveries falling, Tesla's stock is still out-performing other automakers. Granted, share prices have fallen more than 38% since peaking in December 2024, but the real number to look at\u2014Tesla's price-to-earnings ratio, which shows how much it's worth to how much it earns in profits\u2014is still at a mind-boggling 86. Toyota, the next-highest car manufacturer, sits at a cool 9.01.\n\nSo what's happening here? How can Tesla be losing customers at an alarming rate while still be treated like the golden child of wall street?\n\nThe answer is a complicated paradox of duality, and its name is Elon Musk.\n\nTesla's stock has long rested on the shoulders of Musk. The company's CEO is a visionary\u2014one who sold the world on Tesla's mission of sustainability while also expanding the automaker's product line beyond just cars. This has allowed investors to ignore Musk's political side and instead embrace the promises of autonomy, humanoid robots and robotaxi ride-hailing services. In fact, some analysts believe Tesla's share price still has a valuation well over $500 per share.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world is invested in Musk's political meddling like it's a reality TV show. Protestors have demonstrated at Tesla showrooms across the globe to dissuade would-be buyers from purchasing a Tesla while others are doing the same with their wallet\u2014simply buying anything other than a Tesla when shopping for an EV. That includes owners who have otherwise been loyal to the brand in years prior.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nIt's still early in the year, but if public events and outcry are any indication of what 2025 has in store for Tesla, Europe turning its nose at the automaker could be just the beginning of a substantial sales slump. Competition in the EV space is fiercer than ever. With more and more car companies focusing on affordable, quality models, Tesla could be in for a very nasty wake-up call.\n\nEventually, Wall Street may have to start questioning why Tesla is still priced like a startup instead of, you know, an actual car company. If it can't fix the core business, its stock bubble may eventually burst and those results won't be pretty.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Demonstrators gathered outside Tesla stores across the U.S. Saturday to protest the automaker\u2019s billionaire CEO, Elon Musk, and his push to slash government spending on behalf of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe demonstrations are part of a growing backlash in North America and Europe to Musk\u2019s disruptive role in Washington.\n\nCritics of Trump and Musk hope to discourage and stigmatize purchases of Tesla, the electric car company that is the world\u2019s most valuable automaker. Liberal groups for weeks have organized anti-Tesla protests in hopes of galvanizing opposition to Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency and energizing Democrats still demoralized by Trump\u2019s November victory.\n\n\u201cWe can get back at Elon,\u201d said Nathan Phillips, a 58-year-old ecologist from Newton, Massachusetts, who was protesting in Boston on Saturday. \u201cWe can impose direct economic damage on Tesla by showing up at showrooms everywhere and boycotting Tesla and telling everyone else to get out, sell your stocks, sell your Teslas.\u201d\n\nMusk is taking direction from Trump to slash federal spending and sharply reduce the workforce, arguing that Trump\u2019s victory gave the president and him a mandate to restructure the U.S. government. DOGE officials have swiftly gained access to sensitive databases, directed thousands of federal job cuts, canceled contracts and shut down sections of the government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nMusk\u2019s critics say his actions defy Congress\u2019s power to control the U.S. budget and present a host of ways for him to enrich himself. Musk leads several other companies, notably SpaceX, which conducts launches for NASA and the intelligence community, and the social media platform X.\n\n\u201cProtests will not deter President Trump and Elon Musk from delivering on the promise to establish DOGE and make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers across the country,\u201d said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.\n\nTesla did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nMore than 50 demonstrations were listed Saturday on the website Tesla Takedown, with more planned later in March from coast to coast in the United States along with England, Spain and Portugal. News reports showed demonstrations in recent days in U.S. cities including Tucson, Arizona; St. Louis; New York City; Dayton, Ohio; Charlotte; and Palo Alto, California.\n\nSome Tesla owners have also reported their vehicles vandalized with spray painted swastikas amid what Jewish groups and observers fear is a rise in antisemitism.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged a woman in connection with a string of vandalism against a Colorado Tesla dealership, which included Molotov cocktails being thrown at vehicles and the words \u201cNazi cars\u201d spray painted on the building.\n\nSaturday\u2019s demonstration in Boston had a festive atmosphere, with a brass band playing music as protesters carried signs and chanted. Several of the signs mocked Musk and DOGE, with one reading: \u201cStop Elon and his despicable Muskrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis government led by Trump and Musk, it\u2019s gone completely off the rails and we are here to stop that,\u201d said Carina Campobasso, a retired federal worker. \u201cAnd I hope they listen.\u201d\n\nAbout 300 demonstrators protested at a Tesla dealership in New York City on Saturday. Police said nine people were taken into custody but did not elaborate on the charges they faced.\n\nTesla\u2019s share price has fallen by nearly a third since Trump took office, though it\u2019s still higher than it was a year ago. Musk\u2019s current net worth is an estimated $359 billion, according to Forbes, which calculated his 2024 net worth as $195 billion.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of Carina Campobasso\u2019s last name.\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.

            "content": "Update (March 9, 2025): \u2018Tesla Roadster (2025)\u2019 revised.\n\nTesla is synonymous with electric cars, a reputation that has undoubtedly helped it gain more than 7 million buyers. In fact, in 2024, Tesla continues to lead in brand loyalty for automakers in America, S&P Global said on August 8, 2024, with a rate of 67.8 percent for the first half of 2024.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the future Tesla cars that are expected to be launched in the U.S. in the next three years. Note that the article is a compilation of information from various sources (official and unofficial), and the timelines are speculative.\n\nNew Tesla Model Y (March 2025)\n\nFollowing the launch of the new Model 3 and the Cybertruck, Tesla has refreshed the Model Y for the U.S. The company has confirmed that customer deliveries will begin in the coming days.\n\nTesla has priced the Launch Series Long Range AWD variant at $59,990 before tax credits, taxes, and fees. Image Source: Tesla\n\nThe facelifted Tesla Model Y features split headlamps with a light band connecting the DRLs, a longer hood, new bumpers and wheels, a full-width rear combination lamp with subdued illumination, and a cleaner tailgate. Inside, thin ambient light strips highlighting the seamless connection between the redesigned dashboard and door panels give the interior an upscale look.\n\nVentilated front seats, a 15.4-inch touchscreen in the front, an 8-inch rear touchscreen, double-layer acoustic glass, and an upgraded, 16-speaker sound system are among the additions.\n\nThe Launch Series Long Range AWD variant is expected to deliver an estimated 320 miles on a single charge, a nominal increase from the current model\u2019s 311-mile range. The AWD model is priced at $59,990 before tax credits, taxes, and fees.\n\nNew Model Y Performance, 7-Seat & RWD (2025)\n\nThe refreshed Model Y Performance (rendered top) and 7-seat variants will complete the lineup later this year.\n\nTesla will introduce three additional Model Y variants during the course of this year. According to Lars Moravy, VP of Vehicle Engineering (via Youtube/Jay Leno\u2019s Garage), the company definitely plans to expand the lineup beyond the Launch Edition. A rear-wheel-drive variant will offer a lower entry point, featuring the longest range. A seven-seat configuration, as it stands, will provide more flexibility, catering to families needing added capacity.\n\nFor performance-focused buyers, a new Model Y Performance variant will continue to be part of the refreshed lineup. Stronger acceleration, a sportier suspension setup, grippier tires, and sport seat are some of the differentiators. These models will follow the Launch Edition, with Tesla rolling them out in a phased manner.\n\nTesla Model S Refresh (2025)\n\nAfter 12 years, the Tesla Model S (Plaid version pictured) remains technically advanced, but we believe the aging design and average rear seat comfort call for upgrades to stay competitive.\n\nTesla is preparing an update for the Model S. Lars Moravy, Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, confirmed the plan on the Ride the Lightning podcast.\n\nBut we\u2019ll give it some love, you know..later this year..I mean, sure, we\u2019ll make sure it gets some of the stuff we\u2019ve been putting in 3 and Y. Lars Moravy, Vice President of Vehicle Engineering of Tesla, talking about the Model S & X, on the Ride the Lightning podcast\n\nChanges are expected to follow the new Model 3 and Model Y. Exterior updates could include new front and rear fascias while preserving the Model S\u2019s shape. The interior could discard the driver\u2019s gauge cluster in favor of a larger center touchscreen, similar to the Cybertruck. The low-voltage system could switch from 12V to 48V, improving efficiency and compatibility with future Tesla tech.\n\nTesla Model X Refresh (2025)\n\nFeatures like steer-by-wire, 48V system, ambient lighting, next-gen FSD hardware, and front & rear light bars could be installed in the 2026 Model X & Model S.\n\nTesla will update the Model X alongside the Model S later this year. It is expected to further differentiate the crossover with design cues from the refreshed Model Y, adding front and rear light bars. Likewise, changes like the 48V low-voltage system, a front-facing bumper camera, and new lighting are on the cards. The interior could see a larger center screen, ambient lighting, and improvement in trim quality.\n\nTesla Model Q (By June 2025)\n\nTesla has been working on a lower-cost EV positioned below the Model 3 for years, often referred to as the \u2018Model 2\u2019 or \u2018Model Q\u2019 by the public. During the Q4 2024 earnings call, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja confirmed that the company remains on track to introduce a more affordable model in the first half of 2025. However, he did not disclose any specifics about its design or features.\n\nThe Model Q is expected to offer about 250 miles of range, with similar software and autonomy features as the bigger Teslas. Image: TopElectricSUV\u2019s rendering of an entry-level Tesla.\n\nTesla\u2019s financial report further clarifies that this new EV will not be a stripped-down version of the Model 3 or Model Y. Instead, it will use a mix of Tesla\u2019s next-generation and existing platforms, allowing it to be built on current production lines.\n\nOn December 9, 2024, The Wall Street Journal reporter Becky Peterson shared details on X about Tesla\u2019s upcoming model, citing a report from Deutsche Bank. As per the report, Tesla aims to position the Model Q under the 3, pricing it just below USD 30,000. This figure accounts for the USD 7,500 clean vehicle tax credit.\n\nThe information surfaced following Tesla\u2019s meeting with Deutsche Bank for its Autonomous Driving Day, held on December 5, 2024, in New York City. During the event, Travis Axelrod, Tesla\u2019s Head of Investor Relations, reportedly discussed the product with the bank, which is to be introduced by June 2025.\n\nTesla Roadster (2025)\n\nThe next-gen Tesla Roadster made a surprise debut on November 17, 2017, at Tesla\u2019s Hawthorne facility in California. Originally planned to showcase the Tesla Semi, the event stunned attendees worldwide with the unexpected unveiling of the two-door sports car.\n\nThe next-gen Roadster could enter production and go on sale in late 2025, as part of the \u201cseveral new products\u201d that the company plans to introduce this year. Image: Twitter/Stargazer Plaid\n\nOn the Ride The Lightning Podcast, published March 5, 2025, Franz von Holzhausen described it as \u201ca technology showcase,\u201d adding, \u201cIt always was and will continue to be.\u201d Tesla\u2019s design chief suggested the Roadster\u2019s design would evolve further, stating, \u201cDesign evolves over time as well\u2026a little evolution is not a bad thing,\u201d hinting that its final look would differ from the 2017 prototype to stay \u201cfresh and new in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nDuring Tesla\u2019s Q3 2024 earnings conference call on October 23, 2024, Musk said the company is close to freezing the design of the next-gen Roadster. Additionally, he suggested the redesigned model will have the ability to briefly lift itself off the ground and hover, reiterating his previous hints of SpaceX-derived technologies for the car.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the Roadster may arrive with well over 1,020 hp and 1,050 lb.-ft. It\u2019s also expected to have a top speed north of 250 mph, and a dedicated platform with all-wheel drive.\n\nTesla Robotaxi (2026)\n\nThe Tesla Robotaxi is a two-door coupe designed and engineered only for driverless operation. The new electric car borrows cues from the Tesla Cybertruck and flaunts two dihedral doors. It has a big trunk behind the seats, accessible through a large liftgate.\n\nThe Tesla Robotaxi is a two-door coupe and accommodates only two people. Image Source: Tesla\n\nInside, the Tesla Robotaxi features a minimalist design with a slim dashboard and simplistic door panels. The exclusion of a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals frees up a lot of space around the dashboard. There are only two seats, both noticeably wide and reminiscent of old American recliners. A huge freestanding touchscreen is the centerpiece of this cozy interior, integrating all the core comfort and entertainment functions.\n\nTesla has not equipped the Robotaxi with a charging port. The self-driving EV relies on inductive charging to juice up its batteries. The company plans to begin production in 2026 and should release more details about its specifications closer to the launch.\n\nDuring the Q2 2024 earnings conference call, Musk said Tesla will allow customers also to make money from the Robotaxi/Cybertaxi, implying the company will sell/lease the new self-driving EV to regular people. Customers will be able to allocate it in Tesla\u2019s fleet program when they don\u2019t need it for personal use, the same way they list their real estate properties on Airbnb. Tesla will charge a commission for this service, though, taking a share of the revenue.\n\nTesla Robovan (2028)\n\nThe Tesla Robovan is a much bigger self-driving EV, designed for traveling in a big group of people or transporting a large load of goods. Inspired by art deco trains of the 1920s and 30s, the streamlined EV\u2019s design looks like it was pulled off from a science fiction movie. It features sliding doors on the sides and has a trunk at both ends.\n\nThe Tesla Robovan\u2019s travel cost is officially estimated to be just 5-10 cents per mile. Image Source: Tesla\n\nThe interior of the Tesla Robovan is like a modern living space, featuring a clean and space-focused design. Softly lit mood lighting spread throughout the cabin creates a luxurious vibe and highlights the modern aesthetics of the cabin. Seats with upward sloping lower part for better thigh support and the entirely flat floor contribute to the homely vibe of the interior. There are two large, TV-sized screens at both ends, which would provide passengers with entertainment on the go.\n\nTesla says the passenger version of the Robovan can accommodate up to 20 people and estimates its travel cost to be as low as 5-10 cents per mile. The company has yet to reveal the launch timeline of this model, but we expect 2028 to be the earliest possible year.",

The graffiti was instead against Elon Musk, and the graffiti was an \"X\" inside of a circle, which we assume is for Twitter, which Musk owns. This incident will be investigated as a destruction of property and will remain open as we continue to gather information.\n\nThe Space X founder came under fire in January for a hand gesture, some pundits believe resembled a Nazi salute, during an inauguration party for President Donald Trump.\n\nMusk, who has become a close friend and adviser to Trump, denied the allegations.\n\nThe pair has since faced wide-spread criticism over Musk's influence within the government.\n\nThere are several pending lawsuits challenging Musk and DOGE's authority.",

            "content": "Tesla's electric sedan will receive another facelift to bring it up to date and help reverse its declining sales\n\nTesla\u2019s VP of Engineering has all but confirmed that an upgraded Model S will arrive later this year.\n\nThese independently made illustrations envision an extensive facelift inspired by the latest Model Y.\n\nThe large electric sedan debuted in 2012 and underwent facelifts for the 2017 and 2022 model years.\n\nThe Model S has been a cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s lineup for well over a decade, debuting in 2012 as the brand\u2019s first fully in-house-developed EV after the Lotus-based Roadster. Over the years, it has evolved through numerous updates, mostly to keep up with the advancements in technology. But at this point, calling it \u201cdated\u201d feels almost clich\u00e9.\n\nWhile most other automakers would have already mapped out a successor by now, Tesla appears to be content with rolling out yet another refresh later this year. However, don\u2019t expect a full redesign; this will likely be another facelift at best, rather than an all-new generation.\n\nMore: We Compare The 2026 Tesla Model Y Side-By-Side With Its Predecessor\n\nTesla\u2019s VP of Engineering, Lars Moravy, all but confirmed the news recently, hinting at an upcoming upgrade for both the Model S and Model X. Speaking on Ryan McCaffrey\u2019s Ride the Lightning podcast, Moravy said:\n\n\u201cJust give it a minute. We\u2019ll get there. The upgrade a few years ago was bigger than most people thought in terms of architecture and structure. We\u2019ll give it some love later this year; we\u2019ll make sure it gets some of the stuff we\u2019ve been putting in 3 and Y. Everyone here has a little place in their heart for S/X. They are not going anywhere anytime soon.\u201d\n\nSharper Looks and Efficiency Tweaks?\n\nThe Model S originally launched in 2012, three years after its concept debut. It has since undergone two significant revisions, one for the 2017 model year and a more extensive refresh in 2022. While it has maintained a familiar silhouette over the years, the 2026 update could bring more noticeable changes, particularly in exterior design.\n\nThough no official details have been confirmed yet, these updates could bring it more in line with the smaller and significantly more popular Model 3 Highland and Model Y Juniper, both in terms of styling and technology.\n\nIllustrations: Nikita Chuicko for Kolesa\n\nIndependent digital artist Nikita Chuicko (a.k.a. Kelsonik) has created speculative renderings of the 2026 Model S for Kolesa, drawing inspiration from the 2026 Model Y. The illustrations depict the sedan with a redesigned front end featuring split LED headlights and sharper bumper intakes. At the rear, it sports a full-width taillight cluster with the \u201cindirect lighting\u201d introduced earlier this year on the Model Y, along with a prominent diffuser.\n\nMore: Should Tesla Give The Model 3 A Juniper Update?\n\nBesides giving the EV a fresh look, the redesigned elements could also improve aerodynamics, potentially extending its range. Based on comments from Tesla\u2019s VP of Engineering, the company seems to believe the 2022 Model S already brought significant structural updates, ones that could carry over into the 2026 version. However, Tesla engineers may still find ways to boost efficiency with smaller tweaks, such as updated wheels and brakes.\n\nInterior Refinements Could Be Subtle but Impactful\n\nThe last major Model S update delivered a complete interior overhaul, but even minor refinements can enhance quality and usability. If Tesla follows its approach with the Model Y Juniper, the revamped Model S could introduce subtle but welcome additions, such as ambient lighting or a front-facing bumper-mounted camera.\n\n2024 TESLA MODEL S\n\nWhat About the Powertrain?\n\nUnless Tesla surprises us, we don\u2019t expect any meaningful changes to the powertrain options. Currently in North America, the lineup includes the All-Wheel Drive trim, offering a 410-mile (660 km) range, a 130 mph (209 km/h) top speed, and a 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) time of 3.1 seconds with rollout. The high-performance Plaid variant features a tri-motor setup producing 1,020 hp, a 348-mile (560 km) range, a 200 mph (322 km/h) top speed, and a blistering 1.99-second 0-60 mph (96 km/h) sprint with rollout.\n\nMore details about the 2026 Model S should emerge in the coming months. Still, the big question remains: will this be another mild update, or will Tesla implement a comprehensive redesign to help reverse declining sales?",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemonstrators gathered at more than 50 Tesla showrooms across the United States on Saturday in protest of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s role in slashing government agencies as part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency established by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe protests are part of \u201cTesla Takedown,\u201d which, according to its website, hopes to encourage stakeholders to \u201csell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreating a vote of no confidence in him from the shareholders, that would be the ultimate goal,\u201d Alex Winter, a Los Angeles-based actor and filmmaker who is one of the main organizers, told CNN.\n\nThe first Tesla Takedown protest was on February 15 after Winter spoke with Joan Donovan, a sociologist and professor at Boston University, who suggested a Tesla protest on Bluesky, an alternative to Musk\u2019s X.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest person, began leading DOGE on January 20. Musk\u2019s role has received criticism from the start, due in part to buyout offers to federal employees alongside mass layoffs; dismantling the US Agency for International Development; and seeking access to sensitive payment systems.\n\nThe Tesla Takedown movement is also gaining traction internationally. There was a protest Friday in Barcelona, and three protests are set for this weekend in London; Lisbon, Portugal; and Reykjavik, Iceland, according to Winter.\n\n\u201cI am very satisfied, even with where we are now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe provided people an easy way to protest during a very difficult time.\u201d\n\nProtests have varied in size, with some of the largest demonstrations taking place in the cities of Boston and Portland, as well as in California and Florida, according to Winter. About 1,000 protesters gathered with signs Saturday in Tucson, Arizona. In Washington, DC, what started as only two demonstrators standing outside a showroom in the Georgetown neighborhood grew to about 20 within an hour.\n\nThe demonstration included chants of \u201cElon Musk has got to go,\u201d as well as drivers honking horns in support.\n\nPeter Jones, a 59-year-old pilot, told CNN that he searched on Friday for upcoming protests but found none. He said if it weren\u2019t for his wife, who heard the chanting and was curious about the protest, they would have missed out.\n\n\u201cIt feels great because right now I feel powerless,\u201d Jones said. \u201cNobody can keep up with all of the destruction. I don\u2019t feel empowered unless we get out into the street; that\u2019s one thing we have is mass.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 wife, Bonnie Jones, said she\u2019s concerned about Musk\u2019s other investments and contracts, including the high-speed internet service Starlink, because Musk has not been properly vetted through a confirmation hearing like other Trump appointees.\n\nProtestors gather at a Tesla showroom in Washington, DC, chanting \u201cDOGE needs to go\u201d and \u201cWho voted for Elon Musk? No one voted for Elon Musk.\u201d Auzinea Bacon/CNN\n\nDonna Powell, a retiree in the Washington, DC, area, told CNN this is her 20th protest against the Trump administration and Musk\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cTesla stock has been going down and we want to see that continue and we want to see Musk hurt,\u201d said Powell. \u201cWe also hope that Congress will grow a spine and do what they\u2019re elected to do.\u201d\n\nHitting Musk where it hurts\n\nDeclining sales, which could lead investors to sell off their stock, hurt Tesla\u2019s value \u2014 which accounts for much of Musk\u2019s net worth. He owns nearly 411 million shares of Tesla, or 13% of the company.\n\nTesla did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn December, Musk became the first person to have a net worth above $400 billion. He has since lost $52 billion in net worth as shares of Tesla (TSLA) have plunged 27.6% in February.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Tesla Takedown movement will have much of an impact on the company. Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at automotive site Edmunds, noted there hasn\u2019t been a bump in Tesla owners appraising their used cars.\n\nSome hesitation could be that selling a car relies on other factors, including the cost of buying a new vehicle while interest rates are high and because Teslas are now less expensive, she said.\n\nAlthough Tesla may face pushback because of Musk\u2019s involvement in the government, some Tesla owners and potential buyers are likely separating Tesla as a company from Musk, she said. Caldwell added that the attention Musk has received from DOGE is not good for Tesla\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the other car companies, most people couldn\u2019t name another automotive CEO and much less their opinion on politics,\u201d Caldwell told CNN.\n\nTesla reported global sales of 1.79 million in 2024, compared with 1.81 million in 2023. The 1.1% drop was Tesla\u2019s first annual decline in 12 years.\n\nTesla recently reported a 16% decline in sales between December and January. That was an improvement after Tesla sales dropped 24% between December 2023 and January 2024.\n\nAnother explanation for decreased sales could be that Tesla hasn\u2019t made many new changes, Caldwell said. Aside from a few refreshes to old models and the release of the Cybertruck, the cars are \u201ca bit older.\u201d The company is also a smaller share of electric vehicle makers as it faces increased competition from General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and other brands.",

This comes as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped only 2% for the month.\n\nTesla\u2019s slide after its massive run-up following Trump\u2019s election win has been a swift one. After hitting a closing high of $479.86 in mid-December, Tesla stock has nearly given up all its post-election gains, a loss of nearly 40%.\n\nThis week saw new worry for Tesla\u2019s demand picture. Only 9,945 Tesla EVs were registered in Europe this January, down from 18,161 last year, per the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. Meanwhile, overall electric vehicle sales jumped 37.3%, indicating that EV demand was strong, but just not for Tesla.\n\nWhile new competition ate into Tesla\u2019s sales, there is also the effect of CEO Elon Musk and his foray into politics.\n\nMusk\u2019s support for Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is controversial in the country, where AfD secured the second-most seats in Parliament last weekend. Musk also made a hand gesture at a political rally in the US last month that many saw as a Nazi salute, though Musk refuted the claim.

Protests at Tesla showrooms across the country this month, along with blowback from the firing of government workers prodded by DOGE, have many hurling criticism at the Tesla CEO and GOP lawmakers.\n\nRecent surveys show that many voters disapprove of Musk's actions, with a Quinnipiac poll from late January finding that voters oppose Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration by a 53% to 39% margin.\n\nWith a terrible February behind it, Tesla is hoping optimism from the company\u2019s robotaxi initiatives and the long-awaited debut of its cheap EV will get the stock back on track.\n\nTesla\u2019s first quarter delivery report is also due out in about a month\u2019s time, which could see a boost from the refreshed Model Y going on sale in March.\n\nNew data, and at the very least Musk\u2019s eventual return to Tesla\u2019s HQ, should help alleviate the concern coming from his political critics, as well as weary Tesla investors.

            "content": "Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) continues to be a volatile business to own. Yes, the shares have soared 463% in the past five years. However, they are currently 30% off their peak price from December last year.\n\nThere's no doubt that this is an iconic company that's aiming to shape the future of technology. And investors might view the current dip as too good of an opportunity.\n\nShould you buy this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock while it's trading below $350? Let's take a closer look at the bull and bear cases for Tesla.\n\nInnovation and disruption\n\nTesla's biggest bull case rests on its success at innovating and disrupting the global car industry. Tesla deserves credit for making electric vehicles (EV) popular. Credit also goes to the build-out of the Supercharger network that added utility for consumers.\n\nToday, Tesla offers five EV models. And according to CarEdge, it has 44% EV market share in the U.S., putting it well ahead of second place General Motors domestically. And globally, Tesla is behind only BYD Company. Nonetheless, Tesla's rapid growth spurred EV investments from other auto makers.\n\nAnother reason that investors might want to buy the stock is because of Tesla's greater ambition. Perhaps the company's ultimate goal is to one day launch a global fleet of robotaxis, which could see \"quasi-infinite\" demand. Ark Invest believes this could introduce a massive, multitrillion-dollar opportunity for Tesla.\n\nThere's also the potential of the Optimus Robot. Tesla says it could start selling these to other businesses next year.\n\nPart of the allure of owning Tesla shares is being able to place a bet on founder and CEO Elon Musk. Despite what you might think about his recent push into the political arena, or the fact that he has what seems like a million different things all fighting for his time and attention, he is arguably the most visionary corporate executive of our time. Investors might appreciate his ability to spot new trends and position Tesla to take advantage of them.\n\nLofty expectations for a car company\n\nTesla is a classic \"story stock.\" Investors are glued to every word Musk says, making the narrative drive the share price. This means that valuation can get far away from reality, as is the case today.\n\nRight now, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 166. Any reasonable analysis of the company would point to this being an insane valuation to pay. This becomes clear when viewing Tesla's business as it currently stands.\n\nIn 2024, 77% of revenue was derived from EV sales. This automotive revenue figure declined 8% year over year, driven by the first-ever drop in unit deliveries. Obviously, this is not a good trend. Profitability is also taking a hit.\n\nTesla's financial performance now resembles a traditional auto maker instead of some high-flying tech enterprise. Growth is slowing. Higher interest rates, inflationary pressures, and more competition in the EV market are all negative factors working against Tesla.\n\nThe valuation implies flawless execution on the part of Musk and Tesla. In fact, the P/E ratio is based on the belief of what Tesla could become one day, not what it is right now.\n\nBut it's not a virtual certainty that a worldwide robotaxi service will be launched, for example. If history is any indication, we are still a long way from this technology not only being fully developed but from humans feeling comfortable and safe using it. There's still a ton of uncertainty.\n\nTesla shares trade below $350, well off their record high. Investors might want to buy the dip. In my opinion, though, it's best to pass on the stock. There are some rosy expectations embedded in the valuation that make the downside significantly higher than the upside.",

It is our responsibility to stand up for our country,\u201d said demonstrator Vicky Harner.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the #TeslaTakedown protests happening across the country in recent days, urging people to sell their vehicles and dump their stock as CEO Elon Musk faces backlash over his close involvement with the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have no issue with Tesla employees, folks that are driving Teslas. It's specific because the CEO of Tesla is engaging in these activities. He is leading them. He is decimating our federal workforces,\u201d said protester Barbara Kish.\n\nDenver7\n\nMusk is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency\u2014DOGE for short\u2014in an effort to curb wasteful government spending.\n\nIt's resulted in thousands of federal workers across multiple federal agencies losing their jobs.\n\nThe next round of potential layoffs is coming from the U.S. Department Of Education.\n\nAn email from the agency's top human resources official sent on Friday offered many of its employees a buyout of up to $25,000.\n\nThe email says the offer is in advance of a \"very significant reduction in force.\"\n\nThe president says a longer-term goal is eliminating the Department of Education.\n\n\u201cWith all the people that they're firing, there's going to be ramifications,\u201d said another protester.\n\nFolks at the demonstration say protests like this one are just the beginning of what they call a movement to stand up for democracy.\n\n\u201cIt's very encouraging. I believe it shows that we have people in our community who are very, very concerned about what is going on and that there's a need for us to make our voices heard. And it's very, very inspiring,\u201d said Kish.\n\nElon Musk has said numerous times that he believes DOGE's work is extremely important because the federal government is too large, wasteful, and inefficient.\n\nWith the national debt now more than $36 trillion, he believes cutting the size of government can help reduce that debt.\n\nBefore the administration entered office, Musk claimed he could save the government $2 trillion, but he later backed down on that claim.\n\nPresident Donad Trump continues to back the billionaire CEO, and told reporters that Musk is eliminating fraud and corruption inside the federal government.",

Elon Musk claimed on X not to have heard about the deal. The State Department subsequently told MSNBC that the plan had actually started under the Biden administration, that Tesla had not been officially awarded any contracts, and that the entire armored vehicle initiative had been indefinitely put on hold anyway.\n\nNow, a new document obtained by NPR complicates the situation further. According to NPR, while the Biden administration did explore whether electric vehicles could be armored for diplomatic use, it only budgeted $483,000 for light-duty EVs. Not a tiny sum, but one that pales in comparison to the $400 million the Trump administration had reportedly planned to spend on Cybertrucks before halting the contract.\n\nMeanwhile, just this week, we learned that the Federal Aviation Administration is looking to cancel a $2.4 billion contract awarded to Verizon in 2023 and instead hand it to the Musk-owned Starlink satellite internet service. That contract was meant to modernize the FAA\u2019s communications system \u2014 a system that seems especially critical now following a series of high-profile plane crashes. At the same time, NBC News reports nearly 300 FAA employees were fired in February as part of the DOGE-led federal government purge. If Musk is truly concerned about safety, he should focus on strengthening the FAA workforce instead of securing another massive government contract for his companies.\n\nMusk also slammed Verizon on X, falsely claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that its system was putting air travelers at risk. Meanwhile, The Washington Post reports SpaceX employees, some of whom now have FAA email addresses, have been working inside the agency to push for Starlink to take over, even as senior FAA officials refuse to sign off on the change.\n\nWe long knew that Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, would put government conflict-of-interest laws to the test. But the real question isn\u2019t how much power he has now, but how much more he will be able to grab.\n\nA story you should be following: Trump tariffs set for Tuesday\n\nStarting on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said he will impose 25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico while threatening to double the existing 10% tariff on China, citing the need for our trade partners to do more to curb fentanyl smuggling.\n\nBoth Canada and Mexico have pushed back, highlighting their ongoing efforts to address drug trafficking, with Canada investing over $1 billion in border security and Mexico deploying 10,000 National Guard troops to 18 cities and towns along the U.S.-Mexico border. But so far, this has not been enough for Trump.\n\nEconomists warn these tariffs could cost U.S. consumers between $120 billion and $225 billion annually. Businesses that import car parts, medical devices, vegetables and clothing are bracing for the impact, as are industries like U.S. textile production.\n\nAnd yet, according to new polling, only 32% of Trump supporters believe that implementing tariffs will cause prices to go up; 11% say they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d what the impact of tariffs on prices will be. Well, let me tell you: I think those numbers are about to change, and it may not be pretty.\n\nTune in to Episodes 7 and 8 of \u201cThe Blueprint with Jen Psaki\u201d on Monday\n\nThanks so much to everyone who\u2019s tuned in to \u201cThe Blueprint\u201d so far. On Monday, don\u2019t miss our new episodes with Stacey Abrams and former Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan.\n\nRyan, who challenged Vice President JD Vance for one of Ohio\u2019s Senate seats in 2022, has known the vice president for years. And he didn\u2019t hold back. Listen in to hear what he really thinks about Vance\u2019s political ascension, Ohio State football coach Jim Tressel becoming lieutenant governor, and whether or not he\u2019s considering a gubernatorial run.\n\nMeanwhile, few people know more about rebuilding a party than Abrams.

This marks a major milestone for Tesla, which has been working diligently to gain regulatory approval outside of North America. Both China and Europe were key targets on Tesla\u2019s Autonomy Roadmap, with the company aiming to roll out FSD in these regions by Q1 2025\u2014pending regulatory approval. Regulatory Issues Elon Musk recently confirmed on X that FSD is ready for Europe\u2014Tesla is just waiting on regulatory approval. However, securing approval could be challenging, as the process is overseen by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), which sets regulations for the entire EU. While the UNECE has fast-tracked some advancements\u2014such as adaptive and matrix high-beams (soon available in the U.S.), its approach to autonomy has been far more cautious. The commission has consistently slowed the deployment of self-driving technology and even reduced the capabilities of Autopilot. Adding to the challenge, the UNECE body responsible for vehicle autonomy meets infrequently, sometimes with months between sessions. The next meeting is scheduled for March 4, but autonomy is not yet on the agenda, meaning approval could still be a long way off. We are waiting for regulatory approval - Musk Regulation 157 UNECE Regulation 157 governs \u201cAutomated Lane Keeping Systems\u201d (ALKS), similar to Autopilot or lane-keeping cruise control in other vehicles. This regulation imposes strict limits, including speed restrictions and requiring driver confirmation for every autonomous decision. While approving a lane change with a tap on the screen or steering wheel might seem minor, imagine having to do so for every FSD action\u2014speed adjustments, turns, stops, starts, and more. Additionally, Regulation 157 only permits autonomy in areas where pedestrian traffic is physically separated from vehicles. This means that many highways without clear barriers would be off-limits for autonomous driving. Hope on the Horizon There\u2019s still hope\u2014if the UNECE amends Regulation 157, over 50 nations, including the EU and Japan, could open the door for FSD. A step in the right direction came with the 2024 adoption of UN Regulation 171, which expanded the framework for driver-assist systems that don\u2019t fully take over control\u2014such as FSD (Supervised). While regulatory changes take time, the momentum is building. As technology advances rapidly, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the rules catch up.

The achievement demonstrates Tesla\u2019s engineering prowess. As one engineer points out, it wasn\u2019t an easy feat. Interestingly, the NHTSA only recently disclosed the results, despite the crash tests being completed a while ago. According to Lars Moravy, Tesla\u2019s VP of Vehicle Engineering, the team had been aware of the 5-star rating for quite some time. While the reason for the delay remains unclear, now that the results are public, Tesla\u2019s engineers can finally share how they achieved the rating. Crumple Zones Wes Morril, the Cybertruck\u2019s Lead Engineer, wrote about the crash test video on X recently, addressing the claims that the Cybertruck doesn\u2019t have a crumple zone. He also posted a side-by-side video (below) of the engineering analysis and the crash test itself. Engineered Crash Safety There\u2019s a lot of engineering precision at play when a Cybertruck is involved in a crash. Unlike traditional crash structures that rely on crash cans and collapse points, the Cybertruck\u2019s front gigacasting is designed to absorb and redirect impact forces in a highly controlled manner. It all starts with the bumper beam, which crushes within the first few milliseconds of a high-speed impact. At the same time, the vehicle\u2019s sensors rapidly analyze the crash dynamics and determine the optimal deployment of safety restraints, including airbags and seat belt pre-tensioners. These split-second actions are crucial in keeping occupants safe. As the crash progresses, the vehicle\u2019s structure deforms in a carefully engineered sequence. The drive unit cradle bends, directing the solid drive unit downward and out of the way, allowing the gigacasting to begin absorbing impact forces. The casting crushes cell by cell, methodically dissipating energy in a controlled manner. This gradual deceleration reduces the g-forces transferred to occupants, making the crash much less severe. As the gigacast begins crushing, the safety restraints are deployed. As Wes points out in his post - you can see how accurate the virtual analysis and modeling were. The video shows the simulated crash side by side with the real-life crash test and they\u2019re almost identical. All that virtual testing helps provide feedback into the loop to design a better and safer system - one that is uniquely different than any other vehicle on the road. All the armchair experts claimed the Cybertruck has no crumple zone and I get it, the proportions seem impossible. It was a tough one and there is a lot of engineering that went into it. Let me break it down for you:\n\n\n\nHere you can see the large single piece casting in action in a\u2026 https://t.co/Jk4X5erTcm pic.twitter.com/24Nmb1bmU5 \u2014 Wes (@wmorrill3) February 20, 2025",

            "content": "Electric buses are becoming widespread in cities around the world. What about Tesla hitting the market with an electric bus model? Let\u2019s start from the end: in October 2024 Elon Musk presented the Tesla Robovan, able to carry up to 20 passengers and autonomously-driven. And in February 2025, according to The Washington Post, Tesla sought permission for a robotaxi service in California.\n\nThe Verge website also notes that in Tesla Master Plan Part 3, the company lists \u201cbus\u201d and \u201ccommercial/passenger vans\u201d as \u201cTBD\u201d.\n\nBut let\u2019s recap the story from the beginning. In recent years, news have often been circulating with regards to the possibility that Tesla might begin to manufacture electric buses. Or to cooperate with other companies in the market of zero emission buses.\n\nIn this article Sustainable Bus sums up the history of the relationship between Tesla and electric buses.\n\nTesla and electric buses, where Proterra comes from\n\nThe experience developed by Tesla (that in 2023 shared it has delivered 1.8 million electric cars worldwide) had been the springboard for activities in the field of electric buses of Proterra, that for a few years has been among the main North American brands with regards to zero emission buses (two main competitors: the Canadians of New Flyer and the Chinese of BYD). Ryan Popple was indeed appointed CEO of Proterra in 2014. He had previously spent two years in Tesla Motors.\n\nIn 2015, Proterra was awarded a $3 million grant from the California Energy Commission to fund the design, development and construction of a battery-electric transit bus manufacturing line in California. In 2016 Josh Ensign left Tesla, where he covered the position of President of Manufacturing, and joined Proterra as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nHowever, the company filed for bankruptcy in August 2023. In November 2023 Volvo Group has been selected as the highest bidder in an auction for the business and assets of the Proterra Powered unit, at a purchase price of $210 million. Proterra transit business went to Phoenix Motorcars.\n\n2017, Tesla electric bus under development\n\nBack in May 2017, Tesla CEO Elon Musk expressed doubts about the project to develop an electric bus signed Tesla. According to The Verge, Musk said the vehicle was under development to be presented by the end of 2017.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the bus thing really makes sense in a shared and completely autonomous environment,\u201d Musk said in response to a question about the project. \u201cIf it costs less than a bus ticket to use a shared autonomy fleet to go where you want, point to point, why don\u2019t you just use it? So I don\u2019t know\u201d. Musk then added that according to him traffic and urban density \u201ccan be completely lightened with tunnels\u201d, referring to the bizarre project focused on the creation of a system of underground tunnels.\n\nTesla electric bus, what about a mini?\n\nIf it is true that Musk has excluded the production of a real regular size bus, the door has remained open for a vehicle with 10 or 12 seats.\n\nFurthermore, a minibus or van could result more suitable to Musk long-term vision: a situation where driverless technology might make public transport obsolete, allowing the circulation of self driving electric Tesla \u201ctaxis\u201d available to take people from point to point. Such a model could prevail as long as it won\u2019t be cause of huge congestion (avoidable, according to Musk, with tunnels\u2026 but this is another story) and it will be affordable (today Uber and Lift aren\u2019t, as proved by the companies losses highlighted in an article of The Guardian).\n\nElon Musk and public transport\n\nIt is quite known how Musk dislikes public transit: \u201cI think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn\u2019t leave where you want it to leave, doesn\u2019t start where you want it to start, doesn\u2019t end where you want it to end? And it doesn\u2019t go all the time\u201d, Tesla CEO said.\n\nMusk\u2019s preference for vans has been confirmed by a tweet published by Musk in November 2018, in which he looked forward to a collaboration with Daimler (an early investor in Tesla\u2019s shares) aimed at the production of an electric van. With regard to the announcement of the next launch of his electric van, Musk tweeted: \u201cMaybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter\u201d. Nothing more than this. But it was enough to create a viral circulation of gossip news about a possible future Tesla electric bus.\n\nThe Turkish episode\n\nAs reported by Electrive, the news of Elon Musk smoking a joint live during a tv program has brought to a reaction by Mehmet G\u00fcrb\u00fcz, the board chairman of the municipal transportation company in the Turkish province of Bal\u0131kesir. He had invited Musk to the city offering the possibility of a cooperation that could led to the purchase of 180 electric buses. That actually Tesla is not producing at all. Anyway, the invitation was sent\u2026 but the \u201cnegative example for the youth\u201d given by Musk led to a withdraw of the proposal. \u201cWe find that Elon Musk\u2019s behavior live on air would serve as a negative example for the youth, unacceptable for the fight against drugs. That\u2019s why we give up on our goal to work with Tesla, and we retract our invitation to Elon Musk,\u201d G\u00fcrb\u00fcz said according to local press.\n\nTesla Bus pictures ready in 2025?\n\nIn late 2023, as mentioned in the opening, Tesla fan page account published for two times pictures of buses with Tesla\u2019s logo on the front.\n\nIn addition to its commercially successful passenger models, the American market is eagerly anticipating the arrival of the much-discussed Cybertruck, met with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Meanwhile, in the category of large trucks, the Tesla Semi has already made its mark.\n\nRecently, discussions about the Tesla Bus, a project that has been in development since 2016, have resurfaced.\n\n\u201cWe expect the Tesla Bus to borrow heavily from the Tesla Semi not only in terms of design but also on powertrain and architecture\u201d, said a video published on the Youtube channel Tesla Car World. In the same video, that is said to be based on a review of Tesla master plan, the release date of the vehicle is stated to be 2025.\n\nTesla Robovan unveiled in October 2024\n\nThe latest development of this intricate \u2018relation\u2019 between Tesla and public transport occurred on 11th October 2025, when Elon Musk presented the Tesla Robovan during the \u2018We, Robot\u2019 event, held in Warner Brothers studios in California. The vehicle looks \u201clike something out of an Art Deco fever dream, with a sleek train engine-like shape and no visible wheels\u201d, as reads an article by The Verge.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nTesla has recalled certain 2023 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles for an overstress condition in the printed circuit board controlling the vehicle\u2019s power steering, which may lead to a sudden loss of electronic assist after coming to a stop, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .\n\nThe recall potentially includes up to 376,241 Tesla vehicles equipped with older software versions prior to 2023.38.4.\n\nTesla is rolling out an over-the-air software update to correct the issue on vehicles still equipped with an older version. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed March 25.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTesla was aware of the problem since July 28, 2023 after the NHTSA\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation opened a preliminary probe into the steering issue after receiving 12 reports of a sudden loss of power steering assist in 2023 Model 3 and Y vehicles after coming to a stop. An estimated 1% of the recalled vehicles are suspected of having the defect.\n\nThis initial investigation included interviews with the complainants and technical meetings with Tesla engineers, as well as a joint inspection of a steering rack from a crashed vehicle. The driver said they were unable to complete a right hand turn in an intersection due to a sudden loss of power steering assist, which led to the crash.\n\nAs the initial investigation unfolded, the NHTSA\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation identified 2,388 additional complaints of a loss of power steering assist on Tesla vehicles, including the 124 identified through vehicle owner questionnaires and 2,264 through manufacturer data.\n\nTesla provided an over-the-air software update on Oct. 19, 2023 to correct the issue.\n\nThe NHTSA conducted an engineering analysis in February 2024 after Tesla shared data and its evaluation of field reports.\n\nAt the time, Tesla\u2019s internal investigation determined that an overvoltage breakdown may overstress the circuit board\u2019s \u201cmotor drive components.\u201d However, Tesla says Model 3 and Model Y steering systems are designed to prevent a loss of assist functions if the vehicle is moving. But if a driver suddenly stops, the power steering assist may malfunction after the vehicle starts moving again.\n\nAlthough drivers can still steer the vehicle, turning the wheel may be more difficult if the electronic assist is deactivated.\n\nAccording to the NHTSA, a regulatory authority in a \u201cnon-US market\u201d also opened a formal inquiry in December 2023 to investigate complaints relating to loss of power steering assist on the vehicles. Tesla cooperated with that probe, providing information to investigators and taking part in technical reviews.\n\nBetween October 2024 and mid-January, Tesla and the authority held several meetings to review concerns about the potential loss of power steering assist in an unsafe location and how a system malfunction would impact a driver. The meetings resulted in Tesla voluntarily recalling the affected vehicles in all markets on Jan. 16.\n\nAs of Jan. 10, Tesla identified 3,012 warranty claims and 570 field reports for U.S. vehicles believed to be related to the power steering fault. But the company is not aware of any crashes or injuries.\n\nAs of Jan. 23, 99% of Tesla\u2019s vehicles in the U.S. have already received software update 2023.38.4 or later, according to the NHTSA. In addition, all of Tesla\u2019s U.S. stores and service centers were notified about the recall on or shortly after Jan. 28.\n\nAs a maker of software-defined vehicles, Tesla holds an advantage over many legacy automakers. The company has been able to address many past recalls with over-the-air software updates, including a January recall of nearly 240,000 vehicles for a rear backup camera fault.",

The stock\u2019s worst ever month was December 2022, when it declined 37%.\n\n\u201cThe real difficulty with any stock that is as richly valued as Tesla is to be able to call a floor,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Bloomberg. \u201cSince Tesla has defied conventional valuations for so long, a bottom is more about investor sentiment than the normal metrics that value investors might use.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s decline of 13%, was driven in part by a report on Tuesday from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association that showed Tesla\u2019s sales in the EU fell 45% in January, even as the EV market surged. The company\u2019s earnings last month were also disappointing.\n\nMusk\u2019s political activities \u2014 including as effective head of President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 may be alienating potential car buyers, according to analysts. Musk also recently endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany party and participated in an online campaign to convince U.K. officials to release far-right agitator Tommy Robinson.\n\nThere is some kind floor under the stock, even if it\u2019s hard to know where it is, said Explosive Options founder Bob Lang.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a devoted following because he\u2019s made people a lot of money,\u201d Lang told Quartz. \u201cThey\u2019ll follow him until the day they die.\u201d That loyalty means that they\u2019ll continue to hold the stock.\n\n\u2014William Gavin contributed to this article.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

Apparently, it's working.\n\nLast week, Polestar announced a special $5,000 discount for Tesla drivers looking to lease the company's new Polestar 3 crossover. With that deal and another $15,000 of incentives to lessees, Tesla owners could get a $20,000 lease discount to become ex-Tesla owners.\n\nOn Friday, the brand's U.S. head of sales said in a LinkedIn post: \"This week saw some of the highest order days for Polestar 3, and the response to our Tesla Conquest Offer has been incredible.\"\n\nWe've reached out to Polestar for specifics around the numbers and the Tesla deal, which ran from Feb. 21 to Feb. 28, and we'll update this story if we hear back. To be clear, not everybody who took the deal necessarily traded in their Tesla. They merely had to prove their household currently owned or leased a Tesla. Regardless, it's not hard to believe that more than a few Tesla owners took Polestar up on the offer.\n\nFirst off, who doesn't want an extra $5,000 off of a lease for a cool EV that's already discounted by $15,000?

Musk's quarter-billion-dollar bet to get President Donald Trump elected and controversial role in government may just accelerate that trend.\n\nThe Polestar 3 may be shaping up to be a strong alternative. It's more upscale than a Model Y, but cheaper than the aging Model X. Its 111 kWh battery delivers 279 miles of range in Dual-Motor Performance Pack spec, 315 miles of range in Long-Range Dual-Motor spec, and a very impressive 350 miles of range in the new Long Range Single-Motor trim. As Polestar's CEO recently told us, it could be one of the few truly software-defined vehicles in the U.S.\u2014along with Tesla and Rivian\u2014thanks to its smartphone app integration and over-the-air updates.\n\nAnd now that Tesla is far from the only game in town, rivals like Polestar will be there to pick up the pieces.\n\nContact the author: Tim.Levin@InsideEVs.com\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Data show Tesla sales declined sharply in Europe\n\ntoggle caption Odd Andersen/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTesla sales have dropped sharply in the European market, as the U.S.-based electric carmaker faces both business headwinds and public blowback against the unprecedented political activity of its chief executive.\n\nData released this week by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) show that Tesla registrations in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and the U.K. dropped by 45% in a head-to-head comparison between January 2024 and January 2025. (Registrations are a closely tracked indicator of sales.)\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat's a precipitous decline, and it comes even as electric vehicle sales overall were increasing in the region \u2014 up 37% in the same time frame.\n\nData previously released in individual nations covering the same period also showed that Tesla sales were down nearly 60% in Germany, Europe's largest EV market, with large decreases also evident in France and Norway.\n\nMark Wakefield, the global automotive market lead at the consulting firm AlixPartners, cautions that it's hard to draw conclusions from a single month of data, because Tesla deliveries can fluctuate significantly month by month. \"You really have to look at it quarter by quarter,\" he says, although he notes that other data points, like the incentives Tesla is offering to encourage sales, also indicate slowing demand for the vehicles.\n\nMultiple factors may be at play here. Tesla has not yet delivered a long-promised cheaper vehicle, and its best-selling Model Y is getting an update soon \u2014 a reason some buyers might delay a purchase.\n\nMeanwhile, competition from China has been intensifying. In January, according to the ACEA data, Tesla clocked the largest \u2014 by far \u2014 decrease in sales of any auto manufacturer in Europe. The largest increase, at 36.8%, was for SAIC Motor, a Chinese automaker whose brands include MG.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEurope has tried to block Chinese EVs from overtaking the European market, but in response companies like SAIC Motor are pivoting to hybrids . In January, SAIC Motor sold more than twice as many vehicles in Europe as Tesla did, according to the ACEA data.\n\nWakefield says he thinks the Model Y refresh is a significant factor in Tesla's declining sales in Europe. But, he says, the \"visceral reactions\" to Elon Musk's political activities \"certainly has an impact as well.\"\n\nAfter Musk made a straight-armed gesture twice during a speech celebrating President Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, someone projected a photo of it onto the side of the Berlin Gigafactory in Germany with the word \"Heil\" added before the glowing \"Tesla\" sign. A satirical ad posted at a bus stop in London showed the gesture and called a Tesla a \"Swasticar.\" And after Musk appeared virtually in late January at a campaign event for Germany's right-wing AfD party and said that Germany needs to \"move beyond\" past guilt, the Polish government called for a boycott of Tesla vehicles. The AfD polled second in German elections last weekend.\n\nThe outcry is significant, Wakefield says, and taken very seriously in Germany, although he says that in general, public outcry about executive behavior has only a \"muted connection\" with people's buying decisions.\n\nTesla and Musk have not responded to requests for comment. The company has not publicly commented on the sales drop, although its most recent SEC filing acknowledged risks from increased competition in Europe.\n\nTesla share prices have dropped by about a third since President Trump took office, erasing virtually all of the stock gains the company enjoyed post-election.",

Both of these cars \u2014 especially the Air \u2014 build upon and improve what Tesla brought to the table.

As I stood there with my Coopers enjoying \u201cThere Is A Light That Never Goes Out\u201d, I thought of the blackout protection I enjoy thanks to my Powerwall 2.\n\nYes even at gigs, I can\u2019t help thinking about bloody solar energy.\n\nThen it struck me: Here I was, gleefully singing along to songs that still bring immense joy in 2025, while their original creator, The Smiths\u2019 frontman Morrissey, has become someone whose views I can\u2019t stomach.\n\nThis is the same Morrissey who in 2019 performed wearing a far-right For Britain badge and claimed: \u201ceveryone ultimately prefers their own race.\u201d\n\nMany Aussie consumers are wrestling with a similar reality: Tesla makes exceptional products that have genuinely accelerated the world\u2019s electrification, but Elon Musk\u2019s behaviour has become increasingly difficult to defend.\n\nThe man who once teared up when he learned of energy poverty in Australia now spends his days spreading conspiracy theories and making inflammatory statements without bothering to check their accuracy or worry about the human consequences.\n\nSo, what\u2019s a conscientious Australian energy nerd to do?\n\nFirst up, it\u2019s perfectly okay to loathe Elon and love Tesla. We progressives often get caught between being right and being effective.\n\nYes, Musk may have taken too much credit from the brilliant engineers who built these products. Yes, his constant \u2018war mode\u2019 state is hard to stomach.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to deny that without Tesla\u2019s innovation, we wouldn\u2019t have the EV market we have today. Tangible progress often comes from imperfect vessels.\n\nEqually, it\u2019s absolutely valid to boycott Tesla because you can\u2019t bear the thought of adding to Musk\u2019s wealth.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m living this dilemma. I own two Teslas EVs and a Powerwall; they\u2019re great.\n\nBut would I buy another Tesla energy product while Elon\u2019s at the helm? Probably not. The competition has finally caught up, and there\u2019s enough choice that the home energy storage market no longer needs Tesla to thrive.\n\nCars, though? That\u2019s trickier.\n\nAs a cyclist who\u2019s lost dear friends to car accidents and faces weekly near-misses with human drivers, I\u2019m desperate to see autonomous vehicles become reality. I believe Tesla, for all its faults, is leading this race. Their autonomous driving technology could save millions of lives.\n\nSo here I am, still enjoying my Smiths playlist while refusing to buy Morrissey\u2019s solo work. Still driving my Tesla while cringing at Elon\u2019s latest tweets.\n\nSometimes progress comes packaged with paradox, and that\u2019s okay. What matters is that we keep moving forward, preferably in a sun-powered EV \u2014 whoever makes it.\n\nFinn Peacock is the founder of Solar Quotes",

            "content": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nAs the world\u2019s richest person, Elon Musk isn\u2019t short of opportunity. From TikTok to Nissan, his name comes up time and again during potential deals across Asia, no matter how outlandish.\n\nIt\u2019s not his Midas touch that investors are after, experts say. Rather, Musk is being pursued for his closeness to US President Donald Trump and role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nDuring a period of heightened tension between United States and China, Musk stands out as an anomaly: He is perceived as being close to the governments of both Washington and Beijing. Some, particularly in China, want him to be a bridge between cultures.\n\nBut if his new Washington bona fides are catnip for dealmakers wanting to curry favor with Trump, Musk\u2019s proximity to the president may work against him on a major project that he\u2019s been lobbying hard to get off the ground: the launch of Tesla\u2019s \u201cfull self-driving\u201d (FSD) technology in China, its second-biggest market.\n\n\u201cBeijing grants favors and withholds favors,\u201d according to Isaac Stone Fish, CEO Strategy Risks, a business intelligence firm. \u201cThey have many levers over Elon Musk and Tesla.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Times reported last week, citing two unnamed sources, that Chinese officials were mulling whether to withhold approval of Tesla\u2019s FSD license as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with Trump. They were quoted as saying this was the main reason why the permit had been delayed. CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment.\n\nBesides withholding FSD approval, there is a long list of potential violations that either the central or local governments in the country could claim Tesla has committed, Stone Fish told CNN.\n\nRolling out FSD software in China would provide a valuable revenue boost in an ultra-competitive market riven by a brutal price war. Last April, Musk made a surprise visit to Beijing to seek government approval, which included a meeting with Premier Li Qiang.\n\nVirtually all Teslas have a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, while the more robust FSD feature \u2013 which is what the company calls its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) \u2013 costs around $8,000. Autopilot is available in China, but not the full FSD feature.\n\nUpping the ante\n\nThe delay is coming as Tesla faces increasing competition in China. It claimed just 6.1% of China\u2019s market for new energy vehicles last year, according to the China Passenger Car Association, compared to archrival BYD\u2019s 32.5%.\n\nEarlier this month, BYD raised the bar by adding an advanced driver assistance system for most of its models free of charge. Its proprietary \u201cGod\u2019s Eye\u201d system is now available in models that cost as little as 69,800 yuan ($9,555). Previously, it was limited to cars that cost three times as much.\n\nThis week, Tesla appeared to be trying to play catchup. On Tuesday, it rolled out a long-awaited update to its Autopilot software, which allowed some drivers to add a navigation feature for city driving.\n\nLei Xing, co-host of the China EVs & More podcast, said on Wednesday the service was \u201cpretty good\u201d fix for Tesla as it grapples with data security restrictions imposed by both Beijing and Washington. But it\u2019s \u201cnowhere near\u201d the latest version in the US, he added.\n\nIn a January earnings call, Musk said the company was in \u201ca quandary\u201d because China won\u2019t let Tesla transfer training videos outside of the country and \u201cthe US government won\u2019t let us do training in China.\u201d\n\nXing said the competition for advanced automated driving is \u201cmuch more cutthroat\u201d in China compared to the US, where Tesla is \u201call alone\u201d in the field. He added it was technologically behind electric vehicle makers such as Huawei, Li Auto and Xpeng, the frontrunners in ADAS.\n\nStill, it\u2019s important not to underestimate Musk. Since 2014, Tesla has expanded rapidly in the world\u2019s largest car market. It built the Shanghai Gigafactory within 10 months in 2019 as its sole owner, which was an anomaly at the time \u2014 and at a cost that was 65% cheaper than its Model 3 production plant in the US.\n\nAnd earlier this month, its \u201cMegapack\u201d factory, which produces very large batteries used to store huge amounts of electricity, started production next to its existing factory. None of it would have been possible without strong political and institutional support.\n\nDirect ties with China\n\nIt\u2019s precisely because Musk is \u201cparticularly well-liked in China,\u201d that the billionaire \u201ccan serve as a bridge between China and the US, especially given Trump\u2019s strong trust in him,\u201d Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing, told CNN.\n\nThat\u2019s why Vice President Han Zheng met with Musk when he attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, he said. He added that Musk\u2019s link to China could be particularly useful for Trump, who \u201cwants a more personal connection with President Xi [Jinping]\u201d without \u201cdealing with Chinese bureaucrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven Musk\u2019s direct ties with Xi and China, he could serve as a valuable link in this regard,\u201d Wang said.\n\nBut not everyone is sure to what extent Musk can influence Trump\u2019s China policy.\n\nTrump has announced across-the-board 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and steadily unveiled a series of measures, including taxes on metals imports and his \u201cAmerica First Investment Policy\u201d that target Beijing explicitly or implicitly. However, he hasn\u2019t fulfilled his campaign promise to impose upwards of 60% tariffs on the country, even after vowing to get tough on China on this first day in office.\n\nTrump\u2019s entire economic and trade team, composed of adviser Peter Navarro, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, all take \u201ca hardline stance on economic relations with China,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.\n\nThe professor, who sits on the Chinese foreign ministry\u2019s policy advisory board, said Musk can be \u201can effective communicator\u201d between both sides because he has \u201cdirect connections with senior Chinese officials and business leaders.\u201d\n\nMusk, he said, can argue from the perspective of his business operations in China, emphasizing that continued economic engagement benefits American companies by leveraging China\u2019s market and manufacturing capacity.\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s special position, with close ties with Trump and to Chinese officials, could have an adverse effect on a key part of his business empire as Tesla fights against being overtaken in China.",

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nI was at a Tesla Supercharger today, and as I was about to leave, I saw a Rivian R1S connected to one of the Supercharger stalls. This is a V2 Supercharger station, and my understanding is that no non-Teslas can Supercharger on V2 Superchargers, but I also saw a Mercedes-Maybach EQS trying to Supercharge at this station last week (seemingly unsuccessfully, but I left before final confirmation) and routinely have people with EV rental cars coming by and asking about charging there. So, I walked up to the Rivian R1S to see how things were going and to ask if she was able to charge. It turned out it wasn\u2019t working, but she had charged there with her Rivian a long time back. What she and I both figured is there was a short period of time when the stations were open to any EVs to charge, but now that things have been locked down with NACS and the software has been advanced to accommodate non-Teslas at Superchargers and track them, non-Teslas can no longer charge at this (or any V2) Superchargers.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s a long intro to get to another topic. Talking with her for a few minutes, I found out that she and her husband had owned three Teslas previously, but now she has the Rivian R1S and her husband has the Rivian R1T. A friend of hers had switched to Rivian before them.\n\nThe main reason for making the switch seemed to be a very common one \u2014 Rivians are just much nicer and more refined, particularly the interior, but according to this lady, also the drive quality. When I drove and rode in a Rivian R1T about a year and a half ago, the much nicer interior \u2014 including infotainment screens \u2014 struck me immediately. When mentioning it to the owner, who was also a Rivian employee, he said that was a very common response from Tesla owners.\n\nAdditionally, this lady (sorry, I didn\u2019t get her name), noted with enthusiasm that the R1S also cost less than her previous Tesla Model X! That seemed to be another major selling point for her. Lastly, she lives in Tampa, and Rivian had just opened a service center in Tampa before they decided to make the switch. That was a clincher for her, as she didn\u2019t want to have to go to Orlando for service if needed, and that would have been the case before the Tampa service center opened.\n\nShe didn\u2019t mention anything about politics or Elon Musk, and, unfortunately, I didn\u2019t ask when she and her husband made the switch. However, given their experience with the vehicles and her faith in Rivian executives/management, she was optimistic the company would eventually become profitable. Of course, that all relies on the R2 and perhaps even R3. It\u2019s a hot topic of discussion because no one really knows what the future holds for Rivian.\n\nConsidering all of the Rivian pros above, I just got to thinking, how many customers could Rivian take away from Tesla? Under my article yesterday about Rivian\u2019s stock price, recent shareholder conference call, and pros & cons, one reader (\u201cSolar Guy\u201c) commented, \u201cWell, Rivian may be able to steal Tesla buyers who are boycotting the company due to Musk. I contacted Rivian myself just last week about buying an R1S, but told them I didn\u2019t want to buy a car without an autopilot that worked on all roads like my 10 yr old Tesla can. So \u2026 I agree they need to get theirs working better. I disagree it needs to be as good as Teslas FSD system though. I\u2019m going to buy nothing until a non Tesla option with a good autopilot is on the market.\u201d\n\nWe have seen countless comments from longtime Tesla fans, owners, and shareholders who have sworn off buying a/another Tesla unless Elon Musk leaves the company. I\u2019ve met others in \u201creal life.\u201d Tesla saw its sales decline in 2024 compared to 2023, and 2025 seems to be starting out even worse. As Elon Musk gets more and more extreme politically (and, seemingly, spends almost all of his time working on non-Tesla matters), many of us expect Tesla will lose a lot of sales. If that is the case, how many customers could Rivian take from Tesla?\u2026\n\nHow many people will look at a Rivian now and then discover, \u201cOh, wow, this is really nice!\u201d How many will now happily switch because of Supercharger access? (While the Rivian couldn\u2019t charge at this V2 Supercharger, there\u2019s another newer Supercharger a half an hour away where I routinely see other EVs, including Rivians, charging.) How many will switch as Rivian improves its ADAS (a key talking point on Rivian\u2019s conference call)? Of course, the big dog is the R2 (and R3). How many Tesla customers will jump ship, or how many potential Tesla buyers will skip Tesla, once the R2 and R3 are available? Also, how much further is Elon Musk going to go taking a chainsaw to the US federal government, busting down Constitutional doors and democratic norms, and siding with Vladimir Putin over Ukraine and the rest of the democratic West? How much more is he going to push people away from the brand? (I almost asked, \u201cAnd will the Tesla board do anything to rein him in?\u201d But I am certain the answer is \u201cno.\u201d) The there\u2019s also the appeal of the new Model Y, the cheaper Model Q that is supposedly coming, and even the Cybercab. How much will Tesla\u2019s sales dominance continue in the US EV market simply due to the appeal of its products, and also so much of the population not following political matters for even 5 minutes a week or being apathetic to it all when it comes to shopping for a car?\n\nAs you can see, there are a lot of unknown factors. I want you to try to synthesize all of those perfectly and come up with an estimate of how many customers Rivian will steal from Tesla. For my part, there are too many big unknowns and I can\u2019t even come up with a range of options you could choose from in a poll. Also, since we can never really check the results, something about running a poll on this rubs me the wrong way. But I\u2019d love to read what you informed, thoughtful readers have to say on this topic and how many customers you estimate Rivian will take from Tesla.",

            "content": "Andrew Lambrecht compared the BMW i4 to the Tesla Model 3 with its driving experience and features.\n\nThe i4 offers a refined interior, but he said it lacks some intuitive tech compared to Tesla.\n\nDespite its higher price, the i4 will appeal to those seeking a unique driving experience.\n\nSeveral years ago, the Tesla Model 3 was the de facto choice in the electric car market, offering performance, range, and technology at a reasonable price. Last summer, I bought my second used Tesla Model 3. It's still a great car, but the Model 3 now faces some actual competition.\n\nOne of these entrants is the BMW i4, an all-electric take on the Bavarian automaker's 4 Series sedan. It offers good range, solid performance, and a somewhat competitive price point. The German EV costs more than other electric sedans, but BMW is not known for being the affordable option.\n\nI wanted to see just how good the i4 is and what it offers over other electric sedans, so I rented one on Turo.\n\nThe BMW i4: The trims and specs\n\nThe side view of a 2023 BMW i4. Andrew Lambrecht\n\nThe BMW i4 has four different powertrain options: the eDrive35, eDrive40, xDrive40, and the 536 horsepower M50. My review model was an eDrive35, which most recently started at $53,975.\n\nThe base spec i4 can achieve a zero-to-sixty time of 5.8 seconds and offers a peak charging rate of 180 kilowatts. These numbers are not groundbreaking, though they align with the discontinued Model 3 Standard Range.\n\nStandard features for the 2025 version include wireless phone charging, an opening sunroof, BMW digital key access, heated front seats, a power tailgate, wireless Apple CarPlay, and a light array of safety features, including a blind spot monitor.\n\nThe Harman Kardon premium sound system, adaptive cruise control, lane centering, heated steering wheel, parking assistance package, and ventilated seats are not standard but cost extra. Add those on, and the price will increase to $60,000.\n\nFor comparison, the 2024 Tesla Model 3 starts at $44,130 and qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit, effectively making it $36,630 for most buyers.\n\nRelated stories\n\nFirst impressions of BMW's EV\n\nThe BMW i4's interior. Andrew Lambrecht\n\nTuro lent me seven booking days to test the BMW i4. This i4 would've cost around $83 a day to rent if I paid.\n\nDespite featuring frameless windows, the doors deliver a solid \"thunk\" when closing. The front seats are well-bolstered and have adjustable thigh support, dramatically increasing comfort on long road trips. The cabin is frankly a nice place to be.\n\nPut your foot on the brake and press the start/stop button, and the dual curved displays will come to life with an electronic sound. The i4 features a 12.3-inch driver's display and a 14.3-inch center touchscreen, placed together as one panel. The center screen is crisp and responsive, though it requires a bit of a learning curve.\n\nIt's not the most intuitive system, as the climate control system is difficult to adjust, and the map's electric route planner is abysmal. If you're going on a road trip, BMW's system is complicated and outdated. Tesla and Polestar's route planners are far more usable and intuitive.\n\nOne area where the i4 truly shines is in the auditory department. While the base sound system won't impress anyone, Hans Zimmer's acceleration soundscapes will. The base i4 offers two futuristic sounds that change based on throttle input and speed.\n\nBMW: The ultimate driving machine?\n\nThe BMW i4 under a South Carolina sunset. Andrew Lambrecht\n\nThe i4's best feature is its driving experience. Unlike the Tesla, which uses electrically assisted steering, the BMW uses good old-fashioned power steering. The Tesla feels more sensitive to inputs, almost too much so, but the i4 has good responsiveness without being too sensitive.\n\nThe BMW is also an incredibly playful EV to drive. You don't get this in the Tesla or even the Polestar. When traction control is disabled, the rear wheels can easily lose grip. Especially on wet roads, the i4 is truly a blast to drive. Despite my rental i4 being the slowest variant, it still felt quick.\n\nOne of the most remarkable features is the car's performance display screen, which shows real-time horsepower, torque, and temperature information.\n\nThe i4's quietness on the road further entrenches you in the realm of prestige. On rougher roads, I did notice some rattles around the headliner and sunroof.\n\nRange and charging\n\nThe BMW i4 charging in a parking lot. Andrew Lambrecht\n\nBMW's 256-mile EPA range estimate is accurate in real-world driving. Some EVs, like older Teslas, get much less range in real-world driving.\n\nCharging the i4 is not a bad experience, but I've tested better cars. On an 11kW unit, the i4 can add up to 31 miles of range per hour.\n\nThe one issue I had was with DC fast charging. I used Google Maps on CarPlay to route me to a fast charger for my testing. I forgot to enter the options menu and manually precondition the battery before arriving, which meant more time waiting for charging.\n\nI recorded 34 minutes to charge from 20 to 80%. This is not particularly fast. BMW says 10 to 80% should take 31 minutes in ideal conditions. This aligns with the Polestar 2 and Tesla Model 3 but is far behind the Hyundai Ioniq 6, which can manage just 18 minutes from 10 to 80%.\n\nThe gripes of the i4\n\nThe BMW i4's relatively limited rear seating space. Andrew Lambrecht\n\nThe BMW i4 is not cheap, but some parts don't express luxury like others. Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Polestar, Volvo, and Ford have front trunks in their electric cars. With such a large hood, there should be a large front storage space in the i4. Open the hood, and you'll be disappointed to find a gaping hole.\n\nMoreso, since the i4 uses the same platform as the gas-powered one, there's a massive transmission hump, taking up valuable legroom for backseat passengers. This makes the back seats feel very cramped.\n\nTo buy an i4 or not to buy an i4\n\nThe BMW i4 in the nighttime. Andrew Lambrecht\n\nThe BMW i4 is not for everyone. It costs more than other electric sedans but offers one of the best driving experiences among similarly-sized EVs. The price premium goes somewhere.\n\nThe i4 looks elegant and understated and is also fun to drive but manageable. The eDrive35 won't transport you to another dimension like the Model 3 Performance does, but it'll conjure a smile.\n\nFor most buyers, including myself, I'd say buy a Model 3. Its price-to-features ratio is simply unrivaled. For those who want something that looks, drives, and feels different from most EVs, the BMW i4 might be your best choice.",

            "content": "When Mike Schwede first sat in a Tesla Roadster 15 years ago, he felt like it was a glimpse into the future. By 2016, he was the proud owner of a Tesla, revelling in the thumbs up he would get from other drivers as he whizzed along Europe\u2019s highways in the electric vehicle.\n\nBut of late the sheen of owning a Tesla has begun to wear off. For years the brand has been synonymous with Elon Musk and his stance against the climate crisis. Recently, Schwede watched aghast as the Tesla CEO poured hundreds of millions into backing Donald Trump as he made promises to ramp up domestic oil and gas production.\n\n\u201cHe was getting more and more weird,\u201d said Schwede, an entrepreneur and digital strategist based in Switzerland. The final straw came when Musk made back-to-back fascist-style salutes during Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. \u201cI felt nothing but utter disgust,\u201d said Schwede. \u201cAnd I no longer enjoyed sitting in my Tesla.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association showed sales of new Tesla cars almost halved in Europe last month. The figures left analysts scrambling to assess how big a factor customers turning their backs on the brand because of Musk\u2019s foray into far-right politics may be.\n\nThe Texas-based carmaker sold 9,945 vehicles in Europe in January, down 45% from last year\u2019s 18,161, the association said.\n\nView image in fullscreen A parody \u2018Tesla \u2013 The Swasticar\u2019 advert posted at a London bus stop. Photograph: People vs Elon\n\nNow, there are signs existing Tesla owners who have become disgruntled with Musk\u2019s views are making their anger heard.\n\nSchwede contemplated selling his car, but after racking up more than 60,000 miles on it, there was little value left in it. So he came up with his own means of reclaiming his Tesla and the liberal ethos that had underpinned his purchase; he began donating 10 cents for every kilometre driven to a range of charities, countering Musk\u2019s support of the far right with direct support to those who help LGBTQ+ youth or fight hate and extremism. \u201cIt was something Elon wouldn\u2019t like,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my personal revenge.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a hint of how some Tesla owners in Europe are fighting back, putting up their own \u2013 albeit small-scale \u2013 resistance as Musk wades into global politics, using his wealth to help secure Trump\u2019s return to the White House and his sprawling influence to back far-right and anti-establishment parties across Europe.\n\nFor Germany\u2019s Patrik Schneider, the turning point came as he was heckled by a stranger at a petrol station, who pointed to his Tesla and called him a Trump supporter. Saddled with a long-term lease on the vehicle, he scrambled to find a way to address his relationship with a brand that \u2013 in his mind \u2013 had soured.\n\n\u201cOf course, as a Tesla driver you were always the fool: the Green party voter, the world saviour, the CO 2 guy,\u201d Schneider told Germany\u2019s Capital.de media. \u201cBut now you\u2019re in a category that\u2019s no longer funny.\u201d\n\nWhat he came up with was a line of \u201cAnti-Elon stickers\u201d for Tesla cars. In an echo of an American initiative, he began selling the stickers online six months ago, taking orders for messages that range from \u201cI bought this before Elon went crazy\u201d to \u201cElon sucks\u201d.\n\nAs Musk waded more deeply into German politics, hosting the far-right AfD\u2019s co-leader, Alice Weidel, in an interview on X and turning up at an AfD rally where he disparaged multiculturalism and lambasted the country\u2019s focus on \u201cpast guilt\u201d, demand for the stickers soared.\n\n1:53 Germany too focused on past guilt, Elon Musk tells AfD event \u2013 video\n\nDemand has now climbed to as much as 2,000 stickers a day, with orders pouring in from across the German-speaking world but as far as Australia and South Korea. All of it was done without any advertising, said Schneider, adding wryly: \u201cElon Musk does that for us.\u201d\n\nOthers have called for the actions to go further. In Poland \u2013 where the Nazi German occupation led to the deaths of 6 million Poles, including 3 million Jews \u2013 the country\u2019s tourism minister called on citizens to boycott Tesla after Musk\u2019s surprise appearance at the AfD rally. \u201cAll I can say is that probably no normal Pole should buy a Tesla any more,\u201d S\u0142awomir Nitras recently told Polish broadcaster Tok FM. \u201cA serious and strong response is necessary, including a consumer boycott.\u201d\n\nIn August, the German drugstore chain Rossmann said it would no longer buy Tesla cars for its corporate fleet, citing Musk\u2019s support for Trump, while the German energy company LichtBlick said on social media that it would be \u201cpulling the plug\u201d on the Tesla vehicles in its fleet, citing Musk\u2019s backing of \u201ca rightwing populist and extremist party\u201d.\n\nThe message was echoed recently by UK-based campaign group Led by Donkeys after they projected images of Musk\u2019s salute on to the facade of the Tesla gigafactory near Berlin.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Tottenham, north London, a member of the activist group People vs Elon took a cardboard cutout of Musk\u2019s salute into a Tesla dealership.\n\nIn Sweden, the EV maker Polestar has sought to capitalise on the discontent. \u201cWe get a lot of people writing that they don\u2019t like all this,\u201d the company\u2019s CEO, Michael Lohscheller, told Bloomberg, adding that he had directed sales staff to target disgruntled Tesla owners.\n\nAfter a Dutch poll suggested 31% of respondents who owned Teslas were considering selling them or had already done so, it remains to be seen what the impact will be on the company. Matthias Schmidt, a Germany-based automotive analyst, said \u201c2025 will be one of the biggest tests for Tesla.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all respect, consumers tend to be like goldfish; they tend to forget things very quickly,\u201d Schmidt added. \u201cBut Germany is potentially slightly different because of its history \u2026 The shift to him backing the AfD was potentially far more damaging in Germany than his move to back Trump.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Elon Musk wields a chainsaw during his appearance at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in the US. Photograph: Carol Guzy/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nLast year, Tesla saw sales in Germany plunge 41% \u2013 outpacing the overall 27% decline in EVs across the country \u2013 as rivals rolled out their own electric vehicles and governments rolled back subsidies.\n\nFigures for early 2025 show that Tesla sales fell sharply across several European markets. Registrations were down 63% on a year earlier in France, 59% in Germany, 44% in Sweden, 38% in Norway and 12% in the UK.\n\nWhile buyers could be reacting to Musk\u2019s comments, other factors may also be at play as consumers await Tesla\u2019s release of the updated Y model, said Schmidt.\n\nWhen contacted by the Guardian, Tesla did not reply to a request for comment. But late last month, Musk appeared to be upbeat during a call with investors, hinting that 2025 may be a tough year but that 2026 would be \u201cepic\u201d for the company.\n\n\u201cMusk is kind of like a character that \u2013 like a cat \u2013 has nine lives,\u201d said Schmidt. \u201cAnd he\u2019s almost used up those nine lives. And it will be interesting to see what happens now.\u201d",

It definitely can.\n\n[mellow electronic music]\n\nThis is a 2024 Tesla Model 3.\n\nIt has some of the most advanced navigation,\n\nautonomous driving, and safety features\n\ncurrently on the market, meaning it's full of equipment\n\nthat can record and track you and your surroundings,\n\nbut what happens to that data?\n\nHow much of it does Tesla collect\n\nand can you trust the company\n\nto protect your sensitive information?\n\nI'm Andrew Couts.\n\nToday, we're doing a deep dive into Tesla's privacy issues.\n\nThis is Incognito Mode.\n\n[somber electronic music]\n\nThere have been roughly seven million Teslas sold,\n\nand each one of them is\n\nessentially a surveillance system on wheels.\n\nThe manual says there are Wi-Fi and GPS antennas\n\nin the passenger-side mirror,\n\nwhich lets your car see where you are and get directions\n\nand download software updates\n\nwhen it's parked in your garage.\n\nThen, of course, there are all the cameras.\n\nEvery Tesla has a rear-view camera,\n\na common feature which has actually been required\n\nin all new cars since 2018, but Teslas also have\n\neither seven or eight other cameras depending on the model,\n\ntwo mounted on the door pillars,\n\ntwo mounted on the front fenders, one inside the car,\n\nand either two or three mounted on the windshield\n\nabove the rear-view mirror.\n\nThese cameras record around the car\n\nand feed that information\n\nto an onboard AI called Tesla Vision,\n\nwhich figures out things like\n\nwhether you're staying in your lane,\n\ngetting too close to other vehicles,\n\nor if you're approaching a red light.\n\nWith this 360 view, you're really recording\n\na massive amount of information\n\nabout everything the car drives by, license plates,\n\npeople's faces, where people are on the street.\n\nBasically, public information,\n\nbut it's a whole lot for a car to collect.\n\nWith all these sensors and cameras,\n\nyour Tesla is awash in data, data that the company says\n\nyour car needs to stay safe and get smarter,\n\nand Tesla says that it keeps your data private,\n\nbut is it really that simple?\n\nLet's look at what happens to\n\nthe most sensitive data that your Tesla collects.\n\n[somber electronic music]\n\nYour Tesla is constantly using its GPS sensor\n\nto monitor where you go, but according to Tesla,\n\nthe company doesn't collect your location data\n\nwith two exceptions.\n\nThe first exception is\n\nif you experience what the company calls a safety event.\n\nBasically, if you get into an accident.\n\nIf your car senses a crash,\n\nit'll send your location to Tesla.\n\nThe second is if you turn on location data sharing.\n\nIf you do that, your car will send location data to Tesla\n\nso it can evaluate\n\nhow well its cars analyze and respond to road conditions.\n\nTesla promises that,\n\nif you give it permission to collect this data,\n\nit'll make sure it's anonymized.\n\nThe company says that it does not link your location\n\nwith your account or your identity\n\nor keep a history of where you've been.\n\n[somber electronic music]\n\nTesla says that it only collects camera footage\n\nin limited circumstances.\n\nFor the exterior cameras, your car processes the data itself\n\nunless you enable data sharing, in which case\n\nrecordings of up to 30 seconds are shared with Tesla\n\nso it can evaluate\n\nhow well its cars analyze and respond to road conditions.\n\nJust like when you voluntarily share location data,\n\nTesla says this information is anonymized.\n\nAccording to Tesla,\n\nthe only time your car will share your camera footage\n\nand link it to your identity is if you're in an accident.\n\nTesla's exterior cameras are also used for\n\na feature called Sentry Mode,\n\nwhich basically lets you monitor your car's surroundings,\n\nor if your car detects a threat or unusual movement,\n\nyou can watch a recording of the event.\n\nTesla promises that these features are secure.\n\nThe live view is protected with end-to-end encryption,\n\nmeaning that even Tesla can't access it,\n\nand the recordings can only be saved on a USB drive.\n\nThat means they aren't sent to Tesla.\n\nStill, you're gonna wanna keep Sentry Mode in mind,\n\nand we'll explain more later.\n\nAs for the interior camera,\n\nthe one that might be seeing more sensitive things,\n\nTesla says that all its footage stays in the car\n\nunless you enable data sharing.\n\nIf you turn on that sharing and you get in an accident,\n\nyour car will send Tesla short anonymized clips.\n\nIt's the same as with the exterior cameras,\n\nbut what's different about the interior camera is,\n\nif you don't turn on data sharing,\n\nthe footage will never be sent to Tesla,\n\nand if you're wondering about audio recordings\n\ngenerated by voice commands\n\nlike asking your car to turn on the AC,\n\nTesla says those recordings stay in the car too\n\nunless you enable data sharing\n\nso it can improve the accuracy of your car's responses.\n\nJust like with the cameras,\n\nTesla says it doesn't capture continuous audio recordings,\n\nbut can you trust Tesla's promises?\n\nThe truth is\n\nyour privacy isn't as simple as the company makes it sound.\n\n[somber electronic music]\n\nThere are two big problems with Tesla's privacy claims.\n\nThe first has to do with anonymization.\n\nRemember how Tesla claims that it anonymizes all the data\n\nso it can't be traced back to you?\n\nWell, this anonymization isn't fool-proof.\n\nEach piece of data gets a temporary ID\n\nwhen it's sent to Tesla servers,\n\nbut as IEEE Spectrum explained,\n\nthat temporary ID can stay active for days or even weeks,\n\nand during that time, everything associated with that ID\n\nis clearly linked for everyone at Tesla to see.\n\nThat could include repeated visits\n\nto places that could clearly identify someone\n\nlike homes, schools, and office buildings.\n\nAs one Tesla owner who reverse-engineered\n\nthe car's data collection system told IEEE Spectrum,\n\nYou could probably match everything\n\nto a single person if you wanted to.\n\nAnd that leads to our second big problem,\n\nhow much you can trust Tesla itself.\n\nTesla makes a lot of privacy guarantees,\n\nbut when the Mozilla Foundation analyzed those promises,\n\nit wasn't very impressed.\n\nTesla does brag on its privacy pages about\n\nhow they're committed to protecting your data privacy.\n\nHowever, we worry that their actions\n\ntoo often show otherwise.\n\nMozilla criticized the policy's really vague language\n\nand lack of clarity on sharing with third parties,\n\nand it said it was very worried about Tesla's privacy.\n\nThey even went as far as saying\n\nit's hard to trust them with their current track record.\n\nTesla's had some pretty serious\n\nprivacy and security incidents over the past few years.\n\nThe biggest scandal involved\n\nTesla employees spying on customers\n\nthrough the images and videos\n\nrecorded by their car's cameras.\n\n[Reporter] A car owner\n\nfiling a potential class action suit\n\nafter a Reuters report published Thursday said\n\na small group of former employees\n\ndescribed sharing sensitive customer videos internally.\n\nAccording to Reuters, between 2019 and 2022,\n\nTesla employees sent each other\n\nhighly invasive images and videos\n\nfrom their customers' cars.\n\nThis included footage of naked people\n\nand even a car hitting a child riding a bike.\n\nTesla employees could see inside homes and garages\n\nas well as the GPS locations of their recordings.\n\nAfter the news broke in 2023,\n\nmembers of Congress took notice.\n\nSenators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal\n\nwrote to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, saying,\n\nThe apparent willful disregard of Tesla customers' privacy\n\nis unacceptable and raises serious questions\n\nabout Tesla's management practices.\n\nEmployees spying isn't the only reason\n\nto worry about how Tesla protects your privacy.\n\nThe company has also had trouble holding on to its data.\n\nYou have privacy questions\n\nbecause information is being gathered about you\n\nat all times, where you park, where you go,\n\nand it's being kept by the automotive industry\n\nwithout any real standards that are in place today.\n\nIn May 2023, a whistleblower gave a German newspaper\n\n100 gigabytes of internal Tesla documents,\n\nincluding sensitive employee details,\n\ncustomers' bank information, and even production secrets.\n\nA German data protection officer told The Guardian\n\nthat the data breach was unprecedented in scale.\n\nNow that we've covered what's in a Tesla\n\nand what to make of the company's privacy promises,\n\nlet's go over what could go wrong if you own, rent, ride in,\n\nor just walk by one of these cars.\n\n[somber electronic music]\n\nWhen it comes to Tesla's privacy risks,\n\nthere's really three categories you have to consider,\n\ngovernment surveillance, hacking,\n\nand good old-fashioned forgetfulness.\n\nYou own a Tesla, the government can just search your car.\n\nThey may not even need a warrant to do so.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment's so-called automobile exception\n\nlets the police search a car without a warrant\n\nas long as they have probable cause to be suspicious of you,\n\nand searching a Tesla can involve\n\nplugging your car into a computer\n\nand analyzing all the data it's collected\n\nabout your travel history,\n\nand here's something a lot of people don't know.\n\nEven if you don't own a Tesla\n\nand you don't take a ride in one,\n\nyou could still get caught in\n\nthe company's de facto surveillance.\n\nRemember that Sentry Mode feature we told you about earlier?\n\nIf you're walking down the street near a Tesla\n\nand a crime occurs nearby,\n\nyou could get caught up in a police investigation\n\nwithout having anything to do with the incident.\n\nTesla's privacy policy contains vague and broad language\n\nabout when the company will share car data\n\nwith government authorities.\n\nThe company says that it will share information\n\nin response to subpoenas, but it also says\n\nit will turn over data if the company thinks\n\nthe law requires it for purposes of security\n\nor other issues of public importance.\n\nIt's anyone's guess what that means.\n\nApart from government investigations,\n\nthere are also criminal gangs that like to hack companies,\n\ntake huge piles of customer data,\n\nand charge ransoms not to post it online.\n\nThere's also the possibility\n\nthat hackers could steal your data right off your car.\n\nIn early 2023, researchers at Pwn2Own,\n\na security conference in Canada,\n\nhacked into a Tesla Model 3 in less than two minutes.\n\nThey went from what's essentially an external component,\n\nthe Bluetooth chipset, to systems deep within the vehicle.\n\nIn addition to police and hackers,\n\nthere's a third privacy risk you should consider, yourself.\n\nWhen people rent Teslas or trade in their used ones,\n\nthey sometimes forget to erase their car's memory.\n\nResearchers have found sensitive unencrypted data\n\nsitting on Teslas purchased at scrap yards,\n\nwhere their previous owners probably thought\n\nit would never be accessed again.\n\n[somber electronic music]\n\nDon't other cars have these problems too?\n\nIt's a fair question.\n\nA 2023 Mozilla Foundation review\n\nof connected vehicle privacy concluded,\n\nModern cars are a privacy nightmare.\n\nThe truth is\n\nall car companies collect a lot of data on their customers.\n\nCompanies like Toyota use the car's interior camera\n\nto make sure drivers are paying attention,\n\neven to verify a driver's identity to prevent theft.\n\nAnother example is Nissan's privacy policy,\n\nwhich states it could collect\n\nnot just your location history, but anything you might do\n\ninside the privacy of your own car,\n\nbut not all of your car's data is equally sensitive\n\nand not all car makers collect the same data\n\nand handle it in the same way,\n\nand when it comes to the most sensitive data,\n\nTesla stands out.\n\nGiven its unique quantity of cameras and sensor data,\n\nits alarming privacy and security failures,\n\nand its vague policy\n\nabout sharing information with the government.\n\nAs far as we know,\n\none researcher told IEEE Spectrum,\n\nTesla vehicles collect the most amount of data.\n\nAnd in its 2023 review of car companies, Mozilla said,\n\nTesla is only the second product we've ever reviewed\n\nto receive all of our privacy dings.\n\nOf course, we can't talk about Tesla's privacy risks\n\nwithout talking about Elon Musk.\n\nThe world's richest man has recently inserted himself\n\ninto the center of American politics\n\nand aligned himself with President Donald Trump.\n\nHe's repeatedly twisted\n\nthe policies of his social media network X\n\nto satisfy his own personal whims\n\nand support Trump's political agenda,\n\nand remember how Tesla says\n\nit doesn't collect continuous video from its cars?\n\nWe don't know if that's a technological limitation\n\nor just a company policy.\n\nBasically, if the technology allows it,\n\nall it takes is a policy tweak\n\nfor your level of privacy to drastically change.\n\n[somber electronic music]\n\nNow that you know how Tesla collects your information\n\nand why it might not be as private as the company claims,\n\nyou're probably wondering how you can protect yourself.\n\nIf you own a Tesla,\n\nthe one thing you can do is disable data sharing.\n\nOf course, we should point out that\n\ndisabling some of these features\n\nwill make your Tesla less smart.\n\nUsing technology is all about making trade-offs.\n\nYou'll have to decide for yourself\n\nwhat you're most comfortable with.\n\nIf you're getting rid of your Tesla,\n\nyou can use the company's website or app\n\nto request a total account deletion,\n\nand if you're a pedestrian worried about ending up\n\nin the background of a Tesla recording,\n\nmaybe just keep an eye out for that sleek T logo\n\nand cross the street any time you see one.\n\nUntil next time.\n\n[playful electronic music]",

And that\u2019s a big opportunity to change things because those expectations are simply beliefs in Musk\u2019s genius, based on a story that, ultimately, the public owns \u2014 and the public can take it away, by protesting, talking to people, and participating in all sorts of things you can find out about by visiting Tesla Takedown. Change the story enough, and when people go shopping for a car, they\u2019ll buy something else, which means investors will sell off their stock \u2014 and turn the Wall Street math that made Musk towards unmaking him.\n\nShare\n\nWe spoke with Nolan \u2014 the publisher of How Things Work, and author of the new book The Hammer, Power, Inequality, and the Struggle for the Soul of Labor \u2014 not just about Tesla, but about the many challenges facing the labor movement in the 21st century, from gig economy entrepreneurs making an end run around union regulations to A.I. threatening to take away the jobs of millions, and about the hope and possibility labor solidarity still represents. And we talked about the kind of change people working together can achieve in this moment. Taking away Elon Musk\u2019s power is just the start.\n\n\u201cThe bad people who are in charge right now are not that smart,\u201d Nolan pointed out, \u201cSo there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t kick their ass.\u201d\n\nWant to get started?

The latest drawdown comes as new data showed new Tesla vehicle registrations plummeting in Europe, down 45% year-on-year for January, even as overall sales growth of electric-battery vehicles on the continent climbed. Sales in China also recently came in trending down.\n\nSome reports have suggested European buyers are revolting against Musk's active role in the Trump administration, which is effectively resetting longstanding European relations.\n\nInvestors may also simply be locking in the extraordinary gains of the past year or so: Even with the recent drop-off, the stock is still up 52% over the past 12 months.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gary Black, managing partner at The Future Fund investment group, said Tesla shares could fall even further this year given an apparent revision in recent Tesla corporate management guidance about deliveries in 2025.\n\nMusk has assumed an unprecedented \u2014 and highly controversial \u2014 role in American society with his alliance with President Donald Trump and his ostensible leadership of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency. Musk also leads SpaceX; the social media platform X; the xAI artificial intelligence company; and Neuralink, a company that is exploring brain-chip implants.\n\nYet Tesla investors have grown accustomed to Musk's multiple responsibilities \u2014 and indeed, continue to value Tesla stock highly because they see Musk as a uniquely capable figure.\n\nTo that point, some investors say Tesla's recent stock reversal may not endure in the long term. The company is expected to deploy a robo-taxi service later this year, and continues to roll out new models to adapt to shifting driver preferences. It is also unveiling its full-self-driving technology in China.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s superior products, new more affordable vehicle, which I believe will be a new form factor and expand Tesla\u2019s total addressable market, and the promise of unsupervised autonomy will sell more Teslas,\u201d Black wrote on X over the weekend.",

            "content": "Elon Musk may be \"saving\" money for the federal government, however questionably \u2014 but it'll take a minor miracle for him to salvage his automaker's situation across the pond.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), sales of new Tesla cars in the continent have plummeted to just 9,945 vehicles in January, down from 18,161 in the same period last year, per the Guardian. That's a whopping 45 percent decrease.\n\nAs sales collapse, the automaker's usually stellar stock position has also taken a ding, despite soaring to an all-time high in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory. As of Tuesday morning, Tesla shares dropped by more than 8 percent, for a cumulative decline of 23 percent in the last month of trading.\n\nWhile other major stocks are trending downwards, \"Tesla shares are now by far the biggest decliner among the mega-cap technology stocks, weighing heavily on the group's overall performance,\" according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe uninspiring numbers almost certainly indicate that Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration, his dalliance with far-right forces at home and abroad, as well as his polarizing personal behavior \u2014 like his thinly-veiled Nazi salute \u2014 are all blowing back on his businesses.\n\nIt also coincides with Musk wading deeper into European politics. In the past months, the world's richest man threw his support behind Germany's far-right AfD party \u2014 whom he told to get over their Nazi guilt \u2014 and incurred the ire of leaders such as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron, who have accused Musk of spreading misinformation.\n\nThe public has also voiced their dissent. Tesla dealerships in Europe have been targeted with vandalism, ranging from being defaced by spray paint with anti-Nazi slogans to getting smashed up, such as the Tesla showroom in the Hague. Even Tesla owners, infamously immune to feelings of embarrassment, are expressing their buyer's regret with anti-Elon stickers.\n\nWhat's really telling is that Tesla's poor showing comes during what is otherwise a promising period for electric cars, with the European market for new EVs growing by 34 percent in January to 124,341 units, despite overall new vehicle registrations declining by 3 percent, according to ACEA data cited by the Guardian. A rising tide, it seems, doesn't always lift all boats.\n\nThis also follows a dismal year for Tesla sales in Europe. In 2024, sales in the continent dropped by 13 percent, with even famously EV-eager nations like Norway, where 88.9 percent of all new cars sold are electric, seeing a 37.9 percent dip. At this point, it doesn't seem poised for a rebound.\n\nBeyond Musk's unpopular antics, Tesla is also facing steeper competition. In the UK this January, its Chinese rival BYD recorded more vehicle registrations than Musk's automaker for the first time, the Guardian noted, while its overall European market share has fallen from 1.8 percent to 1 percent.\n\nMaybe the hype is finally starting to even out. Tesla has long enjoyed an exorbitant valuation and stock price despite its relatively small share in the US auto market, nevermind its repeated failure to deliver on key promises like fully autonomous vehicles. Last year was the first time that it suffered an annual decline in its sales. Now it may be well on its way to an unwanted repeat.\n\nMore on Tesla: Body Panels Flying Off Cybertrucks on Highway, Drivers Report",

            "content": "Analysts say that most consumers would rather not be called Nazis. (Photo: Getty)\n\nElon Musk, an impossibly wealthy, drug-addled Nazi sympathizer, is making drastic, devastating, unaccountable cuts to our federal government. He is making decisions of great global consequence based on nothing but his own demonstrably ignorant ideas. He is materially harming millions of people around the world. He seems to be operating outside of the law. He appears to have nothing holding back his worst impulses. The Republican Party has opened the door for him, the Democratic Party believes itself to be unable to stand in his way, and there is no indication that the courts will be able to roll back the damage he has already done. It is up to us.\n\nAs a regular person, it can seem impossible to plan and execute actions that would have a serious impact on the richest guy in America. Protesting and waving signs and calling your representatives are all things that you should do, but I know that they can often leave people feeling like their effort has not produced any real effects. You marched against the war and the war still happened. You marched against DOGE and they still defunded a bunch of cancer trials. Is any of this actually getting through to the well-insulated oligarchs?\n\nToday, I want to point out that: Yes. There are very straightforward ways that regular people can organize and exercise leverage on Elon Musk. I will discuss one way here that you, yourself, can get involved with. The wealthier that someone gets, the more points of vulnerability their fortunes have.\n\nWhat is the source of Elon Musk\u2019s power? His wealth. There are lots of smart tech guys and there are lots of company founders and CEOs and political donors and as a group they exercise a fair amount of political influence, but the reason why this man in particular is swanning around DC doing whatever the hell he wants is that he is worth more than anyone else, and he spent more than anyone else to help get Trump elected. The way to get Elon Musk to pay attention is to target his wealth. I don\u2019t think that he will ever be \u201cnot rich,\u201d at least not until the revolution comes, but it is completely possible to bring about enormous losses in his net worth.\n\nMost of Musk\u2019s wealth comes from his ownership of companies that have become very valuable. The two biggest are SpaceX and Tesla. He owns more than 40% of SpaceX, a company that was recently valued at $350 billion, meaning that Musk\u2019s stake is worth about $147 billion. SpaceX is a privately held company, and it is not consumer-facing, meaning its revenue is harder for regular people to affect. We\u2019ll set aside SpaceX for now.\n\nThe other main source of Musk\u2019s wealth is his ownership of around 13% of Tesla. That company, as of today, is worth $1.08 trillion, meaning Musk\u2019s stake is worth about $140 billion. He also has a large number of unexercised stock options in the company. Tesla is the biggest single contributor to his net worth. It is also a public company, and one that makes its money by selling products to consumers. To regular people. Which is to say, the biggest single piece of Elon Musk\u2019s portfolio is directly exposed to organized economic action by regular people. If you want to cost Elon Musk tens of billions of dollars, Tesla is the way to do it.\n\nWhat might that look like? First, it is important to know this about Tesla\u2019s stock price: It is insanely high. Meaning that it is much, much higher than the economic fundamentals of the company would dictate. (Which is why it has long been one of the most shorted stocks, although that trade has mostly not paid off for those who have been betting on its price to collapse for years now.) Tesla\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio is currently 166, meaning that its stock price is 166 times the value of its earnings per share. How high is that? Well, the average PE ratio of the top 500 companies in America right now is 30\u2014and that is high, by historic standards. The second most valuable auto company after Tesla is Toyota, which has a PE ratio of 7. General Motors also has a PE ratio of 7. What if you compare Tesla, instead, to tech companies, which investors assign a premium to? Well, the PE ratio of Apple is 39; the PE ratio of Amazon is 39; the PE ratio of Google parent Alphabet is 23. What I am saying here is that, even by giving Tesla every benefit of the doubt, the company\u2019s stock price is irrationally high. This is well known on Wall Street. Tesla\u2019s stock price\u2014and by extension, the largest part of Elon Musk\u2019s net worth\u2014is almost purely a product of investor sentiment. It is not based so much on the company\u2019s financial performance as on a magical belief that Musk will make it the biggest automaker in the world.\n\nThe unfortunate expression of negative consumer sentiment, via Reddit.\n\nAny company whose value is this dependent not on its balance sheet but instead on a shared popular narrative is unusually vulnerable to narrative shifts. Financial history is one long demonstration of the fact that investor sentiment changes. A lot. Speculators of the sort that make up Tesla\u2019s investors generally are like scared fish, moving tightly with the rest of the crowd, ready to swerve off in an opposite direction the moment that trouble is detected. Dampening the positive sentiment around Tesla as a brand can have a huge impact on Tesla the stock. A fortune that is built on irrational shared beliefs that can be destroyed when rationality\u2019s cold hand creeps in. Consider the fact that if Tesla were to retreat even to a PE ratio of 40\u2014comparable to that of big tech companies, which themselves enjoy higher PE ratios than industrial companies\u2014that would imply a decline in the company\u2019s value of 3/4. It would go from being a trillion-dollar company to a $250 billion company, only a bit larger than Toyota. That would represent a loss of around $100 billion in wealth for Elon Musk.\n\nThere is already a nascent protest campaign against Tesla. Its hashtag is #TeslaTakedown. It has a website. There have already been protests at Tesla dealerships across the country, and many more are planned. You can join them. In order for Tesla to make money they must attract buyers. Potential buyers can easily be turned off by having to pass protesters calling them Nazis when they go to browse for a new car. There are plenty of other cars to buy that will not get them yelled at. These things are a genuine factor in the minds of consumers.\n\nFurthermore, we have all seen the reports of Tesla cybertrucks being defaced with swastikas or other graffiti implying that such vehicles could only be owned by Nazis. Some cybertruck owners have told reporters that they no longer want to own cybertrucks after these incidents. I would never condone illegal vandalism as a protest tactic. But as a keen observer of social trends, I observe that these types of actions often spread and become more frequent when large numbers of people view them as effective ways to achieve a goal. If owners of cybertrucks\u2014or other Tesla products\u2014come to find that they are frequently being made the targets of graffiti implying that they are supporting Nazis, I predict that consumer enthusiasm for purchasing Tesla products will decline. Do you really want to worry about your car being vandalized every day due to the political actions of the person who started the company? Why not just buy a different car, and save yourself that worry?\n\nShare\n\nSure, people who share the political goals of Elon Musk and Donald Trump may continue to buy Teslas, as a way to signal their own politics. (I imagine such people already make up a significant portion of cybertruck owners). But remember: Tesla\u2019s stock price is not a number that can be justified if Tesla\u2019s products appeal to, at most, half of potential consumers. Tesla\u2019s stock price can only be justified by explosive global growth in Tesla sales. If sales figures do not show that Tesla is continually getting more and more popular, its stock price cannot remain at its current elevated level, much less go even higher. Despite Tesla\u2019s size, its stock behaves like a meme stock. And meme stocks always crash down to earth, because they do not have financial fundamentals holding them up. They only have fickle, fickle sentiment.\n\nTesla is not so much an auto company as a story. The story is, \u201cElon Musk is a genius and his genius will cause uninterrupted growth of this company, which will come to dominate the entire auto market.\u201d If this story begins to seem less plausible, investor sentiment will get shakier. If Tesla finds itself the target of sustained protests, and if owning a Tesla begins to carry a negative social price, it is very likely that a large portion of consumers will conclude that buying a Tesla is not worth the hassle. That story of global dominance will therefore become increasingly questionable. High stock prices based on shaky sentiment are very fragile things.\n\nI sketch all this out only to make the point that this is not anything that is out of the reach of ordinary people taking ordinary actions in line with their First Amendment rights. There are Tesla dealerships all over the country. The idea of making Elon Musk $100 billion poorer might sound like some grand dream. It is not. If you think of it only in terms of your own spending, it seems difficult: You may not buy a Tesla, but you\u2019re only one person, and you don\u2019t spend billions. But that is not the right way to think of it. The task is not to organize an explicit national boycott so much as it is to tarnish Tesla\u2019s brand\u2014by simply making clear to potential Tesla consumers that their purchase represents support for an odious political agenda. You, picketing a Tesla dealership in your town, can play a very real part in this goal. The rest is nothing more than the unfolding of the relentless math of Wall Street.\n\nUnpopular things don\u2019t make money.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nMore",

            "content": "A new document undercuts Trump admin's denials about $400 million Tesla deal\n\ntoggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe controversy started in a very Washington way: as a line item in a government spreadsheet buried on the State Department's website.\n\nIt appeared as if the State Department was taking steps to award Elon Musk's Tesla a $400 million government contract to buy armored electric vehicles to securely transport diplomats. The move to set in motion a lucrative contract to a company controlled by a high-profile ally of President Trump seemed so bold it surprised even longtime observers of the norm-busting president.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen asked about it, the State Department issued a statement saying the purchase is now on hold with no plans of fulfilling the contract, pointing out that talks with Tesla began during the Biden administration.\n\nBut NPR has obtained a State Department document detailing that Biden's State Department planned to spend just $483,000 in the 2025 fiscal year on buying electric vehicles and $3 million for supporting equipment, like charging stations. It represented less than 1% of the hundreds of millions of dollars likely destined for Tesla vehicles after the Trump administration quietly revised a State Department procurement document.\n\nThe vast discrepancy in the numbers raises the question: Was it an error or a deliberate action?\n\nA former Biden White House official familiar with the State Department's plans told NPR the steps taken to advance $400 million worth of government business to Tesla appear to be intentional.\n\n\"I don't think this is a clerical error. It was likely someone who is new in [the] State [Department] who decided, 'OK, we're gonna do this with Tesla,'\" said the former official, who was not authorized to speak about the matter.\n\nThe person said the State Department and Tesla had agreed during the Biden administration to conduct research about armoring electric vehicles, but no money had been set aside to purchase armored Teslas for the State Department. A total budget of $483,000 had been approved to buy light-duty EVs as possible State Department vehicles. That plan was moving forward as recently as November 2024.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe White House and Musk did not return multiple requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement to NPR on Monday, a State Department spokesperson said the $400 million figure was \"an estimate,\" pointing out that it was in the early stages and was not yet a full contract, but rather a proposal \"strictly to gather information.\"\n\nThe department spokesman added: \"the Department of State has no intention to move forward with the solicitation.\"\n\nIn a Feb. 13 post on his social media platform, X, Musk, who is also a top White House official, said: \"I'm pretty sure Tesla isn't getting $400M. No one mentioned it to me, at least.\"\n\nAfter the original procurement document attracted widespread attention, NPR reported that the Trump administration appeared to have quietly edited the document, changing the phrase \"armored Tesla\" to the more generic \"armored electric vehicles\" without explanation. Eventually, the item vanished from the State Department's procurement document.\n\ntoggle caption U.S. Department of State\n\nThe document claims it was originally published in December, at the end of then-President Joe Biden's term, but it does not appear in the Internet Archive for that month.\n\nThe $400 million item in the procurement document caused a stir. Since then, Trump officials have not answered why the State Department appeared to be taking steps to pursue an acquisition of electric vehicles from Tesla, with the company's stainless steel Cybertruck likely being the most suitable option for an armored vehicle. The proposed purchase amount would likely exceed what the entire federal government would spend on electric vehicles in 2025.\n\nThe prospect of such a purchase also puzzled security professionals who work with the State Department.\n\n\"I can't imagine why the government would ever put dignitaries in a Cybertruck,\" said Jim McGuffey, an armored-car expert who does work with the State Department. \"Compared to the other armored-car companies out there, it just wouldn't make any sense.\"\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nState Department abandons Tesla plan after publicity\n\nThe potential purchase of armored Teslas emerged as Musk, Tesla's CEO, has become one of the most influential officials in the White House, leading a cost-cutting initiative that has swept across the federal government.\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nMusk's team has orchestrated the firings of tens of thousands of career government workers and has tried to dismantle entire agencies. Ethics experts have grown concerned about how Musk could use his influence to benefit one of his six companies. Trump has vowed to remove Musk from any government matters that could affect one of his firms, even though Musk is already shaking up agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that could have presented a regulatory headache for the billionaire.\n\nThe idea that the Trump administration would support a $400 million contract to buy Teslas would seem to run counter to Trump's opposition to electric vehicles. Trump has revoked Biden's executive orders backing funding and infrastructure for EVs, one of which sought to encourage the federal government to acquire electric vehicles.\n\nExperts interviewed for this story raised this possibility: Trump's State Department may have hoped to replace some or all of the department's fleet of armored cars and SUVs with Teslas, with the most fitting model likely being the Cybertruck, a large and angular vehicle that began deliveries in 2023. Musk has called it a \"futuristic battle tank.\"\n\n\n\nReplacing whole State Department fleet with Teslas? \"It's possible\"\n\nSecurity experts and former federal officials said $400 million would likely cover the purchasing and \"up-armoring\" of thousands of Cybertrucks.\n\nAccording to the State Department document reviewed by NPR, there are about 3,000 armored cars and SUVs around the world that are used to transport diplomats, VIPs and other officials working for the State Department.\n\nIf every one of those vehicles was replaced with a new Cybertruck, which costs around $80,000 for an entry-level model, the bill would come out to about $250 million. The vehicles would then need to go through a process known as \"up-armoring,\" which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per car. Multiply those costs by the size of the State Department's entire fleet, and experts said $400 million would likely be a ballpark cost.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It's possible \u2014 diplomatic-level armoring starts in the mid-$70,000s,\" said Mark Burton, chief executive of Armormax, a Utah firm that installs bulletproof glass and other security-enhancing modifications to vehicles. \"We're doing EVs all the time,\" he said. \"We've done Rivians, [Tesla] Model S and Cybertrucks.\"\n\ntoggle caption Federic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images\n\nYet as of July 2024, when the State Department document was submitted to the White House, the department's officials had serious reservations about converting its fleet to electric vehicles.\n\nAmong the issues was identifying an electric vehicle durable enough to be \"armored up,\" which would require protecting the vehicle's battery against something that could cause the battery to explode or catch fire, the State Department officials wrote. The officials wrote that \"finding an electric vehicle that can hold the weight of armor and have viable range for protection driving are other initial challenges.\"\n\nIndeed, security industry experts say fully armoring a vehicle can add something like 1,000 pounds of weight. A Cybertruck already weighs around 7,000 pounds. The added armor could add stress to the entire vehicle and significantly reduce the electric vehicle's range, a potential safety concern, especially in countries with limited EV charging infrastructure.\n\nIn a now-famous early demo of the Cybertruck, in 2019, Musk wanted to show a live crowd that the car was \"bulletproof\" and had Tesla's chief designer throw a metal ball at one of its windows. He did, and the glass smashed.\n\n\"Well, maybe that was a little too hard,\" Musk said.\n\n\n\nDiplomats in Cybertrucks in Karachi and Mogadishu? Not likely, says former U.S. official\n\nWith those concerns in mind, the State Department officials in the agency's document outlined a gradual timeline, writing that they hoped to test the first electric vehicles prototypes in 2026, before discussion of wider adoption would begin.\n\nBut the Trump administration's 2025 procurement document was on a far more aggressive timetable, noting it planned to begin accepting bids for the $400 million armored electric vehicle order this May, with the goal of completing a purchase by September.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen Michael Evanoff saw that figure, he was instantly skeptical.\n\nEvanoff, a former senior State Department diplomatic security official with 40 years of experience, said the gold standard for diplomatic security is vehicles that are manufactured from the ground up with armor, not with armor added on later. Carmakers including Mercedes, BMW and GM offer such armored models. In fact, the State Department awarded GM a $300 million contract for armored SUVs in 2023.\n\nA Cybertruck, he said, would not fit the bill.\n\n\"It would be hard for a Cybertruck to survive in a hostile environment,\" said Evanoff, pointing to potential problems arising from the vehicle's weight after being modified with armor and battery-life issues. \"You're not going to see diplomats in Cybertrucks in Karachi and Mogadishu.\"\n\nHave information you want to share about the ongoing changes across the federal government?

Williamson Blvd. in Daytona Beach call for the construction of a standalone 35,373-square-foot building that will include a showroom, service and parts departments, a vehicle wash bay, conference rooms, an office and a customer lounge.\n\nThe dealership will sit on a 4.78-acre site on the northeast corner of Williamson Boulevard and Mason Avenue, and will be part of a larger retail center called The Cays, which is being developed by a Neptune Beach-based real estate development company doing business as \"Daytona Lux Development LLC,\" but whose name is actually Paradigm Development Partners.\n\nThe dealership will have a surface parking lot for up to 210 vehicles.\n\nWho is Nikola Tesla?\n\nThe Tesla electric vehicle company is named after Nikola Tesla, the engineer/inventor whose inventions included one of the first alternating current induction motors in 1888.\n\nWho founded the Tesla company?\n\nAccording to an article published by thestreet.com, Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in San Carlos, California. The company shortened its name to simply Tesla in 2017.\n\nThe billionaire Elon Musk was one of the company's early financial backers. After investing in the venture in 2004, he became chairman of its board of directors.\n\nMusk took over as CEO in 2008, shortly after the departure of the company's co-founders.\n\nWho owns Tesla today?\n\nTesla is a public company whose common stock shares are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol TSLA. As of midday Monday, its stock price stood at more than $327 a share.\n\nMusk remains Tesla's largest shareholder today with a nearly 13% stake as of December 2024, according to an article published by The Motley Fool.\n\nThe company's next biggest shareholder is institutional investor the Vanguard Group, which owns a 7.5% stake, followed by BlackRock, which owns 6.1% of all outstanding shares.\n\nAmong individual stakeholders, the No. 2 investor behind Musk is his younger brother Kimbal, who owns more than 1.5 million shares, or a 0.05% stake.\n\nWhere does Tesla rank among electric vehicle makers?\n\nTesla for many years was the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, but it recently relinquished that title to China's BYD Company Ltd., whose initials stand for \"Build Your Dreams.\" Tesla is currently the second largest EV maker.\n\nTesla was the top electric vehicle maker in the United States in 2024, selling nearly 634,000, a 5.6% decline from 2023, its first-ever year-over-year drop, according to the website insideevs.com.\n\nElectric vehicles gaining popularity in Florida\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, Florida had 254,900 registered owners of light-duty electric vehicles in 2023, the second-most behind only California, which had more than 1.25 million registered EVs.\n\nThat's a dramatic increase from 2020, when Florida only had 58,200 registered EVs.\n\nSo how much do Teslas cost?\n\nPrices for new Tesla vehicles, according to the website solareviews.com, vary depending on whether you are buying a base model or a \"max\" price that includes all the optional amenities. A model 3, for example, sells for a base price of $38,990 and a max price of $66,630. A model Y sells for $44,990 base and $63,490 max.\n\nTesla's premium sedan offering, the model S, sells for $72,990 base and $107,630 max.\n\nTesla's version of an SUV, the model X, sells for $77,990 base and $113,630 max.\n\nTesla's newest vehicle, the futuristic-looking Cybertruck, sells for $60,990 base and $99,990 max (for the \"Cyberbeast\").\n\nMore 'affordable models' are in the works\n\nTesla, in its latest annual report, stated that, \"Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These vehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.\"\n\nA 'robotaxi' is also planned\n\nThe annual report also stated that the company's \"purpose-built Robotaxi product \u2014 Cybercab \u2014 will continue to pursue a revolutionary 'unboxed' manufacturing strategy and is scheduled for volume production starting in 2026.\"",

The purchase was part of a broader effort to adopt a more environmentally conscious lifestyle, which also included installing solar panels on his Virginia home. Now, the 76-year-old is worried about the message his car might send to others: that he supports Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has embraced right-wing politics, boosted antisemitic conspiracy theories on his personal X account and become a central figure in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. As a small act of protest, Blackburn purchased a bumper sticker that reads, \u201cI bought this before I knew he was crazy.\u201d\n\nMarylander Carla Harne, 41, has watched the tide turn against Tesla and Musk from the front seat of her sleek, fiery red Model 3. Harne\u2019s interactions with others over her car had mostly been positive \u2014 until last year, when, hours after Trump was elected president of the United States, someone threw \u201cprobably a dozen\u201d eggs at her car as she drove home from work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy windshield was just covered,\u201d Harne said.\n\nAndrew Loewinger of Northwest D.C. sold his Model S in November to protest Musk and his \u201cabhorrent politics and actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I sold the car, I got a customer satisfaction survey from them, and what I wrote, which I still believe, is that Musk has irretrievably damaged the brand, and I would not associate with that brand again, period,\u201d Loewinger, 71, said.\n\nAcross the decidedly blue Washington region, some Tesla owners \u2014 once seen as part of a pioneering sustainability movement \u2014 are grappling with the CEO\u2019s emergence as one of the most powerful right-wing political figures in the country. Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, spent at least $288 million to help elect Trump and other Republican candidates, making him the 2024 presidential election\u2019s biggest donor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as head of the newly created U.S. DOGE Service, Musk has raced to execute his vision of a dramatically smaller government, wiping out swaths of the federal workforce, slashing diversity and inclusion efforts, and ripping up deals with government contractors. The broad-brush bludgeoning of federal agencies and programs has been cheered by Trump\u2019s MAGA base, but it has also run in to a flurry of lawsuits and legal challenges seeking to halt what critics view as an unconstitutional process. Even some of Trump\u2019s senior advisers have been surprised and frustrated by the seeming freedom of DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, to do anything it wants, according to Washington Post reporting last week.\n\nMusk\u2019s actions are distinctly felt here in the Washington metropolitan region, which about 20 percent of the federal workforce calls home. Protests against DOGE have taken place almost weekly, and Tesla showrooms have also been picketed, including locations in Georgetown, Arlington and Owings Mills, Maryland. At one of the demonstrations in Georgetown this month, protesters carried signs that read, \u201cNo one voted for the Muskrat\u201d and \u201cMusk Robbing America.\u201d A message scrawled in colorful chalk on the sidewalk surrounding the dealership read, \u201cYou want a swasticar?\u201d\n\nFor some Washington residents, the political baggage associated with owning a Tesla has become too great.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just irritates me very deeply that the man who started the Tesla and has done other good things has, in my opinion, completely gone off the rails,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cI would never buy another Tesla. I have a brother who bought a Tesla at my urging and a really good friend who bought a Tesla at my urging. Neither of them will ever buy a Tesla again.\u201d\n\nThe brand vs. the CEO\n\nJessica Caldwell, an industry analyst with automotive website Edmunds.com, said Tesla owners fall into two camps: those who say they will never buy a Tesla again and those who differentiate between Musk and Tesla.\n\n\u201cThe one camp is: \u2018I really like my Tesla. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with him, but I kind of see them as two separate entities. It\u2019s not as if Elon Musk is in my car,\u2019\u201d Caldwell said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Terrell, an electric vehicle enthusiast from Chesterfield, Virginia, falls into that camp.\n\nTerrell, 58, had always wanted to own an electric vehicle but thought they were too expensive.

As of 2024, Virginia has almost 92,000 electric cars registered, according to the Virginia DMV, though the commonwealth does not track electric vehicles by manufacturer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, Tesla experienced its first annual drop in electric vehicle deliveries in more than a decade. Overall sales in 2024 declined a little over 1 percent as the company delivered about 1.78 million vehicles, compared with approximately 1.8 million in 2023. Last January, Musk said Tesla would experience a \u201cnotably slower growth rate\u201d as the company invested in next-generation vehicles it plans to start building in 2025.\n\nSome Tesla employees and investors have expressed concerns that Musk has tarnished the company\u2019s brand, with some indicating that the company would be better off if Musk resigned, The Post reported this month. Tesla\u2019s stock surged after the election and peaked in mid-December at $479.86 a share. Since then it has declined steadily, dropping below $303 at the close of trading Tuesday.\n\nSpokespeople for Tesla did not respond to a Post email for this article asking if the company believes sales have been affected by Musk\u2019s role in the new administration and if Tesla owners in the region had reported being targeted because of their vehicles.\n\nMusk has so far shrugged off the critics. Asked during an earnings call in January if his actions were negatively affecting Tesla, he pointed to his 127 million followers on X, his social media platform. \u201cI might not be popular with some people but for the vast majority of people, my follower count speaks for itself,\u201d he said.\n\nBut more Americans disapprove of Musk than approve of him, according to a Washington Post-Ipsos poll released Thursday. Just 34 percent of American adults say they approve of the job Musk is doing within the federal government. A whopping 85 percent of Democrats disapprove of his new role.\n\nThe \u2018Anti Elon Tesla Club\u2019\n\nFor Matthew Hiller, the backlash against Musk has been a bonanza for his side business. On Etsy, he sells bumper stickers and magnets aimed at Tesla owners who want people to know they don\u2019t support Musk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHiller, who lives in Honolulu, said he\u2019s been receiving hundreds of orders every day for stickers with messages like \u201cI bought this before I knew Elon was crazy.\u201d\n\nAnother, \u201cAnti Elon Tesla Club,\u201d has also taken off. \u201cI think it creates a sense of community,\u201d Hiller said. \u201cLike, I\u2019m in this little club with all of the other Tesla owners who can\u2019t stand him.\u201d\n\nSales of the stickers had been strong since the election, but after Musk gave a gesture widely interpreted as a Nazi salute at Trump\u2019s inaugural rally Jan. 20, the numbers skyrocketed, averaging 400 to 500 orders a day.\n\n\u201cIt went crazy. I had to get friends to help me pack envelopes,\u201d Hiller said. \u201cThat particular incident just opened the eyes of more people.\u201d\n\nJillian Rebraca, 33, has purchased two stickers from Hiller. Rebraca and her husband were at one time the proud owners of a gray 2022 Tesla Model 3.\n\nThe District residents still own the car. They\u2019re just no longer proud of it. Musk, Rebraca says, ruined it for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple bought the Tesla because they wanted an electric car that was good for the environment, comfortable and stylish. It ticked all the boxes. What they hadn\u2019t anticipated was Musk actively campaigning for Trump\u2019s second presidential bid and becoming a dominant figure in his new administration.\n\nRebraca said she and her husband started feeling buyer\u2019s remorse about the car during the campaign. As a Christmas novelty gift, Rebraca went online and bought her husband an \u201cAnti Elon Tesla Club\u201d sticker. But it wasn\u2019t until Musk gave his salute that they put the sticker on their car.\n\n\u201cThe person who owns this company is \u2014 I\u2019m trying to be diplomatic here \u2014 polarizing,\u201d Rebraca said. \u201cWith the car being the political statement that it is I wanted to sell it, but that\u2019s not really feasible right now.\u201d\n\nFor Rebraca, buying another Tesla is out of the question.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cars could be free and I would choose to walk.\u201d",

Here\u2019s a breakdown.\n\nIn San Francisco, opinions among Tesla owners vary: There are those who love Musk, those who don\u2019t care about politics, and those who abhor Musk but adore self-driving.\n\nEverything you need to know to start your day.\n\n\u2018I am very embarrassed\u2019\n\nPatrick Levesque has also turned against Musk and says he will not renew his lease when it expires in three months.\n\n\u201cI am very embarrassed,\u201d said John Newmeyer, an essayist who has had his Tesla for five years. \u201cHe\u2019s gone into an area he doesn\u2019t belong in and caused a lot of damage.\u201d\n\nImmediately upon taking office last month as the head of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk offered buyouts to every employee in the federal government and has since fired 30,000.\n\n\u201cI got the lease two years ago, and I was hesitant then,\u201d Levesque said. \u201cThe nail in the coffin was the election cycle meddling before the results were even in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t own a Tesla just because of recent events,\u201d said Isabella Maytorena, a laboratory assistant who often drives her boyfriend\u2019s Tesla. \u201cAt the beginning, I was like, \u2018Oh, OK, maybe it\u2019ll work out.\u2019 But I spend too much time on TikTok watching theories about what could happen.

Musk has accused NHTSA of holding back progress on self-driving technology with its investigations and recalls.\n\nAsked about whether the cuts would impact any probes into Tesla, the agency referred to its statement that says it will \u201cenforce the law on all manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment.\u201d\n\nThe job cuts at NHTSA enacted by Musk\u2019s advisory group on shrinking the federal government, the Department of Government Efficiency, was earlier reported by The Washington Post.\n\nREAD MORE: Duffy Vows to Not Protect Musk in NHTSA Probe of Tesla - TT\n\nIn addition to investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles, NHTSA has mandated that Tesla and other automakers using self-driving technology report crash data on vehicles, a requirement that Tesla has criticized and that watchdogs fear could be eliminated.\n\nThe staff reductions have come through a combination of firings, buyouts and layoffs. The agency noted in its statement that the Biden administration had expanded its payroll, suggesting the smaller staff was sufficient to carry out its mission.\n\n\u201cEven with these modest efficiencies, NHTSA is still considerably larger today than it was four years ago,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe have retained positions critical to the mission of saving lives, preventing injuries, and reducing economic costs due to road traffic crashes.\u201d\n\nWant more news?

Musk believes this could be a $10 trillion revenue opportunity as it replaces humans in repetitive and dangerous jobs.\n\nHumanoid robots also synergize with the large language models (LLMs) behind AI chatbots, which could dramatically increase their potential use cases. Tesla's management aims to produce several thousand Optimus robots this year, with an exponential ramp-up in production.\n\nHowever, while Tesla's Optimus project looks exciting, investors should take everything with a grain of salt. For starters, Tesla's leadership has a track record of overpromising and underdelivering. They have already admitted the staggering complexities in building this technology, suggesting that its training needs will be 10 times more than what's needed for its full self-driving program. It is also unclear if robots will be a more efficient labor source than low-wage workers in developing countries.\n\nOverall, investors should consider Tesla's Optimus program an experimental project instead of a core growth driver for the company.\n\nReinventing the automotive business\n\nOn the surface, Tesla's automotive business is fantastic. In 2024, the company sold a whopping 1.77 million vehicles, making it the second largest EV maker. Its Model Y is the best-selling car in the world. And its Cybertruck is America's best-selling electric pickup truck (with 38,965 units sold) despite its polarizing design and $80,000 price tag.\n\nHowever, there is one big problem: growth. Tesla's fourth-quarter revenue increased by only 2% year over year to $25.2 billion because of an 8% decline in automotive revenue. And while the company's other business segments, like energy generation and storage, helped prop up the top line, operating income dropped 23% to $1.58 billion.\n\nThe EV industry is becoming more competitive, especially in the key Chinese market. This is a significant threat for Tesla because it doesn't want to become just another low-margin automaker. Over the coming decade, self-driving cars may be the key to boosting profitability.\n\nAnalysts at McKinsey expect autonomous driving to be a $300 billion to $400 billion revenue opportunity by 2035. Tesla has an advantage because of the vast amounts of data generated by its cars already on the road. The company has also developed a supercomputer called Dojo, which is designed to process this data and assist with computer vision. In ten years, autonomous-driving-related software-as-a-service (SaaS) could become a significant part of Tesla's business model and boost its margins.\n\nIs Tesla stock a buy, sell, or hold?\n\nThe next decade could see massive shifts as new technologies like AI, robotics, and self-driving cars become mainstream. Tesla's shareholders benefit from having a visionary leader like Elon Musk guide the company in these crucial years. And the company is on track to establish itself in high-value software and service opportunities.\n\nHowever, while Tesla deserves a premium over less inspiring alternatives in the automotive industry, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 119 seems to already price in years of growth, so shares look more like a hold than a buy until more information becomes available.",

            "content": "\u201cLucky me,\u201d I thought as I navigated the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 into the last spot of a Tesla Supercharging station in Palm Springs.\n\nThe EV didn\u2019t really need any juice. But this refreshed compact all-electric SUV comes equipped with Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard port; it was time to test out how well Hyundai would match up with the Tesla Supercharging network.\n\nThe experience exposed a gap \u2014 in the literal sense. And while Hyundai shouldn\u2019t shoulder all the blame, it did illustrate how a seemingly good idea doesn\u2019t always translate in the real world.\n\nFor example, I reversed into the parking spot, opened the charge port on the passenger-rear quarter panel, and grabbed the charging cord, nestled in the cabinet sitting all the way over on the driver\u2019s side of the car.\n\nUh, Hyundai, we have a problem. It didn\u2019t reach.\n\nI could wait for another Tesla to vacate its space and use that charging cable, essentially taking up two spaces, or I could use the in-car navigation to find a CCS-equipped charging station and use the adapter that comes with the car.\n\nI chose to toddle on with my day as I had plenty of battery, but others might not be so lucky.\n\nImage Credits:hyundai\n\nCCS, or Combined Charging System, was the standard in North America and used by every automaker except for Tesla, which developed its own port and charging station called the North American Charging Standard, or NACS.\n\nAutomakers began to shift to NACS in May 2023 after Ford reached an agreement that would give owners of its EV access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. GM followed and within six months nearly every automaker had struck a similar deal with Tesla. Access would initially be accomplished with a Tesla adapter, but most of these automakers \u2014 Hyundai and Kia included \u2014 also agreed to integrate the NACS charging tech into their future EVs.\n\nThe 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is one of these.\n\nOf course, not all of this is Hyundai\u2019s fault. The Ioniq 5 has always had its charging port on the rear passenger side, and moving it would be a spendy proposition. And Tesla says the problem should be solved with the rollout of its V4 charging stations with longer cables, although its website says, \u201cwe encourage all vehicle manufacturers to standardize charge port locations to the rear driver side or front passenger side.\u201d\n\nBuyers of the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 will have better luck finding a CCS station and using the adapter. Hyundai says the Ioniq 5 can go from 10% to 80% of charge in about 20 minutes at a CCS charger. The same fill-up will cost you up to 30 minutes at an NACS charger.\n\nHyundai makes it a bit easier with your choice of a $400 charging credit or a free ChargePoint home charger with the purchase of an Ioniq 5 and those with an older Hyundai EV with a native CCS port can get a free NACS adapter through the MyHyundai owner portal starting in March.\n\nHyundai owners will also have access to the planned Ionna charging network. The Ionna network, which is expected to have 30,000 NACS and CCS charging points by 2030, is a collaboration between BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Stellantis, and Toyota.\n\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5: Bigger batteries, more range, new trim\n\nThe 2025 Ioniq 5, which will come in SE, SEL, XRT, and Limited trims in rear- or all-wheel drive, may look like its previous model years. But there are some key differences, starting with the battery size.\n\nThe standard range battery ratchets up 5 kWh to 63 kWh, while the extended range sits at 84 kWh, an increase of 6.6 kWh. Depending on the combination of drivetrain, battery, and trim, expect to see 245 miles of range on the low end and up to 318 miles of range for a rear-wheel-drive Ioniq 5 with the larger battery.\n\nPower output varies, too, starting with 168 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, growing to 225 ponies in the extended range battery. The most powerful setup settles in at 320 horsepower and 446 pound-feet of torque for all-wheel-drive cars with the bigger battery.\n\nTech upgrades\n\nImage Credits:hyundai\n\nThe 2025 Ioniq 5 has some new parlor tricks too.\n\nThe digital key function now works with your phone inside a pocket or purse, a nice upgrade for when you\u2019re juggling kids, groceries, and a drink.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are now wireless and all models have over-the-air updates.\n\nAdditionally, Hyundai Pay allows owners to add their credit card to the infotainment system to pay for reserved off-street parking automatically. Drivers also get updated blind-spot collision avoidance and parking assistance.\n\nLet\u2019s get dirty\n\nImage Credits:Hyundai\n\nFor those wanting a bit more adventure with their electric SUV, the Ioniq 5 now comes in the XRT trim.\n\nThis model is designed for venturing off the path just a bit thanks to a one-inch lift and 29-inch Continental CrossContact ATR tires for better performance in the dirt and over gravel. This model also gets a Terrain button on the steering wheel that offers up modes for Snow, Mud, and Sand.\n\nHyundai let me loose on a fun dirt loop and I found that the car has enough playfulness in it to induce a grin. Sand mode doesn\u2019t turn the traction control all the way off \u2014 you have to manually push the traction control button to do that. It does adjust the brake regen properties so the vehicle doesn\u2019t automatically start to slow down when you lift. It also splits the torque 50/50 for optimal traction.\n\nIt\u2019s fun to toss it into corners and get a little slidey, but the ABS system \u2014 while great on pavement \u2014 can interfere with traction and off-road stopping distances by not allowing any dirt to build up in front of the tire.\n\nImage Credits:Emme Hall\n\nIt would be great if the drive modes also tweaked this system. Still, the instant electric torque means it\u2019s easy to get on the throttle and power out of a turn and scream toward the next one, slinging dirt rooster tails in the process.\n\nThe XRT is not some kind of rock crawler. The total ground clearance is only seven inches \u2014 that\u2019s two inches less than a Subaru Forester Wilderness. The off-road geometry, while better than the Toyota RAV4 Woodland Edition, is meant more for small obstacles and undulations.\n\nI found the limit of the 19.8-degree approach angle on my drive and returned with part of the XRT-exclusive front fascia tworked just a bit. There isn\u2019t any special underbody protection for the battery in the XRT, but the departure angle is a healthy 30 degrees and the car comes equipped with two front tow hooks.\n\nWhere the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 shines\n\nImage Credits:Hyundai\n\nOn the pavement, the Ioniq 5 is just as enjoyable as it ever was, with zippy acceleration, well-balanced handling, and a comfortable ride.\n\nPart of my first drive took me to higher elevations where the all-season tires were put to the slushy snow test. The car never lost grip, inspiring confidence in this desert dweller.\n\nThe 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 starts at $43,975, including the destination fee for a base SE model in rear-wheel drive with the standard battery. The off-roady XRT can be had for $56,875 while a top Limited trim in all-wheel drive will set you back $59,575.\n\nYou can get a Ford Mustang Mach-E at a lower starting price and comparable range, and all Mach-E cars are standard equipped with the hands-free/eyes-up BlueCruise highway driving assist. You\u2019ll pay a subscription fee to use the technology, but Hyundai doesn\u2019t offer anything like it.\n\nIf you\u2019re into futuristic looks, the Kia EV6 is a worthy competitor, especially if you\u2019re looking for performance. The GT AWD trim nets 576 ponies and 545 pound-feet of torque. Yowza.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to find fault with the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5. This refreshed Ioniq 5 maintains its pavement poise and adds a bit of adventure thrills with the new XRT trim. But owners may find themselves avoiding Tesla Superchargers despite that integrated NACS port.",

But Tesla wants to go it alone.\n\nUber partners with Waymo in Austin and will compete with Tesla's autonomous vehicle platform.\n\nAnalysts suggest Tesla may need Uber or Lyft to scale its robotaxi operations.\n\nUber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, said he wants to work with Tesla on robotaxis \u2014 even though the electric vehicle maker isn't interested.\n\nSpeaking at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Miami on Friday, Khosrowshahi said he has discussed the topic with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\n\"I've had conversations with him. At this point, they want to build it alone,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"Life is long, but we would love to partner with them.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi added that Uber and Alphabet-owned Waymo, who partner in Austin, will compete with Tesla in the autonomous vehicles market when they launch in the city.\n\nMusk has long envisioned forming a standalone network of autonomous Teslas that would compete with ride-hailing companies like Uber.\n\nEarlier this month, Uber said it was opening an \"interest list\" for Austin users who want to be the first to try Waymo robotaxis on the Uber app. Tesla unveiled its robotaxis, called Cybercabs, in October. They are expected to launch in June in Austin.\n\nKhosrowshahi's Friday remarks came about a week after he said that he hoped Tesla would work with Uber.\n\nIn an interview published on February 14, Khosrowshahi said, \"No one wants to compete against Tesla or Elon, if you can help it.\"\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDoor open for Tesla\n\nMusk has previously said Tesla would create its own ride-hailing platform \u2014 a cross between Uber and Airbnb apps \u2014 for riders to call a driverless car. While a portion of the fleet would be owned by Tesla, individual Tesla customers would also have the option to add their vehicles.\n\nDespite these plans, Khosrowshahi's Friday remarks suggested he was willing to keep the door open for a partnership with Tesla.\n\n\"It makes a lot of economic sense\" for Tesla drivers to use Uber as a platform, he said. \"What we bring is demand to the AV ecosystem when demand often is quite variable.\"\n\nAnalysts have stressed this, too.\n\nIn a note published on the day the Cybercab was unveiled, Jefferies analysts wrote that Tesla may struggle without a partner like Uber or Lyft.\n\nTesla \"potentially underappreciates the obstacles to scaling a robotaxi fleet\" such as the technology, asset ownership, regulation, fleet management, and demand required to run an operation at scale, the analysts wrote. \"We also believe TSLA could struggle to scale fleet operations without offering access to demand via Uber/Lyft.\"\n\nIndependent analyst Dan O'Dowd, a previous Musk critic, said that the contrast between Tesla and robotaxi competitors like Waymo was \"stark.\"\n\n\"Until Tesla robotaxis are transporting 100,000 paying customers a week around major American cities like Waymo does, Tesla robotaxi is nothing more than the latest work of fiction to come out of the Warner Bros. Studio,\" he said in a note at the time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nInvestor pressure\n\nUber has faced pressure from investors to ramp up its autonomous vehicle strategy, and shareholders have been closely monitoring developments with self-driving competitors.\n\nIn December, Uber's stock plunged 10% after Waymo announced its expansion to Miami \u2014 without mentioning Uber.\n\nIn some cities, like Austin, Phoenix, and Atlanta, Waymo rides are only available on the Uber app. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, Waymo is available on its own booking platform.\n\nDays after the Waymo expansion news, Uber's stock fell nearly 6% when its AV partner, Cruise, announced it was shutting down operations.\n\nFollowing the Cruise news, the ride-hailing platform's chief financial officer, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, tried to quell investor concerns. He said the company was well positioned to be a demand aggregator for AVs and that it still believes AVs are critical for its growth.\n\nBesides Waymo, Uber has self-driving partnerships with Tesla's biggest competitor, Chinese EV maker BYD, and with AV company Aurora Innovation.\n\nUber's stock is up over 30% so far this year.",

            "content": "I'm becoming more optimistic about EV battery longevity. Research shows batteries rarely fail, and most of what I've seen has convinced me that battery degradation is not a major concern over the typical lifespan of a vehicle. But Out Of Spec's testing on this 250,000-mile Tesla Model S is tempering my expectations. First, we saw that the car doesn't go nearly as far as it once did. Now, we're seeing that it takes much longer to charge, too.\n\nRyan from Out Of Spec did a full 0-100% charging test on a high-mileage, 2019 Tesla Model S standard range. And boy, did it take a while. Going from fully flat to fully charged took a whopping 2 hours and 41 minutes. That sounds awful. But don't give up on high-mileage EVs just yet, as the nuanced version is a lot less dire than the top-line number.\n\nWell over half of that time was just spent getting the Model S from 80-100%. If you know about batteries, that shouldn't surprise you. They take far longer to fill the closer they get to 100%, as free electrons struggle to find open spaces in the battery to park themselves. That process gets harder as batteries degrade, and harder still if the battery is not properly calibrated and balanced.\n\nThat, in fact, explains most of the last hour of charging. Ryan reports that the car's Battery Management System was off, and had to recalibrate itself and balance the cells. That makes sense: These systems eventually need to be rebalanced, and while many do it automatically, it can only happen under certain conditions. I don't think the last 10% of this charging curve would be this bad if the test was repeated, though it would still likely be plenty slow.\n\nWe never recommend charging to 100% for this reason. That's why charge times are typically quoted as 10-80% time. That represents the meat of your battery's charging curve, and what you're likely to use on road trips and the like. The Tesla Model S charged from 10-80% in about 47 minutes, which really isn't too terrible. I can't find what the rate was when new, as this wasn't a popular model. But while 47 minutes is bad, it's in the realm of a Chevy Bolt or similar, and since this car was purchased for around $10,000 after factoring in the used vehicle tax credit, that ain't too shabby.\n\nIts peak rate of 131 kW is also quite solid for the age, even if it tapers quickly. That means a car like this would be better off for frequent, short stops at a low state of charge than 45 minute stops. That's generally the best road trip strategy in an EV anyway.\n\nStill, it's not a great performance. I'm still hopeful that most packs will fare better than this, as we've seen far higher-mileage Teslas with less degradation. Plus, batteries are improving every year, and today's units are likely more robust than the base-model Model S' pack from six years ago. But it's a reminder that reliability beyond 200,000 miles is never guaranteed. Just ask my 25-year-old 230,000-mile gas truck, which has already needed a new transmission, new radiator, new coolant lines, new transmission and countless other little things. It's a cruel world out there, and it isn't nice to cars.\n\nContact the author: Mack.hogan@insideevs.com.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

The lighter weight of the single motor contributes to the boost in efficiency \u2013 up 46 miles from the 390 mile range in the Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive car.\n\nBut while the driving range in the new Model 3 has gone up, the price has gone down \u2013 the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive Model 3 will cost \u00a344,990, a \u00a35,000 saving over the all-wheel drive model which remains on sale.\n\nThe new Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive car is also the most efficient Tesla built to date, managing an impressive 4.97m/kWh. That means on a smart energy tariff like E.ON Next Drive when you can charge at just 6.7p per kWh between the hours of midnight and 7am, the cost per 100 miles of travel will be just \u00a31.35.\n\nTesla claims that makes the new car the most efficient EV available in Europe today, saying that the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive will travel for a full kilometre using the same amount of energy it takes to heat a frozen meal in a microwave.\n\nThe latest edition to the Model 3 range benefits from all the upgrades that came into effect with the Model 3 earlier this year with revised styling, better quality in the cabin, improved sound deadening and work to improve ride quality. It also comes with the standard nine-speaker audio system, a second eight-inch display in the back for rear-seat passengers to control climate and entertainment settings, and heated seats in the front and back of the car.\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 is currently our favourite EV on sale in the UK (Tesla)\n\nThe Model 3 line-up now comprises the entry-level Rear-Wheel Drive model at \u00a339,990 with 318-miles of range, the new Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive at \u00a344,990 with a 436-mile range, the Long Range All-Wheel Drive car at \u00a344,990 that will go 390 miles and the Performance All-Wheel Drive car at \u00a359,990 with a 328-mile range and 0-60mph time of 2.9 seconds.\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 currently sits at the top of The Independent\u2019s list of best electric cars.",

            "content": "Join us for a tour of the Model Y Juniper to see what has changed compared to the outgoing model\n\nWith the Tesla Model Y holding its ground as one of the world\u2019s top-selling vehicles across all powertrains, the 2026 update has understandably become one of the most anticipated launches of the year. The facelifted Model Y introduces a range of exterior, interior, and chassis upgrades, promising to refine the world\u2019s best-selling EV. With deliveries of the refreshed model just beginning, we recently visited a Tesla dealership in Greece for a closer look at the changes.\n\nThe Model Y\u2019s so-called \u201cJuniper\u201d update that follows the \u201cHighlander\u201d revisions for the Model 3, was revealed last month. As expected, the first cars have already hit dealerships worldwide, and some have even started offering demo drives to potential buyers. While our own test drive is still a few weeks away, we managed to park the refreshed Model Y next to its predecessor for a side-by-side comparison.\n\nSharper Front and Subtle Tweaks\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: even hardcore Tesla fans have to admit that the original Model Y was a bit of an awkward sibling to the Model 3. Sure, the rear design worked for a crossover, but that roofline was questionable, and the front end was more \u201cneeds improvement\u201d than \u201cwow.\u201d It took time to warm up to it\u2014if you ever did.\n\nMore: Tesla Rolls Out Standard 2026 Model Y Range In Europe, Cuts Prices By Up To $2,100\n\nNow, hot take alert: despite the endless complaints online about the Cybertruck-inspired front light bar, in person, it actually works.\n\nThe Juniper update ditches the awkward duck-face bumper and replaces it with a fresh pair of split headlights that are noticeably different from the Model 3 Highland\u2019s setup. The full-width LED bar at the front brings some Cybercab and Cybertruck vibes but, thankfully, without the latter\u2019s jagged edges or those comically bad panel gaps.\n\nThe main headlights are now mounted lower, flanking the revised front bumper with taller side intakes. These tweaks contribute to improved aerodynamics (0.22 drag coefficient vs. 0.23 in the previous model), which should, in theory, boost range\u2014though the battery options remain unchanged.\n\nWhile the profile largely stays the same, you\u2019ll notice new mirror caps and the more striking design of the 19-inch Crossflow wheels (those are standard on the pictured Launch Series Dual Motor). They look far more appealing than the old 20-inch Helix 2.0 wheels, at least to our eyes.\n\nAs for the color palette, the Model Y now comes in Stealth Gray, Pearl White Multi-Coat, Quicksilver, Ultra Red, and Glacier Blue. But if you\u2019re in the market outside of Europe, your options may differ.\n\nMore: Should Tesla Give The Model 3 A Juniper Update?\n\nBack-End Changes: LED Afterburners\n\nMoving to the rear, the standout feature is the \u201cindirect reflective body panel taillight.\u201d It\u2019s sleek and far less generic than the previous design, with a glowing LED strip under the dark-tinted cluster that creates a visible \u201cafterburner\u201d effect when driving in the dark.\n\nThe Tesla lettering continues the sci-fi theme, replacing the traditional \u201cT\u201d emblem, which is now only found on the wheels. Interestingly, in most markets outside China, the updated Model Y doesn\u2019t carry a badge on its nose, with Tesla confident that its distinctive styling will be enough for people to recognize it.\n\nLastly, the tailgate features a cleaner design, reminiscent of the Tesla Cybercab, and extends all the way to the more prominent rear bumper, reducing panel gaps. As a result, the length of the crossover has increased by 41 mm (1.6 inches), bringing it to 4,792 mm (188.7 inches). However, the size difference is so subtle that it\u2019s practically undetectable to the naked eye.\n\nYou\u2019ll also notice that the tailgate is now split into two pieces. While this may disrupt the visual flow slightly, it\u2019s a practical change\u2014if damaged, the split design makes it cheaper and easier to replace.\n\nInterior: Better Materials, More Screens, Same Tesla\n\nAt first glance, the interior of the updated Model Y still feels very much like the old one, but take a closer look, and you\u2019ll notice the details have been improved. The materials are slightly more refined, though you\u2019d need a keen eye (or an obsessive Tesla fan) to catch the difference.\n\nThe biggest updates are lifted straight from the Model 3 Highland, including the redesigned steering wheel, a new ambient lighting strip around the cockpit, new dashboard inserts, and\u2014finally\u2014ventilated front seats. Tesla has also reworked the center console and the (larger) door cards, though, in typical Tesla fashion, the overall functionality remains largely unchanged.\n\nMore: Tesla Suing Customers And Journalists To Silence Critical Reviews, And It\u2019s Winning, Report Finds\n\nTesla also made the curious (though not entirely surprising) choice to move the drive controls to the touchscreen, ditching the steering-wheel-mounted gear selector. On the bright side, they\u2019ve kept the turn signal stalk, an obvious win compared to the Model 3\u2019s touch-button alternatives. That said, the stalk itself now has a shorter throw than before.\n\nIn both the old and the new Model Y, all functions are still controlled via the 15.4-inch central display, and yes, Tesla continues to stubbornly avoid adding physical buttons, an instrument cluster, or a head-up display. These features are standard in most other cars, but Tesla\u2019s sticking to its guns here.\n\nThe 2026 Model Y also gets a blind spot indicator, but in true Tesla cost-cutting fashion, it\u2019s just a tiny single-pixel light in the corner of the window, rather than the more conventional mirror-mounted indicator most other automakers use.\n\nThose sitting at the back will notice the addition of a new 8-inch display giving them access to temperature control and media, although its position is far from ideal for watching movies. More importantly, the rear seats are noticeably more comfortable, now offering additional reclining positions.\n\nRear visibility remains extremely poor, although the sensors and the live-view of the surroundings on the touchscreens supposedly make up for it.\n\nThe boot appears unchanged, but the Model Y Juniper now includes a button that electronically folds and unfolds the rear seat back, making it easier to transport larger items. These adjustments are controlled electronically and even move the front seats forward if they\u2019re unoccupied. Additionally, the frunk now comes with a drain plug, a feature that was absent in the previous Model Y, clearly inspired by its Ford Mustang Mach-E rival.\n\nReworked Chassis And Carry-Over Powertrains\n\nTesla hasn\u2019t made any changes to the electric motors or battery packs in the standard models (we\u2019re still waiting for the Performance trim, which should bring more power, among other upgrades). The Model Y (depending on the market) is still available in RWD, Long Range RWD, Long Range AWD, and the upcoming Performance version.\n\nMore: Jay Leno Drives 2026 Tesla Model Y, Performance Trim Coming Soon\n\n2026 Tesla Model Y\n\nThanks to improvements in aerodynamics, tires, and brakes, the Model Y Juniper sees a modest increase in range (EPA-estimated up to 320 miles / 515 km) and also appears to be slightly quicker than its predecessor in equivalent trims\u2014at least on paper.\n\nThe real news here is the reworked suspension, which is said to improve ride quality and reduce NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness), especially in combination with the new acoustic glass and quieter tires. We couldn\u2019t take it out for a spin at the time we visited the showroom, but considering the previous Model Y\u2019s rough ride on poorly maintained roads, there\u2019s definitely room for improvement here.\n\nVerdict\n\nAfter spending some time with the 2026 Model Y, it\u2019s clear Tesla\u2019s designers and engineers approached this mid-cycle update with caution. They\u2019ve addressed some of the weak spots in the previous model while keeping the core character of the car largely intact. And with fierce competition coming from China, it\u2019s no surprise they didn\u2019t want to rock the boat too much.\n\nThe Model Y Juniper features sharper styling and a more refined cabin, with a range of small upgrades that collectively enhance the overall experience. It\u2019s also more efficient and marginally quicker than its predecessor, which are key factors that should resonate with mainstream buyers. The one remaining piece of the puzzle is the reworked chassis, which could address the most significant flaw of the outgoing model: its ride quality. We\u2019re eager to see how it performs on the road, and we\u2019ll share our full verdict in a more detailed review soon.\n\nUntil then, check out the visual comparison in the video and let us know which generation of the Model Y you prefer based on looks. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how the launch of the updated electric crossover affects Tesla\u2019s sales this year, and whether its popularity will be influenced by the growing controversies surrounding the brand\u2019s CEO.\n\nPhotos and Videos: Thanos Pappas for CarScoops",

The loss of power may require drivers to assert more control over the wheel, especially at lower speeds, increasing the risk of a crash, the agency added.\n\nTesla did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nTesla has released an over-the-air software update, free of charge and announced owners of the recalled vehicles will receive a letter in the mail with more information in coming weeks, the NHTSA said.\n\nThe recall comes amid several ongoing probes into Tesla by the NHTSA.\n\nIn 2023, the NHTSA launched a probe into more than 280,000 Teslas over reports of steering issues. Last year, the agency opened a probe into more than 2.6 million Teslas after reports of several crashes while using the cars' self-driving feature. And last month, the federal agency began probing Tesla's \"actually smart summon\" feature equipped on 2.6 million Tesla vehicles in the United States. The feature allows drivers to retrieve their Model Y vehicles from parking lots through the Tesla mobile app.\n\nThe federal probes into Tesla come several weeks after the White House named Musk \u2014 who helms X, SpaceX, brain computer implant company Neuralink and Ai company xAI in addition to Tesla \u2014 to lead Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The agency, previously known as the U.S. Digital Service, has been slashing the federal workforce and government programs at unprecedented speeds in recent weeks.\n\nMusk's appointment to head the agency and his designation as a \"special government employee\" \u2014 which circumvents him from undergoing more onerous vetting requirements typical of full-time government employees \u2014 has raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Musk pushed back on the concerns earlier this month, with Trump telling reporters in the Oval Office: \u201cElon can\u2019t do and won\u2019t do anything without our approval, and we\u2019ll give him the approval where appropriate; where not appropriate, we won\u2019t.\"\n\nOn Thursday, The Washington Post reported that a team of NHTSA regulators who oversee the safety of autonomous cars was facing staffing cuts ordered by the Musk-led DOGE.\n\nA spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately return a request for comment regarding the reported cuts to the NHTSA and Musk's possible conflicts of interest.",

            "content": "Before he was CEO of Lucid Motors, Peter Rawlinson was the Chief Engineer of arguably the most important electric car ever: The Tesla Model S. While at the Goodwood Festival of Speed this past summer, my colleague Matt and I had a chance to chat with Rawlinson, and this story he told us about how a seatbelt packaging problem led to the Tesla Model S\u2019s battery pack voltage is absolute gold.\n\nI\u2019ve said it before: If I were allowed to have a favorite car company, right now it would be Lucid. As an engineer obsessed with optimizing (I could have just said \u201cas an engineer\u201d), I find Lucid\u2019s mission of building vehicles that maximize miles per kilowatt hour (i.e. that can travel farther on a smaller, lighter, cheaper battery) to fit in perfectly in with everything I believe in. Lucid is taking the hard route. The company is not relying heavily on styling or horsepower or marketing \u2014 it\u2019s putting in the work necessary to downsize drive units, consolidate multiple components into single assemblies, dial in aerodynamics, and ultimately squeeze as many miles as possible out of every last cell in the battery pack.\n\nRawlinson talked all about his company\u2019s philosophy in our interview, but this article isn\u2019t about that: This article is about the engineering legend\u2019s previous job at Tesla, and details how a packaging challenge related to a seatbelt pull-test drove the design of the original Tesla Model S\u2019s battery pack. It\u2019s fascinating stuff.\n\nI start this bit of the interview by asking Rawlinson to point out some examples of designs he and his team had to create from scratch. It\u2019s been over a dozen years since the debut of the Tesla Model S, so we\u2019ve all become used to a number of EV attributes: The battery packs are flat, structural parts of the vehicle body; the drive modules contain a motor, inverter, and ~10:1 gear reduction; a heat pump offers improved efficiency in the winter, and on and on. These are engineering attributes of EVs that we\u2019re now well acquainted with today, but back when the Tesla Model S was under development 15+ years ago, some of this wasn\u2019t obvious. So I was curious to hear some engineering firsts that Tesla had to just\u2026 figure out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRawlinson discussed the drive module design (with integrated inverter) and a few other innovations, but the story about the seatbelt and how it drove the architecture (and thus voltage!) of the original Tesla Model S\u2019s battery pack.\n\n\u201cI can give you a little example,\u201d Rawlinson replied to my question about engineer-firsts. \u201cWe wanted to have a flat floor in Model S\u2026but in order to make the seat belt pull test work \u2014 you know, you can have a pull of an elephant\u2026 through the seat belt mounts \u2014 if you put that into a flat diaphragm, it\u2019s not going to be strong enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we wanted it perfectly flat without a cross member, so the only place we could put a cross member was through the battery pack and actually use the cross member of the battery pack, which is underneath the floor and through-bolt it and take the seat belt loads through this.\u201d\n\nRawlinson went on to describe how the passenger\u2019s H-point (the location of the hip of the seated driver) was determined based on styling and safety considerations.\n\n\u201cWe had a predetermined style and actually have quite a long hood and a very swept-back windshield on Model S, and that drove the H-point of the driver relatively far back because it was a very traditionally style vehicle,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that actually meant that we had to move the B puller back further than we\u2019d like. And it made for a very small door aperture and a very compromised rear seating position because it had been styled around the traditional long hood. We also couldn\u2019t put the driver too far forward because in an unbuckled crash situation, you have a neck breaker because the head would rise and hit the windshield and it was a snapped neck.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSo and then there was an ingress-egress issue for the A pillar \u2014 so all these things considered, we did trajectory modeling on the computer for the mannequin in crash and we looked that with ingress-egress ergonomic modeling and determined the H-point. And from that we could determine where the anchor points for the seatbelt would be. And that would have to go right through the battery pack.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember laying this out and actually I got a printout and I was doing it [by hand] and there was this Damascus moment when I realized, actually, if we divided the rocker length into seven bays, I could get a crossmember bang where I needed the seat belt. And it was one-seventh. And I thought that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve got to have seven battery modules in the rocker length to make this seat belt pull test work.\u201d\n\nThe crossmember pointed out above was where the seatbelt would be mounted (see seatbelt below), but because it was so flat, it needed to be stiffened; this would be done by bolting that crossmember to a stiff crossmember in the battery pack below.\n\n\u201cWe could architect the battery around those seven bays. So then you look at the hexagon fill and we use 18650 cells. And I\u2019m looking at thermal runaway and how much spacing we can have with it between the cells, to the 10th of a millimeter optimizing it. And then I\u2019m looking at the practicality of how we\u2019re going to do the ultrasonic wire bond of those.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou can see the seven bays of the battery pack below. Notice the two thicker crossmembers that line up with the two crossmembers in the body (shown above). Those crossmembers are what the seat (and thus seatbelt) fasten to.\n\n\u201cSo I start laying out cell blocks within the seven bays. And we find that we can get 900 cells in each of those bays. But we need to split it into two because of the way the architecture was configured. So that meant the module was down to 450 cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re able to do that, split it 75 in parallel, six in series, and that way then by adding two extra modules in the front, which was just enough space to allow for wheel drive in the future, we had seven modules plus seven, that\u2019s 14, two in the front that\u2019s 16, each with a series count of six, and that led to 96 series count and that determined the voltage that Model S ran at.\u201d\n\nBelow you can see the modules that fit into the seven bays above, including the ultrasonic wire bonding connecting them all together:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe voltage,\u201d Rawlinson concluded, \u201cemanated from the seat belt port anchor structure requirement.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s Look At The Patent Drawings\n\nTo summarize: Because of that seatbelt pull test, Tesla had to put its seat belt crossmember in a certain location, and in order to divide the battery pack (which had a certain length) into roughly equal sections, the battery pack had to be split into seven \u201cbays.\u201d Divide those up the middle and add the two up front just aft of the steering gear (between the front two wheels) and you end up with 16 modules.\n\nWith each module having six groups (of parallel cells) in series, you\u2019ve got a total of 96 groups in series. Since groups of parallel cells all have the same voltage as a single cell (roughly 3.7 volts), the battery pack has 96 groups*3.7 volts per group = about 360 volts.\n\nThat\u2019s how the Tesla Model S\u2019s voltage was determined. By a seatbelt. Amazing stuff!\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the patent. Here\u2019s the abstract:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA vehicle seat mounting assembly is provided in which the seat mounts are attached to body cross-members that are, in turn, mechanically coupled to battery pack cross-members contained within a battery pack enclosure mounted under the vehicle.\n\nThe seat (and thus seatbelt) is mounted to the body, which the battery pack (which itself contains crossmembers) mounts to via some bolts. You can see the bolt holes in the pack in figure 1. below.\n\nNumber 503 in the image above points out all the holes in the battery pack that allow a bolt to go through the pack and into the body crossmembers on which the seats (and thus seatbelts) mount:\n\nHere\u2019s a close look at the crossmembers in question; you can see that the battery pack crossmembers 601D and 601E line up with body crossmembers on which the seat (and thus belt) mount.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou can see the seat rails, 1105, in the image below, sitting on the body crossmembers (1101 and 1102), which sit just above the battery crossmembers 601D and 601E shown above:\n\n(Note: the intro part of this article mentioned just a single crossmember (the rear one) presumably because the one that took the seatbelt loads had to be set in a certain location, and the second crossmember (the front one) could be adjusted to go anywhere by just changing the seat rail length).\n\nHere\u2019s a nice cross-sectional view showing a bolt (1209) coming up from the bottom, through the battery pack, and threading into a weld-nut in a crossmember. 1213 is what the seat rail mounts to from above:\n\nHere\u2019s another view, but this time showing the seat rail (1105):\n\nHere you can actually see the crossmember inside the battery pack; you\u2019ll notice there\u2019s an upper member (1201) and a lower member (1203):\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhy the two members? Well, per the patent:\n\nThe use of upper and lower members for each of the battery pack cross-members 601A-601H provides a convenient means for holding the battery modules in place, specifically by capturing the module mounting flanges 801 within region 1407 during battery pack assembly.\n\nIt\u2019s just fascinating, behind-the-scenes stuff from one of the world\u2019s most talented engineers: The Tesla Model S\u2019s battery design was hugely determined by a seat belt requirement.

The proposal envisions a consortium of investors, with Tesla as the largest backer, but also includes the possibility of a minority investment by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. to prevent a full takeover by the Apple supplier, the report said.\n\nNissan\u2019s shares jumped more than 12% on the news of the potential investment, before closing 9.5% higher in Tokyo.\n\nNissan has found itself in need of a lifeline once again after a deal with Honda Motor Co. to combine both brands under a single holding company formally ended earlier this month. While Nissan is now on the hunt for a new partner \u2014 CEO Makoto Uchida has said it would be difficult to survive without one \u2014 the idea of a tie up with Tesla was met with skepticism from industry watchers.\n\nThe Tesla factory IS the product.\n\n\n\nThe Cybercab production line is like nothing else in the automotive industry. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 21, 2025\n\nThat\u2019s partly due to Tesla\u2019s own struggles as EV demand slows: Last month it reported a drop in annual sales for the first time in more than a decade, and it has cut more than 10% of its workforce. But buying a stake in another carmaker would be a notable change from its usual investments, which focus on businesses that support its high-tech EV ambitions.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear which Nissan assets would be a draw. The automaker has three plants in the U.S. and has previously warned it may slow a planned ramp-up of EV production at its facility in Canton, Miss., due to uncertainties about energy and trade policies under Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cFor Tesla, it\u2019s difficult to think there are any merits in buying Nissan,\u201d said Yasuhiko Hirakawa, head of investment at Rakuten Investment Management Inc. \u201cIt obviously has no need for legacy assets like engines and assembly lines. It\u2019s difficult to imagine something Tesla needs that Nissan can offer.\u201d\n\nThe proposal is being led by Hiromichi Mizuno, former chief investment officer of the Japan\u2019s Government Investment Fund, who was on Tesla\u2019s board as an independent director from 2020 to 2023, the FT reported. The push is also said to be supported by ex-Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, it said.\n\nA Nissan spokesperson declined to comment on the report. Tesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Mizuno and a representative for Hon Hai didn\u2019t immediately respond. Suga\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk responded to the report on X, his social media platform, saying the \u201cCybercab production line is like nothing else in the automotive industry.\u201d\n\nThe fallout of the scrapped deal with Honda has been especially pointed for Nissan, which has suffered from weak sales, overcapacity, an outdated lineup of unpopular models and revolving-door leadership since the 2018 ouster of Carlos Ghosn.\n\nBut despite Nissan\u2019s challenges, its vast manufacturing operations and brand recognition are still enticing suitors.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nFoxconn, as Hon Hai is more commonly known, has expressed renewed interest in Nissan after the deal with Honda collapsed, and Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that KKR & Co. is weighing an investment in Nissan.\n\nThe carmaker continues to face risks from its restructure as well as the challenging geopolitical landscape. Moody\u2019s Ratings on Feb. 21 cut its credit rating to speculative-grade and maintained a negative rating outlook.\n\n\u201cWhoever the buyer is, Nissan\u2019s restructuring is unavoidable,\u201d said Rieko Otsuka, a strategist at MCP Asset Management Japan.",

And it\u2019s been heavily refreshed to keep it looking and feeling competitive with the avalanche of shiny new stuff from a growing army of competitors \u2013 especially China.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nWith the Y now being Tesla\u2019s staple and best-selling model, it needed a shot in the metaphorical arm to keep up with, if not ahead of, the game. Stats. We need some actual stats. Well, the Model Y sold 1.2 million units globally in 2023, was the best-selling car in Europe, sold 480k more units than in 2021 and 64 per cent more than in 2022, as well as being the best-seller in 160 other countries. That\u2019s big numbers, and testament to Tesla knowing what people actually want. But to stay on that kind of sales wave needed a product that keeps improving \u2013 staying still is death \u2013 and the Y has been around since 2020. That\u2019s impressive, but what has actually changed? Well, think of this as halfway between a heavy refresh and an all-new car. So you\u2019ve got exterior changes like new treatments for front and rear bumpers, new wheels and lights (including a cute rear lightbar that\u2019s actually viewed indirectly; it\u2019s tucked up and reflects off a surface on the back of the car) as well as interior tweaks and several engineering changes related to suspension and efficiency, plus aerodynamics. The motors, batteries and basic bits are pretty much the same as the outgoing \u2018legacy\u2019 Model Y though, with a gamut of efficiency and aero improvements accruing into solid gains for the car as a whole. But that isn\u2019t much of a problem anyway, as Tesla has always been at the better end of that side of things, and as a company it quietly improves bits \u2019n\u2019 bobs via over-the-air updates. A Tesla bought two years ago is usually not the same Tesla today.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nThe big news is really the slick new exterior look and the fact that the Model Y has addressed the criticisms of the old one, in that it was quite noisy and stiff-kneed. Part of that is a new die-cast rear floor, that culls the component count from 70 to\u2026 one. That\u2019s a good thing when it comes to strength and complexity, and bodes well for structure.\n\nWhat about the details? Well, the car we get first off will be the Long Range All-Wheel drive car with a 75kWh (usable) battery and Launch Edition badges. All the rage with new car releases. But the things you notice after a few minutes probably mean more. There\u2019s no badge on the nose \u2013 which makes it look clean, but also might fox those who aren\u2019t car-obsessive. There\u2019s a new front bumper. The camera on the front has migrated into the centre (there are the usual pair at the top of the windscreen) to help with forward autonomy sensing functions and things like remote-control Summon features. And that gets a washer jet for obvious reasons. But there\u2019s a rear bumper that sticks out more, likely so that it can act more like a bumper. The previous Y had a flat-faced bottom that sacrificed more than it should in even relatively light rear impacts. And the new tailgate has squarer glass and a couple more shutlines \u2013 again probably so that it doesn\u2019t all have to be replaced if knocked.\n\nThat\u2019s important stuff to repairers and insurers and parts suppliers. It could bring down the cost-to-repair and therefore leasing costs. Then there are various interior changes and spec tweaks. Head over to the Interior tab for more on that. But does it feel much different to drive? Bluntly, yes. The new Model Y is night and day better than the old one, and genuinely feels like a different car. More attention\u2019s been lavished on general rigidity, damping and springs, better isolation and noise reduction. So the Model Y is quieter and more forgiving \u2013 exactly what you need from a family car. It\u2019s not the most precise of things to drive, but it feels more luxurious and expensive; all because it rides with greater sophistication and clonks through potholes less, if at all. The steering is also better: not because it\u2019s laser-precise, but because it\u2019s progressive and calm, and the whole car brings no surprises. Again, reliable reactions and consistent grip is what owners will look for, rather than lairy oversteer or aggressive turn-in that makes a car feel \u2018sporty\u2019 but also puts your pets/children/jowls into compromising positions. But more of that in the Driving section. Want to know what the best electric cars are? Click here for the top 20\n\nWhat's the verdict? \u201c The new Model Y is quieter, more efficient, calmer to drive and nicer to be in \u201d\n\nA massive improvement to the Model Y from Tesla. It may have taken the company a while to react to the feedback, but they\u2019ve got there in the end. The new Model Y is quieter, more efficient, calmer to drive and nicer to be in. The only issue is that where it was a good distance from the competition, it\u2019s now just about keeping ahead of the curve, and the initial surprise and delight is gone. It might look better, but there\u2019s an element of placid androgeny to it now; it looks like a lot of other electric SUVs \u2013 and there\u2019s no badge on the front to tell you what it is. But there\u2019s still Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network to back up the ownership prospect, and buyers won\u2019t be disappointed with the hardware, or the experience. A decent evolution rather than the revolution that might be needed next time.",

            "content": "(Reuters) - A high-level Japanese group that includes a former prime minister has drawn up plans for Tesla to invest in Nissan after the collapse of its merger talks with Honda, the Financial Times said on Friday.\n\nA separate Nikkei newspaper report said Taiwan's Foxconn has proposed forming a partnership with Honda with an ultimate aim of creating a four-way framework that would also include Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors.\n\nThe Japanese group behind the plans for Tesla to invest in Nissan hopes the Elon Musk-led company will become a strategic investor, believing it is keen to acquire Nissan's plants in the United States, according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe proposal is being led by former Tesla board member Hiromichi Mizuno with support from ex-premier Yoshihide Suga and his former aide Hiroto Izumi, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources.\n\nSome analysts, however, are doubtful of Tesla's interest in acquiring U.S. plants, citing its ample capacity at existing factories and first decline in yearly deliveries in 2024.\n\nTesla said last month it expected the vehicle business to return to growth this year.\n\nSuga's office said it was not aware of a plan to encourage Tesla to invest in Nissan. Suga stood down as prime minister in 2021 but remains a member of Japan's lower house, representing a constituency in Nissan's home prefecture of Kanagawa.\n\nIn a social media post, Mizuno said he had \"absolutely no involvement\" in what was reported in the FT article, adding that he doubted if Tesla had any interest at all in Nissan factories given Tesla's unique factory design.\n\nNissan declined to comment on the report, while Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was not immediately able to contact Izumi.\n\nMatt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there was no value for Tesla in investing in infrastructure from a legacy carmaker.\n\n\"Tesla's secret weapon is the novel way its factories have been designed and optimised for its cars,\" Britzman said.\n\nNissan shares closed up 9.6% after the FT report. The automaker and Honda ended talks to forge a $60-billion car company last week. Nissan said it will seek new partnerships.\n\nAccording to the FT, some Nissan board members have suggested Tesla and Apple as ideal strategic investors.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAcquiring Nissan's U.S. plants might make sense considering President Donald Trump's plans to apply new tariffs on auto imports, and separate tariffs on Mexico and Canada, said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.",

ANGELA WEISS / AFP via Getty Images\n\nNot content with shaking up US politics, Elon Musk is on a mission to \"make Europe great again.\"\n\nHis interventions into the continent's politics come as Tesla sales plunge in Europe, falling 13% last year.\n\nSome of Tesla's rivals in Europe are now targeting owners put off by Musk's politics.\n\nAs Elon Musk wades into European politics, Tesla's sales across the continent are plummeting.\n\nThe EV maker's sales in Germany and France tanked in January, dropping 59% and 63% according to industry data.\n\nTesla's sales in the European Union fell 13% in 2024, as the automaker came under growing pressure in its third-largest market from rivals launching a wave of cheaper electric models.\n\nAnalysis from pricing consultancy Argus Media suggests the drop was most severe in major markets like Germany, France, and Italy.\n\nIn Germany, the hub of Europe's auto industry and the home of Tesla's Berlin gigafactory, Tesla sales fell by 41% last year, outstripping the 27% sales decline in the general battery EV market.\n\nTesla's woes come as wider EV sales dropped across Europe in 2024, driven by the end of key subsidies in several markets.\n\n\"The big picture is a shrinking EV market across Europe. But Tesla is shrinking faster than that, and in specific markets, it is outpacing that decline,\" Dylan Khoo, an analyst at Argus, told BI.\n\nStuttering sales\n\nWhile Tesla's sales in markets such as Belgium, Netherlands, and Sweden rose last year, the overall picture in Europe is less than rosy for the automaker \u2014 especially with many of its rivals rolling out their own mass-market electric vehicles.\n\nSwedish brand Volvo, owned by Chinese conglomerate Geely, saw its sales rise nearly 30% in the EU last year, driven by the popularity of its 36,000 euro ($40,000) EX30 electric crossover.\n\nRivals like Renault and BMW also saw their sales grow in Europe and the UK last year, with French firm Renault launching cheaper models including the baguette-holding R5.\n\nVolvo's EX30 is one of a number of cheaper EVs being rolled out by Tesla's rivals in Europe. Guillaume Payen/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nExperts told BI that an increasingly stale product lineup had hit Tesla's European business.\n\nThe automaker has not launched a new vehicle in Europe since the Model Y in 2021. Its most recent EV, the Cybertruck, is not available in the UK or Europe.\n\n\"It's looking a little bit samey,\" said Philip Nothard, Insight and Strategy Director at Cox Automotive.\n\nNothard added that Tesla was facing a more crowded EV market in Europe and coming under pressure from domestic rivals and insurgent Chinese carmakers, who have ambitious growth plans for Europe.\n\nBoth Khoo and Nothard said that the recently unveiled revamped Model Y will be key to turning around Tesla's fortunes in Europe.\n\nDeliveries of the updated SUV start later this year, and Tesla will be hoping the new Model Y will help the company bounce back after it recorded its first ever annual drop in sales in 2024.\n\nMusk takes on Europe\n\nTesla's difficulties in Europe come as CEO Elon Musk continues to shake up European politics.\n\nThe billionaire caused outrage among many in Germany with his endorsement of AfD, a right-wing political party. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz branded Musk's support of the \"extreme right\" as \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\nA screenshot of Tesla's refreshed Model Y, which is coming to Europe later this year. Tesla\n\nSeveral German companies have announced they will stop buying Tesla vehicles over Musk's comments in recent months. Last month activists projected an image of a controversial gesture made by the Tesla boss at an event making Donald Trump's inauguration onto the Berlin factory.\n\nMusk has also become entangled in UK politics, feuding with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and reportedly considering a donation to right-wing party Reform.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Musk has seen one of Tesla's rivals step up efforts to court disgruntled owners.\n\nThe CEO of EV brand Polestar said recently he told sales staff to target Tesla owners put off by Musk's push into politics and echoed Scholz in calling the billionaire's support of AfD \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\n\"We get a lot of people writing that they don't like all this,\" Michael Lohscheller told Bloomberg. \"It's important to listen closely to what they say. And I can tell you, a lot of people have very, very negative sentiment.\"\n\nMatthias Schmidt, a Germany-based automotive analyst, told BI he expected Musk's political involvements to eventually have an impact on Tesla's European sales, and said rivals like Polestar would likely reap the benefit of disgruntled Tesla owners ditching their vehicles.\n\n\"I expect Tesla's rivals are rubbing their hands together because this is the exact point where they need a big EV uptake for their own products,\" said Schmidt.\n\n\"The more Elon Musk continues to shoot himself in the foot, if you like, the more Germans and European manufacturers can only benefit. For them, it's like Christmas and all their birthdays coming all at once,\" he added.\n\nElon Musk and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the opening of Tesla's Berlin factory in 2022. PATRICK PLEUL/Getty Images\n\nHowever, Nothard said that consumers would ultimately be more concerned about factors such as price and performance, rather than Musk's politics.\n\n\"I don't think the consumer really connects it. Ultimately it's a car \u2014do they like it, is it affordable to them? Does it fulfill the requirements of what they want? That's really what the consumer is looking at,\" he said.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or own one of its EVs?

            "content": "A small government team regulating the sort of autonomous cars that Elon Musk says represent the future of Tesla, his car company, is getting cut nearly in half by the Musk-led U.S. Doge Service, according to people briefed on the reductions. The loss of personnel from the specialized unit is part of a 10 percent overall workforce reduction at the federal agency tasked with ensuring safety on America\u2019s roads. In all, the agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, will lose between 70 and 80 people, split roughly evenly between firings of probationary employees and buyouts, according to three people, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution.\n\nThe losses touch on many aspects of the agency\u2019s safety work, according to fired workers who also spoke with the The Washington Post: an engineer who worked with crash test dummies, employees who work with states on safety grant funding, and a research psychologist focused on drunken driving and speeding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was just very jarring to go from saving lives one day to being locked out of your computer the next,\u201d said one terminated employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid hurting his prospects of finding a new job.\n\nDOGE\u2019s slash-and-burn approach also eliminated three out of roughly seven people in a new office charged with overseeing the safety of autonomous vehicles, one person familiar with the cuts said. Fired workers said they do not believe they were targeted specifically because they are examining driverless cars, which remain a new and controversial technology. But one of them said the upshot is the same, with less scrutiny of robotic vehicles.\n\n\u201cIf the question is, will this affect the federal government\u2019s ability to understand the safety case behind Tesla\u2019s vehicles, then yes, it will,\u201d said one terminated engineer. \u201cThe amount of people in the federal government who are able to understand this adequately is very small. Now it\u2019s almost nonexistent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Transportation Department and NHTSA did not respond to requests for comment on the job losses. The U.S. DOGE Service, Musk\u2019s unit at the White House, and Tesla also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe job losses were part of widespread, messy cuts to federal agencies led by DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nAt the Transportation Department, another division, the Federal Aviation Administration, terminated roughly 400 probationary employees last week; newly hired workers at other transportation agencies that oversee railroad and transit safety and fund infrastructure projects say they were also terminated in recent days.\n\nNHTSA employed nearly 800 people as of January. It is relatively small but plays a leading role in the federal government\u2019s efforts to reduce the annual death toll on the nation\u2019s roads. It works on improving driver behavior, sets rules for the safety of vehicles and holds the power to recall dangerous cars and trucks. In recent years its work has increasingly involved overseeing new driver assistance technologies and fully robotic vehicles \u2014 including investigations of safety risks in Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agency has faced criticism from safety advocacy groups that it has done too little to rein in the technologies and been too slow to write rules to govern them.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, other companies also have a direct interest in how NHTSA approaches regulation of self-driving cars, including Alphabet\u2019s Waymo and Amazon\u2019s Zoox. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nSen. Edward J. Markey (D-Massachusetts), Minority Leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-New York) and other Democrats sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy on Thursday demanding information on the scale of the job losses at NHTSA and across the Transportation Department, and answers about their implications for the traveling public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration appears to have little respect for these workers or understanding of their critical importance to safety,\u201d the senators wrote.\n\nSteven Bradbury, Trump\u2019s pick to be the transportation department\u2019s No. 2 official, said during a Senate confirmation hearing Thursday that Duffy was focused on ensuring that funding and staffing cuts were \u201cmade without compromising safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll ensure that safety critical staffing is sufficient to address those needs,\u201d Bradbury said.\n\nMusk\u2019s various roles represent numerous potential conflicts of interest. He is a leading figure in the Trump administration with responsibility for slashing the federal workforce and spending. At the same time he is the leader of companies, including Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX, that are regulated by the same agencies his team is targeting for cuts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and Musk said in a joint interview with Fox News this week that Musk would not be involved in any work that poses a conflict with his business interests.\n\nNHTSA has been responsible for investigating the safety of Tesla\u2019s vehicles as Musk has put increasingly sophisticated driver assistance technology in the hands of regular drivers. Tesla plans to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road this year. An agency investigation led to a recall of 2 million vehicles in December 2023, and it disclosed in April that it had documented numerous deadly crashes involving Autopilot.\n\nNHTSA is also investigating deadly crashes involving Ford\u2019s driver assistance technology and safety problems with Waymo and Zoox\u2019s autonomous vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration has said it wants to help get more autonomous vehicles on the road by creating a framework to oversee them.\n\n\u201cAutonomous vehicles, if done right, can make our roadways way safer,\u201d Duffy said during a department-wide employee town hall Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s the vision.\u201d\n\nBut NHTSA has struggled for years to ensure the safety of new technologies that take over much of the job of driving from humans or replace drivers altogether. The systems largely fall outside existing safety rules, so Tesla and other companies have been free to put them on the road with limited federal oversight.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, NHTSA grew steadily from about 600 employees. As part of that growth the agency built the team of seven or so experts to better understand autonomous systems and take responsibility for regulating them. The team was small, and because it was relatively new and had recently hired a number of employees from outside the federal government, it was vulnerable to DOGE effort targeting probationary employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly before President Donald Trump was elected, Musk said he would seek to use his role in the administration to have the federal government create a framework for autonomous vehicles, although he did not provide details. Tesla\u2019s stock price surged after the election, as investors bet that his influence would benefit the company.\n\nDuffy said during his Senate confirmation hearing that he would allow ongoing investigations into Tesla and other manufacturers to proceed. NHTSA has also left in place a Biden administration order that requires companies to disclose crashes involving automated vehicles and driver assistance systems. Tesla reported 84 incidents between mid-December and mid-January, according to a batch of data released on Tuesday, in line with previous months.\n\nThe FAA is by far the largest agency at the Transportation Department, employing almost 47,000 of its nearly 58,000 workers. While NHTSA gets far less attention than the FAA, another engineer who was terminated said its staff are keenly aware of the dangers on the roads.\n\n\u201cIt sticks with me that we\u2019re still in this place of about 40,000 deaths a year and a million or so pretty bad injuries,\u201d said the engineer, who took a pay cut and accepted a long commute to start a job at the agency. \u201cWe\u2019re a small organization who are passionate about that mission.\u201d",

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nNIO has completed more than 66 million battery swaps at its 3,000+ battery swapping stations. Tesla had one battery swapping station that was hard to find and barely used about a decade ago in California. Nonetheless, reportedly, someone at Tesla tried to shoot down battery swapping as a horrible idea in a recent post titled \u201cWhat are the advantages of charging compared to battery swapping?\u201d that was apparently directed at NIO Vice President of Power Shen Fei. \u201cAlthough the automaker was not explicitly named, Tesla was mentioned multiple times in both the letter and Shen\u2019s response, which he shared on his Weibo account on Saturday.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, but it sounds like some kind of battle for customers in China. I just find it humorous that someone would attack a company\u2019s battery swapping approach as pointless when the company has performed 66 million battery swaps. Also, I have found it interesting that NIO has basically stood alone in the auto world in developing its vast battery swapping network, and have always wondered how that would evolve.\n\n\u201cBattery swapping is always an intermediate process. You always have to go somewhere to do something specifically for another purpose\u2014just like going to a gas station to refuel,\u201d the original post noted, before adding that charging \u201ccan be a destination or a stop along the way.\u201d That\u2019s all fair and good, and no one is saying charging doesn\u2019t have a place and have some advantages, but perhaps battery swapping also has a place for a lot of people and a lot of scenarios?\n\n\u201cAfter you park, you don\u2019t need any extra steps. You just plug in the charger, and by the time you\u2019re ready to leave, the battery is charged,\u201d the statement added. Yep, we get all that, and have been making this point for a decade and a half (or longer for some of you readers). But sometimes people could also benefit from a quick 3-minute battery swap, and there are many people who don\u2019t have convenient home or workplace charging.\n\nHere\u2019s more (translated) from the original letter criticizing NIO\u2019s battery swap system:\n\n\u201cTesla had highly advanced battery swapping technology, but after testing it, we abandoned it for three reasons:\n\n\u201c1. Technological iteration: Battery technology is constantly evolving. Tesla integrates the battery into the vehicle chassis, reducing weight and improving efficiency. However, the structural constraints of battery swapping prevent flexibility in adapting new battery technologies.\n\n\u201c2. Safety concerns: Battery swapping requires frequent disassembly and installation of high-voltage components and fasteners. Doesn\u2019t this pose safety risks? While we don\u2019t know for certain, it is worth considering. Additionally, Tesla treats the battery as an integral structural component of the vehicle, which enhances safety.\n\n\u201c3. Cost control: Every battery swap station is like a real estate investment\u2014you have to rent or buy land. However, with charging, existing parking lots can be used without additional infrastructure costs.\u201d\n\nShen Fei clapped back, starting with a bit of humor. \u201cReceived a \u2018battery swapping\u2019 talking points card from a competitor\u2014quite interesting! [laughing emoji]\u201d\n\n\u201cHere are the real facts: Battery swapping and charging are not in conflict! Nio offers \u2018chargeable, swappable, and upgradeable\u2019 options,\u201d he stated. Exactly \u2014 the more choice, the merrier, right?\n\n\u201cCharging at home is great (Nio supports that too), but for long trips or when home charging isn\u2019t available, a 3-minute battery swap gets you back on the road\u2014much faster than charging!\u201d NIO\u2019s VP added. \u201cNo need to step out in the wind or rain.\u201d\n\nNIO also adds that it has installed more than 20,000 charging piles, in addition to all of the battery swapping infrastructure.\n\n\u201cA gas car\u2019s engine remains the same after 10 years, but a Nio car from 2018 can now use the latest battery, doubling its range!\u201d Shen Fei added. \u201cIntegrated battery and chassis? Pros and cons! If the battery breaks, repairs can be insanely expensive,\u201d Fei Shen argues, but with battery swapping, drivers \u201cget both an upgrade and an easy fix without replacing everything.\u201d\n\nNio\u2019s \u201cbattery swap fasteners hold a national patent\u20143,000 swaps without loosening, good for 600,000 km,\u201d and \u201cevery swap includes a battery check-up, detecting small issues early and significantly reducing fire risks!\u201d\n\nThose are a lot of advantages that most of us don\u2019t even consider when thinking about battery swapping.\n\nShen Fei also points out that battery swapping can be more resource efficient, whereas oversized batteries sit being unused most of the time just to provide long range that is almost never needed. You don\u2019t need a monster battery if you can quickly do a battery swap. These batteries can also be used for electricity backup in the region.\n\n\u201cTesla didn\u2019t make it work back then because American and Chinese consumer needs are different,\u201d Shen Fei added. \u201cBut we have Nio, and when it comes to battery swapping, China just does it better!\u201d Maybe that is the case now.",

Police were investigating the fire, which was limited to one vehicle. No injuries were reported. A window of the building was also broken.\n\nHedrick said the FBI took over the investigation for that case in late January.\n\nTesla is an electric vehicle company owned by billionaire Elon Musk. Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, which is focused on reducing federal government spending. Actions taken by Musk and President Donald Trump have led to recent nationwide protests, including at the Oregon State Capitol.\n\nIsabel Funk covers breaking news and public safety for the Statesman Journal.

In contrast, the proposed law would set a requirement that a shareholder hold at least a third of a company's shares in order to be deemed a \"controller.\"\n\nLegal experts are divided on whether the proposed legislation, if enacted, could impact Musk's Tesla compensation package currently on appeal to the state's Supreme Court -- a point of contention that has arisen from the fact the bill lacks an explicit mention forbidding its application to pending cases.\n\nThe law firm representing Musk and Tesla, Richards, Layton & Finger, confirmed to ABC News its involvement in drafting the legislation. The firm claimed the legislation, if enacted, would not be retroactive.\n\nThe firm also said that its role in the process \"was not on behalf of or otherwise influenced by any firm client,\" stressing that it was among a group of lawyers, professors and experts that helped draft the proposal and that the firm has played a major role in shaping Delaware's business statutes for more than 125 years.\n\nIn this March 29, 2021, file photo, an aerial view of Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory is shown in Shanghai, China. Xiaolu Chu/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"As many have recognized, statutory changes are necessary to restore the core principles that have been the hallmark of Delaware for over a century and ensure that Delaware remains the preeminent jurisdiction for incorporation,\" Richards, Layton & Finger President Lisa Schmidt wrote in a statement to ABC News.\n\nThe bill's sponsor, Delaware Democratic state Sen. Bryan Townsend, echoed the claim, telling ABC News that the bill is \"not retroactive and would not affect the litigation regarding Elon Musk's compensation package at Tesla.\"\n\nTownsend also stressed that an attorney from Richards, Layton & Finger was invited to advise on the legislation as an industry expert and a member of the Delaware State Bar Association's Corporation Law Council, along with many other experts -- and that legislators were fully responsible for the bill's final draft.\n\nBut other legal experts told ABC News that the proposed law could allow the Delaware court to reverse its decision and grant Musk the pay package.\n\nThe bill lacks an explicit mention forbidding application to pending cases, making possible a court finding that alters the outcome of Musk's case, legal experts said.\n\n\"It's possible,\" Sarath Sanga, a professor of corporate law at Yale University, said of the potential use of the proposed law to revive Musk's pay package. \"There's nothing in the law requiring it and there's nothing preventing it.\"\n\nAnn Lipton, a law professor at Tulane University, said the absence of any stipulation preventing application to pending cases could function as a signal to the court to reverse its decision about Musk's pay.\n\n\"It sends a strong signal to the Delaware Supreme Court that we want you to interpret this to give Elon his pay package back,\" Lipton said.\n\nBoston College Law Professor Brian Quinn said that it's unclear if the legislation will be retroactive or not -- but added, \"It's entirely possible that the court reverses the trial opinion for reasons not related to this amendment, and the package is reinstated.\"\n\nChancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversees the Delaware trial court that handles commercial litigation, rejected the 2018 compensation package that Tesla voted to provide to Musk.\n\nMcCormick found that the negotiations surrounding the package had been inappropriate, due to a lack of independence among board members and Musk's influence over the negotiations.\n\nThe proposed changes to the law could ease the scrutiny applied to Musk, resulting in a reversal of the court's judgment, some experts told ABC News.\n\nThe proposed law bypassed a typical process of consideration before the Corporate Law Council, a section of the Delaware Bar Association, Sanga said. He said he could not recall an instance in which a proposed change to Delaware corporate law did not go through that process.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to reflect additional information provided by Richards, Layton & Finger.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nIn the cutthroat world of electric vehicles, the Tesla Model Y has risen to global superstardom. This isn\u2019t just some Silicon Valley fever dream, it\u2019s the best-selling car on the planet. Forget niche markets or EV bragging rights; the Model Y has dethroned titans like the Toyota Corolla to become the world\u2019s favorite mode of transportation. It\u2019s a staggering achievement for a vehicle that\u2019s part tech product, part family hauler, and part cultural touchstone.\n\nA New Contender\n\nBut as more contenders emerge, Tesla\u2019s crown faces pressure. Among these challengers is the Lucid Air Pure, a luxury sedan with enough poise and polish to question Tesla\u2019s dominance, at least in some areas. The Model Y\u2019s rise isn\u2019t hard to understand. Starting at $47,740, it delivers blistering acceleration, up to 330 miles of range, and access to Tesla\u2019s industry-leading Supercharger network. It\u2019s the Swiss Army knife of EVs, blending affordability and performance in a way that no one, not even Toyota, has been able to replicate. Yet, for all its strengths, Tesla\u2019s entry-level crossover has its shortcomings. Ride quality? More punishing than plush. Cabin refinement? Minimalist to a fault. For many buyers, it\u2019s a compromise, a great EV, but not necessarily a great car. Enter Lucid, a company that\u2019s betting its Air Pure can fill the gaps Tesla has ignored, especially in the luxury space.\n\nAn Ownership Experience\n\nA recent Lucid owner shared their experience transitioning from a Tesla Model Y, offering a striking comparison between the two vehicles \u2013\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like the Lucid Air Pure coming from a Model Y, but my god the car is so much quieter and rides better. It actually feels like a luxury car. I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d and I fit in the back seat with room to spare. I have some gripes about the experience being in the car. I\u2019m tall so it can be difficult to see the speedometer because the steering wheel is in the way, but it\u2019s not critical. I wish the driving mode I prefer, swift, would stay registered with my profile instead of me having to pick it every time I start the car. The mobile key can be hit or miss. A few times I\u2019ve had to open the app and wake up the car just to unlock the doors. This feels like a software fix. I think these things are very minor.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a telling contrast. Tesla may have cracked the mass-market EV formula, but Lucid is going after the refinement Tesla lacks. The Air Pure offers 410 horsepower, a whisper-quiet cabin, and a suspension that prioritizes comfort over cornering dynamics. At $77,400, it\u2019s not a direct competitor to the Model Y\u2014but it\u2019s a shot across Tesla\u2019s bow, a reminder that there\u2019s more to EVs than range and acceleration.\n\nYet Lucid\u2019s owner experience isn\u2019t without hiccups, as the same driver explained:\n\n\u201cI just got this car yesterday, and already had to bring it back to be serviced the very next day. That is a sucky feeling. The door handle broke. The door stayed locked but you couldn\u2019t open it from the outside. Lesson learned: don\u2019t accidentally press down on the door handle. I feel like this handle shouldn\u2019t be this fragile. I\u2019m going to chalk it up to minor bad luck. The service center I\u2019m at is super nice and helpful. I arrived before they opened and they ushered me in and directed me to the comfy studio with coffee. I\u2019ve had no less than three people check on me and offer me things. Wow, basic hospitality too.\u201d\n\nLucid\u2019s Chance To Shine\n\nIt\u2019s here that Lucid has a chance to shine. Tesla\u2019s service network has long been its Achilles\u2019 heel, plagued by delays, parts shortages, and a reputation for poor communication. Lucid\u2019s boutique approach feels like a breath of fresh air, even if it\u2019s still ironing out the kinks in its manufacturing process. Offering better service and customer care might not matter to Tesla diehards, but for buyers entering the luxury space, it\u2019s an expectation, not an option.\n\nTesla Customer Service\n\nCustomers have reported difficulties in reaching Tesla's customer service representatives, often being directed to use the mobile app for service appointments. This reliance on digital communication has led to frustrations, especially when timely human interaction is desired.\n\nThere have been instances where Tesla owners experienced significant delays in vehicle repairs and maintenance. Some reports indicate waiting periods extending to several weeks or even months, attributed to factors such as parts availability and limited service center capacity.\n\nWhile some Tesla owners have praised the company's innovative approach and vehicle performance, others have expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of customer service. Issues such as unresponsive support channels and challenges in addressing service concerns have been highlighted in various customer reviews.\n\nTesla\u2019s Model Y thrives because it\u2019s accessible, fast, and practical. It doesn\u2019t need to be the best luxury car because that\u2019s not its mission. For Lucid, however, refinement is everything. As EV adoption grows, the game is shifting from raw performance to the overall experience\u2014how the car feels, how it\u2019s supported, and how it serves the driver.\n\nRewriting The Rules\n\nTesla may have rewritten the rules, but brands like Lucid are playing by them better in certain areas. Ultimately, these two vehicles represent different visions of what an electric car should be. The Model Y is the mass-market everyman, a utilitarian tool with just enough flair to make it desirable. The Lucid Air Pure is a luxury machine built to rival Audi and Mercedes-Benz, and it\u2019s playing a longer game, targeting a smaller but wealthier audience. Whether Lucid can survive its growing pains is anyone\u2019s guess, but for now, its Air Pure shows that the future of EVs isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution. Both cars are proof that electrification is no longer a novelty\u2014it\u2019s the new normal.\n\nNoah Washington is an automotive journalist based in Atlanta, Georgia.

Musk has overseen the mass firing of federal employees and slashed government spending while running a cost-cutting task force Trump named the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nSalem police responded just before 5 a.m. Wednesday to a report of damaged windows at the dealership at 2755 Mission St. S.E. Police remained on scene until around 12 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOfficers found the damage to be from gunshots,\u201d according to agency spokeswoman Angela Hedrick.\n\nHedrick said authorities have made no arrests and are still investigating the shooting.\n\nShe declined to specify why the FBI was helping investigate the shooting. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s standard practice is to assist local agencies with their expertise or tools, for example, if it can benefit an investigation,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen asked whether police suspect the incidents were politically motivated, Hedrick said, \u201cThe incident was reported less than six hours ago, and we have detectives that are still on the scene gathering evidence and facts in the case.\u201d\n\nThe shooting comes just over four weeks after authorities investigated a vehicle fire at the dealership.\n\nThe earlier fire at the dealership was reported around 3:45 a.m. on Jan. 20. Fire damage was contained to one car, and one of the dealership\u2019s windows was broken.\n\nFederal agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives helped investigate the incident.\n\nSalem police said at the time that they were investigating the fire as an arson but had made no arrests. They asked anyone with information to call the agency\u2019s tip line at 503-588-8477.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Portland field office told Salem Reporter in a statement Wednesday that the fire investigation was still pending.\n\nThe FBI and ATF are jointly investigating the fire, according to Hedrick.\n\nThe scene after a vehicle fire at the Tesla dealership in south Salem on Monday, Jan. 20. (Salem Police Department)\n\nThis story was updated Wednesday afternoon with information provided by the FBI\u2019s Portland field office.\n\nCORRECTION: This story was updated to reflect that the FBI and ATF are jointly investigating the January fire \u2013 not both incidents, as the FBI originally stated.\n\nContact reporter Ardeshir Tabrizian: [email protected] or 503-929-3053.\n\nA MOMENT MORE, PLEASE\u2013 If you found this story useful, consider subscribing to Salem Reporter if you don\u2019t already.

            "content": "Tesla has been preparing its Gigafactory Berlin production plant in Germany for a European takeover, performed strictly by the new Model Y, a design that will launch across the world with deliveries coming soon.\n\nThe American automaker\u2019s German production plant has seen manufacturing lines transition from producing the older version of the Model Y to the new one, codenamed \u201cJuniper,\u201d over the past few weeks.\n\nOn Monday, Tesla officially launched consistent production of the new Model Y at Giga Berlin, according to a report from German media outlet rbb24, which said that, since Sunday evening, only the new version of the all-electric crossover had been produced.\n\nPlant Manager Andr\u00e9 Thierig confirmed these details to the outlet and stated that deliveries of the new Model Y could begin as soon as next week. In the United States, production of the new Model Y started in Fremont and Austin in late 2024, but production models that will be handed over to customers are still being built. These will be delivered in March, the company estimates.\n\nTesla has brought an all-new look to the exterior of the Model Y with this design refresh, something that was anticipated as the vehicle was seen with exterior car covers as early as mid-2024. The company installed a new headlight and taillight design, as well as some other design changes to the body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, many of the major engineering changes are beyond the eye, and include upgrades to suspension to create a more solid and comfortable ride, acoustic laminated glass for a quieter cabin experience, and even the addition of a front-facing 180-degree camera on the bumper that will enable more accuracy to self-driving efforts.\n\nThe upgraded design is also expected to help Tesla regain growth in terms of annual deliveries, as 2024 saw a leveling-off of the figure it reported the year prior. Tesla focused on developing what it refers to as its \u201cnext-gen platform\u201d in 2024, with plans to unveil these vehicles coming in 2025.\n\nThe 12,500 employees at Gigafactory Berlin will put their efforts completely into the production and deliveries of the new Model Y.\n\nIts most recent production rate was 5,000 vehicles per week, but this new design will require somewhat of an adjustment period, so don\u2019t expect that pace to continue, at least not straight away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeed accessories for your Tesla?

It will be based on the Volvo group's SPA2 platform \u2014 the same basic structure that serves as the basis for cars like the EX90 SUV and the Polestar 3. Given we've already driven the Polestar 3 and EX90 (and been impressed with both), we know a little bit about what to expect. A battery pack with a usable capacity of around 100 kWh will form the floor of the vehicle, and all-wheel drive will be standard thanks to two electric motors (one on the front axle, one on the rear).\n\nGiven the Polestar 3 we tested got over 300 miles of range on the real-world Edmunds EV Range Test, we think it's safe to say the longest-range versions of the ES90 will hover around 315 miles of range (possibly more thanks to a sedan's naturally lower weight and better aerodynamics when compared with an SUV's). Expect the ES90's max charging power to be similar to the EX90's 250 kW and charge times from 10% to 80% to be around 30 minutes when on an appropriately speedy charger.\n\nVolvo is also going all in on safety tech for the ES90. That probably comes as no surprise given the company created the seatbelt, but we now know what exactly to expect. A total of one lidar, five radars, eight cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors, as well as a driver monitoring system inside the car, will all work in tandem to detect obstacles and ensure drivers are alert. All those sensors will feed info to Volvo's Superset software platform that's powered by an NVIDIA processor. Volvo says the ES90 will be the most powerful car it has ever made in terms of core computing capacity.\n\nStay tuned for more details on the upcoming ES90; we won't have to wait that long.",

Chandler and Strine work for law firms Wilson Sonsini and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, respectively.\n\nThe bill was introduced in the Delaware General Assembly on Monday and would require approval by the state's two chambers as well as Gov.

After several false starts in the market, is it finally time for Tesla to launch in India?\n\nTesla has been trying to get into the Indian automotive market for years, but it wasn\u2019t able to find a way around the country\u2019s protectionist effort, which includes high import duties on vehicles being imported.\n\nThe Indian government wanted Tesla to build a factory in the country, but the automaker preferred to first establish a market in the country through imported vehicles before investing in a manufacturing facility in the country.\n\nLast year, we reported that India finally reached a compromise on its import duties on cars, opening the door for Tesla and other EV automakers to launch in the country.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nThe deal involves significantly reducing import duties for a limited number of electric vehicles as long as the automaker makes a significant investment and commitment to build an electric vehicle factory in India in the coming years.\n\nIt looked like Tesla had a hand in making that deal happen, considering the automaker was working closely with the government, and there were indications that Tesla would take them up on the deal.\n\nCEO Elon Musk planned to go to India shortly after the deal was announced \u2013 hinting at closing a deal for Tesla to launch in the market and building a factory there.\n\nHowever, the CEO canceled his trip to India at the last minute and went to China instead.\n\nIt didn\u2019t look like Tesla was going to take the Indian government\u2019s offer as nothing was announced months for months.\n\nIn December, there were reports that Tesla might be looking for store locations in India.\n\nNow, Tesla has listed a bunch of new job openings in Mumbai, including many related to selling and servicing vehicles:\n\nThe development comes after Musk met with Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, last week. The meeting appeared to be more related to Musk\u2019s role in the US government, but it\u2019s not impossible that he negotiated a deal for Tesla to enter the market.\n\nUnder India\u2019s blanket deal for electric vehicle automakers, the EV import tariffs are limited to 15% and apply to only 40,000 vehicles, no more than 8,000 per year.\n\nThe automaker benefiting from those lower import tariffs also needs to make a ~$500 million USD investment into local EV manufacturing over 5 years, but it has to start no later than within 3 years of starting the import of the EVs at lower tariffs.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nWe have been there before with Tesla in India so I will believe it when I see it, but it\u2019s possible.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see if Tesla is taking up India on this offer. I would be surprised. I think if Tesla is entering India, it would probably be under a different, more advantageous deal.\n\nWe will see.",

            "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is hitting a major roadblock in China, and it's not just about technologyit's politics. The EV giant was expecting a green light for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) rollout in early 2025, but Chinese regulators have thrown a wrench into the plan. With no clear timeline for approval, Tesla's ambitions in the world's largest auto market are stuck in limbo. And here's the kicker: Beijing may be using this as a bargaining chip in trade talks with the Trump administration. That puts Tesla in a tough spot, especially as local rivals like BYD (BYDDF) and XPeng are racing ahead with their own advanced driver-assist systems.\n\nBut the approval delay is just one piece of the puzzle. Tesla is also caught in a regulatory bind between the US and China over data security. China won't allow training video to be transferred out of the country, and the US won't permit AI model training inside China. Meanwhile, homegrown players are rolling out Level 2 and Level 3 automation featuressometimes at no extra cost. That raises big questions about Tesla's ability to sell FSD subscriptions in China, where BYD's new \"God's Eye\" system is already making waves. If Tesla can't move fast, it risks losing ground in an EV market that's evolving at lightning speed.\n\nAdding to the pressure, Elon Musk's close relationship with Donald Trumponce seen as a strategic advantageis turning into a liability. Trump's latest tariffs on Chinese goods have escalated tensions, and Tesla could end up as collateral damage in a broader trade war. While Tesla's stock initially surged post-election, the reality is more complicated. If China continues to delay FSD approvalor tightens the screws furtherTesla could find itself on the wrong side of an increasingly competitive market, watching as its rivals seize the momentum.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nTesla sales are in an unprecedented slide. Competitors are rapidly gaining ground. There\u2019s a lot of bad news for Tesla lately \u2013 but it\u2019s unclear if the politics of its polarizing CEO, Elon Musk, are to blame.\n\nWhat is known is that Tesla had its first-ever drop in global sales last year, as sales fell 1% from 2023. That wouldn\u2019t be a huge decline for many other companies, but it is notable at a company that had recorded 38% and 40% increases in sales the previous two years \u2013 and with the massive growth in its share price over the past decade largely predicated on future growth.\n\nOn a smaller time scale, Tesla did report a sharp drop 16% in US sales between December and January, but that is typical for the company, which seems to make a major push for year-end sales to hit its full-year financial results target, followed by a drop in January. Sales in January 2024, for instance, were off 24% from its December 2023 sales.\n\nBut Tesla is facing a lot more than a CEO whose eyes have not only been on the federal government, but at least four other companies he\u2019s involved in. And that makes it hard to blame any one element definitively for the company\u2019s relatively rough seas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to see any (Musk backlash) in the Tesla numbers,\u201d said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint that polarization is causing people to buy or avoid a Tesla.\u201d\n\nMusk has become the focus of much attention for his moves to reshape the federal government as he co-hosts Oval Office press conferences with President Donald Trump. And the headwinds for Tesla sales are real, from increased competition to the price of its cars.\n\nPerhaps the biggest sign of shift in interest in owning a Telsa comes from S&P Global Mobility, which has sales data on a state-by-state basis. It broke the data into \u201cblue states,\u201d meaning states that voted for the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and \u201cred states\u201d where Republicans won four straight elections. And within each group of states, it looked at the percentage of household that already owned a Tesla that bought another one when purchasing a new car.\n\nIn the blue states, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell, from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% in the last quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, repeat Tesla buyers in red states edged up very slightly from 47.6% at the end of 2023 to 48.2% during the last three months of last year.\n\nThe drop in loyalty rate for Tesla owners in blue states resulted in Tesla losing about 1 percentage point of market share overall in those states, which includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest car markets, such as California.\n\nThere\u2019s some additional anecdotal evidence to suggest that some buyers may have been turned off by Musk\u2019s political activism. Valdez Streaty points to polling of potential car buyers this month by Morning Consult that shows that nearly 32% of US buyers \u201cwould not consider\u201d buying a Tesla. That\u2019s up from 27% in a Morning Consult survey a year ago, and only 17% when it asked the question in in February 2021.\n\nBy comparison, only 16% of potential buyers were almost certain or very likely to look at a Tesla before buying in the most recent survey, a figure that hasn\u2019t changed much over the last four years.\n\nThe rise in people who say they are crossing Tesla off their shopping list is not nearly as great as those now expressing a negative view of Musk. A January poll by Quinnipiac University found that 53% of voters disapprove of Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration, compared to 39% who approved. A poll in December 2022 by the university found 36% of voters had a positive opinion of Musk and 35% had a negative view.\n\nMore used Teslas for sale\n\nOne factor that could indicate a Tesla-based Musk backlash would be the number of used Teslas hitting the market, as owners dump their cars. And there are more Teslas being traded in currently, with an average of around 11,300 Teslas listed on Cox\u2019s AutoTrader, a record, throughout the fourth quarter of last year, up 28% from the average of 8,800 a year earlier.\n\nBut even that has complicating factors \u2013 Cox said much of the flood of Teslas hitting used car lots is likely due to the post-pandemic surge in sales three years ago and the natural trend of some people trading in cars after three years.\n\nAnd there are many other factors likely driving down new Tesla sales, most notably increased competition. Legacy Western automakers such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen have spent the past few years rolling out new models of electric vehicles, with more constantly on the way and sometimes with lower prices than Tesla.\n\nBy comparison, Tesla has made relatively modest changes to its main lineup \u2013 the Model Y and Model 3 sedans and Model X and Model Y SUVs. The one new model, the Cybertruck pickup, is an expensive niche vehicle that has had only modest sales.\n\nThere is also significant new competition from Chinese automaker BYD, which has nearly caught Tesla in worldwide EV sales and actually topped it by a large margin in the fourth quarter of 2024. BYD is taking market share away from Tesla in China and Europe but it has yet to enter the US market.\n\nTesla sales in Germany in January fell 59% compared to a year ago, according to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority. And just as Musk has been a key supporter of Trump, he has become a high profile supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\n\nCar purchases are among the largest and most carefully thought out purchases that consumers make other than housing. And they generally look primarily at price, options and perceived value more than factors such as the politics of the CEO, said Ivan Drury, director of insights at car-buying site Edmunds.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge swath of the populaton that doesn\u2019t care about politics or it\u2019s not top of mind,\u201d said Drury. \u201cA lot of people will put aside their feelings about politics when making a purchase like this and focus on price.\u201d",

Modi wrote in an X post on Thursday that he had a \"very good meeting\" with the Tesla CEO.\n\n\"We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation,\" Modi added.\n\nTrump told reporters on Thursday that while he wasn't sure why Musk had met Modi, he assumed it was because Musk \"wants to do business in India.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nTesla has been planning to enter the Indian market for close to a decade. In April 2016, the company started accepting pre-orders for its vehicles.\n\nThen, in January 2021, Tesla registered a company in India, just weeks after the country's transport minister, Nitin Gadkari, said Tesla would launch its operations there in early 2021. India is the world's third-largest auto market.\n\nBut those plans were put on hold. Musk said in July 2021 it was difficult for Tesla to break into the Indian market because the country's \"import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country.\"\n\n\"Still working through a lot of challenges with the government,\" Musk wrote in an X post in January 2022 when asked if Tesla was still planning to launch in India.\n\nIn March, India lowered its import taxes on EVs made by companies that commit to invest at least $500 million and start making cars in the country within three years.\n\nMusk was scheduled to visit India in April and announce Tesla's entry into the country. However, the trip was postponed at the last minute.\n\n\"Unfortunately, very heavy Tesla obligations require that the visit to India be delayed, but I do very much look forward to visiting later this year,\" Musk wrote in an X post in April.",

            "content": "Courtesy of Flickr\n\nGrowing up, my favorite place was the Cinema City movie theater down the street from my house. From the outside it may have looked like a run-down building with a tower on top for no apparent reason, but to me it was like a castle and a time machine all in one beautiful package.\n\nWalking through those glass doors filled me with so much joy and excitement. I had my seventh birthday party there. And my fourteenth. And my sixteenth. I saw \u201cTangled\u201d, \u201cCoco\u201d, and \u201cJurassic World\u201d all in that slightly run-down building. To this day, I can still picture the soft, red, worn carpeting that greeted me whenever I entered that hallowed space.\n\nI always thought that one day, maybe, I\u2019d get the opportunity to work there during the summer\u2014that I could share my love of movies with all the people who came through those doors. So, after my freshman year of college, I applied, only to find out that, just a few days later, my favorite place would be closing its doors forever. Initially, I thought to myself, \u201cmaybe they\u2019re just refurbishing or something?\u201d Nope. They turned the greatest, most beloved movie theater in town into the unimaginable.\n\nA Tesla dealership.\n\nEnraged is the best way I can describe how I felt in that moment. Who decided to turn a beloved landmark into a cold, emotionless chamber of electric motor vehicles? Now, if I want to go enjoy a movie in a theater on a big screen with some popcorn, I have to drive at least 20 minutes to a different theater that\u2019s honestly not as good.\n\nCinema City was perfect in every way. I had so many core memories there. Like the time my sister yelled \u201cElsa dies and Olaf melts!\u201d to all the small children in Elsa dresses as we were leaving the theater where we watched \u201cFrozen 2\u201d. Or the time I saw \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d with the guy that I thought was my best friend (but definitely wasn\u2019t), which, looking back, is still a good memory despite what ended up becoming of our relationship.\n\nThe point is, why do people always feel the need to turn something old into something new? Change can be good, but tearing down a beloved community landmark is not something that I believe should happen, especially so suddenly. One minute, I was going there with my friends to watch a movie. Then, just a few days later, it was closed, and we had no idea it was happening.\n\nMovie theaters have been closing all over the country. In 2019 there were over 5,000 movie theaters across the U.S., and as of Jan. 2025 there are less than 2,000. Between Covid and the popularity of streaming services, most people don\u2019t see the point of leaving the comfort of their home to pay to go watch a movie. It\u2019s a very sad phenomenon. The adrenaline I feel when a movie begins playing on a screen that large is unmatched. It\u2019s like being immersed in whatever world is being created in front of you.\n\nSo, if there\u2019s a movie theater or any other place you love, take advantage of it. Go whenever you can and just soak in the vibes because you never know what tomorrow will bring.",

Photo by Gennady Sheyner\n\nThe Tesla dealership in Palo Alto became a scene of protest on Sunday afternoon as more than 400 demonstrators lined two sides of the block to wave signs and chant slogans directed at company CEO Elon Musk, who is playing a leading role in the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to slash programs and reduce the federal workforce.\n\nThe demonstration brought activists, politicians and residents from throughout the Peninsula to the El Camino Real block in south Palo Alto. Folk singer and protest icon Joan Baez made the rounds on both sides of El Camino to cheers from the demonstrators, who included residents from Sunnyvale, Redwood City, Mountain View and other area communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moment to do what we can,\u201d Baez said, when asked what brought her to the event.\n\nThe demonstration was organized by Sally Lieber, a former state Assembly member and Mountain View council member who currently serves on the state Board of Equalization, and the group Together We Will, a chapter of Indivisible, an organization that supports progressive causes.\n\n\n\nAbout 150 people initially showed up to the area in front of the Tesla dealership at 1 p.m., when the event began. The attendance more than doubled within the hour as both sides of the block filled with demonstrators, who also spilled over onto the median island and later to the adjacent block north of El Camino Way.\n\nLieber said that she helped organize the event because she wanted to give people a chance to take action now and not wait until the midterm election, when it might be too late to restore some of the programs now being dismantled.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to provide a platform for people in the community to come out and speak their minds and also make sure people are doing everything they can to mobilize and organize before Musk gets further, before Trump gets further, before JD Vance gets further,\u201d Lieber said. \u201cWe have to fight for our rights. We can\u2019t take them for granted anymore.\u201d\n\nSally Lieber, one of the event organizers, waves during the demonstration in front of Tesla on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady Sheyner\n\nSunnyvale resident Bruce Hahne, an organizer with Together We Will, said he was encouraged by the turnout he had seen both in Palo Alto and during a Saturday demonstration in Sunnyvale, where about 150 people showed up to protest Musk\u2019s actions. The core message of the demonstrations, he said, is to signal \u201cdefense of democracy and opposition to the coup.\u201d\n\nHahne described the actions of Musk and his newly created task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, to slash funding for federal programs and access sensitive data as clearly illegal.\n\n\u201cWe need to think of the executive branch as just the executor,\u201d Hahne said. \u201cTheir job is to follow the financial instructions of Congress. When Congress says money goes to EPA, money goes to EPA. When Congress says money goes to Head Start, it goes to Head Start. Elon Musk does not get to cut off those programs simply because he feels like it. That\u2019s got to stop.\u201d\n\nThe Palo Alto demonstration is part of a growing trend of protests at Tesla dealerships across the country. Similar events have occurred in Manhattan, Berkeley, San Francisco, Pasadena and other communities, according to social media and reports from the Verge and other publications. While some of these \u201cTesla Takeover\u201d events have attracted just a few dozen protesters, the attendance was considerably larger in Palo Alto, a city that formerly housed Tesla\u2019s corporate headquarters and that is currently home to the company\u2019s engineering headquarters.\n\nDemonstrators carried signs that read, \u201cCURB YOUR DOGE,\u201d \u201cNO ONE VOTED 4 MUSK\u201d and \u2018STOP THE COUP\u201d and chanted, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like\u201d as cars streamed by and honked their horns.\n\n\u201cWhat has gratified me is there\u2019s been people driving here in Teslas, honking their horns and giving thumbs up,\u201d said retired Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge LaDoris Cordell, who was at the rally. \u201cThey know this is not good. Elon Musk has no business doing what he is doing. I think it\u2019s criminal \u2013 and look at all the people who agree.\u201d\n\nAnother message of the demonstration was that \u201cthe real Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t support Trump,\u201d said Lenny Siegel a former Mountain View City Council member. While the national press often suggests that Trump has made a deal with Silicon Valley, his deal is only with a handful of billionaires, Siegel said. He noted that about 80% of the voters in Palo Alto and Mountain View voted for Kamala Harris for president.\n\nAccording to registrar data, Harris received 68% of the votes in Santa Clara County and 73% in San Mateo County.\n\n\u201cThese are the people who make Silicon Valley tick,\u201d Siegel said, alluding to the crowd around him. \u201cGetting that into the national news is a struggle because most people who write about Silicon Valley write about billionaires.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to come up with a strategy to resist Trump in the Palo Alto area, where members of the Congressional delegation already hold similar views, Siegel said. He encouraged people to reach out to their friends and family members in other communities that have more conservative leanings and get them to call their representatives.\n\nPalo Alto City Council member Julie Lythcott-Haims also attended the Sunday demonstration and held a \u201cRESIST\u201d sign as she stood on the median island with a line of supporters and encouraged cars to honk. Many obliged.\n\nPalo Alto Council member Julie Lythcott-Haims attends the demonstration in front of Tesla on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady Sheyner\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today because Elon Musk, this unelected figure, clearly has the ear of the president whose priorities appear to be driving much of what President Trump does,\u201d Lythcott-Haims said, \u201cHere we stand as Palo Altans and saying, \u2018In this democracy, the only thing we have is our voice.\u2019 You see hundreds of people out here using their voices to state what they believe in.\n\n\u201cWe are all rightfully concerned that our democracy is being dismantled brick by brick.\u201d\n\nVentura residents Angela Dellaporta and Claire Elliott both said they were concerned about the massive cuts that Musk and his aides are imposing on the federal government. Dellaporta held up a sign protesting the Trump Administration\u2019s recent cuts to U.S. Agency for International Development. Elliott voiced broader concerns about America\u2019s growing inequality.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is just the rich getting richer. It\u2019s been going that way for so many years and this is just taking it to a whole new level,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nFolk singer Joan Baez attended the demonstration in front of Tesla on Feb. 16, 2025.

Organisers said the protests took place in dozens of locations.\n\nWhile the protests were scattered, they highlighted the risks to the car company of Musk\u2019s close association with Trump\u2019s radical rightwing agenda.

So long Tesla.\u201d\n\nPeople within the Tesla business insist the company is separate from its chief executive. However, its surging valuation \u2013 thanks to previously fast-growing sales \u2013 has played a key role in building Musk\u2019s wealth used to fund Trump\u2019s election campaign.\n\nShares in Tesla account for about a third of Musk\u2019s wealth, according to Bloomberg. His ownership of private rocket company SpaceX accounts for another third, while the rest is linked to stakes in xAI, the X social network, the Boring Company, a tunnelling business, and brain-computer interface company Neuralink. Musk has used his shares in Tesla and SpaceX to secure personal loans worth billions of dollars.\n\nTesla reported its first ever annual decline in sales in 2024, amid tough times for the global car industry. It is not yet clear whether Musk\u2019s rightwing politics contributed to that decline, and the company could conceivably make up for lost leftwing customers with new enthusiasts on the right.\n\nSome commentators have linked a steep decline in Tesla sales in Germany with his December declaration of support for the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD). German Tesla sales fell 60% year-on-year in January, although delivery schedules can be affected by other factors beyond demand.\n\nTesla could also be vulnerable in other ways to political backlash. In the UK, Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, this week said the Labour government should impose tariffs on Tesla cars in retaliation for the White House imposing levies on steel imports.\n\nTesla was approached for comment.",

Musk's bet on Trump could also help pave the way to federal approval for fully autonomous vehicles, technology that the Tesla CEO has said is key to its future growth.\n\nMusk, a self-described optimist, has told investors he envisions Tesla eventually being worth multiple trillions in market cap.\n\n\"I see a path, I'm not saying it's an easy path, but I see a path of Tesla being the most valuable company in the world by far,\" Musk said during Tesla's Q4 earnings call. \"Not even close, like maybe several times more than \u2014 I mean, there is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined.\"\n\nAs of February 25, the top five most valuable companies in the world by market capitalization were Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Tesla sits at number 10 on the list.\n\nSo, how does Musk plan on eclipsing his competitors? In short: solving \"autonomy.\"\n\nThousands of Optimus bots\n\nTesla unveiled its Optimus humanoid robot in 2021. VCG/ Getty Images\n\nMusk said the company plans on continuing to home in on \"autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots\" in 2025, after laying extensive groundwork last year.\n\nThe company has said it's moving onto \"building the structure\" necessary to produce the tech that Musk has identified as critical.\n\nWhile Musk said that Tesla's internal goals call for the production of around 10,000 Optimus robots, he recently hedged that the goal is likely unrealistic.\n\n\"Will we succeed in building 10,000 exactly by the end of December this year? Probably not, but will we succeed in making several thousand? Yes, I think we will,\" Musk said on the earnings call. \"Will those several thousand Optimus robots be doing useful things by the end of the year? Yes, I'm confident they will do useful things.\"\n\nMusk said Tesla plans on using the bots internally at Tesla factories to tackle \"boring, annoying,\" and sometimes \"dangerous\" tasks. The Optimus models in use at Tesla will inform tweaks for \"production design 2,\" Musk added, which he expects to launch in 2026.\n\nWhen Optimus is finally ready to be sold externally, the bots could eventually cost in the neighborhood of $20,000 to $30,000, Musk has previously estimated.\n\nCurrently, increasing the volume of production year-over-year is one of Tesla's foremost goals. Musk said the company is aiming to \"ramp up Optimus production faster than maybe anything has ever been ramped.\"\n\n\"It doesn't take very many years before we're making 100 million of these things a year if you go up by, let's say, a factor by 5x per year,\" he said.\n\nThe rollout of Tesla's first robotaxi rides\n\nTesla showed off what its autonomous ride-hailing app could look like at an event last year. Tesla\n\nOn the autonomous vehicle front, Musk said he expects 2025 to see the rollout of fully self-driving cars.\n\n\"But I think we'll have unsupervised FSD in almost every market this year, limited simply by regulatory issues, not technical capability,\" Musk said. \"And then unsupervised FSD in the US this year, in many cities, but nationwide next year.\"\n\nRegulatory scrutiny could prove to be an obstacle \u2014 Tesla's supervised FSD program has already been subject to regulator scrutiny. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a probe into the tech in 2024, after reports of four crashes, one resulting in a fatality, in which Tesla's FSD was believed to be engaged.\n\nStill, Musk said that the technology itself is there, with thousands of Teslas are already \"operating autonomously\" with unsupervised FSD at its California factory in Fremont. He added that Teslas will be driving \"in the wild\" with no oversight in Austin by June, with California to follow by the end of the year.\n\n\"So, what I'm saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation,\" he said. \"It's literally five, six months away, five months away kind of thing.\"\n\nMusk acknowledged that he's been promising FSD for a long time, but said he's now confident that Tesla can deliver.\n\n\"Some of these things I've said for quite a long time, and I know people have said, 'Well, Elon, the boy who cried like a wolf like several times,'\" Musk said. \"But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time and you can drive it. In fact, it could drive you. It's a self-driving wolf.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nA less-expensive Tesla\n\nMusk has said 2025 will also see a cheaper Tesla finally hit the market. He's previously said a more affordable model could cost around $25,000 dollars, which would make it the first sub-$30,000 Tesla.\n\n\"We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025 and will continue to expand our lineup from there,\" said Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's CFO, on the company's most recent earnings call.\n\nLast year, Tesla sales dipped amid a wider EV slowdown and increased competition, particularly from Chinese rival BYD, which has a $9,500 EV available for purchase.\n\nRegardless of Musk's bigger-picture focus on autonomy, the majority of Tesla's profits still come from EV sales, which a cheaper model could help boost.\n\nThe lower-cost vehicle could be built on Tesla's \"next-generation\" vehicle platform, with the same manufacturing lines pumping out both Tesla's $25,000 vehicle and upcoming Cybercab robotaxi.\n\nIt's less clear what the lower-cost vehicle will look like, as Musk has previously said Tesla doesn't plan to simply launch a version of the Cybercab with a steering wheel and pedals.\n\nA refresh for Model S and Model X\n\nLars Moravy, Tesla's Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, teased a possible update to Tesla's Model X and Model S, which could come later this year.\n\n\"Just give it a minute. We'll get there,\" Moravy said on an episode of \"Ride the Lightning.\"\n\nMusk has previously said that Tesla continues to manufacture the S and X largely for \"sentimental reasons,\" calling them niche products, but Moravy said the company isn't likely to stop production of the cars \"anytime soon.\"\n\n\"The upgrade a couple years ago was bigger than most people thought, you know, in terms of architecture and structure, and the car got a lot better, too,\" Moravy said. \"We'll give it some love, you know, later this year \u2014 make sure it gets a little bit, you know, of the stuff we've been putting in 3 and Y.\"\n\nMoravy didn't provide further detail on what exactly the update would include. The Model S and Model X \u2014 which were introduced in 2012 and 2015, respectively \u2014 last received a refresh in 2021.\n\nMoravy said the company plans on continuing to focus on the 3 and Y to stay \"competitive\" and that everyone at Tesla has \"a little place in their heart for S and X.\"\n\n\"Definitely there's some nostalgia to them and keeping them around, and we don't have any immediate plans to change that,\" he added.",

At a recent staff meeting, some of these managers expressed that the company would be better off if Musk resigned, per WaPo.\n\n\"He seems to have ghosted his own company,\" Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, and who donated the majority of her Tesla stock last year, told the newspaper. \"He has inflicted a massive amount of damage on the perception of that company.\"\n\nWhat's more, many employees fear that Musk may be permanently damaging Tesla's reputation by his association with Trump \u2014 and of course, his personal conduct, like performing Nazi salutes.\n\n\"While Musk might get away with a [Nazi-like] salute in some parts of the world, European markets reject such behavior,\" Tim Kraaijvanger, founder of the Dutch Tesla blog Tesla360.nl, told Wired. \"World War Two still casts a long shadow.\"\n\nThese concerns come after a lackluster year for Tesla, with faltering sales, plunging profits, and stagnating revenue.\n\nAutomotive sales have been particularly bad in Europe, Wired notes, with a 13 percent drop in the European Union. But nowhere are the numbers more damning than in Norway, a country where 88.9 percent of all new cars sold are electric vehicles. Strikingly, Tesla sales fell in the Nordic country by 37.9 percent in 2024.\n\nHow much of the slump is attributable to Musk's self-immolation is up for debate, but it's undeniably a factor. In the US but especially Europe, various forms of protest have sprung up against Musk and Tesla, including public demonstrations and, more pervasively, vandalism of Tesla cars and locations, which typically involves spray-painting anti-Nazi imagery.\n\nNot that Tesla's competitors will be complaining. \"We have seen an increase in people writing to us and switching to Polestar in recent months,\" Michael Lohscheller, CEO of the Swedish EV company Polestar, told Wired.\n\nIn short, Tesla employees' fears that Musk could tank the company are more than justified.\n\nAnd what threatens to get lost in all the bedlam is that even if Tesla keeps its position as a leading automaker, it's sacrificing its identity.\n\nPer WaPo, employees are now beginning to doubt whether Musk still supports the company's mission to accelerate \"the world's transition to sustainable energy.\" For one, Musk continues to support Trump even though the president intends to eliminate federal EV tax credits, which are nominally intended to incentivize a transition away from gas guzzling cars. Trump has also issued executive orders to reverse various climate change policies, while declaring a \"national emergency\" as a ploy to ramp up the production of fossil fuels.\n\nNone of this jibes with whatever's left intact of Tesla's original green image.\n\n\"We invested into this vision of what he stood for, and the old mission was for Tesla to build the sustainable future,\" Kevin Smith, a longtime shareholder who recently sold all his stock, told WaPo. \"I bought into the scam and that\u2019s on me \u2014 but now he\u2019s doing the same thing to the country.\"\n\nMore on Tesla: State Department Says Contract for $400 Million of \"Armored Teslas\" on Hold After Explosive Outcry",

Although Tesla has already enabled adaptive headlights in Europe and other regions, North American owners still do not have the feature due to different standards. In an episode of Jay Leno\u2019s Garage (video below), Lars mentioned that adaptive headlights are just a few months away in the U.S. and that many Tesla vehicles already have the necessary hardware\u2014it\u2019s simply a matter of enabling the feature via software. Matrix or adaptive headlights selectively dim individual pixels, which greatly improves road safety by better illuminating the road for Tesla drivers and reducing blinding lights for oncoming traffic. Two Months Away Lars has now confirmed on X that Tesla has received regulatory approval for matrix headlights in the United States and that the hard part is now over. The company will begin rolling out adaptive headlights, starting with the new Model Y, and then expand it to the rest of their vehicles that have matrix headlights. Rivian and Mercedes-Benz have already rolled out full matrix headlight systems in North America, putting Tesla slightly behind as it works on its own implementation. Canada and Mexico Unlike in the U.S., Tesla won\u2019t face regulatory hurdles in Canada and Mexico, where adaptive headlights and matrix functionality were approved several years earlier. Once Tesla ensures compliance with local guidelines, enabling the feature should be a straightforward process. High-Resolution vs Low-Resolution Tesla first introduced matrix headlights with a high-resolution LED matrix headlight, allowing precise control over individual pixels. Over time, they transitioned to a lower-resolution version of the same system. While the headlights can no longer project things like \u201cTESLA\u201d during a light show, they\u2019re likely cheaper to produce. Whether your vehicle has the original high-resolution matrix headlights or the newer low-resolution version, once Tesla enables the feature, the experience should be similar.

The achievement demonstrates Tesla\u2019s engineering prowess. As one engineer points out, it wasn\u2019t an easy feat. Interestingly, the NHTSA only recently disclosed the results, despite the crash tests being completed a while ago. According to Lars Moravy, Tesla\u2019s VP of Vehicle Engineering, the team had been aware of the 5-star rating for quite some time. While the reason for the delay remains unclear, now that the results are public, Tesla\u2019s engineers can finally share how they achieved the rating. Crumple Zones Wes Morril, the Cybertruck\u2019s Lead Engineer, wrote about the crash test video on X recently, addressing the claims that the Cybertruck doesn\u2019t have a crumple zone. He also posted a side-by-side video (below) of the engineering analysis and the crash test itself. Engineered Crash Safety There\u2019s a lot of engineering precision at play when a Cybertruck is involved in a crash. Unlike traditional crash structures that rely on crash cans and collapse points, the Cybertruck\u2019s front gigacasting is designed to absorb and redirect impact forces in a highly controlled manner. It all starts with the bumper beam, which crushes within the first few milliseconds of a high-speed impact. At the same time, the vehicle\u2019s sensors rapidly analyze the crash dynamics and determine the optimal deployment of safety restraints, including airbags and seat belt pre-tensioners. These split-second actions are crucial in keeping occupants safe. As the crash progresses, the vehicle\u2019s structure deforms in a carefully engineered sequence. The drive unit cradle bends, directing the solid drive unit downward and out of the way, allowing the gigacasting to begin absorbing impact forces. The casting crushes cell by cell, methodically dissipating energy in a controlled manner. This gradual deceleration reduces the g-forces transferred to occupants, making the crash much less severe. As the gigacast begins crushing, the safety restraints are deployed. As Wes points out in his post - you can see how accurate the virtual analysis and modeling were. The video shows the simulated crash side by side with the real-life crash test and they\u2019re almost identical. All that virtual testing helps provide feedback into the loop to design a better and safer system - one that is uniquely different than any other vehicle on the road. All the armchair experts claimed the Cybertruck has no crumple zone and I get it, the proportions seem impossible. It was a tough one and there is a lot of engineering that went into it. Let me break it down for you:\n\n\n\nHere you can see the large single piece casting in action in a\u2026 https://t.co/Jk4X5erTcm pic.twitter.com/24Nmb1bmU5 \u2014 Wes (@wmorrill3) February 20, 2025",

A spokesperson with the State Department declined to comment when reached by CBS News, saying they don't comment on congressional correspondence.\n\nMusk, the world's wealthiest person, who is also CEO of SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), has enormous government contracts and was a huge contributor to Mr. Trump's campaign.\n\nHe heads the newly-created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which, while not an official government agency, is aggressively pursuing ways to cut the federal budget.\n\nMusk's team has gone into computer systems in numerous agencies looking for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse.

Perhaps his worst offense was giving what appeared to be a Nazi salute at the recent inauguration of the so-called president of the United States. That one act incensed a wide number of current and potential customers, particularly in Europe, where sales of Tesla automobiles have plummeted since the ketamine addict who is the world\u2019s richest person endorsed the neo-Nazi party.\n\nMusk pooh-poohs his ketamine usage, but for the uninitiated, here is how the DEA describes the drug: \u201cKetamine produces hallucinations. It distorts perceptions of sight and sound and makes the user feel disconnected and not in control. Ketamine may cause unwanted side effects such as: agitation, depression, cognitive difficulties, unconsciousness, and amnesia. Involuntarily rapid eye movement, dilated pupils, salivation, tear secretions, and stiffening of the muscles, possible nausea.\u201d This person should be nowhere near sensitive information and yet he has been handed the keys to the federal government by the clown posing as the president and told to dismantle it as rapidly as possible. His unhinged behavior is having a strong negative effect on the company he is too busy to run.\n\nTesla Toxicity In Europe\n\nAccording to Wired, in January, S\u0142awomir Nitrasoland, the sports and tourism minister for Poland, lobbied for a Tesla boycott. \u201cThere is no justification for any reasonable Pole to continue purchasing Teslas,\u201d he said. In Germany, where Musk has caused outrage by endorsing far-right political party Alternative for Germany, going so far as to appear as a surprise video guest at the party\u2019s national election campaign launch last month, several companies have cut ties with Tesla.\n\nDrugstore chain Rossmann, with 4,700 stores across Europe, has replaced Tesla in its electric fleet with other EV brands, citing the \u201cincompatibility\u201d of its corporate values and Musk\u2019s ideology. German energy company LichtBlick said on LinkedIn post, \u201cWe are pulling the plug on Tesla vehicles in our fleet.\u201d Kevin L\u00fctje, the firm\u2019s real estate head, told Wired, \u201cElon Musk\u2019s support of Donald Trump and his recommendation to vote for a right wing populist and right wing extremist party \u2026 is in no way compatible with LichtBlick\u2019s values.\u201d He stated that \u201cclimate protection and electromobility are extremely important to us, but in the future we will be relying on providers other than Tesla.\u201d\n\nTim Kraaijvanger of the Netherlands is the founder of Tesla360.nl, a Dutch everything-Tesla site. He recently sold his Model Y and bought a Polestar instead. \u201cWhile Musk might get away with a [Nazi-like] salute in some parts of the world, European markets reject such behavior,\u201d Kraaijvanger said. \u201cWorld War Two still casts a long shadow.\u201d He recently sold his Tesla Model Y for half what he paid for it but said he accepted the loss because he no longer wanted to be associated with that brand and its lunatic leader. Recently an English advocacy group that calls itself Led by Donkeys and Germany\u2019s Center for Political Beauty beamed an image of Musk making his Nazi-like salute onto Tesla\u2019s gigafactory in Berlin, with the word \u201cHeil\u201d projected next to the lit Tesla logo. \u201cThis is who Elon Musk really is. Don\u2019t buy a Tesla,\u201d the group urged its followers.\n\nTesla sales are in free fall in Europe and the UK right now. Last month, Norway recorded a 37.9 percent slump. Tesla sales in France fell by 63.4 percent; in Spain, Tesla sales plummeted by 75.4 percent. Driving a Tesla on public roads is becoming increasingly problematic in Europe. Social media is rife with images of Teslas vandalized with swastikas and expletives. Dealerships are also being targeted. Vandals sprayed graffiti on a Tesla car showroom in The Hague in early February, defacing the building with \u201cNo to Nazis\u201d and anti-fascist slogans. Startup crowdfunded group Everyone Hates Elon has been distributing anti-Tesla stickers in London, while left-wing outlet Novara Media is reporting that \u201chundreds\u201d of Tesla owners have returned to their parked EVs to find them defaced with hard-to-remove roundels featuring a grinning Musk plastered with a Hitler-aping toothbrush mustache and the request not to \u201cbuy a Swastikar.\u201d\n\nDisgruntled Tesla Owners\n\nSome Tesla owners are also adding \u201cI Bought This Before I Knew Elon Was Crazy\u201d bumper stickers. \u201cI have seen massive uplift in sales across Europe,\u201d Matthew Hiller of Mad Puffer Stickers told Wired. \u201cLeading the way are buyers from France, Norway, and the UK. I used to want a Tesla until Elon turned into a full-on fascist,\u201d claims Hiller, who adds there are a \u201clot of disgruntled Tesla owners out there\u201d and claims to have sold thousands of sticker sets around the world. \u201cI went so far as to test drive a Tesla in 2023, but at that time, [Musk\u2019s] purchase of Twitter was complete, and I saw what he was doing to the platform. Skewing the algorithm to favor alt-right voices, promoting disinformation, banning people he didn\u2019t like. Using his influence to wade into politics really turned me off buying a Tesla. It\u2019s a MAGA hat on wheels.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s \u201csalute\u201d boosted his sales tremendously, Hiller said. \u201cIt has been a sustained 500 sales a day since the salute. That moment broke through all the usual Elon noise. Even the people who only casually pay attention to what is happening in the government woke up at that moment and were like \u2018Holy shit, what have we done?\u2019\u201d\n\nTesla shareholder Karen R\u00f3bertsd\u00f3ttir of Reykjavik, Iceland, said: \u201cThe Tesla groups over here in Iceland used to never have the sort of \u2018I can\u2019t buy a Tesla because of Elon\u2019 stuff you\u2019d see in the States. But now it\u2019s everywhere, and the people I talk to elsewhere in Europe are seeing the same thing. I\u2019ve defended you guys so much over the years, and you make great products, but even I can\u2019t stick up for you anymore,\u201d she said on her YouTube channel. A long-time Tesla stockholder, one of her resolutions calling on Tesla\u2019s board to release a succession plan for Musk and other \u201ckey persons\u201d whose behavior could create a risk for the company and shareholders was put to a vote at Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in 2023, \u201cWhen people look at this company,\u201d she said at the meeting, \u201cthey see the company as a synonym for its CEO.\u201d The board recommended rejecting the resolution and it was duly voted down.\n\nThere are many reasons for Tesla\u2019s waning fortunes in Europe, but Musk\u2019s steady descent from real-life Tony Stark to MAGA power broker seems to be a key reason for Tesla\u2019s current precipitous fall from grace, Wired suggests. Tesla sales dropped 13 percent across the whole European Union in 2024, according to data from the industry body ACEA, and in many key markets the fall is still steeper. According to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, Tesla registered only 1,277 new cars in Germany in January, a year-on-year drop of 59.5 percent.\n\nEmbarrassed\n\nA recent survey by Dutch news outlet EenVandaag got responses from 432 Tesla drivers. Some \u201c31 percent are either contemplating selling their car or have already done so,\u201d the survey found. Forty percent of owners felt embarrassed to own a Tesla. \u201cBy any measure, these are statistics that no car company wants to own,\u201d Wired says. And yet the Great and Powerful Musk seems utterly unconcerned by all the negativity swirling around him. Maybe it\u2019s the ketamine, or maybe he is just drunk with power like so many others in Assington, DC, at the moment. The headline to the Wired story says it all: \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Toxicity Could Spell Disaster for Tesla.\u201d\n\nElon has more zeros in his bank account than anyone ever in the history of the world, but he still puts his pants on one leg at a time. Sadly, he shows absolutely no interest in preserving Tesla. What a waste of a company that was once the envy of the world.",

            "content": "Tesla has officially started deploying a software update activating its in-cabin radar, a feature that has been supported and expected for a few years, and one that may require a retrofit for some owners.\n\nOn Friday, Tesla began rolling out software update 2025.2.6, featuring the activation of its in-cabin radar located just above the passenger dome light. The company lists the feature in its owner\u2019s manuals, noting that the cabin radar is currently only available for 2022 model-year Model Y units and later, though it\u2019s also expected to roll out to refreshed Model 3 and Cybertruck units at some point.\n\nSome have also said that they believe the refreshed Model S and Model X have been equipped with the radar hardware, so it\u2019s possible these vehicles could also receive the feature. Tesla calls the feature the First-Row Cabin Sensing Update in the release notes for 2025.2.6, which also seems to be related to the company\u2019s debut of the so-called 4D Radar in the new Model Y.\n\nWhat does Tesla\u2019s in-cabin radar do?\n\n\u201cCabin radar can detect the presence of people inside the vehicle and use the measurements to determine occupancy,\u201d Tesla writes in the owner\u2019s manual. \u201cCabin radar supports certain vehicle and safety features, such as occupancy detection for the front passenger seat.\u201d\n\nThe benefit of cabin radar is that it uses radio waves to detect objects and passengers inside the vehicle, and it can do so more precisely than the selfie camera when identifying what exactly is in the front and rear seats. Recently, Tesla has also highlighted the 4D radar system\u2019s ability to pick up on things like the heartbeat of a pet or small child, offering an extra layer of safety for passengers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE ON IN-CABIN RADAR: Tesla plans to use cabin radar, ditching seat sensors for safety\n\nIn a video interview with Tesla Owners Silicon Valley earlier this week, the company\u2019s Model Y Program Manager, Emmanuel Lamacchia, also detailed the 4D imaging radar, saying that it both detects and classifies passengers based on their size. This lets the system toggle necessary airbags and even take further precautions against passengers being left behind in the vehicle.\n\nEventually, Lamacchia says the system will be able to protect against a child or pet being left behind by sending a reminder to owners, turning on the HVAC system, rolling down the window, or even calling 911. The Model Y Program Manager says that these will be enabled in the refreshed model in Q3.\n\nTesla\u2019s Lead Cybertruck Engineer said on X on Friday that, while incidents related to these issues are extremely low, their severity can be extremely high, pointing to the importance of the upcoming feature.\n\nYou can watch the full talk from Lamacchia and Tesla Owners Silicon Valley below, with the bit about the 4D in-cabin radar starting around 30:30.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

            "content": "Tesla Adds New Anti-Theft Protection for Supercharger Cables Tesla has begun installing new anti-theft measures on some Supercharger cables, consisting of an exterior wrap called DyeDefender and engravings on the copper wiring inside the cables. Like other high-speed EV charging stations, Superchargers have been frequent targets of vandalism and theft. While vandalism can often be mitigated through increased security, theft presents a bigger challenge. Thieves primarily target the copper inside the charging cables, which is densely packed and valuable as scrap metal. DyeDefender To address this, Tesla is trialing DyeDefender, a theft deterrent system commonly used to protect catalytic converters. It consists of a pressurized staining dye housed within a stainless steel hose called CatStrap, which wraps around the Supercharger cable. The CatStrap is highly resistant to cutting, but if breached, it releases a bright blue dye. While harmless, the dye is difficult to remove, making it easier to identify suspects. Engraved Cables In addition to DyeDefender, Tesla is also engraving the actual copper wiring inside the cables, making stolen material harder to sell since scrapyards often reject marked metals. This solution is more scalable, cost-effective, and doesn\u2019t disrupt service operations or the customer experience\u2014it simply involves engraving the copper inside the cables. Supercharger cables will be permanently marked with \u201cProperty of Tesla Motors,\u201d engraved directly at the factory in Buffalo, New York. Recycling companies and scrap yards will immediately recognize that the cables belong to Tesla and refuse to accept them. Instead, they may notify Tesla that they\u2019ve received stolen goods. While this may not have an immediate impact, over time, as thieves realize that stolen Supercharger copper is unsellable and could get them caught, they\u2019ll be less inclined to target them. It\u2019s interesting to see Tesla experiment with unique ways to protect Supercharger sites. While the company will likely focus on DyeDefender deployments in high-theft areas, this remains a trial phase. The full impact of cable engraving may take time to materialize, but it should prove effective in the long run. In the meantime, continue reporting any downed Supercharger sites through the Tesla app by navigating to Location > Charging > Select Site > Report an Issue.

The achievement demonstrates Tesla\u2019s engineering prowess. As one engineer points out, it wasn\u2019t an easy feat. Interestingly, the NHTSA only recently disclosed the results, despite the crash tests being completed a while ago. According to Lars Moravy, Tesla\u2019s VP of Vehicle Engineering, the team had been aware of the 5-star rating for quite some time. While the reason for the delay remains unclear, now that the results are public, Tesla\u2019s engineers can finally share how they achieved the rating. Crumple Zones Wes Morril, the Cybertruck\u2019s Lead Engineer, wrote about the crash test video on X recently, addressing the claims that the Cybertruck doesn\u2019t have a crumple zone. He also posted a side-by-side video (below) of the engineering analysis and the crash test itself. Engineered Crash Safety There\u2019s a lot of engineering precision at play when a Cybertruck is involved in a crash. Unlike traditional crash structures that rely on crash cans and collapse points, the Cybertruck\u2019s front gigacasting is designed to absorb and redirect impact forces in a highly controlled manner. It all starts with the bumper beam, which crushes within the first few milliseconds of a high-speed impact. At the same time, the vehicle\u2019s sensors rapidly analyze the crash dynamics and determine the optimal deployment of safety restraints, including airbags and seat belt pre-tensioners. These split-second actions are crucial in keeping occupants safe. As the crash progresses, the vehicle\u2019s structure deforms in a carefully engineered sequence. The drive unit cradle bends, directing the solid drive unit downward and out of the way, allowing the gigacasting to begin absorbing impact forces. The casting crushes cell by cell, methodically dissipating energy in a controlled manner. This gradual deceleration reduces the g-forces transferred to occupants, making the crash much less severe. As the gigacast begins crushing, the safety restraints are deployed. As Wes points out in his post - you can see how accurate the virtual analysis and modeling were. The video shows the simulated crash side by side with the real-life crash test and they\u2019re almost identical. All that virtual testing helps provide feedback into the loop to design a better and safer system - one that is uniquely different than any other vehicle on the road. All the armchair experts claimed the Cybertruck has no crumple zone and I get it, the proportions seem impossible. It was a tough one and there is a lot of engineering that went into it. Let me break it down for you:\n\n\n\nHere you can see the large single piece casting in action in a\u2026 https://t.co/Jk4X5erTcm pic.twitter.com/24Nmb1bmU5 \u2014 Wes (@wmorrill3) February 20, 2025",

            "content": "Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) stock soared to a new record high in December, shortly after President Trump's election win. Investors are betting on friendlier regulations, which could help the company bring its full-self-driving (FSD) software to market much faster than previously expected, especially since CEO Elon Musk is currently serving as an advisor to the administration.\n\nFSD has the potential to transform Tesla's economics, but that could still take years, even with an accelerated approval timeline (more on this later). In the meantime, the company is struggling with declining passenger electric-vehicle (EV) sales, which is where most of its revenue comes from right now.\n\nThat's part of the reason Tesla stock has fallen 31% from its recent record high. Here's why I predict it could plunge by another 50% over the next year or so.\n\nTesla's electric-vehicle sales are shrinking\n\nUp until the end of 2023, Musk consistently told investors that Tesla could grow its annual EV production by 50% per year, on average. The company delivered 1.8 million cars that year, which was a 38% increase, compared to 2022. It wasn't quite 50% but still a very strong result.\n\nHowever, 2024 was a totally different story. EV deliveries shrank by 1%, compared to 2023, marking the first annual decline since Tesla launched the flagship Model S in 2011. The company is facing some grim realities, including a sharp increase in competition and softening demand for EVs overall as consumers weigh issues like depreciation and availability of charging infrastructure.\n\nSimply put, it's impossible for Tesla to grow production by 50% per year if the cars aren't selling. Musk told investors he expects sales to rebound during 2025, with EV deliveries potentially growing by as much as 30%. However, the early signs are very troubling.\n\nIn January, Tesla's sales plunged by 63% year over year in France, almost 60% in Germany, 44% in Sweden, and 38% in Norway. Sales were even down by over 33% in Australia.\n\nHere's the kicker: In Germany, sales of EVs overall actually increased by 53%, which implies Tesla is rapidly losing market share.\n\nThese challenges are likely to get worse as the year progresses, as more EVs come to market from low-cost manufacturers, like China-based BYD. It already sells its Seagull model for $10,000 in its domestic market and is expected to enter Europe this year.\n\nFSD and a new $10 trillion opportunity\n\nTesla unveiled its Cybercab robotaxi last year, which will be powered by its FSD software. In fact, it won't even come with pedals or a steering wheel. Musk wants to build a ride-hailing network in which Cybercabs can haul passengers and even make commercial deliveries around the clock, creating a new, high-margin revenue stream for Tesla.\n\nCathie Wood's Ark Investment Management thinks autonomous ride-hailing could drive Tesla's annual revenue to over $1.2 trillion by 2029, representing a staggering 12-fold growth from its 2024 result of $97.6 billion. Other Wall Street analysts, like Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities, have also predicted that FSD will be a trillion-dollar opportunity for the company.\n\nThe Cybercab isn't scheduled to go into mass production until 2026, so those forecasts will take years to play out. That brings me to another long-term opportunity for Tesla -- the Optimus humanoid robot -- which Musk says will have a thousand times more use cases than a car.\n\nTesla plans to use several thousand Optimus robots inside its manufacturing facilities this year to complete repetitive and even dangerous tasks that human employees don't want to do. Given the versatility of humanoid robots, the potential customer base is almost limitless because they can be used in factories, households, and everything in between.\n\nPlus, since Optimus is expected to sell for under $30,000, it will be extremely cheap, compared to the ongoing annual cost of a human worker. Its value proposition is obvious for businesses all over the world.\n\nMusk thinks Optimus will generate $10 trillion worth of sales over the long term and even predicts robots will outnumber humans by the year 2040.\n\nTesla stock is wildly expensive, which could lead to a drop of 50% or more\n\nTesla generated $2.04 in earnings per share (EPS) during 2024, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 161. That's an eye-popping valuation, considering the Nasdaq 100 technology index -- which is home to all of Tesla's big-tech peers -- trades at a P/E of just 33.6.\n\nIt also makes Tesla three times more expensive than Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/E of 52.2. Nvidia will report its financial results for its fiscal year 2025 on Feb. 26 and is expected to have grown its EPS by a whopping 126%. Tesla's EPS, on the other hand, plunged by 53% during 2024. Therefore, it's incredibly difficult to justify the enormous premium in Tesla's valuation right now.\n\nWith that said, Tesla stock has always traded at a premium valuation to the broader market. But in the past, it was supported by the incredible growth in the company's EV business. That's no longer the case.\n\nEV sales still account for 78% of Tesla's total revenue, so the recent decline is a problem because the company's future potential growth drivers, like autonomous driving and the Optimus robot, aren't expected to scale up until after 2026. That means investors might have to brace for another year of weak earnings in 2025, which makes Tesla's current valuation even harder to stomach.\n\nAs I mentioned at the top, Tesla stock is down 31% from its all-time high already. But even if it plunged by another 50%, its P/E ratio would still be above 80. The stock would have to decline by 67% just to trade in line with Nvidia's P/E ratio, or 79% to trade in line with the P/E ratio of the Nasdaq 100. That's assuming the company's earnings don't fall even further, which is a real possibility.\n\nAs a result, I think significant downside is on the horizon for Tesla stock over the next year or so. If it does fall by another 50%, investors who believe in the potential of the Cybercab and Optimus might be faced with an attractive long-term buying opportunity.",

Artists are printing and distributing posters that call for a Tesla boycott. And some Tesla owners in Berkeley are expressing regret they own a car associated with a man they believe is assaulting the constitution.\n\nMeanwhile, sales associates at the Tesla dealership on Fourth Street said Thursday that the showroom, which opened in December, has already weathered small protests and can handle any pickets on Saturday.

Fur Master Race Only! \u201c The sticker also had derogatory things to say about Jews and Black people, implying all Tesla owners are Nazi sympathizers. The man reported the sticker to Berkeley police, he wrote on Nextdoor. Officer Jessica Perry, BPD\u2019s public information officer, said she could not find a record of the report.

It featured a picture of Musk doing a Nazi salute and read: \u201cSell your car or we will get rid of it for you. Nazi cars not welcome here.\u201d\n\nThe police department in Arcata in northern California reported that four Teslas had threatening flyers stuck in their windshields in early February, according to The Lost Coast Outpost, a local newspaper. The news organization received an envelope in the mail from a group calling itself SANE, which stands for Students Against Nazi Extremism. There was a note that contained \u201ca manifesto, of sorts, and plan of attack,\u201d the Outpost reported. \u201cIt calls Tesla CEO Elon Musk \u2018an overt Nazi with a history of fascist, racist, misogynist and criminal behavior\u2019 and describes a plan to \u2018inflict physical damage to Tesla-branded vehicles\u2019 over the next month or so.\u201d\n\nWhat Musk is doing\n\nMusk donated $250 million to help elect Trump, who then appointed him to oversee the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, not an official government department. But Musk is not a government employee. He is acting in his capacity as a private citizen.\n\nMusk has long railed against government regulations, complaining that they slow down business innovation. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, at least 11 departments of the federal government were investigating Musk\u2019s various businesses, which extend from the computer screen, to the mind, to the car, to space, according to the New York Times. There were 32 investigations, including ones by the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Economic Opportunity Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into aspects of Tesla\u2019s operations. Investigators were also probing Space X, Neurolink, and the social news site X.\n\nMany of those agencies have been decimated or undermined by Musk and Trump, which calls into question the future of those investigations, according to the Times. DOGE has also overseen the firing or suspensions of tens of thousands of federal employees, including many who oversee the country\u2019s nuclear stockpile, although the courts have slowed those down. It has terminated billions of dollars of grants and completely eliminated USAID, which distributed billions of dollars in foreign aid to help countries with health care and other pressing social issues.\n\nSome of Musk\u2019s claims and reasons for canceling the aid have already been debunked, including the contention that the Biden administration distributed $50 million in condoms to people in Gaza. Musk admitted at a recent press conference that was not true.\n\nDOGE is first reporting many of these actions on X, which Musk owns.\n\nFourteen states, including California, filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge what they characterized as Trump\u2019s \u201cunlawful delegation of executive power\u201d to Musk and DOGE, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cThe 14 states argued that Mr. Trump had violated the appointments clause of the Constitution by granting sweeping powers to Mr. Musk, who has \u2018transformed a minor position that was formerly responsible for managing government websites into a designated agent of chaos without limitation,\u2019\u201d the paper wrote.\n\nThe swift and broad actions by the Trump administration have unnerved many Berkeley and Bay area residents who are overwhelmingly liberal and vote Democratic. While thousands marched in the streets during the first Trump Administration, the protests in Trump\u2019s second term have been smaller.\n\nThere is no single organization organizing protests at Tesla dealerships. The group Anonymous posted a call for demonstrations on Bluesky and X. Others are joining in the call under the hashtag #teslatakedown.\n\nThe Action Network website is promoting the location of the Saturday protests. So far, more than 30 are scheduled around the country, including one at noon at the Tesla showroom in Berkeley.\n\n\u201cThis Saturday, we hit Tesla showrooms everywhere,\u201d reads the site. \u201cSell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines. Hurting Tesla is stopping Musk. Stopping Musk will help save lives and our democracy. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. No one is coming to save us\u2014not politicians, not the media.\u201d\n\nTesla sales down in California\n\nMusk\u2019s actions, as well as his vocal support for right-wing groups in Germany, may be affecting sales. Sales in Germany dropped 59% in January and plunged in France and the United Kingdom, by 63% and 12%, respectively, according to Bloomberg News. Sales in California were down 11.6% in 2024, according to Newsweek.\n\nThe sales manager at the Tesla dealership in Berkeley, which has an $80,000 gleaming stainless steel Cybertruck on display in the middle of the showroom, declined to give specific figures but said his team was \u201cvery busy.\u201d\n\nAnna Mantell bought her blue Tesla Model 3 in December 2021. While she loves driving the car \u2014 \u201cit appeals to the teenage boy in me\u201d \u2014 she now associates it with Musk and would like to sell. \u201cI resent and dislike Elon, and it\u2019s carrying over to the automobile,\u201d said Mantell, who lives in Berkeley.\n\nHelmrich\u2019s negative feelings about owning a Tesla came to an abrupt end on Jan. 11. She and her husband got into an auto accident. No one was hurt, but the Tesla was totaled.\n\n\u201cThe upside of the accident was that we bought an electric Volvo,\u201d said Helmrich. \u201cI\u2019m very happy not to be driving that car [the Tesla].\u201d",

But whatever support the environmentally minded singer formerly had for the EVs has been superseded by her alarm at the rightward political turn taken by the man she now calls \u201cPresident Musk,\u201d and so she is saying: \u201cSo long Tesla.\u201d\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram, Crow stands on the street as her Tesla is towed away. The caption says that she has sold the car and donated the money to NPR, \u201cwhich is under threat by President Musk.\u201d\n\nHer statement begins: \u201cMy parents always said\u2026 you are who you hang out with. There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla.\u201d\n\nCrow is part of a wave of liberally minded Tesla owners who have decided they can no longer drive cars so closely associated with the world\u2019s richest man, now that he has been set up by President Donald Trump as seemingly his closest advisor. Earlier this week, Musk \u2014 who, as head of the unofficial government agency DOGE, is taking the lead on eliminating thousands of federal government jobs and cutting back agencies and services \u2014 stood literally as Trump\u2019s right-hand man in a headline-making Oval Office news conference where he, not the president, did most of the talking.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCrow\u2019s social media message continued: \u201cMoney donated to @npr, which is under threat by President Musk, in hopes that the truth will continue to find its way to those willing to know the truth.\u201d\n\nThe singer\u2019s message closed out by adding hashtags for #PresidentMusk as well as #PresidentTrump and #ProtectTheConstitution, plus the suggestion to call 202-224-3141, the switchboard for the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIt was a far cry from five years ago, when Crow retweeted Musk as he offered a solution for a problem she had tweeted out about the screen on her Tesla going black.\n\nThe immediate responses to Crow\u2019s Tesla-farewell message fell along predictable lines, with many applauding her for the move, and some conservatives \u2014 who have long ridiculed the singer for her progressive stances \u2014 finding a fresh reason to slam her activism.\n\nSome of Crow\u2019s fellow Nashvillians were particularly supportive. Kacey Musgraves left no less than two messages of support for the artist she considers royalty, calling her both \u201cSheryl Queen\u201d and \u201cSheryl CrowN.\u201d Wrote Margo Price: \u201cLove to see it.\u201d And Alyssa Milano left an emoticon face with hearts in its eyes.\n\nAmong responses from the right, Instagram users posted messages like: \u201cYou realize Musk already got the money for that one right? If you like the car, you only hurt yourself.\u201d \u2026 \u201cSo you support wasteful government spending, money that could\u2019ve gone to support our veterans. Got it.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI so love it when wealthy liberals that tell the struggling rest of us how morally justified it is that the government must continue to waste our tax money.\u201d \u2026 \u201cYou loved Elon when he donated to Dems. Now that he\u2019s uncovering fraud and waste on a grand scale that is mind-boggling, you\u2019re all full of virtue signaling. Oh, we\u2019re so impressed.\u201d\n\nSome even claimed they were fine with her until this last straw, unlikely as that might be given her long history of taking positions on the environment, gun control and other issues. \u201cLife long fan unfollowing your stupid liberal ass!\u201d wrote one.\n\nCrow was most recently seen as part of the all-star band opening the Grammys with a song in support of fire relief aid for Los Angeles. Her most recent album, \u201cEvolution,\u201d was released last year. In 2023, she was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n",

Both entrepreneurs pin their car switch on Musk\u2019s support for European far-right political parties and his inauguration rally arm gestures.\n\n\u201cWhile Musk might get away with a [Nazi-like] salute in some parts of the world, European markets reject such behavior,\u201d Kraaijvanger tells WIRED. \u201cWorld War II still casts a long shadow.\" He may be right. Tesla sales are in free fall in Europe right now. Last month, Norway\u2014where EVs overtook internal combustion vehicles in total market share in 2024\u2014recorded a biting 37.9 percent slump.

He has owned several Tesla cars and, later this year, planned to upgrade to the refreshed $59,990 Model Y Juniper. Offloading his current Model Y has cost him dearly: \u201cI received only about half of the [Tesla\u2019s] original new price when selling it,\u201d he revealed. \u201cBut I do not wish to be associated with [Musk\u2019s] ideology.\u201d\n\nHe has yet to ditch his URLs, but then running websites is mainly anonymous. On the other hand, driving a Tesla on public roads is becoming increasingly problematic in Europe. Social media is rife with images of Teslas vandalized with Swastikas and expletives. Dealerships are also being targeted. Vandals sprayed graffiti on a Tesla car showroom in The Hague in early February, defacing the building with \u201cNo to Nazis\u201d and sweary anti-fascist slogans.\n\nOn a grander scale, the English campaign group Led by Donkeys recently teamed up with Germany\u2019s Center for Political Beauty to beam an image of Elon Musk making the inauguration salute onto Tesla\u2019s gigafactory in Berlin, with the word \u201cHeil\u201d projected next to the lit Tesla logo. \u201cThis is who Elon Musk really is,\u201d stressed Led by Donkeys across their well-followed social media accounts. \u201cDon\u2019t buy a Tesla\u201d urged the activists.\n\nStartup crowdfunded group Everyone Hates Elon has been distributing anti-Tesla stickers in London with left-wing outlet Novara Media reporting that \u201chundreds\u201d of Tesla owners have returned to their parked EVs to find them defaced with hard-to-remove roundels featuring a grinning Musk plastered with a Hitler-aping toothbrush mustache and the request not to \u201cbuy a Swastikar.\u201d",

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he was not aware of being named in that contract and Tesla\u2019s name has specifically been removed from the document.\n\nThis did not stop Senator Richard Blumenthal from writing a letter to Marco Rubio, the U.S. Secretary of State, challenging the contract, its amount, and what he called a \u201cconflict of interest,\u201d despite several things already being resolved.\n\nBlumenthal wrote, in a letter obtained by CBS News:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr. Musk\u2019s dual roles pose conflicts of interest so obvious that they hardly require explanation. The State Department\u2019s intent to purchase armored Cybertrucks suggests the conflicts of interest inherent in Mr. Musk\u2019s installation of his cronies throughout the government are not being adequately managed and, in fact, are increasing by the minute.\u201d\n\nSome of the things he said can be directly challenged, however.\n\nHe went on:\n\n\u201cIn the 15 months since it was released, the Cybertruck has been widely derided and subject to at least six separate recalls. Indeed, Tesla has reportedly had \u2018disastrous\u2019 sales numbers for the Cybertruck. It hardly seems like the type of reliable vehicle the State Department would choose for this contract absent a heavy thumb on the scale.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the six Tesla Cybertruck recalls can be resolved with Over-the-Air software updates, something that resolves things like a camera issue, without ever having to visit a service center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, the Tesla Cybertruck\u2019s \u201cdisastrous\u201d sales numbers slotted it as the best-selling EV pickup in the U.S. in 2024, in front of the Ford F-150 Lightning, according to Cox Automotive.\n\nIt was the fifth-best-selling EV in the United States last year, as well.\n\nBlumenthal is asking for a response from Secretary of State Rubio by February 21.\n\nNeed accessories for your Tesla?

The 100-day moving average is a key measure of longer-term market sentiment.\n\nThe reclaiming of the 100-day average comes after a nearly 6% bounce on Thursday. Shares rose about 1.5% in pre-market trading on Friday.\n\n\"Sentiment was way too negative \u2014 the best is still ahead for Elon Musk,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me.\n\nTesla remains one of Ives' top picks for 2025.\n\nRead more: Tesla robot rival just raised $350 million\n\nShares are still down 12% year to date and the worst-performing component of the \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla.\n\nThe drop is with good reason from a fundamental perspective.\n\nTesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to data released this week by the China Passenger Car Association. The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December.\n\nAt the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January.\n\nIn the US, prices on used Cybertrucks, Model 3s, Model Ss, Model Ys, and Model Xs continue to drop as Tesla faces increased EV competition and consumers opt for hybrids.\n\nIn the past 30 days, the average price of a Tesla has declined 1%, according to data from CarGurus. That brings the decline over the past 90 days to 5.49%. The fastest price declines are being witnessed in the Cybertruck.\n\n\"We're cautious on what's happening for the EV maker,\" Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination.\n\nMeanwhile, new tariffs from the Trump administration stand to raise costs for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nOn Monday, the president signed two executive orders imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla.\n\nTrump's new trade war with China doesn't help either \u2014 a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies.\n\nTesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe company's earnings per share missed analyst estimates by a penny.

            "content": "Tesla Inc. is challenging the state in court over a decision blocking it from opening dealerships in Wisconsin.\n\nLast year, the electric car company led by Elon Musk applied for dealer licenses to sell its vehicles. The state denied the request in December, saying Tesla did not qualify for an exemption to a state law prohibiting manufacturers from owning dealerships.\n\nOn Jan. 15, Tesla filed a petition for a judicial review of the decision in Outagamie County Circuit Court. The company asked the court to overturn the state\u2019s decision or order a new hearing on Tesla\u2019s request.\n\nStay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter. Email Comments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nIt comes after Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a decade last year. In California, the nation\u2019s largest electric vehicle market, the company\u2019s sales fell by around 12 percent last year. Tesla is also seeing a sales slump in Europe to start this year.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s court filings, more than 13,000 Tesla vehicles are registered in the state. Tesla estimates it sold between 3,000 and 4,000 electric vehicles to Wisconsin customers last year, and believes those sales would grow if it opened dealerships in the state.\n\nThe company operates two \u201cnon-sales galleries\u201d in Milwaukee and Madison, and its sales to Wisconsin customers typically happen in Illinois or Minnesota, court documents said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThere has been debate in the past about tweaking state law to allow Tesla to open dealerships in Wisconsin. State lawmakers discussed such a proposal in 2018. An amendment to the 2019 state budget would have allowed electric-vehicle manufacturers without existing franchise agreements to engage in direct-sales, but was vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers.\n\nLast March, Tesla submitted a request to the Department of Transportation for dealer licenses to open dealerships in Madison and Milwaukee, with plans for additional dealerships in Glendale and the Fox Cities.\n\nTesla argued state law allows manufacturers to operate their own dealerships if there\u2019s no independent dealer available to operate those locations that meets the manufacturer\u2019s standards.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s Wisconsin customers prefer Tesla\u2019s uniform retail pricing and transparent, middleman-free car-buying experience,\u201d Tesla\u2019s petition reads. \u201cAs a result, an unaffiliated dealer cannot meet Tesla\u2019s uniformly applied standard qualifications.\u201d\n\nThe company also argued Wisconsin law does not ban \u201ca non-franchising manufacturer like Tesla\u201d from operating a dealership.\n\nTesla\u2019s application was sent to the Department of Administration. The Wisconsin Automobile and Truck Dealers Association was allowed to intervene in the case, which was opposed by Tesla, court documents said.\n\nTesla and the auto dealers association both presented witnesses to the state during a hearing on the request in May 2024, the petition for judicial review states. The state DOT did not participate in the hearing.\n\nThe administrative law judge handling the case issued a proposed decision denying Tesla\u2019s application in October, and Tesla provided its objections to the state later that month, court documents said.\n\nThe company filed an open records request the following month seeking communications pertaining to its case between the officials handling it. According to Tesla\u2019s petition, the response to the request showed the administrative law judge shared the draft decision with state administrators before sharing it with parties involved in the case.\n\nTesla submitted additional objections to the state on Dec. 4. The company argues it was \u201cdeprived both of an independent hearing, and of a meaningful review of the (administrative law judge)\u2019s decision, insofar as the Administrator had already reviewed and prejudged the case.\u201d\n\nThe state issued its final decision on Dec. 17, denying Tesla\u2019s application to operate dealerships.\n\nThe logo of Tesla car is pictured at the Paris Auto Show, in Paris, Monday, Oct. 14, 2024. Michel Euler/AP Photo\n\nBrian Hayes, administrator for the Wisconsin Department of Administration\u2019s Division of Hearings and Appeals, wrote in the decision that Tesla did not show that no independent dealers are available to own and operate a Tesla dealership that meets the manufacturer\u2019s standards.\n\n\u201cIndependent dealers testified that they were willing and able to sell Tesla vehicles consistent with Tesla\u2019s standard sales and pricing model,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cEach of the independent Wisconsin licensed dealers who testified hold franchise agreements with various vehicle manufacturers to sell and service vehicles.\u201d\n\nIn its petition to the court, Tesla argues the auto dealers association was an \u201cimproperly admitted party\u201d and that the state\u2019s decision \u201crested entirely\u201d on evidence from the association.\n\nThe state Department of Transportation and Department of Administration did not respond to requests for comment. In a court filing responding to Tesla\u2019s petition, attorneys for the state said the company is not entitled to relief through the court, and asked the court to enter an order affirming the decision.\n\nThe Wisconsin Automobile and Truck Dealers Association declined to comment on an ongoing court case. The association filed a motion to move the case to either Milwaukee or Dane County because that\u2019s where Tesla has galleries.\n\nIn a legal brief, the association said Tesla formally applied for dealerships at those sites with the intention of converting the galleries into dealerships and planned to later apply for dealerships in Glendale and the Fox Valley.\n\n\u201cTo date, Tesla has not submitted an application to open a dealership anywhere in Outagamie County,\u201d the brief reads.\n\nA motion hearing is scheduled for next month in the Outagamie County Government Center.",

This upsets no one like it upsets men: men whose self-worths are tied up in their ugly little vehicles, the hideous blue upholstery they got for their Toyota, their early lives guided by reruns of Pimp My Ride. To me, a station wagon is a caravan is a hatchback. In fact, I know so little about cars that I had to google all of these words.\n\nHaving a toddler\u2019s understanding of types of vehicles never impacts me, except in two cases. One, if I ever witness a bank heist and am asked to describe the getaway car, I would be so profoundly useless that the cops would assume I was involved. Two, I never know which Uber is mine. I\u2019m the idiot who walks all the way around the car to read the license plate, to make sure I\u2019m getting in a\u2014let me just check my notes here\u2014Nissan Altima instead of a Kia Sorento. (For this joke, I googled \u201ccar types.\u201d)\n\nI don\u2019t use rideshares very often, but increasingly, my experiences have been nauseating. Uber rides and Lyft trips have felt like riding in a broken Tilt-A-Whirl, with me swaying in the back seat, trying to not throw up before I can get the window rolled down. I arrive at my destination still undulating with motion sickness. I\u2019ve never liked riding in the backs of cars very much, but lately, it\u2019s felt like a new, worse car had recently hit the market.\n\nI\u2019m half right. The car isn\u2019t new, but my god, does it ever suck. Elon Musk has done a lot of harm to society, from decimating the federal government to ruining Grimes for me, personally, but I want to grab that man by his scruff for foisting the Tesla on me. That I even know what a Tesla is remains a problem unto itself, but the experience of riding in one of these cars is so indelibly unpleasant that now I can recognize one on sight. What the fuck is this awful car? It\u2019s like riding in a coffin. They\u2019re too low to the ground, completely pitch-black inside, and every single Tesla ride makes me feel like I\u2019m going to barf for one million years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not the only person trying to not blow chunks in the back of the world\u2019s ugliest vehicles; there are several websites and forum posts about how Teslas, and electric cars generally, can make passengers carsick. Now, when I order a car on Uber or Lyft, I speak a silent incantation into the sky hoping for any car other than a Tesla, which is increasingly the only kind of car I get. I would prefer a teenager show up with a tandem bike, him patting the extra seat and telling me to \u201chop on.\u201d\n\nBut hey, I get it. Other than me burp-heaving in the back of these cars, the Tesla is perfect! If there\u2019s anything I want in a tin can that can drive up to 200 miles an hour, it\u2019s for the door to be practically nonfunctional. I completely understand why you would want the external handle to fuse completely with the door, making it impossible to hold on rainy or freezing-cold days. I also really admire how opening the door from the inside and rolling down the window are equally mysterious actions. Do you press the button for the window or the door? Or is it both? And how about two screens on the dashboard to distract both me and the driver? Yes, I think all cars should have televisions, great idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Americans Are Actually in a Position to Make Elon Musk Feel Our Rage Read More\n\nHoly shit, this car sucks. I will pay any amount of money to never ride in a Tesla again. In fact, I would pay even more money to Uber if they offered me a Tesla-free version of the app. Look at me, a sucker willing to pay a bonus to solve a problem created by another VC-funded company that killed the yellow cab. Maybe Uber can reroute my extra funds to all the hospitals preemptively suspending trans health care out of fear they\u2019ll lose federal funding! I already feel sick enough in my day-to-day life; do I need to be in a car invented by the guy who\u2019s lighting American infrastructure on fire every day? All I want is to avoid making the eugh-eugh-eugh sound that comes with Tesla-induced carsickness. My dreams have become so small.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure that for drivers, there are other issues with the Tesla. It seems like it would feel like you\u2019re steering a Roomba. Charging it sounds annoying. They\u2019re certainly ugly, and Musk is also responsible for the Cybertruck, a car that looks so much like literal garbage that raccoons keep trying to eat it. Drivers should avoid buying a Tesla for good reasons beyond the fact that it\u2019s a lousy car. All I want is for me, an innocent cherub in the woods who doesn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license, to be able to avoid this car entirely. A rideshare app would never expect me to take a ride home from the club in an ambulance, a school bus, or the apple that worm drives in those Richard Scarry books. Surely there\u2019s a way to keep me out of a Tesla, too.\n\nBut anyway. What are you doing this weekend? Do you think you could pick me up? I have a few errands to run and I could really use a car.",

Anna Fyodorova also asked both owners which model she should buy.\n\nLike Anna, many buyers are in a dilemma. They're torn between the sleek appearance of the Model 3 and the practicality of the Model Y's storage space.\n\nShe asks, \"Which one is more suitable for a single woman? Considering that I don't need a lot of storage space and I like the appearance of Model 3 more, should I go with the Model 3, or will I be sorry I didn't go with the storage space in the Model Y? I want to hear your thoughts.\"\n\nNote: Anna chose the Model 3 because she likes how it looks better. Will she be sorry if she doesn't have the extra storage space of the Model Y?\n\nEven though Anna has made her decision, did she make the right choice?\n\nWhat Advice Would You Give Model 3 and Model Y Buyers?\n\nHere are a few diverse comments from both Model 3 and Model Y owners, each offering a unique perspective.\n\nTom Beardy - The Model 3 is more like a sports car - especially if you opt for the Performance. The Model Y is a nice bigger space daily. I went with the new P and would never think about changing.\n\nShankar Oliyile - I ordered the Model-3 Highland UltraRed after seeing the launch series price of Juniper. I don't want to wait for another year for the standard price of Juniper. I have a small family with a 5-year-old son. We love the Model 3.\n\nIvy Tran - The Model 3. That's my car, too. No complaints. I love it. I enjoy having it, FSD, sound system, everything about it. It protects you from driving on the way with the best of it!\n\nKippy Gurr Brunty - I LOVE my Y!\n\nJames Nikko - Model Y\n\nMuhammad Kamran - Choose the Model 3 if you want a sporty ride and the Model Y with an SUV feel.\n\nA report from Motor Trend says, \"Unless you hate a higher seating position or cannot have a taller vehicle or are on a tight budget, go with the Model Y. It offers almost everything the Model 3 can provide along with more usable space and utility.\"\n\n\"Not to mention, you can lie down in the back to snuggle with the person you like while viewing the sky through the seamless panoramic glass roof. Oh, and don't forget to activate Romance mode. (It's the fireplace logo on the Easter egg tray.) However, for more budget-minded buyers, the Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive is still the cheapest Tesla vehicle you can buy.\"\n\nPerformance Package Versus the Standard Model 3 and Y\n\nLet's examine the Performance Upgrade Package (PUP), an option for both the Model 3 and the Model Y.\n\nFeatures of the PUP\n\nBrakes: Larger brakes and painted calipers\n\nWheels: Larger, staggered 21-inch wheels\n\nSuspension: Lowered suspension for improved handling\n\nSpoiler: Rear carbon fiber spoiler\n\nHeadlights: Upgraded Matrix headlights\n\nOther Model Y Performance features a larger battery, more power, a larger rear motor, and revised powertrain software.\n\nPerformance and ride:\n\nThe Model Y Performance is quick and dynamic, but the large wheels and sport suspensions can make for an uncomfortable ride.\n\nComparison to Long Range:\n\nThe Model Y Performance has several visible differences from the Long Range model, including the larger wheels, upgraded brakes, and lower suspension.\n\n(Note: Tesla acknowledges that the Performance reduces range from 315 to 280 but does not provide revised EPA numbers for this package).\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nFor a single woman, a Tesla Model 3 is generally considered the better choice if she prioritizes maneuverability, affordability, and a sporty driving experience. At the same time, a Model Y might be better if she needs more cargo space, a higher ride height, and potentially the option for a third row of seats for occasional passengers.\n\nKey points to consider:\n\nSpace: The Model Y offers significantly more cargo space and a larger interior than the Model 3, making it ideal for hauling larger items or occasionally carrying extra passengers.\n\nDriving Dynamics: The Model 3 is considered more agile and handles better due to its lower center of gravity and smaller size.\n\nPrice: The Model 3 is generally more affordable than the Model Y.\n\nWho should choose the Model 3:\n\nA single woman who primarily drives in urban areas and values easy parking.\n\nSomeone who enjoys a sporty driving feel.\n\nA person on a tighter budget.\n\nWho should choose the Model Y:\n\nA single woman who frequently transports large items or occasionally carries extra passengers.\n\nSomeone who prefers a higher driving position and better visibility.\n\nA person who values extra cargo space.\n\nQuestions For Tesla Model 3 and Model Y Owners\n\nDo you have a Tesla Model 3 or a Tesla Model Y?

The spreadsheet entry, labeled \u201cArmored Tesla (Production Units)\u201d and last modified on Dec. 13, before Trump took office, noted that the potential purchase was still in the \u201cPLANNING\u201d phase. It did not specify the model of car from Tesla, which does not manufacture an \u201carmored\u201d vehicle.\n\nThen, hours after the articles were published, the State Department appeared to remove the word \u201cTesla\u201d from the spreadsheet and uploaded a revised version to its website, though a version of the list including Tesla was still online on another State Department web page Thursday afternoon.\n\nMusk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, threw cold water on the issue. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Tesla isn\u2019t getting $400M. No one mentioned it to me, at least,\u201d he wrote on X at 1:30 a.m. ET Thursday.\n\nTesla and Musk did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment on the matter Thursday.\n\nThe news reports attracted wide interest partly because of Musk\u2019s power and influence in the Trump administration. He heads up the Department of Government Efficiency, a sweeping effort to dramatically slash government spending and shrink the federal workforce. He has accused the federal government of widespread corruption and wasteful spending.\n\nMusk is also one of the federal government\u2019s most significant and high-profile contractors. In recent years, his SpaceX firm has been awarded billions of dollars in contracts. He has faced growing questions about potential conflicts of interest given his simultaneous role in the Trump administration and his vast business holdings.\n\nThe budget spreadsheet listed potential allocations to other vehicle manufacturers, but the State Department spokesperson said contracts have not been \u201cawarded to Tesla or any other vehicle manufacturer to produce armored electric vehicles for the Department of State.\u201d",

The losses have sent Musk's net worth tumbling from a peak of $486 billion on Dec. 17 to its current level of about $380 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe stock woes have divided current and former Tesla shareholders. Critics of Musk fault his new role and polarizing reputation, blaming recent reports showing lackluster sales in some regions on his foray into politics. They say Musk must step away from the Trump administration for the company to thrive.\n\nSupporters, on the other hand, say Musk's role in the White House has little to do with the selloff, noting that Tesla shares remain higher than where they stood on Election Day. Instead, some say, the company is suffering growing pains as it weathers stiff competition in electric vehicles and pursues new ventures like self-driving taxis.\n\n\"I don't have a problem if Elon wants to save a bunch of money for America. I say, 'Where's the good part in this for Tesla?'\" Ross Gerber, a prominent Tesla investor, told ABC News, referring to cost-cutting efforts undertaken by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTesla representatives did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nDespite disagreement over the effect of Musk's government role, both current and former Tesla shareholders who spoke to ABC News broadly acknowledged the company's recent business hiccups.\n\nTesla sold fewer cars in 2024 than it did the year prior, marking the company's first year-over-year sales decline in more than a decade, earnings released in January showed.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. Christian Marquardt/Getty Images\n\nAs rivals have challenged Tesla's dominance over the electric vehicle market, the company has promised a future revenue stream from autonomous taxis, also known as robotaxis.\n\nMusk announced in late January that the company would roll out its robotaxi test program in Austin, Texas, in June. But within days, China-based competitor BYD unveiled advances in self-driving technology, which the company said was set to be included in models costing as little as $9,600.\n\nGary Black, managing partner of The Future Fund, which manages $100 million in assets, including Tesla shares, said the recent selloff of Tesla is primarily the result of investor jitters about whether the company can dominate self-driving technology the way it did electric vehicles.\n\n\"Over time, you will see Teslas and other cars self-drive. But Tesla is not going to be the only one,\" Black told ABC News' Elizabeth Schulze.\n\nThe stock also faced downward pressure this week when a Musk-led group of investors offered to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion, making possible a scenario in which Musk would sell some of his Tesla shares to finance the deal, Black said.\n\nBlack said that, in his opinion, the downturn has nothing to do with Musk's government role.\n\n\"It's always good to know the president of the United States -- to be able to pick up your phone and say, you know, 'I need this favor, that favor,'\" Black said.\n\nA jump in Tesla shares after Trump's victory suggests many investors viewed the relationship that way. The stock price soared about 85% over a six-week period following Election Day.\n\nBut some investors lay the blame for the downturn squarely at Musk's feet.\n\nNell Minow, Vice Chair of ValueEdge Advisors and a longtime critic of Musk, said Musk has been \"absent\" from the company.\n\nElon Musk speaks next to President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Feb. 11, 2025. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\n\"I think that he is a huge drag on the stock right now,\" Minow told Schulze. \"No question, he's a problem.\"\n\n\"Elon Musk is to the Tesla brand what the Green Giant is to corn,\" Minow said. \"He has made himself the brand and that is always very risky.\"\n\nMinow, who said she donated nearly all of her Tesla shares to charity last year, also criticized the Tesla board for what she said was a failure to hold Musk to account, or update shareholders and the public about a leadership plan while Musk runs DOGE.\n\n\"We don't know what the board is thinking. They have not spoken out in any way,\" Minow said. \"They have not made a filing with the SEC about what the impact of this side hustle is, and the employees and the shareholders need some kind of certainty.\"\n\nNew York City Comptroller Brad Lander echoed concerns about the board's ability to rein in Musk. Lander, who oversees $1.25 billion in Tesla stock through the city's five pension systems, said the lack of oversight was a \"long-standing problem.\"\n\n\"Independent governance is designed to provide a voice for shareholders at the table,\" Lander, who is running for New York City mayor and has publicly sparred with Musk, said in a statement to ABC News. \"When companies are controlled by a set of directors with either family or aligned interests, they lose this.\"\n\nFor his part, Musk has looked to hype up Tesla's prospects, saying on an earnings call last month that he believes there is an opportunity for it to be \"the most valuable company in the world.\"\n\nDuring the call, AllianceBernstein Research analyst Daniel Roska questioned Musk on how Tesla plans to meet its ambitious projections given its high valuation.\n\nMusk emphasized Tesla's focus on real-world AI, claiming the company is making significant strides.\n\n\"We're working on perfecting real-world AI and making rapid progress week over week, if not month over month,\" Musk said. \"I go where the problem is, essentially ... I focus where the challenges are the greatest.\"\n\nSome Tesla shareholders remain bullish on the company despite its short-term drop. Angel investor Larry Goldberg, known as \"Tesla Larry,\" posted on X that he supports Musk's political efforts, even if they impact the company's stock price.\n\n\"If the Trump administration (and DOGE) does not fix the deficit, my Tesla shares -- and everyone's US stocks and bonds will be worthless,\" Goldberg wrote.\n\nMusk reposted Goldberg's comment, adding, \"Exactly.\"\n\nABC News' Will Steakin contributed to this report.",

(AP) \u2014 The State Department had been in talks with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla company to buy armored electric vehicles, but the plans have been put on hold by the Trump administration after reports emerged about a potential $400 million purchase.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the electric car company owned by Musk, who has become President Donald Trump\u2019s billionaire adviser aiming to dismantle agencies and downsize the federal workforce, was the only one that expressed interest back in May 2024, when Joe Biden was president.\n\nWhile it was in its planning phases, the deal with Tesla was forecast to be the largest contract of the year. It shows how some of his wealth has come and was still expected to come from taxpayers before the plans were put on hold. His companies obtain hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. And Tesla had already received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.\n\nNo government contract had been given to Tesla or any other manufacturer to produce armored electric vehicles for the Department of State, the agency said.\n\nThe Biden administration had tasked the State Department to gather information from potential suppliers to buy these vehicles in September. An official request for bids was to be released in May, according to State Department data from December. But that solicitation is now on hold with no plans to issue it, the State Department said.\n\nAfter reports emerged about the plans to buy from Tesla, the State Department changed the data entry on its expected contracts forecast for fiscal year 2025 late Wednesday. The State Department said it should have been entered into the system as a generic \u201celectric vehicle manufacturer,\u201d but there is at least another entry for a different purchase that continues to list a company\u2014 German car manufacturer BMW.",

But now, the solicitation is on hold, according to the State Department spokesperson.\n\nMusk did not return a request for comment.\n\nMusk, who spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to help elect Trump, has used an X account devoted to DOGE to highlight what he views as excessive or unnecessary federal contracts.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs Musk's deputies have gained access to nearly two dozen federal agencies, ethics experts have raised concern about the billionaire running into conflicts of interest, since Musk runs six companies, some of which are under investigation by government authorities. Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, also have multibillion-dollar contracts with the federal government.\n\nMost of the federal money Musk has received has gone to SpaceX, the rocket company, for projects including work for NASA to launch Musk's Starship with astronauts to the moon.\n\nA new Cybertruck starts at around $82,000, and about 38,000 were sold last year, according to Cox Automotive. The truck, which was unveiled in 2019 and began reaching customers in 2023, has faced complaints about rust, finger pinches and defective accelerator pedals.\n\nThe State Department document also shows that some Tesla competitors are set to receive lucrative, yet considerably smaller, contracts for armored vehicles, including from BMW, which is expected to supply about $40 million worth of SUVs to the federal government.\n\nHave information you want to share about the ongoing changes across the federal government?

But after reports emerged on Wednesday of the potential for conflict of interest given Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s prominent role in the Trump Administration, the document was updated, removing mention of Tesla and changing the line item to \u201cArmored Electric Vehicles\u201d instead.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, both versions of the 2025 procurement forecast remained available on different State Department webpages. The earlier version that mentions Tesla also lists the planned procurement under NAICS Code 311999, an industry code for miscellaneous food manufacturing, while the newer version, which says it was modified at 9:12 p.m., Feb. 12, lists the revised \u201cArmored Electric Vehicles\u201d procurement under NAICS Code 561613 for \u201cArmored Car Services.\u201d No other changes were made in the document, which contains 319 other line items.\n\nThe State Department website says it issues annual procurement forecasts pursuant to the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988, which \u201crequires agencies to compile and make available projections of contracting opportunities small and small disadvantaged firms may be able to perform.\u201d It is meant to give \u201csmall businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses\u201d opportunities to compete for direct contracts with the government or subcontracting opportunities.\n\nIn response to questions about the change and whether Tesla remains the intended awardee for a contract that is anticipated, according to the procurement forecast, to be awarded on Sept. 30, a State Department official tells TIME that no government contract has been awarded to Tesla or any other vehicle manufacturer to produce armored electric vehicles for the Department, but the previous administration did ask the Department to explore interest from private companies to produce armored electric vehicles. The Department then did a public Request for Information, the official said, for an armored electric vehicle to solicit interest and received interest from only one company at that time. As a next step in that process, an official solicitation would be sent out to vehicle manufacturers to bid, the official said, but the solicitation is on hold and there are no current plans to issue it.\n\nTesla has not responded to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Tesla isn\u2019t getting $400M.

She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car\u2019s brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.\n\nZhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk, among the richest men in the world and a self-described \u201c free speech absolutist.\u201d Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.\n\nThe company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press. Tesla won all 11 cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang\u2019s, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.\n\nIt is not common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China\u2019s ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.\n\nThe AP review of Tesla\u2019s record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.\n\nIn the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Trump. Together, they have launched an assault on the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others that have traditionally acted as guardrails.\n\nTesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nIn this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, the Tesla Gigafactory in Lingang new area of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone is seen in east China\u2019s Shanghai on Sept. 26, 2023.

With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told AP they have been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.\n\nTesla\u2019s windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers.

Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn\u2019t acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \u201chad someone behind her\u201d and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.\n\nZhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive\u2019s comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company\u2019s own shortcomings.\n\nAnd then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.\n\n\u2018The odds are stacked against you\u2019\n\nTesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.\n\nThe case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.\n\nDozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang\u2019s crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.\n\nZhang\u2019s emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.\n\nTesla had finally given Zhang what she\u2019d been asking for, but they\u2019d published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn\u2019t modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she\u2019d hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.\n\nZhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.\n\nMeanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang\u2019s public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world\u2019s most valuable car company.\n\nZhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.\n\n\u201cI refuse to accept it,\u201d Zhang told The Associated Press, \u201cAs a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\u201d\n\nHer odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it\u2019s also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.\n\nAn AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.\n\nIn a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court said that judgments are the result of a \u201cfair trial\u201d based on \u201cthe objective facts of the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cannot be assumed that the party has received \u2018special protection\u2019 or \u2018special treatment\u2019 because of their victory,\u201d the court wrote.\n\nTesla vehicles are parked outside of a building at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound during a meeting between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing, Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2019.

It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China\u2019s financial capital.\n\nIn this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, visiting Tesla CEO Elon Musk, left, meets with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing, Sunday, April 28, 2024.

China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that has generated billions in income for Tesla.\n\nIn January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world\u2019s richest person in January 2021.\n\nChina got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla\u2019s arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around 5% of China\u2019s auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world\u2019s largest EV-battery maker. China\u2019s BYD is now the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.\n\n\u201cTesla had a large part to play in that,\u201d said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk\u2019s factory was critical. \u201cIt was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later they\u2019re rolling cars off the line,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\u201d\n\nIn this photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacts at a delivery ceremony for the first Tesla Model 3 cars made at Tesla's Shanghai factory in Shanghai, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020.

Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk\u2019s overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nMusk\u2019s \u201cgreater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\u201d said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job of it in China and he\u2019s done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\u201d\n\n\u2018A chilling effect\u2019\n\nSafety advocates worry about the implications of Musk\u2019s proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.\n\nIn the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.\n\nTesla has not publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \u201cmaybe it is time\u201d to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla\u2019s brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.\n\nTesla has already successfully done that in China.\n\nTwo Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.\n\n\u201cWe were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\u201d a tech reporter told AP.\n\nThose who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk\u2019s company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest\u2019s report that claimed Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factory was a \u201csweatshop.\u201d The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla\u2019s ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.\n\nTesla is not the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.\n\nTesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.\n\n\u201cTesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\u201d said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla\u2019s alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \u201cTesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\u201d\n\nChen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 30 centimeters (12 inches) of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Teslas, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.\n\nTesla maintained the accident was Chen\u2019s fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.\n\n\u201cTesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\u201d Chen said in a court statement reviewed by AP. \u201cI almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\u201d\n\nThis excerpt from a legal document shows that a Chinese civil court ordered Chen Junyi to publicly apologize to Tesla (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and to pay the company $6,800.

            "content": "In the past few months, shares of Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) have rapidly accelerated, rising 69% since late October. This extends an unbelievable streak of huge gains for investors over the years.\n\nRecently, the market quickly became hopeful about the possibility of improving prospects for the company under President Donald Trump. But shares have taken a breather. As of this writing on Feb. 10, they are down 13% in 2025. Does this dip make the electric vehicle (EV) stock a long-term buy?\n\nFacing some challenges\n\nTesla provided investors with some fresh data when it reported financial results for the last three months of 2024. Revenue of $25.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.73 both missed Wall Street estimates, which wasn't welcome news for shareholders hoping for better-than-expected results.\n\nThat top-line figure was up only 2% year over year. Even worse, automotive revenue declined 8%. Lower average selling prices for the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y made an impact.\n\nIt's worth pointing out Tesla's inability to grow vehicle deliveries, which totaled just under 1.8 million in 2024, slightly below the year before. This was the first time ever that this key metric fell on an annual basis.\n\nManagement said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025. A cheaper car model will start production this year, which could help drive greater volume.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a car company\n\nTesla's financial performance over the past several quarters clearly shows that this resembles a traditional car company instead of some high-flying tech enterprise. Investors can't ignore some negative characteristics about its operations.\n\nFor starters, the business no longer stands out as much in what is becoming a very competitive EV market. There are numerous options for customers when buying a new EV, both from domestic players and international rivals. The automaker registered tremendous growth for many years, but this hasn't been the case more recently.\n\nThe result is diminishing pricing power, which was alluded to earlier. Consequently, profitability has come under immense pressure. Gross margin and operating margin of 17.9% and 7.2%, respectively, in 2024 were both much lower than they were two years ago.\n\nMaybe even more worrying is the fact that the business is demonstrating a sensitivity to macroeconomic factors. For example, higher interest rates make cars less affordable, something that hurts demand. And it's hard to argue that inflationary pressures also won't hurt a consumer's ability and willingness to buy a new EV, especially ones on the premium end of the market where Tesla sits.\n\nWhere's the margin of safety?\n\nCEO Elon Musk unsurprisingly urges investors to focus on the bigger picture. For Tesla, this means a future characterized by autonomous driving and robotics. Should the business make great strides in further developing these areas, while finding success in commercializing the technologies, then maybe there's outsize success down the road.\n\nHowever, it's easy to be a bit skeptical. Full self-driving (FSD) capabilities could still be a long way off. There are still technical and regulatory hurdles to clear. And it could be a while until consumers become comfortable giving up complete control when riding in a car, if this happens at all.\n\nIf you look at the stock's valuation, it appears that success with FSD tech and broad adoption are a virtual certainty. Shares currently trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 176.7, implying monster financial gains in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBased on the fact that Tesla is still just a car company today that's facing pricing pressure and is struggling to grow in the face of intensifying competition, the stock looks extremely overvalued. Although shares are down by double digits in 2025, investors should avoid them.",

            "content": "Updated at 4:52 p.m. on February 12, 2025\n\nDonald Trump may be pleased enough with Elon Musk, but even as the Tesla CEO is exercising his newfound power to essentially undo whole functions of the federal government, he still has to reassure his investors. Lately, Musk has delivered for them in one way: The value of the company\u2019s shares has skyrocketed since Trump was reelected to the presidency of the United States. But Musk had much to answer for on his recent fourth-quarter earnings call\u2014not least that in 2024, Tesla\u2019s car sales had sunk for the first time in a decade. Profits were down sharply too. Usually, when this happens at a car company, the CEO issues a mea culpa, vows to cut costs, and hypes vehicles coming to market soon.\n\nInstead, Musk beamed about robotics, artificial intelligence, and Tesla\u2019s path to being \u201cworth more than the next top five companies combined.\u201d This is the vision he has been selling investors for years: Making cars\u2014a volatile, hypercompetitive business with infamously low profit margins\u2014was only the start for Tesla. Its future business will be making fleets of self-driving taxis and humanoid robots trained for thankless manual labor. Whether his vision has any connection to reality is hotly debated by many AI and robotics experts, but most Wall Street analysts put their faith in Musk. And he has, at times, delivered on wildly ambitious goals. Shares jumped again after the call. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment; a DOGE official did not respond to an email seeking comment.)\n\nMusk gets the benefit of the doubt from investors because\u2014despite undelivered promises, half-baked ideas, and forgotten plans\u2014he has made Tesla worth, on paper at least, more than essentially the rest of the auto industry combined. His funders are asked to buy Musk\u2019s picture of the future, and the recent enthusiasm for Tesla stock suggests they believe that his political influence will help him get there.\n\nMusk needs that belief to hold. Tesla\u2019s stock price is the largest source of his enormous wealth and, by extension, his influence; if his plans succeed, that stock is also his clearest shot at achieving trillionaire status. Right now, though, Tesla\u2019s primary business is still selling cars that people drive, and Musk himself may be the biggest reason that faith in Tesla could falter.\n\nFor all of Musk\u2019s ire for the former president, Tesla did very well in the Joe Biden years. The Model Y is the world\u2019s best-selling electric vehicle and its best-selling car, period. The company has comfortably been out of its \u201cmoney-losing start-up\u201d phase for years. Although the competition among EV makers is heating up, the only individual company close to eating into Tesla\u2019s market share is China\u2019s BYD, which for the first time last year produced more EVs than Tesla did.\n\nYet that competition can\u2019t entirely account for Tesla\u2019s latest, abysmal numbers. Last year, Tesla sales were down nearly 12 percent in the EV stronghold of California. And in Europe, where Musk is helping supercharge far-right politics, Tesla\u2019s sales were down 63 percent last month in France and 59 percent in Germany. This is happening even as the rest of the worldwide electric market is growing fast; nearly every car company that makes EVs saw sales gains in 2024, some of them huge.\n\nMusk\u2019s activism does seem to be turning off the affluent or middle-income progressive crowd that was traditionally Tesla\u2019s bread and butter. Look no further than how the company\u2019s new, updated Model Y has been received. Musk\u2019s army of fanboys on X was as effusive as ever, but outside the hard-core Tesla bubble, the SUV was met with a flood of Nazi jokes following Musk\u2019s Sieg heil\u2013ish arm gesture at Trump\u2019s inauguration. This type of reaction goes beyond that one car; the Cybertruck has a unique penchant for being the target of vandalism, and people appear to be making a killing selling anti-Musk bumper stickers to disgusted Tesla owners. In covering the auto industry, I can\u2019t go a week without fielding emails from people asking for advice on the best EV alternatives to Tesla\u2014many from longtime Tesla owners who say they\u2019re ready to move on.\n\nIn theory, Musk\u2019s rightward turn could help him swap out traditionally liberal buyers for more conservative ones, who usually tend to be more skeptical of EVs. And it\u2019s likely that EVs will become less polarizing along partisan lines over time as electrification becomes more common on new cars. Right now, however, even the deep-red-coded Cybertruck doesn\u2019t seem to be changing many minds about the concept of battery-powered cars. Take a recent report from the EV Politics Project, a nonprofit group that studies the partisan divide over electric cars. Their study indicates that although Musk himself is now viewed much more favorably by Trump voters and Republicans, he\u2019s not leading some seismic shift in how they view EVs.\n\nNor is he obviously trying to get MAGA voters to buy the new Model Y. In fact, those who follow the auto industry closely wonder if Musk is still interested in running a car company at all. On that January earnings call, he offered only a boilerplate response about \u201cmore affordable\u201d new Teslas coming soon; the word Cybertruck was not uttered once. He is, however, clearly focused on the company\u2019s \u201cunsupervised\u201d robotaxi service. (Imagine Uber, except with Model Ys and Model 3 sedans, and with no humans behind the wheel.) He claims that Tesla will launch the taxis in Austin in June, the first step toward turning the company into the AI powerhouse that Musk thinks will make it so valuable. Right now, his AI ventures are separate, but he\u2019s started mingling them with his ambitions for Tesla. Ultimately, his thinking\u2014which he\u2019s articulated in earnings and public appearances over a number of years\u2014is that his roving network of autonomous vehicles can use their cameras to capture huge quantities of data, and those data can be used to train AI networks.\n\nIn the immediate future, Musk wants Tesla robotaxis everywhere, as soon as possible, and sleeping next door to the White House could help advance that part of his vision. Critics have expressed concerns that his newfound influence could also help stymie federal investigations into Tesla, which are probing the crash record of the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d technology and its claims about the technology\u2019s safety. And his current political position could help eliminate one of his oldest foes: regulations.\n\nTesla has long clashed with environmental rules (last year, a California judge ordered Tesla to pay $1.5 million over allegations that it mishandled hazardous waste), labor laws (employees at a Tesla plant have said that the company failed to pay overtime, among other alleged violations), and safety ordinances (the company was recently fined for violating California\u2019s workplace-heat-safety rules at one of their plants). But the greatest roadblock to Musk\u2019s vision of robotaxis everywhere is arguably America\u2019s current patchwork of state-by-state rules and regulations for autonomous vehicles, which may allow self-driving cars in some places but not others. No federal standards currently exist, but creating rules favorable to the industry would speed things up\u2014especially if those rules were tailored to especially benefit Tesla.\n\nMusk\u2019s approach to Tesla\u2019s future has more than a few problems that the rest of the self-driving-car industry does not face. Tesla relies solely on cameras and AI for its automated-driving systems, rather than lidar and other more advanced sensors used by competitors. Plenty of experts think Tesla\u2019s strategy can never power true autonomous driving. And Tesla is already years behind robotaxi companies operating in many cities right now, most notably Google\u2019s Waymo. Musk\u2019s Tesla faces the rising threat of China\u2019s advancements in AI too: Investors are noticing BYD\u2019s autonomy-focused deal with tech upstart DeepSeek. And they\u2019re noticing where Musk\u2019s attention lies; as he holds court in the Oval Office, Tesla\u2019s stock has begun losing all those postelection gains.\n\nThe most daunting problem, though, may be the same problem Musk has always had: people. Even if he does succeed in tearing down the regulatory state for the sake of his own companies, who\u2019s to say anyone will buy what they\u2019re selling. Any power Musk has in the future depends on turning millions of people into Tesla customers. If he can\u2019t do that\u2014or at least keep convincing investors that he\u2019ll be able to\u2014he\u2019s just another guy screaming online.",

The State Department is expected to purchase $400 million worth of Tesla vehicles this year. File Photo by Terry Schmitt/UPI | License Photo\n\nFeb. 13 (UPI) -- The U.S. State Department documents show it is expected to purchase $400 million worth of armored vehicles from Tesla, the car manufacturer owned by President Donald Trump's key advisor Elon Musk. The documents detail the procurement forecast for the State Department during the 2025 fiscal year. Though they do not specify which model of Tesla vehicle is to be purchased, the \"Armored Tesla (Production Units)\" specified in the document seems to suggest the stainless-steel plated Cybertruck, which Musk has advertised as being bulletproof. Advertisement\n\nThe deal, first revealed by reports on Wednesday, is expected to raise already high ethical concerns surrounding Musk and his relationship to the Trump administration.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, spent nearly $300 million on Trump's election campaign. Since Trump's inauguration, he has been leading the Department of Government Efficiency and its mandate of slashing so-called wasteful spending from the federal government. He has vowed to cut $2 trillion from the U.S. budget.\n\nMusk is already a major contractor with the U.S. government. According to USASpending.gov, his SpaceX launch vehicle service has received more than $3.3 billion in the last fiscal year and some $13 billion since 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has attempted to address concerns surrounding Musk and his involvement with the federal government.\n\nEarlier this month, the president told reporters that Musk cannot do anything without his administration's permission. And then on Sunday, he told Fox News that his top advisor was \"not gaining anything\" from his government position.",

After all, he opted to get the car wrapped in a metallic gold that cannot be missed.\n\nBut now, after the administrative changes at the White House, he said he's getting a different kind of attention.\n\n\"It's been a rough ride with the Cybertruck,\" Jaroje said. \"People are literally pointing middle fingers, screaming at my wife and kids.\"\n\nWhile there has been no damage to the car, Jaroje found profane stickers placed on the bumper Feb. 7. When he posted a photo of the sticker on social media, he said he immediately started getting threats online.\n\nWorcester Police are aware of the sticker and harassment and are investigating.\n\nHe said while he's received harassment here and there for owning the eye-catching car, the aggression has reached a new level since President Donald Trump moved into the White House and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is now the head of the president's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"It's 10 times worse since,\" he said, adding he's been trying to get rid of the vehicle but no one will take it, not even Tesla. \"All started when Musk endorsed Trump and did that weird salute.\"\n\nDuring the president's inauguration last month, Musk appeared to salute the crowd with a stiff arm, which to many appeared similar to a Sieg Heil salute, used in the Nazi regime.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League released a statement following the incident calling it \"an awkward gesture\" made in a \"moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute.\"\n\n\"I always had people giving me a thumbs down, I always looked and laughed. Now after the sticker and that much hate on social media, I am really anxious,\" Jaroje said.\n\nJaroje owns Sculpting MD in Southborough that offers glamourous medical beauty treatments including liposuction, laser skin treatments, hair transplants and other facial treatments.\n\n\"Now some of my patients are refusing to come because they are accusing me of supporting Trump,\" he said.\n\nHe isn't the only one. Nationwide, Cybertruck social media groups are full of complaints from drivers, saying they are being harassed and targeted for their vehicle. Some say Tesla and the Cybertruck have become more of a political statement, while others said it's simply a car choice.\n\nWorcester Police said they're not seeing an increase in incidents involving Teslas or Cybertrucks at this time.\n\nIn Tyngsboro, police are investigating after swastikas and \"hateful graffiti\" were discovered near a Tesla charging station in the area of 440 Middlesex Road Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we believe this to be an isolated incident. There have not been any similar reports anywhere in the community,\u201d said Chief Shaun Woods. \u201cActs of this nature are extremely rare in our community, and we take them seriously. The Tyngsborough Police Department prides itself on maintaining strong ties with the community, working closely with residents, businesses, and visitors to ensure that our town remains a safe and welcoming place for all. We are conducting a thorough investigation and encourage anyone with information to come forward.\u201d\n\nJaroje said he has now added more security, cameras and parks his car inside the garage instead of leaving it outside. He is also looking at potentially moving from Massachusetts to a \"Republican state,\" suggesting Florida or New Hampshire.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",

Tesla\u2019s Director of Megapack Americas Brad Harbidge was joined by Genera CEO and President Winnie Irizarry, Governor Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, and other officials for a contract signing event last Friday.\n\n\u201cWe are addressing the energy crisis by taking action to stabilize the system and ensure a reliable, modern, and accessible electric service for all,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n. \u201cThe signing of the contract for the acquisition of 430 MW in Energy Storage Systems, which does not cost the people as it comes from federal funds, does not increase emissions, is part of the movement toward new energy sources, and can greatly reduce power outages.\u201d\n\nThe Megapacks will be deployed to sites at power generation plants in the following locations:\n\nCambalache, Arecibo\n\nVega Baja\n\nPalo Seco, Toa Baja\n\nYabucoa\n\nAguirre, Salinas\n\nCosta Sur\n\nInitial Megapacks are set to begin arriving in Cambalache in July, while the parties expect the entire distributed system to become operational by the first quarter of 2027.\n\nOn Monday, Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n also shared additional photos from the Friday meeting on X, which you can see below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE PUERTO RICO: Tesla launches large-scale Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in Puerto Rico\n\n\u201cThe new energy storage systems will allow for the integration of 430 MW of clean, instantly dispatchable energy for up to four hours, resulting in an expected 90-percent reduction in load shedding,\u201d Irizarry said.\n\nOfficials selected Tesla\u2019s four-hour Megapacks for the project in October, prior to finalizing the contract at the signing event. The groups have also said that they expect the total investment into the project to reach $767 million, likely including everything from the purchase price of the Megapacks, to construction and labor.\n\nThe capacity level for the 430MW project is also considered to be the equivalent of the largest power plant currently operating in Puerto Rico, according to the release.\n\n\u201cThe signing of this agreement with Tesla represents a momentous change in Puerto Rico\u2019s energy transformation. This unprecedented investment in our energy infrastructure is a firm step toward a sustainable future,\u201d Irizarry adds.\n\nTesla also launched its latest-generation Powerwall home battery, the Powerwall 3, in Puerto Rico in December, after beginning to roll the new hardware out to a number of markets throughout last year. While Megapacks are Tesla\u2019s product for grid-scale energy storage, Powerwalls are a suitable size for homes and businesses hoping to keep the lights on during outages through charging from the grid or from renewable sources such as solar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing the Powerwall batteries, Tesla has also launched its Virtual Power Plant (VPP) program in Puerto Rico alongside these programs in a handful of U.S. states. The VPP programs effectively create a giant, distributed battery from Powerwall owners across a given region, letting them sell their stored electricity back to the grid during times of peak use or outages.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Any employee who takes this type of preemptive break is supposed to be monitored for symptoms of heat illness by a supervisor and should not be asked to return to work until symptoms have subsided.\n\nTesla co-founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk has had a hostile relationship with the state in recent years, accusing California of \u201coverregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation.\u201d And the new regulatory scrutiny comes at a time when Musk is leading an aggressive effort to scale back or entirely dismantle swaths of the federal government on behalf of the Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe carmaker has previously tussled with California workplace safety regulators over conditions at the Fremont plant.\n\nAn investigation by The Center for Investigative Reporting in 2018 found that Tesla has failed to report some serious workplace injuries, skewing the company\u2019s injury statistics. Tesla rebutted the findings, but Cal/OSHA cited the company the next year for omitting hundreds of injuries listed in logs at its factory from annual summary data that the company sends each year to government regulators.\n\nTesla also constructed an open-air structure outside its main Fremont vehicle facilities in an effort to speed up assembly and production of its Model 3 sedan, but in 2019 was hit with fines from Cal/OSHA for safety violations, including a failure to obtain a permit to build the open-air facility, failure to protect workers from exposed metal rods and rebar that posed risks and failure to properly train employees to prevent heat illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Musk restarted production at the plant in defiance of a countywide stay-at-home order, although the company eventually reached an agreement with Alameda County to resume operations. Hundreds of infections were reported in the aftermath of the reopening.\n\nAnd Cal/OSHA in 2023 slapped Tesla with four safety violations after an employee at the Fremont plant was seriously injured when she got stuck in a Model Y. Tesla had allegedly failed to ensure power was cut to a conveyor belt while workers were performing quality inspections, leading to the worker becoming trapped in the car.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create self-driving automobiles.\n\nNow, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald J. Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish.\n\nThe Trump administration could quickly nix a host of federal probes and safety programs: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.\n\nSafety advocates, who credit such federal investigations and recalls with saving lives, say the consequences of such actions could prove dire.\n\n\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d\n\nHere are some key things to know about what what experts think might happen:\n\nMusk and Trump are aggressively seeking to revamp government\n\nThe White House and Musk is waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.\n\nThe actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be a much easier task than their audacious assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.\n\nFederal government has a lot of power over Tesla\n\nThe federal government\u2019s power over Tesla is wide-ranging. It can investigate, order recalls and mandate crash data reporting. However, the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla and on the other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.\n\nA host of Musk\u2019s other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.\n\nTesla alone is facing federal probes from a litany of agencies, including the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.\n\nNHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, that has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.\n\nThe agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.\n\n\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d\n\nVictims and attorneys worry about a lack of oversight\n\nPeople whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.\n\nThey say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon, who was killed when a Tesla blew through a three-way intersection in rural Florida.\n\nBenavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Tesla\u2019s vehicles at this time was faulty and needed repairs.\n\n\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides\u2019 sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on X in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d\n\nTesla also said that because the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph\u201d his actions effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural road, something Benavides\u2019 attorney disputes.\n\nIn the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.\n\n\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case. But they did, in fact, find this.\u201d",

Wards did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nThat follows news that Tesla sales plummeted across Europe in January, according to reporting by the Financial Times, after declining 10.5% in 2024. In the first month of this year, sales were down 63% in France, 59.5% in Germany, 38% in Norway, and 8% in the UK.\n\nEven in China, which offset EU and US declines last year, the news is bad for Tesla.\n\nIn January of this year, Tesla sales dropped 11.5% in China, according to data reported by Reuters from the China Passenger Car Association released late last week. Tesla, which recently released a more expensive version of its Model Y in the country, is running up against low-cost options from competitors like BYD.\n\nOf course, some of the declines might have to do with customers waiting for Tesla\u2019s long-awaited lineup of lower-priced models \u2014 something that steel and aluminum tariffs could jeopardize.\n\nFor now, sales are down this year in Tesla\u2019s three major car markets, so 2025 isn\u2019t looking so hot for the EV maker.",

Three is reserved for Plaid and the Beast.\u201d\n\nBy that, he meant the top performance \u201cPlaid\u201d versions of Model S and Model X, which do come with a tri-motor powertrain, and the Cyberbeast version of the Cybertruck.\n\nThen Leno had to remind them that they said the Roadster would also have three motors:\n\n\u201cand the Roadster?\u201d\n\nThen, both executives repeated \u201cand the Roadster\u201d before quickly moving on.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nI think the odds of Tesla launching the new Roadster this year just crashed. Not that they were very high to start with.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Roadster wouldn\u2019t be very impactful as a vehicle program, but it would make things fun and exciting at Tesla again with some cutting-edge fun EVs to drive rather than everything being about self-driving.\n\nIt would be a fun distraction amid failing FSD deployment, crashing sales, lower margins, etc.",

Tesla appeals after state denies 4-dealership plan\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Trump wants to end EV tax credits as Musk\u2019s Tesla benefits from them The same Biden-era EV policies that Trump wants to roll back are currently benefiting Tesla CEO and special government employee Elon Musk. Straight Arrow News\n\nAPPLETON - Tesla Inc. estimates Wisconsinites each year buy 3,000 to 4,000 of its electric vehicles. None of those sales happen in Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsinites who want to buy a Cybertruck or Model Y have to go to another state, frequently Illinois or Minnesota, because Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cfactory store\u201d law bars vehicle manufacturers like Tesla and Ford from owning vehicle dealerships with few exemptions.\n\nTesla last year applied for an exemption to open its own dealerships at its existing showrooms in Madison and Milwaukee, plus indicated interest in two more dealerships in Glendale and the Appleton area. The request would have made Wisconsin the 28th state to allow Tesla to directly sell its EVs to customers, but an administrative law judge denied the request in October. Tesla objected, but a state administrator in December upheld the decision.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk-led Tesla filed a petition in Outagamie County Circuit Court asking a judge to either overturn the decision or order a new hearing on the request to open up to four direct-sales dealerships. The petition cited the 3,000-4,000 vehicle sales estimate for Wisconsin and indicated direct-sales dealerships in the state would likely increase that volume.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice has asked Judge Mitchell Metropulos to affirm the state\u2019s decision. The Wisconsin Automobile & Truck Dealers Association (WATDA) wants the decision upheld and also has requested the case be moved to Dane or Milwaukee county. Tesla will have spent more than a year on the effort by the time Metropulos convenes a procedural hearing in late March.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nWhat did Tesla want to do?\n\nTesla in 2020 opened two galleries and service centers in Wisconsin at 12011 W. Silver Spring Drive, in Milwaukee, and at 6624 Seybold Road, in Madison. Consumers can take a look at the vehicles available, learn more about Teslas and arrange service, but can't buy a Tesla.\n\nIn March 2024, Tesla applied to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation for an exemption to turn both of those galleries into direct-to-consumer dealerships owned by Tesla. The application also indicated the company wanted to open two more dealerships in Glendale and in Grand Chute, an Appleton suburb town along Interstate 41 on Appleton's northwest side.\n\nMore EV coverage: Trump administration freezes funds for Wisconsin electrical vehicle charging stations\n\nWhy can't Tesla or Chevy or Honda open their own dealerships in Wisconsin?\n\nWisconsin is among the states that do not allow vehicle manufacturers to own or operate sales dealerships. The state's \"factory store\" law aims to avoid unfair competition that could arise from a vehicle manufacturer owning the dealership, too.\n\nInstead, vehicle manufacturers need to contract with independent dealers such as Wilde Automotive Group in Milwaukee or Bergstrom Automotive in northeastern Wisconsin.\n\nA provision added to the state's 2019 biennial budget would have allowed Tesla to proceed with direct sales in the state, but Gov. Tony Evers vetoed the provision.\n\nFactories can request an exemption from the state, but they must prove there is no independent, licensed dealer available to sell the company's vehicles in a manner that fulfills the public interest and meets a factory's reasonable standards and uniform qualifications.\n\nTesla says its business model rules out independent dealerships\n\nTesla, in its Jan. 15 court petition to overturn the state's denial, claimed it qualifies for an exemption because no independent dealer meets the company's qualifications and standards and profit under its flat-price, direct-to-consumer sales model. It alternately claims it qualifies because state law does not apply or bar a non-franchising factory like Tesla from operating a dealership.\n\nThe company had eight Tesla-owning Wisconsinites testify in the May 2024 exemption hearing, explaining that they enjoyed the uniform retail price system Tesla uses for its vehicles and the middleman-free purchase experience.\n\nTesla in its petition for judicial review claimed that no independent dealership could profitably operate a Tesla dealership because it could not mark up vehicle prices to make a profit since consumers could go online and purchase a vehicle from the company for less. It also said the state's decision violated the company's right to economic liberty (selling EV cars and trucks) enshrined in the Wisconsin State Constitution.\n\nWisconsin car and truck dealerships argue Tesla is not barred from selling cars in Wisconsin, it just can't sell them the way it wants\n\nWisconsin Automobile & Truck Dealers Association, the state's auto dealership industry group, requested to participate in Tesla's exemption hearing and had representatives from four major independent dealerships including Bergstrom and the Russ Darrow Group testify that not only were they interested in Tesla dealerships, they could profitably operate such dealerships without having to mark up Tesla's prices.\n\nDealership representatives said they could make a profit via used electric vehicles trade-ins and sales, as well as EV service and maintenance.\n\nThe association also responded to Tesla's constitution claim by noting state law doesn't bar Tesla from selling cars to Wisconsinites, but does bar the company from owning or controlling its vehicle dealerships.\n\nA WADTA official on Friday declined to comment, citing the ongoing legal matter.\n\nAdministrative law judge rules against Tesla; state administrator upholds decision\n\nThe exemption request went to a hearing before Administrative Law Judge Kristin Fredrick, with the Wisconsin Department of Administration's Division of Hearings and Appeals.\n\nFredrick on Oct. 10 issued a ruling recommending Tesla's request be denied, which the company in November objected to. The company's reasons for objecting were reviewed by DHA Administrator Brian Hayes, who in a Dec. 17 decision affirmed the state's initial decision and denied Tesla's request for an exemption.\n\nHayes wrote that Tesla sought an exemption the state Legislature did not include in the \"factory store\" law that is based on \"circular logic,\" namely that independent dealers can't qualify for a Tesla franchise solely because they are independent and not owned by Tesla.\n\n\"The law, as written, simply does not support the conclusion Tesla seeks,\" Hayes wrote.\n\nWhat's the basis for Tesla's objections and appeal in Outagamie County Circuit Court?\n\nTesla cited six issues as grounds for a review of the state's decision in its Outagamie County Circuit Court petition. Tesla's attorneys did not return a request for an interview or comment.\n\nDHA erred by rejecting Tesla's argument its non-franchising business model rules out any franchised dealer as available.\n\nThe law judge's conclusion that independent dealerships are available to profitably sell Tesla EVs was not supported by solid evidence presented in the case.\n\nThe judge's determination an independent dealer could operate within the public interest is a legal error and unsupported. The company said its direct-to-consumer model saves consumers money compared to franchised dealerships.\n\nWATDA was improperly allowed to join the hearing and its witnesses, evidence and arguments should be rejected. Tesla suggested WATDA's involvement left the decision on whether Tesla qualifies for an exemption up to its competitors.\n\nThe judge's decision rested on legal error in that the decision is unconstitutional because it infringes on Tesla's \"fundamental right of economic liberty\" as enshrined in the Wisconsin Constitution.\n\nDHA should provide Tesla with a new hearing before an impartial administrative law judge. Tesla argues that because the judge shared a her draft decision with the DHA administrators prior to with the parties involved, the company was deprived of an independent, impartial hearing and consideration of its objections.\n\nThe company requests Metropulos issue a judgement that Tesla is entitled to a dealership license. Alternatively, it requested he hold a hearing on the irregularities in the review process it cited, reverse the decision and direct DHA to correct any errors in the procedure and, if necessary, grant Tesla a new hearing.\n\nWhy did the auto and truck dealers request the case be moved out of Appleton?\n\nTesla in its petition said Outagamie County is the proper place to hear its petition because that is the location of one of its proposed dealerships affected by the state's decision.\n\nWATDA on Feb. 5 filed a \"change of venue\" motion to move the case to either Dane County or Milwaukee County.\n\nThe association's attorney's argue the case belongs in Madison or Milwaukee because Tesla currently operates two galleries in Madison and Milwaukee and only applied for two dealerships, in Madison and Milwaukee, while merely indicating an interest in dealerships in Glendale and Grand Chute.\n\nWhat has the Wisconsin Department of Justice said in response to Tesla's petition?\n\nIn a Feb. 5 filing statement of position filed by Attorney General Josh Kaul and an assistant attorney general, the state denied most of Tesla's arguments and the company's claims that it's entitled to a new hearing or approval of its request.\n\nDOJ requested Metropulos affirm the state's original decision.\n\nA request on Friday for an interview or comment from the DOJ was not returned.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nA hearing on WATDA's request for a change of venue to Dane or Milwaukee county circuit court.\n\nMetropulos will hold the hearing at 9:30 a.m. March 24 in the Outagamie County Courthouse, 320 S.

However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.\n\nInvestigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.\n\nAs such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.\n\nMusk\u2019s empire\n\nAmong Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.\n\nA host of Musk\u2019s other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.\n\nFILE - Workers install lighting on an \"X\" sign atop the company headquarters, formerly known as Twitter, in downtown San Francisco, July 28, 2023.

SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.\n\nMusk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.\n\nThose donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.\n\nAs the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.\n\nEven before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d\n\nProposed actions will help Tesla\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.\n\nThe action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.\n\nThe transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.\n\n\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.\n\nAuto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.\n\nA Tesla Cybertruck passes an ice-encased tree along a slick road in Wake Forest, N.C,.

The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.\n\nThis video, provided by attorneys for Dillon Angulo, shows the Tesla crash that killed his girlfriend, Naibel Benavides Leon, and severely injured him. (Attorneys for Dillon Angulo via AP)\n\nBenavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.\n\n\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations.

In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon\u2019s family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d\n\nTesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\u201d an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon\u2019s attorney disputes.\n\nFILE - Tesla vehicles line a parking lot at the company\u2019s Fremont, Calif., factory, on Sept. 18, 2023.

It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.\n\nThe agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.\n\nOther federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:\n\n\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.\n\n\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.\n\n\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.\n\n\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.\n\nExperts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\n\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d\n\nTrump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.\n\nTesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.\n\nThe small safety agency in Musk\u2019s crosshairs\n\nThe federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.\n\n\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d\n\nMusk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d\n\nElon Musk speaks with Michael Milken at a Milken Institute event in Los Angeles on May 6, 2024. (Milken Institute via AP)\n\nMichael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.\n\nAs with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.\n\nThat threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.\n\n\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d\n\nNHTSA conducting several probes of Tesla\n\nAmong the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.\n\nAn investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.\n\nUnder pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.\n\nNHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.\n\nThe agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.\n\nNHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.\n\nThat recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.\n\nThis photo provided by the Laguna Beach Police Department shows a Tesla sedan, left, in autopilot mode that crashed into a parked police cruiser Tuesday, May 29, 2018, in Laguna Beach, Calif.

Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions.

The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.\n\n\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d\n\nThe collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.\n\nAttorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.\n\nHowever, Schreiber and other lawyers say if the federal government\u2019s investigative powers don\u2019t remain intact, Tesla may also not be held accountable in court.\n\nIn the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides Leon filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.\n\n\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case.

It had controlled more than 75% in 2022.\n\nThe U.S. is hardly the company\u2019s only problem spot.\n\nSales Dropping in Europe, China, Too\n\nChina has accounted for over a third of Tesla\u2019s global sales in recent years. Reuters reports that Tesla sales \u201cfell 11.5% to 63,238 units in January from a year earlier, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.\u201d\n\nIn Germany, Tesla sales fell by a remarkable 59% in January alone, The New York Times reports. Tesla sales dropped in all three of Europe\u2019s largest markets. \u201cTesla\u2019s sales plummeted 63% in France in January from a year earlier, and 12% in Britain,\u201d the Times notes.\n\nNorway, home to the world\u2019s largest concentration of EVs, saw Tesla sales fall 38% last month.\n\nAging Lineup Partly to Blame?\n\nBlame may fall partly on a largely stale lineup. Only the Cybertruck rides on an up-to-date 800-volt architecture like rival models from Hyundai, Kia, Porsche, and others. Four of Tesla\u2019s five models ride on an older 400-volt system designed for the 2012 model-year debut of the Model S. Tesla has given its Model 3 and Model Y visual updates, but the technology that drives them trails what many competitors have to offer.\n\nThe company has not publicly disclosed the development of any high-volume new models. In a recent conference call with investors, company executives promised lower-cost cars in 2025, but said they would likely be derived from current models.\n\nSales may, however, be slumping for reasons that have nothing to do with the cars. InsideEVs notes, \u201cone factor feels inescapable at this point: the backlash to Elon Musk\u2019s increased involvement in politics.\u201d\n\nControversial CEO\u2019s Political Crusade May Be Hurting Sales\n\nElectrek reports, \u201cTesla stores have increasingly become targets of vandals amid rising discontent with the company\u2019s CEO.\u201d A Loveland, Colorado, Tesla store was the target of an arson attempt last week, the site notes.\n\nProtestors recently projected the phrase \u201cHeil Tesla\u201d onto a Berlin factory, while vandals spraypainted swastikas on a showroom in The Hague, the site reports.\n\nWhatever the cause, the sales slump appears to have spooked some high-profile investors. Under securities law, public companies must report stock sales by executives and board members.\n\nElectrek notes that Tesla Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja, Board of Directors head Robyn Denholm, and board member Kimbal Musk (younger brother of the CEO) have all sold tens of millions of dollars worth of Tesla stock this month.\n\nTesla stock traded at over $424 when markets opened after inauguration day in January. It sits at just over $360 at press time for this article.",

But sometimes there\u2019s just a perfect storm of irony and eye-rollery and embarrassing fanboyism and powerful, important lessons about the sometimes serious limitations of Level 2 driving systems. This is one of those times, thanks to a tweet that is going viral which hits all of these key points, and has a dramatic picture as well. It\u2019s really the total package. We have to talk about it, at least a little.\n\nI should mention that while the Cybertruck here looks pretty badly messed up and is likely totaled, nobody was actually hurt, so that\u2019s good. Modern cars are very good about not killing the beings inside them in wrecks, and we\u2019re seeing a great example of that here.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s one of the key points of the tweet, which has been seen by 2.4 million people:\n\nHere\u2019s a bigger screenshot of the text:\n\nComplimenting The Car That Helped Cause The Crash To Keep The \u2018Haters\u2019 Away\n\nWhat many seem to find amazing, and the reason the tweet is going viral, is that the poster seems worried about what the dashcam footage of his wreck will do for the \u201cbears/haters\u201d after his car crashed itself into a pole.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere\u2019s an awful lot here to unpack. Of course, the first thing that jumps out to most people is how the Cybertruck owner thanks Tesla for \u201cengineering the best passive safety in the world.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s actually true, though the Cybertruck does have some impressive passive safety features, and like many modern vehicles, it is generally safe in a wreck, and it is genuinely amazing that the owner here came out without a scratch. And then in the next sentence the owner states that the Cybertruck \u201cfailed to merge out of a lane that was ending (there was no one on my left) and made no attempt to slow down\u201d which resulted in the Cybertruck hopping a curb and smacking right into that large streetlight pole, as you can see in the photograph included with the tweet.\n\nNotice I said \u201cowner\u201d there instead of \u201cdriver,\u201d because that leads to the next, far more important point. There\u2019s the irony, of course, of thanking Tesla for making a vehicle that\u2019s so safe in a wreck, and then going on to mention that the very same vehicle caused the wreck. It\u2019s very good at dealing with the problem it created!\n\nIt\u2019s Proof That These Level 2 Systems Are Problematic\n\nNow, where this gets more complex, and leads to the owner/driver distinction I mentioned before, is that exactly who or what was in control of that 6,000+ pounds of Cybertruck is not clear. The tweet definitely makes it seem like Tesla\u2019s FSD software (noted in the tweet to be version 13.2.4, which is less than a month old) was in full control of the car, which made the decisions that led to crashing into that light pole, and the fact that despite the car heading towards the pole, the human inside did nothing to stop the situation, pretty clearly showing they were not in control or paying attention.\n\nThis, of course, is precisely how one is not supposed to use a Level 2 system, which requires constant driver vigilance, and is also the fundamental reason why all semi-automated driving systems are doomed: because people are terrible at using them. And, even worse and more paradoxically, the better a job the Level 2 system does, the worse it is for people to actually use and the more likely it is to be abused, as we see in this situation.\n\nBy the way, if you don\u2019t remember what those automated driving levels are, here\u2019s the chart. Remember, the levels don\u2019t indicate how good or advanced the system is, but rather dictate the relationship between the human and the machine when it comes to how the driving responsibility is shared:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll Tesla FSD systems on the road today are Level 2 systems, meaning the human is always responsible, no matter how well the system works or how long it\u2019s been since your last intervention. Under FSD, you have to be ready to take over at a moment\u2019s notice, unless you\u2019re cool with, say, smashing your $100,000 stainless steel truck into a huge post.\n\nOther tweets by the owner seem to suggest a pattern with taking FSD at its name and just treating it like an actual Level 4 or 5 self-driving system \u2013 which, again, it isn\u2019t \u2013 as you can infer here:\n\nSo, the Twitter-poster here gets in his Cybertruck and turns on FSD and is so distracted he doesn\u2019t even remember where he asked it to go? Even when there\u2019s Taco Bell at the end? Bizarre.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is, of course, precisely the worst way to use any sort of Level 2 driving-assist system and remains the biggest issue with such systems. People are genuinely confused about just how much a driver-assist system does, and even when they\u2019re not confused, people still get incredibly distracted when using driver-assist systems that they\u2019re supposed to be monitoring, because of course they do.\n\nWe\u2019ve known this would be a problem since 1948, when Mackworth\u2019s famous study \u201cThe Breakdown of Vigilance during Prolonged Visual Search\u201d demonstrated that intense and prolonged vigilance to a mostly independently-operating system is simply not something people are good at. At all. Tesla\u2019s FSD not only calls itself a \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system, which sets up unrealistic expectations, but it\u2019s also generally quite good at what it does, which means it is very easy for people to end up in the same situation as Mr.Pole-Pegged Cybertruck over here: too comfortable and then ultimately fucked.\n\nBecause no matter how good FSD may be most of the time, it\u2019s not actually a Level 4 or 5 system, and even if it\u2019s been doing fantastic for months, you have no idea when it may suddenly decide to not realize a lane is ending and crash into a pole. I know it\u2019s tempting for ardent defenders of FSD or other automated driving systems to blame these sorts of wrecks on lighting or weather or confusing environmental setups, calling them \u201cedge cases\u201d and suggesting that these circumstances are uncommon, and not worth making a big fuss about.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing about \u201cedge cases\u201d: the world is full of edge cases. That\u2019s what reality is! Messy, chaotic edge cases, with some veneer of order slapped down over everything. Look at where this wreck happened, for example, on that map of a section of Reno, Nevada there. That\u2019s not a particularly challenging area, really. It looks like it was dark, but we\u2019re not talking about some labyrinthine narrow, crowded streets in an ancient European city or anything like that: these are big, well-lit roads that aren\u2019t even particularly dense, traffic-wise. I\u2019m sure the FSD instance in that very same Cybertruck has navigated far more complex situations than this (FSD is a thoroughly impressive system). But, this time, for whatever arcane reason made up of ones and zeros, it got confused and drove right smack into a pole, like an idiot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe owner should have been able to see this coming with plenty of time to react. If I understand what happened correctly, then the wreck is his fault, no question. He was using this software in a stupid way, and thankfully that stupidity didn\u2019t hurt anyone else. But while the owner is likely entirely to blame, at the same time, that blame is shared with the very concept of a Level 2 driving system itself, which has been shown time and time again to foster this sort of dangerous inattention.\n\nYes, it appears our Cybertruck-lover wasn\u2019t being particularly smart here, but he was guided to that idiocy by a technology that is technically very advanced, but practically crude and foolish. You can\u2019t ask a machine to take over 90% or more of a task and then expect a person to remain alert and vigilant, at least not all the time. This wreck seems stupid on pretty much every level possible, the driver\u2019s stupidity and the inherent stupidity of Level 2 semi-autonomy working hand-in-hand to make sure this person no longer has a working car.\n\nWe\u2019ve reported on these sorts of wrecks before, we\u2019ve told you about the studies and findings and research, and we will continue to do so, because wrecks like this show that the message is still not being heard. FSD, no matter what version number, no matter how few interventions you saw on some YouTube video of a drive, does not drive a car by itself. There still must be a human there, ready and able and willing to take over when it screws up. Which it may never do. Or it may do in the next minute. The point is, you just don\u2019t know.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of ridiculous we still are letting all this happen without really trying to find better solutions for the goal of self-driving. Sure, L2 is a great way to get self-driving data, but the way these systems are set up is kind of backwards. When the concept is that the machine is in more control and the human is watching or observing or monitoring, the tendency will always be less vigilance on the human\u2019s part. If this was reversed, and a human was always in control with the software being ready to assist in emergencies or to compensate for driver failure, you could get all the data without introducing these vigilance-induced problems.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a lot less sexy, and people want to not pay attention if they don\u2019t have to. So here we are.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n(Topshot: X, Jonathan Challinger)",

            "content": "It\u2019s hard to believe it was ever a controversial take, but a little over two years ago, I argued that Tesla\u2019s market share was poised to decline due to Elon Musk\u2019s behavior. I cited a range of factors\u2014from intensifying competition and supply chain challenges to a less-discussed (at that time), but equally important, variable: Elon Musk\u2019s controversial acquisition of Twitter. I predicted that his behavior on the platform would alienate the very customer base most likely to purchase an electric vehicle, eventually impacting Tesla sales.\n\nI suggested that it might take a bit of time, because Tesla didn\u2019t have a lot of competition and many Tesla orders were already in the pipeline, but I thought his actions would eventually drive customers away.\n\nSome critics at the time dismissed this view as overly sensational. One commenter called it a \u201cstupid and one-sided analysis\u201d, adding \u201cThis article makes it sound like Elon Musk is ruining Tesla with his Twitter-related actions, but revenues are still up every year.\u201d\n\nData Validates the Warning\n\nRecent data appears to validate my previous analysis.\n\nThe latest figures indicate that even though the EV market grew last year, Tesla\u2019s 2024 deliveries dropped double digits from 2023, confirming that the company has indeed lost momentum. It isn\u2019t just the inevitable result of a rapidly expanding EV market where more models are emerging; there\u2019s growing evidence that Musk\u2019s actions have actively deterred potential buyers.\n\nNow, as Tesla\u2019s latest quarterly numbers reveal a marked decline in deliveries, it\u2019s becoming increasingly hard to ignore the impact of Musk\u2019s public persona on the brand. While Tesla continues to maintain a robust revenue stream, the dilution of brand loyalty is evident.\n\nThe California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA) noted, \u201cThings aren\u2019t looking so golden for EV automaker Tesla in the Golden State. Tesla\u2019s dominance in the electric vehicle market continues to falter as the brand reported its fifth consecutive quarterly registration decline. Tesla\u2019s registrations fell 7.8 percent in Q4 2024, contributing to an overall 11.6 percent decline in 2024.\u201d\n\nImpact of Musk\u2019s Public Persona\n\nWhen the company once enjoyed a near-mythical status as the undisputed leader of the EV revolution, its products were not only about performance and innovation but also about aspirational branding. Today, however, that narrative appears fractured by the growing politicization of Musk.\n\nCritics have argued that Tesla\u2019s market share decline is the inevitable result of an expanding overall EV market, with traditional automakers and startups alike launching competitive models. Indeed, the numbers reflect that the overall market is growing, which in itself presents a challenge for any single company.\n\nYet, there is more to the story. The loss in market share isn\u2019t solely a byproduct of fierce competition or production constraints\u2014it\u2019s also a signal that consumers are reacting to leadership decisions that seem increasingly disconnected from core customer expectations.\n\nIn retrospect, my previous analysis wasn\u2019t just a contrarian take on market dynamics\u2014it was a warning that corporate governance and brand stewardship matter immensely. Musk\u2019s high-profile moves have shifted public discourse in ways that extend far beyond social media. The resulting erosion of trust among a segment of Tesla\u2019s traditional customer base is now reflected in the declining delivery numbers despite an EV market that is still growing.\n\nLooking Ahead: Rebuilding the Connection\n\nAs the data unfolds, it\u2019s clear that while Tesla still delivers impressive technological advancements, the company now faces a critical juncture. The challenge is not only to sustain innovation but to rebuild the connection with consumers that once fueled its meteoric rise.\n\nIn the end, the evolving narrative around Tesla serves as a reminder: even the most dominant market players must heed the multifaceted demands of modern business\u2014where product excellence, public perception, and leadership behavior all play crucial roles. Musk\u2019s Twitter escapade was seen as peripheral by some, but as Tesla\u2019s latest figures suggest, they\u2019re proving to be a factor in the company\u2019s current market performance.\n\nWhile Tesla\u2019s share price remains robust, the decline in deliveries signals that its brand is under strain. This divergence underscores a critical reality: technological prowess alone no longer guarantees market dominance. Tesla now faces the formidable challenge of re-establishing a connection with its customers while maintaining its relentless pace of innovation. As investor sentiment begins to factor in the broader implications of leadership decisions and public perception, the coming quarters will be pivotal in determining whether Tesla can reverse the trend.\n\nBy Robert Rapier\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

            "content": "The redesigned Tesla Model Y has arrived in the UK. Awaited, photographed and finally seen live, it debuted with several updates, both in terms of aesthetics and equipment. Will it still be the world's best-selling electric car? It is too early to say, as several very strong competitors have entered the market in the last year.\n\nThe first is the new BYD Sealion 7, a direct competitor to Musk's SUV in terms of size and mechanics, which comes from China and has very similar content and technology, but a slightly smaller boot and slightly more competitive prices. As always, we compared them again on paper to find out all the main differences and similarities.\n\nExterior\n\nStarting with the exterior and in alphabetical order, we begin with the dimensions of the BYD. With a length of 4.83 m, the Chinese car is indeed larger than the Model Y and shows this with much more imposing proportions. Its general lines are reminiscent of something aquatic, and indeed its name is Sealion, a mammal found in the coldest regions of the world, which was the source of inspiration for the designers.\n\nIn addition to the rounded shapes, this new BYD also features the ever-present X-shaped front end that characterises all of the brand's cars, but this time combined with bulkier light clusters and an almost coup\u00e9-like rear end characterised by horizontally developed headlights with a light signature.\n\nPhoto by: BYD BYD Sealion 7, the new Chinese challenger Photo by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\nThe redesigned Tesla Model Y, on the other hand, is completely new at the front and rear and has changed slightly in size. The mid-life update of the American SUV has in fact increased its dimensions by around 4 cm, a change also aimed at improving aerodynamics (Cx goes from 0.23 to 0.22).\n\nThe Model Y \"Juniper\" - as the project is called - is now 4.79 metres long, 1.92 metres wide and 1.62 metres high, with a wheelbase that stops at 2.89 metres. All new are the front headlights and rear lights, which are now connected by a single light band that has certainly freshened up the car's overall design, as well as high and low beams on a second level. The rear is also inspired by coup\u00e9 shapes.\n\nModel Length Width Height Wheelbase BYD Sealion 7 4.83 m 1.93 m 1.62 m 2.93 m Tesla Model Y 4.79 m 1.92 m 1.62 m 2.89 m\n\nInterior\n\nOn board, the BYD Sealion 7's interior is generally simple, but nevertheless personal. The dashboard in particular, like the exterior, has been designed with an eye to the sea and echoes the nautical theme, while the upholstery is high quality with leather and soft plastics.\n\nIn terms of technology, on the other hand, the large 15.6\" swivel screen, which can be swivelled vertically and horizontally, and which is combined with the 10.25\" instrument panel, is certainly very impressive. Finally, although it does not have record-breaking capacity, the boot is well exploitable and has a volume that starts at 520 litres and reaches 1,789 litres when the rear seats are folded down. Add to this the 58 litres of the frunk, the front compartment.\n\nIn terms of technology, the large 15.6-inch screen, which can be tilted and swivelled, combined with the 10.25-inch instrument panel, is certainly impressive. Finally, the boot, although not record-breaking in capacity, is very usable, with a volume that starts at 520 litres and reaches 1,789 litres when the rear seats are folded down. Add to this the 58 litres of the front boot.\n\nPhoto by: BYD BYD Sealion 7, the interior Photo by: Tesla Tesla Model Y 2025, the interior\n\nMinimalism is also the key word for the interior of the newly renovated Tesla Model Y. In keeping with the tradition of Musk's cars, the interior is also very minimalist, with the new large 15.4-inch touchscreen at the centre, the true command centre of the vehicle, from which it is possible to manage all the main functions, from infotainment to on-board comfort control, eliminating the need for traditional buttons.\n\nAs with the rest of the range, the Juniper features a new 8-inch rear monitor in the centre of the front tunnel, dedicated to rear-seat entertainment: it can be used to control the climate control and a range of multimedia content, including some games for the kids.\n\nAmong the most interesting features are the enormous fixed panoramic roof, which gives the interior a feeling of great brightness, and the boot with a truly remarkable capacity: 854 litres in 5-seater configuration, rising to 2,158 litres in 2-seater configuration, all completed by the additional 117 litres of boot space.\n\nModel Digital instrumentation Central monitor Luggage compartment BYD Sealion 7 10.25-inch 15.6-inch 520/1,789 litres + frunk 58 litres Tesla Model Y absent 15.4-inch 854/2,158 litres + frunk of 117 litres\n\nPhoto by: BYD BYD Sealion 7, the boot Tesla Model Y, the boot\n\nEngines\n\nBut let's leave aside the interior and exterior and move on to the mechanicals, where there are a few things to say. Starting with the BYD Sealion 7, the Chinese crossover is available in two versions called Comfort and Excellence.\n\nThe first uses an 82.5 kWh battery and a rear-mounted 313 PS electric motor for a range of 300 miles in the WLTP cycle. The second uses a 91.3 kWh battery pack and a twin electric motor powertrain (capable of activating four-wheel drive) with a total of 530 PS. In this case, the range is 312 miles. Both versions can be recharged up to 230 kW in direct current, which drops to 11 kW in alternating current.\n\nPhoto by: BYD Two versions for the BYD Sealion 7 Photo by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\nThe new Tesla, on the other hand, will initially only be available in the UK in the Long Range All-Wheel Drive version, the top of the range, with a claimed WLTP cycle range of 353 miles, 0-62 mph time of 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 135 mph.\n\nObviously, the powertrain is dual motor and therefore capable of developing electric all-wheel drive, and is powered by a 78.4 kWh net capacity battery that can be recharged via a DC fast charger with a maximum output of 250 kW and a standard AC charger with a maximum output of 11.5 kW.\n\nBoth models use a heat pump to improve the car's air conditioning efficiency in cold weather.\n\nModel Versions BYD Sealion 7 82.5 kWh and 313 PS 91.3 kWh and 530 PS Tesla Model Y 78.4 kWh and 450 PS\n\nPrices\n\nThe BYD Sealion 7 starts at \u00a346,990 for the rear-wheel drive model and goes up to \u00a358,990 for the top-of-the-range variant with dual electric motors.\n\nThe new Tesla Model Y, on the other hand, can only be ordered in the UK for the time being in the Launch Edition Long Range AWD version with a price of \u00a360,990, alternatively it can be leased (PCP) with a variable duration, from 24 to 48 months.\n\nModel Minimum price Maximum price BYD Sealion 7 \u00a346,990 \u00a358,990 Tesla Model Y n.a. \u00a360,990\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Tesla didn't provide any information about the revised Model Y when it was unveiled online a few weeks ago.\n\nNow, it has published a video featuring some of the key people who worked on the vehicle.\n\nThey reveal exactly what has been changed, what the improvements are and what their favorite bits of the car are.\n\nIt\u2019s been over two weeks since Tesla unexpectedly unveiled the heavily revised version of its Model Y crossover known as project Juniper. The manufacturer never put out a press release outlining the changes it made to the Model Y, but it has now released a video showcasing the new features, and, unsurprisingly, there were some things we missed.\n\nThe big thing everybody was talking about when the Model Y Juniper was revealed online was the design changes. It looks completely different with full-width front and rear light bars and redone fascias. What we didn\u2019t know, though, is that Tesla managed to make the trunk opening larger on the Juniper than on the pre-refresh model.\n\nWe did spot some new things when we saw a made-in-Germany Model Y in the metal earlier this month, like the new drain plug in the revised frunk, the new electric folding rear bench or the general improvement in interior materials and assembly quality. What we couldn\u2019t have known (since we\u2019ve not driven one yet) is that the revised cabin is also 20% quieter, which was achieved through the use of acoustic glass all around the vehicle.\n\nThe video also shows what appears to be a tailored cool box that fits perfectly inside the frunk. They also mention that a line of dedicated Model Y accessories will be revealed soon, and this is one of them, but they don\u2019t hint at what the others are.\n\nGallery: 2025 Tesla Model Y 17 InsideEVs/Andrei Nedelea\n\nThe Juniper gets around 3% more EPA range (up from 311 miles to 320 miles in the Long Range All-Wheel Drive variant), most of which comes from improved efficiency. In the video, Tesla VP for Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy notes that real-world driving efficiency has increased by \u201calmost 10%,\u201d which doesn\u2019t quite match the state range gain, but it\u2019s still a welcome improvement.\n\nThis was achieved by \u201crevisiting every single component,\u201d although the new wheels and tires that the car ships with likely play a significant part in the efficiency gain.\n\nLike the Model 3 Highland, the Model Y gets a completely overhauled suspension system, which is more geared toward comfort than before. As we\u2019ve seen in the Model 3, this does away with some handling sharpness and engagement, but the comfort gains are so significant that we can forgive it. We\u2019re sure the Performance variant will have stiffer suspension, which driving enthusiasts prefer, not regular drivers.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nTesla design boss Franz von Holzhausen revealed his favorite part of the redesigned Model Y. It\u2019s not the new reflective rear light bar, which is an industry first, but rather the light this emits onto the ground behind the vehicle. Von Holzhausen likens this to the afterburner glow of a jet airplane, and we agree that it looks really cool and unique.\n\nWe will soon be driving the Model Y Juniper in Europe. The car needs to deliver and then some to counteract falling Tesla sales worldwide, partly caused by Elon Musk\u2019s pivot into politics and his support of Preisdent Donald Trump, who is openly anti-EV. It would be wild if the Model Y ceased be the world\u2019s best-selling vehicle in the same year when it received a significant update that made it better in every single way after two years straight as the global best-seller. With all that's happening at Tesla these days, trying to predict how this year will pan out for the manufacturer is virtually impossible.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

However, Tesla claims that it will soon work without driver supervision\u2014hence the name.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nChallinger said that he was driving with FSD v13.2.4 on the right lane, which was ending and merging into the left lane, but the car failed to merge and hit the curb.\n\nHe said that he failed to react in time and take control of the Cybertruck:\n\nIt failed to merge out of a lane that was ending (there was no one on my left) and made no attempt to slow down or turn until it had already hit the curb.\n\nThe Cybertruck then crashed into a light post. He was lucky to walkway without a scratch.\n\nTo be fair, it was a strange location for a post, but there\u2019s no reason why Tesla FSD shouldn\u2019t have moved lane and even if it wouldn\u2019t have changed lane, it should have hit the curb or post (pictures via TroyTeslike):\n\nChallinger said that he shared the story as a \u201cpublic service announcement\u201d to tell people to remain attentive when using Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving system and not become complacent:\n\nBig fail on my part, obviously. Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did. Pay attention. It can happen. I follow Tesla and FSD pretty closely and haven\u2019t heard of any accident on V13 at all before this happened. It is easy to get complacent now \u2013 don\u2019t.\n\nIt might be the first crash on Tesla\u2019s latest FSD v13, which CEO Elon Musk has presented as \u201cmind-blowing\u201d and an important step toward achieving \u201cunsupervised self-driving\u201d by the end of the year.\n\nMusk and his Tesla influencers often share FSD videos claiming that the technology is \u201con the verge of becoming truly self-driving,\u201d despite data evidence pointing to Tesla still being years away from achieving this.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nThis guy is lucky to be alive, and he is right. There\u2019s a problem with people becoming complacent with FSD, and Tesla, and especially Elon Musk, are not doing enough to prevent that from happening.\n\nOn the contrary, Musk continues to hype every update, like Tesla is on the verge of solving self-driving, and claims that its quarterly safety report proves that FSD is safer than human driving, which is misleading.\n\nIf Tesla was developing FSD in a vacuum without Elon\u2019s claims that it would be solved every year for the last 5 years and Tesla selling the software package to customers without any clear idea of when it can be achieved or on what hardware, it would be celebrated product.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s a product that is making Tesla lose credibility and potentially dangerous, as we see today.\n\nI myself had the exact same problem that Challinger described where a lane ends, but FSD doesn\u2019t detect it. It\u2019s weird because it works most of the time so you can get this sentiment of complacency and give the system a chance to move. In this case, it evidently went too far.\n\nBe careful out there and stop believing Elon Musk when he talks about self-driving.",

The company also said that it will offer a 3-percent discount on a terms\u2019 worth of premiums to those who opt to switch to the new policy.\n\nTesla also says that customers must elect to switch to the policy by four days before March 14 in order to be eligible for the discount.\n\nREAD MORE ON TESLA INSURANCE: Tesla partners with Zurich to provide insurance in Australia\n\nAt this time, California is still the only state in which Tesla insurance can\u2019t use real-time Safety Scores for premium rates, though customers can access this feature in the 11 other states where the company\u2019s insurance program is available. Last weekend, Tesla insurance also launched discounts in Arizona and Texas for those who use Supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) for 50 percent or more of their driving.\n\nAlong with its insurance program in the U.S., Tesla appears to be preparing to launch insurance services in China, as the company officially registered a brokerage in the country in August.

Lincoln Ave., according to Loveland Police. The dealership's building and some of its vehicles were spray-painted with graffiti. Police said some of the graffiti was offensive and hateful.\"\n\nThe report says Federal ATF agents are also investigating after someone vandalized a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colorado, and tried to start a fire as well.\n\n9 News says that whoever did this targeted the Tesla dealer and the Tesla cars on the lot. In the 9 News report, a Tesla Cybertruck sits on the dealer's lot as ATF agents look at the truck's vandalism. The image does not show what was spray painted on the side of the polarizing truck.\n\nKevin Vaughn, a reporter for 9 News, says,\n\n\"This is the third time this dealership has been vandalized in the last ten days, and Loveland police said this is the most serious of the three incidents.\"\n\nA woman driving by on Saturday morning captured words left on the dealership's front windows overnight that said, \"Nazi Cars,\" says Vaughn.\n\nThe FBI and ATF are Assisting in the Investigations\n\nThe report says agents from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrived to investigate. At this point, they don't know anything about the alleged arson.\n\nThere is no visible sign of a fire, and the dealership has remained open and operating normally. Customers have been seen coming and going, and even vehicles are going out on test drives.\n\nReporters are Told To Contact Tesla For a Statement\n\n\"Management at the Tesla dealership told 9 News to contact Tesla's national press office for details about this incident. We sent a message to them asking for a comment and have not heard back.\"\n\n9 News also asked for more information about the attempted arson, and a Loveland Police spokesperson said they did not have additional information at this time.\n\nThe Tesla dealer also filed similar reports of vandalism on January 29 and February 2, police said. The previous vandalisms were of a lesser proportion, according to Loveland Police.\n\nA post on the Tesla Owners Facebook page says,\n\n\"Tesla appears to be a frequent target of political activists, as this marks the third act of vandalism at this location. Over the past decade, the company has faced similar incidents, often from individuals opposing electric vehicles or environmentalists concerned about lithium and cobalt mining. However, recent attacks are not limited to dealerships but also extend to Tesla owners.\"\n\n\"The company has become an easy target for those frustrated with its CEO's actions, though it's important to remember that Tesla is much bigger than one person. While Elon Musk is a brilliant engineer, he has openly discussed his struggles with Asperger's syndrome, which can impact social interactions.\"\n\n\"Regardless of personal opinions about its leadership, Tesla remains committed to its mission: \"accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy.\"\n\nBy the way, before we move forward you need to know that Tesla recently made something seemingly impossible, by making the Cybertruck looking cheap, using the Model X. How? Look at this fresh video from the Youtube Channel of Torque News.\n\nAre Tesla Owners Being Targeted?\n\nReddit users say they have been targeted.\n\nOne Tesla owner posted images of the damage in a Tesla Model Y Reddit post. The photos show smashed front and driver's side windows.\n\nAnother Redditor experienced a similar situation. After writing a Facebook post encouraging people to switch to an EV to save money on gas, they woke up to find that their car's charging port had been damaged.\n\nfedora_and_a_whip says, \"My wife and I came out of the grocery store to find a banana peel tossed on the vault cover of our Cybertruck. No harm, but obviously, someone was jealous.\"\n\nWildy84 - \"I also love how they say vandalism towards electric vehicles is common'\u2026 um, no, it's not, especially not in Portland. Tesla is the only brand (EV or not) that's specifically targeted. This week, three Tesla vehicles were keyed in my wife's office car park.\"\n\nFinal Thoughts and Questions for Tesla Owners\n\nA report from TCD says, \"Tesla CEO Elon Musk's recent controversial moments could also have played a role, as some Tesla owners have even said they would be selling their vehicle as a result. It seems likely that anyone with concerns about Musk would understand that owning a Tesla does not mean approval of everything the company's leader has said and done.\u201d\n\nAre You Concerned About Being Targeted?\n\nIf you're a Tesla owner who has experienced vandalism, we encourage you to share your story.

This marks a significant increase from 13.94% in January 2024, showing steady growth in the brand\u2019s EV adoption. More importantly, this figure places BMW well ahead of its premium rivals. While both Audi and Mercedes are seeing modest electric growth, neither has reached BMW\u2019s numbers in absolute or percentage terms.\n\nAudi sold 1,922 BEVs (13.12% share)\n\nMercedes-Benz delivered 2,211 BEVs (11.21% share)\n\nBMW Surpasses Tesla in Its Home Market\n\nA year ago, BMW trailing behind Tesla in its home market was the norm. But the situation has now reversed. In January 2025, BMW sold 2,795 battery electric vehicles, more than double Tesla\u2019s 1,277 registrations, a 60% drop. This follows BMW\u2019s success in 2024, when it sold more EVs than Tesla in Germany for the full year.\n\nTesla\u2019s decline in Germany is part of a broader trend. The brand\u2019s global sales have been under pressure. In France, Tesla\u2019s sales fell even further, plunging 63% year-over-year in January. Meanwhile, in the UK, Tesla also saw an 8% decline.\n\nThe Power of a Flexible Architecture\n\nBMW\u2019s strength in the EV market isn\u2019t driven by a single model but by a well-balanced lineup that caters to multiple segments. This is all achieved through a flexible architecture which allows BMW to offer different drivetrains on the same platform.\n\nThe top-performing models in January were:\n\nThis highlights BMW\u2019s ability to appeal to different customer bases, from compact SUVs to executive sedans, unlike Tesla, which relies heavily on a more limited model range. The iX2, iX3 and i7 also contribute to BMW\u2019s broader EV portfolio, giving customers more choices than its premium competitors.\n\nWith the Neue Klasse lineup on the horizon, this dominance is likely to continue, considering the major tech improvements coming with the new architecture.

            "content": "A hefty price increase for the Model S: since yesterday, Friday, Tesla has been charging \u20ac17,000 or 18 per cent more for its five-metre saloon. The previous base price of \u20ac92,990 is still listed on the Model S website, but according to the configurator, the normal all-wheel drive model with two motors now costs \u20ac109,990. The Plaid variant now costs \u20ac119,990 instead of \u20ac107,990, an increase of 11 per cent.\n\nThere are similar price increases for the Model X, according to Teslamag. Perhaps as a consolation, Tesla is reintroducing free Supercharging for both models. This will apply to all Model S and X purchases from 6 February, according to the configurator. It states:\n\n\"Eligibility for free Supercharger use and premium connectivity is linked to the vehicle's VIN and the original named driver, who must also take possession of the vehicle. Free Supercharger use and Premium Connectivity cannot be transferred to another person or vehicle in the event of a change of ownership.\"\n\nThis news gives us the opportunity to update our model overview of the Model S. The luxury saloon was Tesla's second electric car after the Roadster; the model was launched in 2012, so it has been \"in service\" for over ten years. At the end of 2021, it underwent an extensive technical upgrade, including a slight facelift.\n\n9\n\nThe Plaid+ version announced for 2021 was never released, and the new Plaid version was initially only available in the USA. The Plaid has only been available in Germany since August 2022. The regular all-wheel-drive version was also delayed in Germany: the Model S Dual Motor only appeared in the German configurator at the beginning of 2023.\n\nDrives and battery\n\nThe Model S is available with two engine options, labelled \"All Wheel Drive\" and \"Plaid\" in the configurator. \"Plaid is a reference to the science fiction parody Space Balls. Here are the key specs:\n\nModel S Dual Motor Model S Plaid Drive system AWD with 2 electric motors AWD with 3 electric motors Motor power front/rear 343 PS / 343 PS 466 PS / 2x 420 PS System output 670 PS 1,020 PS 0-62 mph 3.2 sec. 2.1 sec. (roll-out start) Top speed 155 mph 200 mph WLTP power consumption 17.5 kWh 18.7 kWh Net battery (unofficial) approx. 95 kWh (NCA) approx. 95 kWh (NCA) WLTP range approx. 449 miles (19 inch)\n\n394 miles (21 inch) approx. 432 miles (19 inch)\n\n373 miles (21 inch) Price \u20ac109,990 \u20ac119,990\n\nThe basic Model S has two 343 PS motors. The system output is slightly less than the sum of the engine outputs. The Plaid also has four-wheel drive, but with three motors - one at the front and two at the rear. The system power (1,020 PS) is significantly lower than the sum of the motor powers (1,267 PS).\n\nThere is no official information about the battery. However, according to EV-Database, both motors are equipped with an NCA (Nickel, Cobalt, Aluminium) battery with a net capacity of around 95 kWh. The cylindrical battery cells come from Panasonic and have the 1865 format (18 mm diameter, 65 mm length). A total of 7,920 cells are arranged in five modules.\n\nAt 449 miles, the Tesla Model S Dual Motor with 19-inch wheels is one of the electric cars with the longest range. However, this figure is an estimate; only the ranges with the 21-inch wheels, available at extra cost, are certified.\n\nAll Teslas can be charged with up to 11 kW of alternating current, according to the Tesla website. With DC, the Model S is capable of 250 kW. As we know from our fast-charging test at the V3 Supercharger, this value is also achieved. This means that the maximum charging power is extremely high for a 400 volt car.\n\nTesla does not give a charge time, but according to EV-Database, a 10 to 80 per cent charge takes around 30 minutes. This, together with the unofficial net capacity, gives a charge rate of 2.2 kWh/min - a very good value. The range charge is also very good, at best 16.9 kWh/min (dual motor with 19-inch wheels).\n\nThe interior of the Model S is Spartan: there are very few physical buttons and most settings are made via the large, horizontal touchscreen. This even applies to selecting the driving mode: D or R is selected on the screen. Turning is done with buttons on the steering wheel. Also unusual: when ordering, you can choose between a conventional steering wheel and a steering horn for an extra \u20ac1,000.\n\nTest and evaluation of the Tesla Model S\n\nOur US colleague Kyle Conner tested the Model S Plaid. Kyle criticises the unergonomic turn signal controls, the steering horn and the handling, as well as the brakes, which are inadequate for the performance. His colleague, however, found that the acceleration set new standards. A plus point for us is that there is a large boot lid at the rear, not just one like the Model 3.\n\nRivals of the Tesla Model S\n\nThe Tesla Model S's rivals include the BMW i5, Mercedes EQE and EQS, the Nio ET7, the Porsche Taycan and the Lucid Air. We published a comparison with the Model S Plaid at the beginning of 2024 and a comparison with the normal all-wheel drive model in May 2022.\n\nThe Tesla Model S's competitors include the BMW i5, Mercedes EQE and EQS, Nio ET7, Porsche Taycan and Lucid Air.\n\nTechnical data of the Tesla Model S\n\nAll-wheel drive with 2 or 3 motors\n\nSystem power / system torque: up to 750 kW / n.a.\n\n0-62 mph / top speed: 3.2 or 2.1 sec / 155 or 200 mph\n\nWLTP power consumption: 18.7 or 17.5 kWh/100 km\n\nBattery / WLTP range: approx. 95 kWh (unofficial) / 373-449 miles\n\nCharging capacity: up to 11 kW AC, up to 250 kW DC\n\nCharging time: approx. 30 min (according to EV database)\n\nDimensions: 5,021 mm length / 1,987 mm width / 1,431 mm height / 2,960 mm wheelbase\n\nLuggage compartment: 793 litres\n\nc W -value: 0.208\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Meanwhile, its European and Chinese rivals have brought out a range of more affordable products, better adapted to local preferences.\n\nFrance has also decreased subsidies for EV purchases, making Tesla's premium models far less affordable.\n\nBeijing files WTO complaint over EU's new taxes on Chinese EVs\n\nPolarising politics\n\nThe drop in Tesla sales has also coincided with its CEO Elon Musk's increasingly polarising political positions. His calls to support far-right parties in Europe have multiplied under new American president Donald Trump's administration.\n\nThe billionaire has used his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to voice support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD) ahead of the country's February elections, and to amplify far-right commentators.\n\nIn a recent video address to an AfD campaign rally, two days before the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, that Germans should not feel guilt over the sins of their great-grandparents.\n\nMacron, Starmer join forces to tackle Musk 'interference' in European affairs\n\nAt Trump's inauguration ceremony last month, Musk made a gesture that was widely interpreted as a Nazi salute. Musk responded to the accusations on X, posting: \"Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"\n\nLast week, French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou said that Musk's vast fortune was enabling him to \"threaten democracy\", adding \"money should not give the right to rule consciences\".\n\nEuropean politicians have pushed back against Musk's recent comments, while several European media outlets have closed their X accounts, citing the spread of disinformation. Musk has dismissed criticism against him as an affront to democracy and free speech.\n\nElon Musk addresses German far-right rally by video link\n\nTesla owners' dilemma\n\nMusk's comments have pushed Tesla owners in France and other European countries to distance themselves from the company's CEO, with some buying bumper stickers with slogans such as: \"I bought this car before we knew Elon was crazy.\"\n\nSeveral polls have shown consumers have mixed views of Musk. A January survey conducted by EV review website Electrifying.com showed that 59 percent of British owners of EVs, and those intending to buy such a vehicle, said Musk's influence would deter them from buying a Tesla.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Tesla's biggest market in the European Union, a third of Tesla owners said they were considering getting rid of their vehicle because of Musk's opinions, according to a poll by Dutch public broadcaster EenVandaag.\n\nDespite the recent slump in sales, Tesla shares have more than doubled over the past year.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

Enter EVision, a California-based company aiming to add some flash to the front of your Tesla. Their solution is a wide LED display mounted directly on the bumper, allowing owners to project everything from graphics and photos to videos.\n\nMore: GM\u2019s Adorable Chinese Baojun EV Has A Gigantic Smartwatch On Its Tailgate\n\nThe concept isn\u2019t groundbreaking, as automakers have toyed with the idea of flashy front-end displays in various concept cars, and we\u2019ve even seen production cars with rear-end screens, like GM\u2019s Baojun EV in China. However, EVision\u2019s solution, which made its real-world debut recently at CES, brings this idea into the aftermarket scene.\n\nEndless Customization\n\nIn EVision\u2019s demo, the Tesla Model Y\u2019s front screen displayed various styles inspired by Ferrari, Maserati, Bugatti, and Rolls-Royce models, along with countless variations of fake intakes and DRLs. Want a flying Spiderman on your car? Don\u2019t worry, EVision has you covered. The display can also show any animation or graphic, from galaxies and landscapes to cityscapes.\n\nAccording to the company, the display \u201creflects the unique personality of the driver, transforming the Tesla Model Y into a dynamic, head-turning statement on the road.\u201d Additionally, the \u201cfully customizable LED grille\u201d can be used for promotional purposes, displaying ads or various messages. In other words, the only limit is your imagination \u2013 and, probably, copyright laws.\n\nEVision\n\nThe screen is mounted on a custom bumper made exclusively for the pre-facelifted Tesla Model Y, with users controlling the display through a dedicated smartphone app, instantly changing the appearance of the EV.\n\nIn addition to the Model Y, EVision has also shared renderings of a similar display on the Tesla Cybertruck\u2019s boxy front end. And for those who aren\u2019t fans of Teslas, don\u2019t worry \u2013 EVision has promised to offer the same product for other manufacturers, as long as the vehicle is electric.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost?\n\nAt CES, the company confirmed the cost of the LED display will range between $2,500 and $3,000, with installation taking around two hours. Now, before you start thinking that\u2019s a little steep for a bumper sticker with a screen, consider that EVision\u2019s display could be a unique opportunity for rideshare or commercial fleets to generate advertising revenue from their electric vehicles.\n\nThat Sounds Great, But Will It Last?\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room: durability. While we don\u2019t know if EVision has equipped the display with a protective layer to withstand scratches or impacts (we reached out for more details but haven\u2019t heard back), the placement of this screen, right at the front of the vehicle, naturally makes it vulnerable. We all know that driving at highway speeds can lead to all sorts of debris (rocks, bugs, other objects) bouncing off your car, and even paint can suffer from the impact.\n\nMore: Avatr 11 And 12\u2019s Exterior Pixel Screens Are Cool, But Will They Be Useful?\n\nSo, imagine what could happen to a thin, exposed LED screen in the same conditions. And it\u2019s not just an issue for high-speed drives, either. In fact, even low-speed bumps while parking could leave your flashy LED display scratched, cracked, or worse. While it might look great in a demo video, the practicality of having a screen mounted on the most vulnerable part of your car is, well, at least a question mark.\n\nBelow, you can find footage from CES 2025 in Las Vegas and some AI-generated videos from EVision\u2019s official YouTube channel.",

But a new report suggests that they\u2019re actually deadlier than one of the most infamous\u2014and flawed\u2014American cars ever made: the Ford Pinto.\n\nAn analysis published Thursday by the auto news website FuelArc found that, in their one year of existence, the approximately 34,000 Cybertrucks on the roads had five fire fatalities, giving them a fatality rate of 14.5 per 100,000 units. That\u2019s 17 times the fatality rate of the Ford Pintos, whose famously flawed gas tank design on the car\u2019s rear end led to 27 reported fire fatalities in its nine years on the road, resulting in a fatality rate of 0.85 per 100,000 units, according to FuelArc.\n\nThe authors of the Cybertruck analysis openly acknowledge caveats in their methodology. First off, Tesla\u2014the car\u2019s manufacturer and one of Musk\u2019s companies\u2014has not confirmed how many Cybertrucks it has sold. FuelArc puts its best guess at 34,438, based on \u201ca variety of means, including piecing together public reporting.\u201d Secondly, the five Cybertruck fatalities include the one that occurred in Las Vegas last month outside Trump International Hotel, when an Army soldier fatally shot himself before the car, packed with fireworks, exploded. Musk claimed in a post on X that the explosion was \u201cunrelated to the vehicle itself.\u201d Thus, the FuelArc analysis acknowledges that this fatality is \u201ccontroversial\u201d since the driver\u2019s cause of death was reportedly a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and the burns occurred after his death.\n\nThe other Cybertruck fatalities included in the analysis were the ones that took place in December in Piedmont, California, which killed three college students and left one injured, and in Texas last August, which reportedly\u2014at least initially\u2014left the victim unidentifiable due to severe burns. (The Texas Department of Public Safety did not immediately respond to an email Sunday seeking updated information on the victim\u2019s identity.) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) previously said it was seeking information from Tesla in both incidents; a spokesperson for the agency did not immediately respond to questions on Sunday.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla also did not immediately respond to questions.\n\nThe point of comparison in the analysis, though\u2014the Ford Pinto fatalities\u2014is a strong, and telling, one. In a classic Mother Jones cover story from 1977, reporter Mark Dowie spent six months investigating the deadly Ford Pintos and found that the company rushed to create and distribute the cars to beat the competition\u2014despite the fact that testing showed that the Pinto was unsafe as designed, due to the flawed placement of the gas tank:\n\nMother Jones has studied hundreds of reports and documents on rear-end collisions involving Pintos. These reports conclusively reveal that if you ran into that Pinto you were following at over 30 miles per hour, the rear end of the car would buckle like an accordion, right up to the back seat. The tube leading to the gas-tank cap would be ripped away from the tank itself, and gas would immediately begin sloshing onto the road around the car. The buckled gas tank would be jammed up against the differential housing (that big bulge in the middle of your rear axle), which contains four sharp, protruding bolts likely to gash holes in the tank and spill still more gas. Now all you need is a spark from a cigarette, ignition, or scraping metal, and both cars would be engulfed in flames. If you gave that Pinto a really good whack\u2014say, at 40 mph\u2014chances are excellent that its doors would jam and you would have to stand by and watch its trapped passengers burn to death. This scenario is no news to Ford. Internal company documents in our possession show that Ford has crash-tested the Pinto at a top-secret site more than 40 times and that every test made at over 25 mph without special structural alteration of the car has resulted in a ruptured fuel tank. Despite this, Ford officials denied under oath having crash-tested the Pinto.\n\nThat Mother Jones report prompted the NHTSA to undertake an investigation. Ford recalled more than 1.5 million of the cars the following year, and stopped producing the cars entirely by 1980. The company was also accused of reckless homicide over the safety concerns, but a jury acquitted them.\n\nStill, all in all, it\u2019s not a favorable comparison for the Cybertruck.\n\nThere are other reasons, beyond the latest analysis, to be skeptical of the car\u2019s safety, though: The NHTSA only recently crash-tested the Cybertruck, according to a spokesperson for the agency, who added that the results will publish online when the analysis is complete. The nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has reportedly not crash-tested it, nor has Tesla released its own safety data on the Cybertruck.\n\nMusk bragged around the time of its release that it would \u201cbe much safer per mile than other trucks.\u201d But his claims of superiority were quickly disproven, given that Tesla recalled the truck seven times last year alone\u2014an astonishingly high amount\u2014including once over a trapped accelerator pedal that could increase the risk of a crash, estimated to affect more than 3,800 units, according to the NHTSA.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 9: An earlier version of this story mistakenly characterized the fatality rate of Cybertrucks as a percentage rather than as a rate per 100,000 units.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 12: This piece was updated to acknowledge that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported recently crash-testing the Cybertruck.",

And Tesla's sales are not off to a great start in 2025.\n\nIn recent days, full-year and January sales results from various markets around the world indicate a bleak picture for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle company. Even as it added the Cybertruck to its lineup in large volumes last year\u2014which should have unlocked more buyers in America's expansive pickup truck field\u2014Tesla is seeing serious declines in places where it once had a near-lock on electric sales. Let's take a look at some of the areas taking the hardest hits.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nAs various outlets covered this week, the California New Car Dealers Association's (CADA) latest data indicates that EV sales leveled off in the Golden State last year, holding steady at 25.3% of new-car sales and just slightly up from 2023's result of 25%. Granted, while it's quite impressive for one in four new cars sold in California to be entirely electric, a slowdown in once-rapid EV growth has coincided with a big decline in Tesla sales.\n\nTheir report doesn't mince words. \"All of the decrease in the state market last year was attributable to Tesla, which had an 11.6% decline,\" it said. \"Registrations for all other brands increased 1.4%.\" And that's for all new passenger vehicle registrations in California, not just EVs.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs The new Tesla Model Y will be released globally in March. Can it help reverse these sales declines?\n\nToyota, Tesla, Honda, Ford, and Chevrolet were the market-share leaders in California last year, and the Tesla Model Y kept its \"best-selling light truck\" crown. Yet California saw almost 30,000 fewer Model 3 registrations compared to 2023. The Model Y fared better, but was still down more than 4,000 units. The Cybertruck was California's top-selling electric truck, but cracked a mere 9,019 registrations\u2014not quite what you'd expect in an affluent, EV-friendly market and the one where Tesla was born. That was only 434 registrations off the aging and expensive Tesla Model X, for example.\n\nThe story gets worse in other parts of the world. In Germany, where Tesla was the longtime EV sales leader even as new entries from Volkswagen, BMW, Audi and various Chinese brands started showing up, sales declined a whole 60% in January\u2014just 1,277 registrations in Europe's biggest car market, according to Fortune. Tesla\u2019s sales were also down 63% in France in January, another large car market, from a year earlier. They also dropped 8% in the UK year-over-year in January even as all-electric vehicle sales rose to 21% of the British new car market, a seven-point increase from 2024. \"No Tesla cracked the UK's top 10 best-seller list last month, something that has regularly happened in the past,\" Ars Technica reported this week.\n\nAnd one trend that's especially worth watching is what's happening in China, which makes up more than a third of Tesla's global sales. In China, which leads the world in total all-electric and hybrid sales, Tesla dropped 11.5% in January.\n\nThere are a few things that should be taken into account for these sales declines. Tesla once dominated EV sales but new competitors are showing up left and right, including in areas where Tesla doesn't play, like three-row SUVs. In China, sales often slow around the Lunar New Year holiday festivities and Tesla also implemented factory upgrades at its Gigafactory Shanghai plant to build the updated \"Juniper\" Model Y. And in several European markets, EV sales have been uneven or outright declined as various countries ended their subsidy programs; as a result, there are now calls for EU-wide subsidies that would promote growth across the entire bloc to counter new imports from China.\n\nBut one factor feels inescapable at this point: the backlash to Elon Musk's increased involvement in politics. In the U.S., the Tesla CEO spent the past week\u2014illegally, according to many lawyers and constitutional scholars\u2014breaching the U.S. Treasury Department's payment systems as part of President Trump's effort to unilaterally defund various government agencies. In Germany, Musk's vocal support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has been widely cited as a turn-off for EV buyers, and the same has been said of his politics in the UK.\n\nThough it's hard to gauge empirically, Musk's far-right political turn does seem to be having an effect on Tesla sales\u2014especially among the more affluent, urban progressive-to-centrist buyers traditionally more inclined to buy EVs in many places. A recent report from the nonpartisan EV Politics Project indicates that Tesla and Musk are losing support among EV intenders and Democratic-leaning buyers faster than they're gaining support from people on the other side of the political spectrum, who tend to be less interested in EVs. In other words, Musk is losing Tesla sales ground with the traditional EV base, and not making it up with any of his new supporters.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs EV Politics Project Slide\n\n\"Republicans are creeping toward greater EV acceptance and willing or not, Elon\u2019s journey to MAGA may have helped that,\" the group said in its latest report. \"Meanwhile, the Elon-driven Tesla headwinds problem among non-Republican consumers is clearly growing.\"\n\nThough Tesla's stock surged after the election, attributed to investor faith in Musk's close relationship with Trump being able to help clear hurdles for goals like autonomous car deployment, it has sunk in recent days due to these dismal sales reports.\n\nThe biggest thing to watch this year may be the release of the updated Model Y. In theory, a big refresh for the world's best-selling EV (and by some metrics, best-selling car, period) should jump-start sales in a major way. But if buyers are counting out the brand because of Musk, the success or failure of that car will be the ultimate barometer.\n\nContact the author: patrick.george@insideevs.com\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Elon Musk thinks Tesla's humanoid robotics business could be worth trillions.\n\nEarnings season is in full swing, and, as usual, investors are paying close attention to anything and everything that even remotely touches artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDuring Tesla's (TSLA 3.86%) fourth-quarter earnings call last week, Elon Musk got investors amped after the entrepreneur spoke at length about the company's AI roadmap and how it's betting big on humanoid robotics.\n\nCould AI be Tesla's next big opportunity? Read on to find out.\n\nElon's latest comment is exciting, but...\n\nBeyond Tesla's electric vehicles (EV), you might know that the company also develops a number of energy storage products. However, in addition to its green initiatives, Tesla has a number of other exciting projects going on in the background -- many of which feature AI.\n\nOne such project is a line of humanoid robots called Optimus. During Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call, Musk suggested that \"Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue.\"\n\nOn the surface, the very mention of a $10 trillion opportunity might make you want to smash the buy button. But before you do that, let's consider some more details.\n\nIt's quite different than what he said over the summer\n\nLast week was not the first time that Musk provided an update on Optimus. In fact, Tesla's corporate accounts post videos on social media pretty frequently that feature Optimus performing basic tasks -- showing investors just how sophisticated these robots are.\n\nOver the summer, Musk spoke at a conference and alluded that Optimus could be a $200 trillion business someday. That's multiples larger than the $10 trillion he suggested more recently.\n\nGiven the disparity among Musk's forecasts, should investors be worried about Optimus?\n\nWhat does Optimus mean for Tesla investors?\n\nIn all honesty, I wouldn't spend too much time focusing on the total addressable market (TAM) for Optimus at the moment. Forecasting what demand will look like for both consumers and businesses is too difficult to model with any real accuracy right now.\n\nMoreover, even when demand trends start to emerge, there are other unknown variables, such as the scale at which Tesla will be able to produce these bots and at what cost. It's just too hard to know how humanoid robots will become integrated with society over time.\n\nEven so, I still think Optimus represents an important chapter in the Tesla narrative -- despite its nascency as a business right now. To me, Optimus signals that Tesla is serious about diversifying its platform beyond EVs and storage packs.\n\nFurthermore, Optimus could actually be a hidden catalyst that stitches Tesla's various businesses together in the long run. For example, if Tesla equips its factories around the globe with fleets of Optimus bots, then theoretically, the company can manufacture more vehicles -- and likely at a lower cost, given the labor savings Optimus presents. Therefore, Tesla could widen its overall margin profile and profitability significantly.\n\nWith that said, the commercial scale of Optimus is still years away. For now, the EV business is still Tesla's core operation, while Optimus could be seen as more of a marketing tactic to get investors excited about the company's future.\n\nPerhaps a better way to look at Optimus is by trying to assess how much value can be generated or recognized by complementing the labor force, as opposed to trying to model specific revenue figures. Whether Optimus is worth millions, billions, or trillions, I can't say. Nevertheless, I think Optimus has enormous potential at scale, and I think enhanced robotics will indeed unlock a lot of value for Tesla and propel the company into one of AI's biggest businesses over the long run.",

The release also notes that this is the first Netherlands deployment of the four-hour battery system, expected to help improve both grid stability and costs for consumers.\n\n\u201cThe Rilland installation is the first of its kind in the Netherlands with the storage capacity to deliver 10MW of power for 4 consecutive hours,\u201d says Dominique Becker Hoff, S4 Energy CCO. \u201cWhile this alone cannot meet the total energy demand, it represents a critical and scalable step forward in sustainable energy storage innovation and grid flexibility.\u201d\n\nBecker Hoff also says that the Megapack site will be an important part of the solution to the massive strain currently facing the electrical grid in the Netherlands, adding that issues like the mismatch between demand timing and availability of sustainably generated energy are expected to remain for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs such, S4 explains plans to use the Rillan project and other sites to harvest and store surplus energy during periods of overcapacity, later releasing it to accommodate surges in demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE ON TESLA ENERGY: Tesla Shanghai Megafactory to kick off Megapack production February 11\n\nTesla has been deploying Megapack storage more frequently than ever in recent months, as the company\u2019s so-called Megafactory in Lathrop, California continues to ramp production. The company is also set to launch production at a new Megafactory in Shanghai, China next week, and CEO Elon Musk recently said Tesla was also looking to build a third production facility for the Megapack without disclosing where.\n\nIn 2024, Tesla deployed a record 31.4 GWh of energy storage between its Megapack and home-scale Powerwall batteries, along with achieving the highest-ever gross profit generation for the energy business in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn addition to this four-hour energy system in the Netherlands, Tesla has recently confirmed plans for a 548 MW Megapack facility in Japan, a 75 MW project in Belgium, and it\u2019s nearing completion of a 600 MW project near Melbourne, Australia, to name just a few sites in the pipeline.\n\nTesla also built its 10,000th Megapack at the Lathrop Megafactory in November, and it\u2019s eventually targeting that figure for yearly production at both that site and the upcoming Megafactory Shanghai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

But for Johnny Bacigalupo and Rob Hussey, their $78,000 electric dream turned into a financial nightmare after their car stopped working in the rain, leaving them with a $22,627 repair bill.\n\nA routine night out ends in disaster\n\nThe Edinburgh-based couple took their \u00a360,000 Tesla Model Y into the city for dinner last Saturday. With no apparent issues during the drive, they parked on Frederick Street. But after their meal, their high-tech car refused to start.\n\nStranded, they called Tesla Roadside Assistance around 10 p.m.. After five long hours of waiting, their vehicle was finally collected at 1 a.m. by a specialized firm and taken to Tesla Edinburgh. Days later, the shocking news came: their battery was \u201csubmerged in water\u201d and would not be covered under the warranty.\n\nJohnny Bacigalupo and Rob Hussey. (Edinburgh Live/NCJ Media)\n\nTesla blames the rain\u2014but refuses to cover repairs\n\nAfter several frustrating calls with Tesla representatives, Bacigalupo and Hussey were told they had to cover the cost of repairs\u2014despite having done nothing unusual.\n\n\u201cThey said that the battery is effectively submerged in water. How can that be our fault?\u201d Bacigalupo said.\n\nA Tesla manager reportedly admitted that the issue stemmed from Scotland\u2019s severe weather but refused to take responsibility, stating:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily your fault, but it\u2019s not Tesla\u2019s to pay under warranty.\u201d\n\nHe even pointed out that a yellow weather warning had been issued in parts of Scotland at the time\u2014implying that Tesla owners should avoid driving in bad weather.\n\n\u00a317,374 for a dead car\u2014without warning\n\nWhat shocked Bacigalupo even more was the lack of any prior warning about such a catastrophic risk.\n\n\u201cI asked if this happens to other cars, and they said it can happen with Range Rovers and Mercedes\u2014but I\u2019m just not buying it,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite Tesla confirming the \u00a317,374 ($22,627) bill in writing, the couple have yet to see their car again. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s UK customer relations team has only committed to investigating the complaint\u2014with no resolution in sight.\n\nIs Tesla unfit for wet climates?\n\nFor Bacigalupo and Hussey, the biggest frustration isn\u2019t just the cost\u2014it\u2019s Tesla\u2019s silence and lack of accountability.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been driving for 30 years and this is my most premium car to date. And this is what it does when Edinburgh\u2019s roads get puddles or a little wet?\u201d he said.\n\nThe ordeal has left them questioning whether Tesla is even suitable for Scotland\u2019s weather\u2014something potential buyers should seriously consider.\n\n\u201cIf I had known the customer service would be this bad, I\u2019m not sure I would have bothered buying the car,\u201d Bacigalupo added.\n\nThe hidden risk of electric cars?\n\nTesla has built its reputation on innovation, sustainability, and high performance. But this case raises serious questions about its reliability in real-world conditions\u2014especially in places with frequent rain.\n\nShould Tesla warn customers about water damage risks?\n\nHow many other owners are at risk of similar failures?\n\nIf an EV battery can\u2019t handle rain, is it truly built for everyday use?\n\nFor now, Bacigalupo and Hussey are left with no car, a massive bill, and no clear answer\u2014a cautionary tale for anyone considering making the switch to electric luxury.",

While we\u2019ve already seen quite a few cool new features, there\u2019s more that has yet to be revealed. A recent video interview with Tesla\u2019s engineering team hosted by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley reveals that the vehicle includes a new 4D cabin radar.\n\n4D Radar\n\nWhile Tesla has included an in-cabin radar since 2022, this appears to be a new, more capable radar. The current cabin radar is used to verify seat occupancy, but Tesla plans to add more functionality to this new system.\n\nThis updated radar will be used to provide a lot more detail than the current radar or cabin camera can provide today. The radar is located in the same location as the current version, directly above the rearview mirror.\n\nClassify Passenger Size\n\nThis new radar has several new safety-focused features, and they\u2019re all quite exceptional. First off, the radar will detect and classify passenger size to determine which airbags to deploy dynamically. That means that if a shorter individual is sitting up front, the dashboard airbag may not activate - but the curtain airbag will.\n\nThat will reduce injuries in impacts from airbag activation while also reducing repair costs by not activating unnecessary airbags. By having a better idea of the passenger\u2019s size, height, and weight, the vehicle can also better determine when to activate the airbag.\n\nChildren Left in Car\n\nBut that\u2019s not all - because of that classification system, the radar can differentiate an adult passenger from a baby or child sitting in the second row - and automatically make the necessary dynamic safety adjustments.\n\nThe cabin radar will also detect heart rate and breathing, and Tesla will automatically send a reminder through the Tesla app if it detects a child is left unattended in the vehicle. If this occurs, the vehicle will perform a variety of functions, the first being to turn on the HVAC system and send you a reminder. And if that\u2019s not enough - in the case of an emergency, your vehicle will automatically call emergency services for you and report its location.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while vehicles outside North America have eCall capabilities, in North America, they cannot call 911 unless a phone is connected to the vehicle via Bluetooth. We hope that Tesla can contact 911 via an alternative method or add eCall capabilities to these vehicles.\n\nIn late 2023, Tesla added the ability for the vehicle to call 911 over Bluetooth when the vehicle is involved in a crash.\n\nComing Soon\n\nWhile the refreshed Model Y will be shipping in March, this new radar and its associated features won\u2019t be available immediately. Tesla intends to activate these new safety features in Q3 2025 - so sometime in late summer or early fall. We\u2019ll dive into this new feature once it\u2019s available later this year.",

Should he succeed, though, the impact would be significant, with a recent study finding that electric car sales could fall by 27 percent without the incentive.\n\n\u201cIt just shows he\u2019s an opportunist, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurning off the credits would affect a meaningful share of the EV market,\u201d said Joseph Shapiro, a University of California, Berkeley, economist and co-author of the study, who added that while a growing number of people would still go electric, the total number of cars sold would shrink by more than 300,000 a year than if the incentives stayed in place.\n\n\u201cYou could say that it would be a speed bump in the road but if the US goes all electric in 2090 rather than 2050, say, that matters a lot for the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of carbon would be emitted in that time.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s agenda has been enthusiastically backed by Musk, despite the world\u2019s richest person heading Tesla, the market-leading EV company that also relies upon some parts made in China that may be targeted by tariffs imposed by Trump.\n\nMusk has said, though, that removal of EV subsidies will hurt rivals such as Ford and General Motors more than Tesla. \u201cTake away the subsidies,\u201d Musk wrote on X, another of his companies, in July. \u201cIt will only help Tesla.\u201d\n\nThere is some logic to this, Shapiro said. Tesla is comfortably the largest EV brand in the US, accounting for nearly half of all sales, and makes more profit per car than its rivals, meaning the removal of incentives would be disproportionately felt by other manufacturers.\n\n\u201cIf the tax credit is removed Tesla could survive and have less competition, they have more headroom to withstand a decrease in the market size,\u201d Shapiro said. Stock in Tesla surged following Trump\u2019s election win.\n\nHowever, Tesla will still be affected. Weakening federal pollution rules, for example, could see a reduction in the amount of carbon credits Tesla sells to other car companies\u2014amounting to $2.7 billion just last year\u2014to offset their emissions and avoid fines. Tesla\u2019s sales dipped slightly for the first time in 2024, amid concern among some of its traditionally liberal customer base about Musk\u2019s rightward political turn.\n\n\u201cTesla isn\u2019t immune to sales being impacted, they have some brand loyalty although we don\u2019t know what the impact Elon Musk has had on polarizing consumers yet, that\u2019s still a bit of an unknown,\u201d said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, which estimates EVs will have a 10 percent share of US car sales this year, up from 8 percent in 2024.\n\nRegardless, Musk\u2019s focus has now seemingly shifted away from EVs to other areas such as robotics, artificial intelligence and his SpaceX venture, Valdez Streaty said. He has also embraced rightwing fixations shared by Trump. In a speech after the president was inaugurated, Musk made no mention of cars but said that the \u201cfuture of civilization is assured\u201d with \u201csafe cities, secure borders, sensible spending, basic stuff.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take DOGE to Mars,\u201d in reference to the \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d he heads in an effort to curb spending. \u201cCan you imagine how awesome it will be to have American astronauts plant the flag on another planet for the first time? Bam. Bam. Yeah. How inspiring would that be?\u201d\n\nConcern over the climate crisis is seemingly no longer one of Musk\u2019s priorities, despite previously saying he is \u201csuper pro-climate\u201d and in 2016 calling for a \u201cpopular uprising\u201d against the fossil fuel industry because the world was \u201cunavoidably headed toward some level of harm and the sooner we can take action, the less harm will result.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis desire for eternal glory for doing great deeds has motivated his primary accomplishments\u2026But it also has a dark side.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump removed the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, Musk said he was quitting a presidential advisory body in protest. \u201cClimate change is real,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cLeaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\u201d\n\nBut Musk has had little to say after Trump, who memorably called climate change \u201ca giant hoax,\u201d once again pulled the US from the Paris deal and issued a flurry of orders to ramp up oil and gas drilling and stymie renewable energy production. In January, Musk said: \u201cClimate change risk is real, just much slower than alarmists claim.\u201d\n\nCritics say it is unlikely Musk will reflect the growing alarm voiced by scientists, and the American public, over the impacts of dangerous global heating within the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIt just shows he\u2019s an opportunist, really,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, who was a climate adviser to Bill Clinton\u2019s White House. \u201cHe now downplays the dangers of climate change, but I think in the back of his mind he\u2019s thinking about using government contracts for geoengineering as the costs of climate change become so undeniably expensive.\u201d\n\nThose who know Musk say that he soured on Democrats in part after not being invited to a major summit on electric cars held by the White House in 2021, after Joe Biden became president.\n\n\u201cThat was an unforced error by Biden,\u201d said Robert Zubrin, a leading advocate for human exploration of Mars who said he helped introduce Musk to the idea of Martian expansion. \u201cAnd in the past two years, Elon Musk has redefined himself from the white knight of environmentalists to a Bond villain.\u201d\n\nZubrin said that Musk\u2019s \u201ccentral motivation is the desire for eternal glory for doing great deeds. He wants to save civilization because he wants to be famous for saving civilization. \u201cThis desire for eternal glory for doing great deeds has motivated his primary accomplishments, Tesla and SpaceX,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it also has a dark side to it, and this has been exploited.\u201d\n\nTesla was contacted about its stance towards the EV tax credits but did not respond.",

Kimbal Musk, meanwhile, sold approximately $27 million in shares on Thursday, according to another filing.\n\nThe stock sales come after Denholm, Kimbal Musk and other Tesla board members \u2014 including James Murdoch and Oracle co-founder Lawrence Ellison \u2014 recently agreed to collectively return roughly $919 million in compensation to Tesla in a Delaware settlement last month. The settlement followed a lawsuit alleging the directors had overpaid themselves, Reuters recently reported.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe board members agreed to return approximately $277 million in cash, $459 million in stock options, and to forgo stock options for the period between 2021 and 2023 valued at about $184 million, Reuters reported. The directors did not admit wrongdoing.\n\nSales by top leadership also come as the EV company is facing an uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S.\u2014despite Elon Musk\u2019s close ties to President Donald Trump, Tesla is among the businesses that could be impacted by potential tariffs proposed by the new administration. Tesla remains \u201cvery reliant\u201d on parts for its vehicles sourced from across global markets, Taneja said during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call on Jan. 29, with the CFO warning proposed tariffs could negatively affect Tesla\u2019s profitability.\n\nAdditionally, plans by the new administration to \u201celiminate the electric vehicle mandate\u201d as laid out in a recent executive order \u2014 which could include the possible removal of an EV tax credit for buyers \u2014 could stymie sales for the company at a time when overall demand for EVs has declined, CFO Dive previously reported.\n\nKimbal Musk\u2019s sale of approximately $27 million in company shares also comes as Tesla is set to have its worst week since the U.S. presidential election, in part due to what Bloomberg classed as \u201cshockingly bad\u201d sales reports from Europe \u2014 which could indicate Musk\u2019s political activities in the U.S. are hurting the EV\u2019s profitability, according to a Friday report. Tesla sales in Germany plummeted to their lowest figure in four years last month, while sales in France and the United Kingdom also declined. Deliveries in China, meanwhile, slumped by 11.5% year-over-year, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn discussing Tesla\u2019s efforts to release fully self-driving vehicles during the company\u2019s Q4 earnings call, Musk referred to Europe as \u201ca layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\nMusk has remained bullish on Tesla\u2019s prospects, claiming during the call that \u201cthings are really going to go ballistic next year, and really ballistic in \u201827 and \u201928.\u201d The EV maker reported an 8% drop year-over-year in automotive revenues, logging about $19.8 billion in Q4 compared to total automotive revenues of $21.5 billion in Q4 2023, according to the companies\u2019 earnings results.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

Musk has characterized DOGE as a \"cost-cutting\" tool for government spending, but raised concerns with transparency advocates, both in and out of government.\n\nSince kicking into gear on Jan. 20, DOGE has prompted several lawsuits and raised alarms from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.\n\nCritics of DOGE also say that Musk, who runs SpaceX, which receives billions of dollars in government contracts, could be engaged in work through DOGE that may pose conflicts of interest with his private businesses, such as potentially gaining access to data about competitors' federal contracts.\n\nIn December, Musk responded to a note a Portland resident said was taped to his car, allegedly warning him about possible vandalism to it.

If you prepare in advance, you can adjust your capacity if you think you need it.\n\n3. Accessorize! The first purchase was ceramic tint for all windows. Hopefully, this helps in the Texas summers! TBD.

My kids are used to slamming my [Toyota Tundra] truck doors shut, so it pains me a little when they forget and slam them!\n\nAre Tesla's Doors Too Light?\n\nAccording to discussions on Reddit, some users do perceive Tesla doors as being \"too light\" due to their seemingly effortless opening and closing mechanism, which can sometimes lead to concerns about potential safety issues, particularly in a crash situation; however, Tesla claims their doors are designed to meet all necessary safety standards despite the light feel.\n\nKey points from Reddit discussions:\n\nLight feel:\n\nMany users comment on how easily Tesla doors open and close, making them feel \"flimsy\" compared to other vehicles.\n\nSafety concerns:\n\nSome users worry that the light feel might indicate a potential weakness in the door structure during a collision.\n\nDesign considerations:\n\nTesla engineers prioritize smooth operation and aesthetics in the door design, which could contribute to the perceived lightness.\n\nIn the comment section, Scott isn't alone in kids slamming doors. Can you relate?\n\nRic Berven says I'm always on my kids about slamming the doors!\n\nJohn Kim - I've yelled at my kids for slamming the door, too!\n\nEdgar Hernandez - That blue is nice! I completely agree with the kids slamming the doors!

Your car is your pride and joy, and you take extra care of it. So, Scott is not alone.\n\nA performance car should be lighter than a regular car, and the doors are one area where Tesla may have tried to lighten the car. The Tesla Model Y is the second lightest model in the Tesla lineup, with the Model 3 being the lightest. This lightweight design contributes to the car's impressive performance and range.\n\nDo you own a Tesla Model Y Performance?\n\nIf so, click the red Add New Comment link below and tell us about your experience with the performance car.\n\nCheck out my Tesla story titled; Tesla Former Chief Engineer Reveals Real Reason Why Tesla\u2019s Charge Port Is On the Left Rear, \u201cIt\u2019s Because of the Layout of Elon Musk's Rented Garage in Bel Air, He Didn\u2019t Even Own the Place\u201d\n\nI am Denis Flierl, a Senior Torque News Reporter since 2012.

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThese should be tough days for Tesla. Sales are down. It\u2019s making less money on every car it does manage to sell. Competitors are eating into its market share, especially internationally. The end of various federal EV policies could cost the company billions.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the CEO. Elon Musk made the company what it is, turning it from a humble startup into a financial juggernaut. But now there\u2019s near-constant controversy swirling around him as he upends the US government, inserts himself into international politics, plays video games and posts on his social media site, X, drawing his attention away from Tesla in what he himself describes as a \u201cpivotal year\u201d for the company.\n\nBut you wouldn\u2019t know that by the value of Tesla shares (TSLA), which still dwarfs any other automaker\u2019s market value.\n\nMusk took up most of a recent investor call promising imminent, major advances on self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots and promising that next year would be \u201cepic,\u201d rather than addressing the company\u2019s fundamentals. Investors sent the stock up 4% in the following days anyway, even though Musk himself has admitted that he has a track record of not delivering on promises.\n\n\u201cThere is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined,\u201d he predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, a difficult path, but it is an achievable path.\u201d\n\nSome analysts questioned the gains in Tesla shares.\n\n\u201cThe move higher in Tesla shares bore no relation whatsoever to the company\u2019s financial performance in the quarter just completed or to its outlook for growth in the coming year,\u201d wrote JPMorgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman in a note to clients. \u201cTesla shares continue to strike us as having become completely divorced from the fundamentals.\u201d\n\nBut some investors remain Tesla bulls.\n\n\u201cThe bulls are laser focused on the AI and autotonomous vehicles story,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who counts himself as one of those bulls, with a $550 12-month price target that would be 45% above Wednesday\u2019s closing price. Ives said beyond the promise of autonomous vehicles, Tesla\u2019s plans to sell humanoid robots to the public as soon as 2026 would be \u201ca game changer.\u201d\n\nWhat will make Tesla so valuable, in Musk\u2019s view, is that owners of its autonomous vehicles will soon be able to rent their cars for rides \u2013 a sort of robot-driven Uber \u2013 thereby making money when the cars would otherwise be parked. Musk argues that will change the basic economics of car ownership.\n\nAnd Musk predicted even greater sales for the company\u2019s planned \u201cOptimus\u201d humanoid robots, which he said could bring in more than $10 trillion a year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really bananas,\u201d he said.\n\nA history of broken promises\n\nBut Musk has had a history of ambitious promises and badly missed targets.\n\nIn 2016 he said the company\u2019s so-called Full Self Driving feature, or FSD, would allow owners to summon their cars to come to them, without anyone on board, from all the way across the country by the end of 2017. And with each successive year, he kept saying true autonomous driving, with no human driver intervention, was just a year or so away. In 2019 he predicted Tesla\u2019s robotaxi service would be available by 2020.\n\nThe reality is that Tesla\u2019s FSD is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board for a series of accidents, and it still requires a person to sit behind the steering wheel ready to take control of the cars.\n\nYet in October 2024, when unveiling a prototype of his driverless Cybercab, which doesn\u2019t even have an accelerator pedal, brake pedal or steering wheel, he promised \u201cunsupervised (driving) possibly by the end of this year.\u201d He added: \u201cI tend to be a little optimistic with time frames.\u201d\n\nUnsupervised driving still hasn\u2019t been launched. And in last week\u2019s investors call, Musk revealed that existing Teslas will need a \u201cpainful and difficult\u201d hardware update to ever be able to be truly self driving.\n\nThen there are the promised regulatory changes.\n\nThe Trump administration has also said it plans to end a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, including Tesla, this year. While that could hurt legacy automakers\u2019 EV sales the most, that would still make Teslas more expensive relative to gasoline-powered cars \u2013 just as growth in US demand for EVs is slowing.\n\nIn addition, Tesla gets billions from the sale of regulatory credits to automakers that still sell primarily gasoline-powered cars. The Trump administration is vowing to roll back tougher emissions rules that give rise to those regulatory credits in the first place.\n\nWill Musk give Tesla the attention it needs?\n\nMusk has always been distracted by his other businesses, like SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink , and his social media platform, X, and is now even more distracted by his role reshaping the federal government.\n\nDuring past Tesla challenges, like ramping up new vehicle production, Musk was literally living and sleeping at the plants and working around the clock. That won\u2019t be the case at Tesla this time.\n\nEven with the EV tax credit still in place, Tesla just reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024 as it faces increased competition from other automaker\u2019s increased EV offerings. It is close to losing its title of the world\u2019s largest maker of EVs to Chinese automaker BYD. And Tesla sales could be hurt by political blowback.\n\nFor example, the number of vehicles Tesla sold in Germany in January fell 59% compared to a year ago, according to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority. Just as Musk has been a key supporter of President Donald Trump, he has become a high profile supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\n\nShares of Tesla fell 4% in trading Thursday after the German sales drop was disclosed. But shares are still up 50% since the November 5 US election, as investors bet Tesla will benefit from Musk\u2019s new role as Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cfirst buddy.\u201d",

The gesture has been outlawed in Germany since the end of World War II.\n\n\n\nNonpolitical factors, like the impending arrival of the Model Y Tesla, could be at play. But Schmidt Automotive Research wrote in a report that German customers \"may well be reacting to Musk's comments.\"\n\n\n\nSome segments of the German public expressed disgust with Musk before the EV sales numbers were released this week, with activists projecting an image of the CEO's salute and the word \"Heil\" on the outside of a Tesla factory near Berlin after Trump's inauguration.\n\n\n\nIn recent days, protests have cropped up across the U.S. as Musk, through his advisory body to the Trump administration, the Department of Government Efficiency, has attempted a takeover of numerous federal agencies and their data on millions of Americans, including a payment system at the Department of Treasury, the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Education, and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSigns displayed at demonstrations on Wednesday took aim at the Tesla CEO as much as President Donald Trump, with some reading, \"Arrest Elon Musk\" and \"De-MusKKK the U.S.\"\n\nSome have started directing their outrage at Tesla, as German activists have. On Tuesday, Tesla campus recruiters arrived at Michigan State University to talk to potential future employees, only to be greeted by protesters carrying signs that read, \"Don't be a Musk-Rat!!\" and \"SUPPORT STUDENTS NOT FASCISTS!!\"\n\nJournalist Robinson Meyer mused this week on the social media platform Bluesky that protests at Tesla dealerships across the U.S. could soon follow as Musk continues his efforts to dismantle federal agencies.\n\nOther users shared images of small public actions at a dealership in Burbank, California and elsewhere, as well as graffiti that was recently scrawled on the outside of the company's office in Seattle, saying, \"Nazi Scum.\"",

This is one of the findings in the report Finding gaps in the national electric vehicle charging station coverage of the United States , published in the journalAdding so-called Magic Docks \u2014 adapters to Tesla Superchargers \u2014 or open-sourcing their connector design could greatly expand fast charging coverage requiring, yes, 500 fewer new stations, said Corey Harper , assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s College of Engineering and one of the authors of the report.This relatively simple technology adaptation could save between $166 million and $332 million in programming costs by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, established by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act . That program provided $5 billion to help fund the development of a national high-speed electric vehicle charging network. Those projects are coming online almost daily.Already, car-makers are gravitating to the Tesla charging standard, known as the North American Charging System (NACS). A number of major auto companies including Ford and GM have an adapter available to allow their vehicles to use the Tesla charging stations.Gravitating toward a single charging standard for all vehicles is only part of the process of making the charging experience easier, more seamless and more available, Harper said.\u201cA single charging standard, along with Tesla opening up its Superchargers to non-Teslas, would fix this issue and provide an overall easier driving experience for the user,\u201d he said in an email.Even though major car-makers like Ford and GM have announced plans to transition their electric vehicle (EV) technology to the NACS charging plugs, there are still thousands of cars operating which use the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard, all but setting up two separate sets of charging infrastructure. This bifurcated system has made the effort of expanding charging infrastructure \u2014 for all vehicles \u2014 all the more challenging. And though states like California and on the East Coast have a high concentration of charging, states like South Dakota have almost none, according to analysis in the report.\u201cThere is a chicken and egg problem with EVs and charging infrastructure. Charging stations need EVs to be profitable, but consumers hesitate to purchase EVs due to a perceived lack of chargers,\u201d Harper said in a statement. \u201cMany states have a long way to go before we achieve the consecutive coverage that would ease the minds of potential buyers.\u201dThe trend toward the North American Charging System standard \u2014 known as the Tesla plug \u2014 cannot be understated. Large EV charging plaza developers are looking past the CCS plugs and only building out infrastructure with the NACS equipment. The new Lebec Travel Center in northeast Los Angeles County will boast 112 Tesla fast-chargers, as well as conventional fuel pumps. The travel center will include other amenities like an updated and modernized 7-Eleven convenience store.\u201cWe feel we\u2019re on the forefront of the trend for the servicing of the need,\u201d Hamo Rostamian, president of HRI, a California-based commercial and retail developer, told in December . HRI is developing the project. The company was approached by Tesla to propose locating some of its Superchargers within HRI\u2019s travel center developments, Rostamian said, adding the company views these facilities as \u201cfueling stations of the future.\u201dAnd even though the new White House administration has taken an adversarial view toward EVs by threatening to end regulations and programs which incentivize their sale, California remains committed to expanding EV charging infrastructure. In early January \u2014 prior to the start of the new Donald Trump administration \u2014 the U.S. Department of Transportation announced the award of $122.9 million toward six California projects to develop zero-emission charging and fueling infrastructure.\u201cI think the number of EV charging ports available to EV owners is one of the biggest developments and this number will only increase with the NEVI program,\u201d said Harper. \u201cEven with a larger number of chargers available to drivers, deployment is still needed in many areas of the country and in underserved areas to improve the EV charging experience.\u201d",

Black workers were routinely referred to by slurs, they said, and threatening graffiti-covered restrooms and work and break areas.\n\nEverything you need to know to start your day.\n\nTesla\u2019s letter was one among dozens in California alone, according to Levin. OFCCP investigators were set to review the practices of more than 2,000 U.S. companies this year, including 211 in California, according to federal data that is no longer online . Investigations have been canceled at the San Francisco offices of Google, Meta, Blackrock, Sony, and PG&E, among others.\n\nIn agreements the companies signed with the agency, all three agreed to conduct annual pay equity analyses and face continued federal security for five years.\n\nIn 2020, Cisco was fined $2 million for underpaying women, as well as Black and Latino employees, compared with their white male counterparts.\n\nIn 2021, Google was fined $2.6 million for the same offense, which affected thousands of women, including nearly 300 staffers in San Francisco.\n\nIn 2022, LinkedIn was fined $1.8 million for paying hundreds of female engineering and marketing employees in San Francisco and Sunnyvale less than men who held the same jobs.\n\nDespite its lack of name recognition, OFCCP for years served as an effective civil rights watchdog for Silicon Valley- and San Francisco-based tech companies.\n\nThe OFCCP was created by executive order in 1965 under President Lyndon Johnson to ensure that federal contractors do not discriminate against employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The office oversees approximately one-fifth of the U.S. labor force, according to its fast-shrinking website, by regulating the practices of private companies that contract with the federal government.\n\nPresident Trump deemed the agency an \u201cillegal\u201d diversity, equity, and inclusion program, revoking Johnson\u2019s executive order with his own.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025, a blueprint for a right-wing takeover of government that is often touted as a roadmap for Trump\u2019s second term in office, advocated for the elimination of the agency.\n\nActing Labor Secretary Vincent N. Micone, whose department oversees the office, ordered staff to stop all work in a Jan. 24 email that was obtained by The Standard.\n\n\u201cCease and desist all investigative and enforcement activity under the rescinded Executive Order 11246 and the regulations promulgated under it,\u201d Micone wrote. \u201cThis includes all pending cases, conciliation agreements, investigations, complaints, and any other enforcement-related or investigative activity.\u201d",

            "content": "Tesla has a problem. The American company is no longer selling, either in Europe or in the US. Or rather, it is still selling a lot, but much less than in the past. The figures for January 2025 do not leave much room for interpretation.\n\nThere are several factors behind this slump. Anticipated at the shareholders' meeting at the end of last month and now confirmed by the first figures of the new year, the reasons lie first and foremost in the behaviour of Elon Musk, who has disappointed both Americans with his support for Donald Trump and Europeans who have not liked the various interventions of the brand's CEO in the politics of the Old Continent. But there is more.\n\nAll the reasons for the collapse\n\nOne of the reasons is the low availability of cars in stock. As every year, the company pushes sales in the last quarter in order to close the accounts with a better result. But this inevitably has an impact on the start of the new year, when stocks are low.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model 3 Performance 2024\n\nThen there is the 'Juniper effect'. The Tesla Model Y, the brand's best-seller, has just been relaunched with a 2025 model year that is quite different from its predecessor. The new Model Y has recently gone on sale in China and is now available in Europe and the US, but only in the Launch Edition.\n\nThe fact that the full range is not yet available means that many potential buyers are waiting for further versions. This is why sales are slowing down. But what have all these reasons led to? Let's have a look.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\nSales in Europe halved\n\nIf 2024 ended badly, 2025 started even worse. On the old continent, there was a 50% drop compared to January 2024. The decline affected key markets such as those in Scandinavia (Sweden -44%; Norway -38%), where electric car registrations grew by double digits.\n\nNegative figures were recorded in Spain, where registrations fell from 1,094 to 269 (-75.4%), and in France (from 3,118 to 1,141, -63.4%), but Tesla also fared badly in the Netherlands (from 1,610 to 926, -42%) and Denmark (from 763 to 451, -40.9%). In Italy, the figures are smaller, but the decline was also -13.4%. In Europe as a whole, we have reached an uncomfortable -47.7%.\n\nCountry January '25 January '24 decrease % United Kingdom 1,293 1,581 -18.2% France 1,141 3,118 -63.4% The Netherlands 926 1,610 -42.5% Norway 663 1,109 -40.2% Spain 269 1,094 -75.4% Sweden 394 730 -46.0% Denmark 451 763 -40.9% Portugal 380 551 -31.0% Italy 265 306 -13.4%\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\nDouble-digit contraction in California\n\nTo explain Tesla's current situation, you can also look at what is happening in California, the largest electric car market in the United States. For years, Elon Musk and Co. dominated the market with ever-increasing numbers. But in 2024 they will see a decline.\n\nAnd while zero-emission car registrations are up 1.2%, Tesla's are down 11.6%, with almost 27,000 fewer electric vehicles delivered. Without Tesla, the Californian market is up 20%, and while the brand still leads with a 52.5% share, it's hard to ignore that it was over 60% in 2023.\n\nGallery: Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\n50\n\nSource: Tesla\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Tesla\u2019s sales have dropped nearly 60% in January in Germany compared to the same period last year. The same thing is happening throughout Europe.\n\nEarlier this week, we reported that Tesla\u2019s sales crashed throughout all European markets in January.\n\nThe two main reasons are believed to be the introduction of the new Model Y and the disapproval of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his meddling in politics, which is especially not appreciated in Europe.\n\nAt the time, we didn\u2019t have the number from Germany, but now we do.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nReuters reported that Tesla\u2019s sales were down 59.5% in January:\n\nGerman road traffic agency KBA\u2019s website on Wednesday showed the number of newly registered Tesla cars fell 59.5% to 1,277 in January, while the overall German market was down just 2.8% at slightly more than 207,000 vehicles during the month.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a Tesla problem because the German auto market was down just 2.8% in January, and the battery-electric market was up 53.5% during the period.\n\nThese are now Tesla\u2019s sales in Europe in 2025 compared to 2024:\n\nCountry Jan-25 Jan-24 % YoY Germany 1,277 3,150 -59.5% UK 1,293 1,581 -18.2% France 1,141 3,118 -63.4% Netherlands 926 1,610 -42.5% Norway 663 1,109 -40.2% Spain 269 1,094 -75.4% Sweden 394 730 -46.0% Denmark 451 763 -40.9% Portugal 380 551 -31.0% Total 6,794 13,706 -50.4%\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nThis is pretty nuts. Obviously, Tesla will use the Model Y transition as an excuse, and there\u2019s some truth to it. However, Tesla was transitioning the Model 3 around the same time last year, which also negatively affected 2024 sales.\n\nNow, it\u2019s true that Model Y is more impactful than Model 3, but I think it\u2019s also clear that the Musk effect is at play too, it\u2019s just impossible to tell by how much.\n\nBut I do think it will be quite disastrous, especially considering the Model Y refresh is not significant enough to convince people who are on the fence.\n\nIt feels like the negative sentiment toward Tesla is still gaining momentum rather than slowing down.\n\nThat\u2019s not good for the EV industry. At least they have more options in Europe. It will hit even harder if we start seeing a similar impact on Tesla in the US.",

            "content": "Elon Musk's foray into politics has made him far more unpopular with Democrats.\n\nHe's particularly turning off the buyers who say they're most likely to get an EV.\n\nAs a result, Tesla has the worst favorability to unfavorability ratio of any brand among buyers looking for an EV, per a new study.\n\nTesla's chief executive has spent the last year alienating the people his company needs most, a new study from the nonprofit EV Politics Project Shows. Among buyers who say they are looking to buy an EV as their next vehicle, Tesla had the worst favorability ratings of any brand surveyed.\n\nIn the survey of 600 people, 20% said they were planning on buying an EV next. Of those, 37% had an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, with 63% reporting a favorable opinion. That doesn't sound that bad outright, but note that Toyota, Ford and Volkswagen all score significantly higher on favorability and\u2014importantly\u2014far lower on unfavorability.\n\nThat's important because it's much harder to shake a negative view than it is to develop a positive one from a neutral position.\n\nNotice how Elon Musk is unpopular with people who currently drive EVs. That's pretty counterintuitive. Photo by: EV Politics Project\n\nThe EV Politics Project describes itself as \"a bipartisan effort to better understand the growing divide between Republicans and Democrats (and Independents) over electric vehicle adoption.\" It is led by several academics and veteran political operators from both parties.\n\nTheir data is also surprising given that EV buyers should, in theory, be pretty pro-Tesla. The company essentially started the EV revolution, and is by far the largest EV manufacturer in the U.S. The Tesla Model Y is the best-selling EV in the world and, by some counts, the best-selling vehicle full-stop. It's also a great car, as is the Model 3. The Cybertruck is, well, if you don't have nice things to say... But broadly, Tesla's cars are good, its charging network is great and its software is in a class of one. So why has public opinion shifted so heavily against the company, especially among its most crucial buyer base?\n\nBlame politics. Yes, I know you hate hearing about it. Trust me, I'd rather not be writing about what's going on. But we've seen survey after survey showing people getting increasingly frustrated with Musk's pivot toward being a far-right power broker, especially the types of well-off, educated, left-leaning drivers that make up Tesla's current customer base.\n\nMost categories don't inspire much animosity from either side. EV brands are the exception. Photo by: EV Politics Project\n\nNow, this pivot isn't without benefits for Musk. He's become far more favorably perceived on the political right. Yet the people who align with Musk's politics are far less likely to care about climate change, or EVs, studies (including from this group) have shown.\n\nAmong those who had a favorable opinion of Musk in the EV Politics Project survey, only 23% agreed that \"Climate Change is real and EVs can help.\" And while they may like Musk, 48% of Republicans surveyed reported unfavorable opinions of EV brands overall. Among Democrats, only 13% had an unfavorable view of EV brands.\n\nPhoto by: EV Politics Project\n\nAfter a decade of positioning his brands against climate change and the fossil fuel lobbyists, Musj has now pulled a 180, throwing all of his money and weight behind a politician with endless criticism for EVs and who has called climate change a hoax. Moreover, President Trump's industrial and environmental policies are all but certain to slow America's progress in the electric race. While Musk has said that losing EV tax credits, as Trump aims to do, will benefit Tesla over time, it's not exactly clear how that would happen when public opinion has shifted so strongly against him.\n\nIt's no wonder Musk's current vibe is turning off EV buyers. There just aren't that many people who both want to purchase an EV and simultaneously support a platform based on increased drilling, decreased environmental regulations and the revocation of subsidies that make those EVs cheaper. None of that's surprising.\n\nContact the author: mack.hogan@insideevs.com\n\nSo why does it matter to you, someone who probably comes here to read about EVs more than politics? Because Tesla is the biggest player in this game, and Musk's pivot comes at a seriously inopportune time for the company. Its sales were down last year for the first time ever. The Cybertruck has not moved the needle for it really. The Model Y refresh was received with a murmur. And the company has already pulled out all of the stops to stimulate demand. It's cut prices, updated the core products and piled generous incentives on to juice the numbers. Still, they fall.\n\nHow can Tesla arrest this decline? Well, the affordable models that the company has promised will surely help. But that will require the discipline and focus to launch them effectively, the institutional competency to do so without quality issues and a broad buyer pool of consumers that are happy to buy Tesla products. Elon's attempt to bend the federal government to his will certainly has advantages for him, but it won't help with any of those three issues. In fact, it's making most of Tesla's problems a hell of a lot worse.\n\nContact the author: Mack.Hogan@insideevs.com.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Straight Arrow News\n\nTesla TSLA.O posted lower sales across five European countries in January, including the United Kingdom and France, as competitors with newer models gained on the electric vehicle maker and polls show public opinion souring on CEO Elon Musk.\n\nMusk has made a high-profile foray into politics, with much of his 2024 dominated by his financial support of Donald Trump, on whom the billionaire CEO spent $250 million in what proved a successful campaign to return to the White House. He has also stirred controversy with his vocal support for far-right parties in Britain and Germany on his social media platform X.\n\nTesla's UK sales fell nearly 12% in January, even as monthly EV registrations in Europe's biggest battery-electric market surged to a record, according to data published by New AutoMotive on Tuesday.\n\nThat follows a 63% decline in January sales for Tesla in France, drops of 44% and 38% in Sweden and Norway, and a 42% fall in the Netherlands. In California, the largest U.S. car market with more than 1.7 million vehicle registrations in 2024, Tesla sales fell by 12%.\n\nIn 2024, Tesla posted its first-ever annual decline in deliveries, though it is still the leading EV seller in the United States. Musk said he would soon launch long-awaited cheaper EVs in 2025, and the company has increased its focus on autonomous driving technologies.\n\nMore Elon Musk: Musk creates new power base in Washington with takeover of US agencies\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its sales.\n\nThe company fell from the No. 2 spot for EV sales in Britain in January 2024 to the No. 7 spot behind Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, Mercedes MBGn.DE and Stellantis' STLAM.MI Peugeot, which all posted higher sales.\n\nSeveral polls show consumers have mixed views of Musk. A late January survey conducted by EV review website Electrifying.com showed that 59% of British owners of EVs, and those intending to buy such a vehicle, said Musk's influence would deter them from buying a Tesla.\n\n\"Musk's influence on the brand is becoming increasingly polarising, pushing many buyers to look elsewhere,\" said Electrifying.com CEO Ginny Buckley. \"With over 130 mainstream EV models now available in the UK - compared to just 25 in 2020 - competition has never been fiercer and Tesla is already feeling the pressure.\"\n\nEuropean politicians have pushed back lately against Musk's recent comments, which include the amplification of far-right commentators on X. Some accounts have quit the platform, citing the spread of misinformation. Musk has dismissed criticism against him as an affront to democracy and free speech.\n\nThe Tesla CEO has become a vocal supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of February elections. He recently told an AfD audience just before the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp that Germans should not feel guilt for the sins of their great-grandparents.\n\nThe share of Swedes with a positive view of Tesla fell to 11% in a Novus survey conducted after Trump's inauguration, down from 19% in a similar poll conducted Jan. 15-17, according to Swedish news agency TT. Those with a negative view jumped to 63% from 47%, TT reported.\n\nThe chief executive of research group New AutoMotive, Ben Nelmes, told Reuters that Tesla's problems stem less from Musk's actions and more from its failure to launch a new mainstream model since the Model Y in 2020, while rivals, including Chinese EV makers, have fresher products on the market.\n\n\"It's not due to Musk's views or British motorists' views about Musk - they stopped innovating after the Model Y,\" he said of Tesla.\n\nDespite these factors, the company's stock has continued to outperform the market, with shares more than doubling over the past year. The stock currently trades with a forward price-to-earnings ratio exceeding 131, ahead of not just legacy carmakers but also high-flying tech stocks with P/E ratios in the 20s, according to LSEG data.\n\nReporting by Alessandro Parodi in Gdansk and Nick Carey in London; Editing by David Gaffen and Matthew Lewis",

Sales are crashing in France, Germany, and the UK\u2014all affluent countries that are key markets for Tesla's electric vehicles. Coming on the heels of a large financial miss, it's just one more problem for the automaker.\n\nTesla sales dropped around 13 percent across Europe in 2024, but so far this year, the scale of the problem is far greater. In France, sales of new Teslas fell by 63 percent, while total car sales in the country fell by just 6 percent, with EV sales dropping just half a percent.\n\nGermany was already looking like lost ground for Tesla\u2014its 41 percent drop in 2024 accounted for most of Tesla's lost sales across Europe. That must make the 59 percent drop in German Tesla sales recorded during January even more painful on the profit and loss statements.\n\nAcross the Channel, the British auto industry just released its sales data for January. Here, Tesla sales fell less precipitously\u2014just 12 percent. However, battery EV sales were 35 percent higher in the UK in January 2025 than in January 2024. The cake is growing, but Tesla is getting to eat less and less of it.",

            "content": "Last month, Tesla unveiled the new Model Y in the United States, featuring an all-new light bar design, a redesigned rear-end, and a refreshed interior. It\u2019s currently available as a \u201claunch series\u201d model, starting at $59,990 \u2013 with deliveries beginning in March.\n\nThe new Model Y is currently in 19 Tesla showrooms across North America, 17 in the United States and 2 in Canada. I took the opportunity to head to the one in New York\u2019s Meatpacking District to get some up close photos, as well as share some thoughts.\n\nDesign impressions\n\nWhen the new Model Y was unveiled in China at the start of the year, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan. I was glad that Tesla came up with a unique design language for Model Y, rather than just creating a taller Model 3 once again, but I still wasn\u2019t a fan. The new design felt super busy.\n\nHowever, as time passed, it\u2019s certainly grown on me. Seeing it in person cemented the fact that this is actually a great design, at least in my book. Could there be some improvements? Sure. Overall though, I welcome all of the improvements and I\u2019m more than happy about the new design.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nNew Model Y upgrades\n\nThe main improvements with the new Model Y include two new light bars, one on the front and one on the rear. Unlike the Cybertruck, the front light bar on the New Model Y isn\u2019t continuous, and instead features a split design. However, that\u2019s for good reason.\n\nOn Model Y, the primary headlights are part of the light bar (pieces to the left and right), which isn\u2019t the case on the Cybertruck. The light bar on the Cybertruck is mostly aesthetic, with the actual headlights being near the bumper. Some may think the splits in the front light bar are a design downgrade, but it\u2019s certainly a lot more functional.\n\nAdditionally, you have a new rear light-bar that reflects downwards on the road, and gets very bright at night. I didn\u2019t get a photo of this unfortunately, since the showroom is very well lit, but you can see the effect for yourself in videos. It can be pretty cool.\n\nOther than that, the new Model Y has many of the same upgrades from last years refreshed Model 3. You have the ambient LED lighting on the interior, the new dual-pane glass for quieter interiors, new materials on the interior, as well as a display in the back seat for passengers to interact with.\n\nNew Model Y also has a front-bumper camera, as well as powered seats in the rear, allowing for customers to fold them down with just the press of a button.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nIt\u2019s a nice refresh. For now, Tesla only sells the new Model Y as a \u201claunch series\u201d model, coming in at $59,990 for the Long Range AWD configuration. At this price, you get Full Self-Driving included, the acceleration boost, and the tow package. Launch series models also have a special badge on the rear, alongside a puddle light, a more premium interior, and special \u201claunch\u201d badging around the vehicle.\n\nThere\u2019s no word on when RWD or Performance models will be available, but Tesla still sells the old Model Y if you\u2019d like to get one of those trims. There\u2019s some great deals on existing inventory as well.\n\nGallery\n\nLast but not least, here\u2019s all of the photos I took of the new Model Y! The showroom model was Ultra Red, which is personally one of my favorite colors for this new design. It also comes in Stealth Gray, Pearl White Multi-Coat, and Quicksilver.\n\nFollow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram",

At least. And then when he hit the other car, the damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire,\" a witness told Eyewitness News.\n\nFirefighters extinguished the stubborn e-battery fire in the Tesla. The vehicle was loaded on a tow truck and firefighters followed the tow truck to the impound to prevent future flareups.\n\nOfficials say lithium-ion batteries under a car pose a major hazard, making for flames that are extremely hot and difficult to put out.\n\n\"We have a pretty vociferous, nasty fire to deal with, high temperatures of fire that's very difficult to extinguish,\" said Professor of fire science Glenn Corbett.\n\nIt was just this past September when another Tesla burst into flames after a crash in White Plains, killing two women who trapped inside.\n\n\"Firefighters have developed tools now to slide water spray devices underneath the car to try to cool it off,\" Corbett said.\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by the National Transportation Safety Board, \"fires in electric vehicles powered by high-voltage lithium-ion batteries pose the risk of electric shock to emergency responders. A further risk is that damaged cells in the battery can experience uncontrolled increases in temperature and pressure (thermal runaway), which can lead to hazards such as battery reignition/fire.\"\n\nIt happened in a 2017 crash investigated by the NTSB in California. A 2016 Tesla SUV reignited three times, even as it was being unloaded from a tow truck.\n\n\"These cars need to be re-engineered so that the lithium battery packs are virtually protected, are basically protected against having an explosive reaction because of a vehicle accident,\" Corbett said.\n\nIn 2011, the NTSB began working with the National Fire Protection Association to help first responders handle lithium-ion batteries after a crash.\n\nElectric and hybrid vehicle manufacturers were also called on to develop post-crash protocols.\n\nJosh Einiger reports from Washington, DC.\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* More New York City news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

            "content": "We reported during most of 2024 that Tesla seemed to be facing a consumer demand problem. Tesla superfans did not like that and claimed we were wrong and irrationally hating on Tesla. As it turned out, Tesla\u2019s sales dropped in 2024 year over year \u2014 far off of the company\u2019s plan to grow 50% a year, on average, throughout the 2020s. Why did it seem to me that sales were not going to be great and that Tesla sales could even decline? Simple: because Tesla kept dropping prices and offering more and more incentives, including repeatedly offering significant incentives Elon Musk said they\u2019d only offer once.\n\nThose incentives and price cuts were often implemented in the latter half of the quarter when Tesla was trying to accelerate the movement of cars off the lot and into new homes. While Tesla has offered different incentives and price cuts for years at the end of quarters for this purpose, they seemed to be getting bigger and bigger as well as more frequent and more heavily pushed by Tesla.\n\nWhat we didn\u2019t see much of was big new incentives popping up in the first half of quarters \u2026 until now.\n\nFirst of all, note that Tesla is now suddenly offering $2,500 referral bonuses for new Tesla Model 3 buyers. $2,500 is already a significant discount, but Tesla also recently dropped prices on the Model 3. For both the AWD version and the RWD version, the lease price has been cut by $50/month. Across 5 years, that would be $3,000. So, you could say that we\u2019re looking at $5,500 in discounts on the Model 3! Or, if you consider there was already a $1,000 referral bonus option, it\u2019s a further $4,500 discount over the default.\n\nThe Model 3 Long Range RWD went from $299/month to $249/month, while the Model 3 Long Range AWD went from $399/month to $349/month. None of this is a sign of strength or overflowing demand.\n\nThe Cybertruck, meanwhile, went from $899/mo to $749/mo. Clearly, the demand for this truck isn\u2019t anywhere close to where it was hyped for years. More than a million \u201creservations\u201d have gone poof.\n\nElon Musk is basically betting the house on a robotaxi grand slam. He\u2019s convinced that Tesla will have commercially viable robotaxis on the road by the end of the year, and R&D plus AI operating costs are burning through the operations budget to make that happen. Then again, Musk has been convinced Tesla would achieve this within 6\u201318 months for more than 7 years. So, who knows if Tesla robotaxis are actually around the corner this time or not? However, at this point, I think it\u2019s getting to a critical point. Tesla needs robotaxi capability in order to juice sales again. The lineup, otherwise, seems to have maxed out when it comes to consumer demand. Sales have been dropping \u2014 not just in 2024, but also in January. Perhaps that is in large part in anticipation of the new Model Y and a lower cost \u201cModel Q,\u201d but it seems at least as likely that the dropping sales are due to Elon Musk\u2019s involvement in politics (which goes far outside the norm) and growing competition from other automakers that are rolling out new EV models and updates more frequently than Tesla.\n\nIf sales continue to drop, average selling price continues to drop from Tesla trying to attract new buyers, and Tesla\u2019s operating expenses continue to grow, Tesla could find itself in territory it hasn\u2019t been in for years \u2014 unprofitable quarters. That\u2019s a bit extreme to assume at this point, given that the company made $8.4B in non-GAAP net income in 2024 and $2.6B in Q4. However, it\u2019s definitely something to keep an eye on, as it is a possibility. Tesla\u2019s automotive revenue declined from $21.6 billion to $19.8 billion in Q4 2024 versus Q4 2023, and declined from $82.4 billion to $77 billion in 2024 vs. 2023. Another ~$2 billion decline in quarterly revenue could make Tesla barely profitable.\n\nWhat happens with Tesla sales trends in 2025 could be massive, especially if Tesla\u2019s AI and robotics bets don\u2019t pay off as quickly as hoped. A rebound in sales could mean all is great in Tesla World. A continued decline in sales could lead to unprofitable quarters for Tesla again and a serious shakeup and disruption of its long-term story. Which do you think is more likely?",

The automaker market share of the California EV market went down from 60% in 2023, but it still hold a majority at 52.5%.\n\nDespite the market leader shrinking in 2024, EVs still manage to grow in California by just 1.2%.\n\nIf you remove Tesla from the equation, the California EV market (excluding Tesla) grew 20% in 2024.\n\nEV market shares now sit at 22% in the state:\n\nCNCDA commented on Tesla\u2019s performance in the state:\n\nThings aren\u2019t looking so golden for EV automaker Tesla in the Golden State. Tesla\u2019s dominance in the electric vehicle market continues to falter as the brand reported its fifth consecutive quarterly registration decline. Tesla\u2019s registrations fell 7.8 percent in Q4 2024, contributing to an overall 11.6 percent decline in 2024. The company\u2019s market share also dropped by 7.6 points in 2024, now holding 52.5 percent of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) market for the year. Amongst all brands, Tesla\u2019s share of California\u2019s market is 11.6 percent, down from 13 percent in 2023.\n\nThe results are indicative of Tesla\u2019s broader performance in 2024.

Meanwhile, he says China will make up just around 5 percent, while the rest of the world, including other parts of America, would also make up just 5 percent.\n\nHe also predicted that that number would go up even further to nearly 100 percent, once SpaceX\u2019s reusable rocket is being launched more frequently.\n\n\u201cWhen Starship is launching at high rate, SpaceX will probably carry >99 percent of Earth\u2019s payload mass to orbit. This is necessary to make Mars a self-sustaining civilization,\u201d Musk added.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT SPACEX\u2019S STARSHIP: Texas awards SpaceX $17.3M grant to expand Bastrop tech hub\n\nTo be sure, Musk has been known to make ambitious claims about when his companies\u2019 products would achieve certain milestones. For example, Musk predicted in 2018 that SpaceX could launch a rocket to Mars with humans aboard by 2024, though SpaceX only began testing the company\u2019s reusable Starship in 2023.\n\nStill, the company has been routinely testing Starship since then, and with increasing frequency, and in October, SpaceX performed the first catch of the Starship\u2019s Super Heavy booster after liftoff to demonstrate the concept that a reusable rocket could be possible. In a launch earlier this month, SpaceX again successfully caught the Super Heavy Booster, though it lost the upper stage to a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d effectively meaning that it had exploded in air and showered surrounding areas with rocket parts.\n\nThe explosion was the second consecutive launch in which debris from Starship reigned down, highlighting the continued importance of testing as SpaceX aims to make the rocket a viable product for reusable space travel.\n\nOn Friday, SpaceX also launched its Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) to rescue astronauts that have been stuck on the orbital craft, after a Boeing launch was originally intended to bring them back to Earth. While SpaceX attempted to rescue the two astronauts in September, issues with the Starliner craft\u2019s thrusters discovered upon arrival made NASA hold off on approving the return mission.",

Annual registrations of the Model 3 sedan dropped by more than a third.\n\nAlso see: Trump order weighs eliminating EV-favoring policies and subsidies\n\nTesla\u2019s registrations declined despite the company adding a fifth model \u2014 the polarizing Cybertruck \u2014 to its lineup last year. While more common business factors also came into play, including changing over the Model 3 sedan early in the year, the company likely lost some business in California as a result of the active role Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk played in the US election.\n\nMusk, 53, spent at least $288 million to help elect Donald Trump and other Republican candidates during the 2024 cycle. California went for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by 20.2 points in November.\n\nTesla did manage to maintain a majority of the state\u2019s zero-emission vehicle registrations last year, although its share dropped to 52.5% from 60.1%.

Tesla\u2019s sales plummeted 41% last year in Germany, while overall battery-electric vehicle sales declined 27%. The EV maker has struggled in the country due to an aging model lineup, increasing competition and the withdrawal of government subsidies in late 2023.\n\nMusk moved Tesla\u2019s headquarters out of California in 2021 after defying lockdown policies during the pandemic.

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For Elon Musk fans, it\u2019s the half a trillion-dollar bet.\n\nThat is how much the stock market value of Tesla has rocketed since the presidential election, a vertiginous climb uninterrupted in recent days despite a disappointing financial report that would have sunk the stock of nearly any other company.\n\nInvestors are wagering that President Donald Trump will help Musk\u2019s company more than hurt it with his plans to take an axe to reams of Washington regulations and wield tariffs to get his way with key trading partners.\n\nLess regulation? Fantastic. Trade war? No biggie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a golden age for Tesla and Musk,\u201d said Wedbush Securities financial analyst Dan Ives, adding after an investor conference call Wednesday, \u201cThis is the most bullish I\u2019ve ever heard Musk.\u201d\n\nInvesting in Tesla has long been a gamble. Odds were against Musk creating a successful electric car company, never mind growing it to become the world\u2019s most valuable automaker \u2013 and in the process making himself the world\u2019s richest person. But this latest bet seems particularly risky.\n\nMusk says the true value of his company lies in a future of Tesla robots, thousands of them possibly by the end of the year, and in unsupervised, driverless vehicles. He promised in Tesla\u2019s investor conference call to start offering such robotaxis in June in Austin, Texas, and across the country by the end of next year.\n\nSpeeding all that along will be Trump, or so the story goes, who has given Musk an office in the White House and made him the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency tasked with shrinking the size of the government.\n\nTrump\u2019s new transportation secretary, who can have a big impact on Tesla, is mostly sticking to the script. Sean Duffy has promised to cut excessive regulation on automakers as well as to come up with a single set of federal rules on self-driving technology to replace a patchwork of state-by-state ones that Musk has blasted for holding back development.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Trump has softened his stance toward China, a big market for Tesla, hitting the country with an additional 10% tariffs starting Saturday, and not the 60% he threatened on the campaign trail. Still, Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as China, sent the stock down 5% Monday, a bit worse than other automakers. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said last week the company should feel an impact to its business because it sources parts from around the globe.\n\nTrump has also vowed to do other things that will hurt Musk\u2019s business.\n\nTrump said he wants to eliminate a $7,500 federal tax rebate designed to get people to buy electric vehicles. He also plans to lower emission standards, a potential blow to Tesla\u2019s business of selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to car makers that pollute more and fall short of the requirements. Tesla sold $692 million of these credits i n the last three months of 2024, a 60% jump from a year ago, revenue that nearly all flows straight to Tesla\u2019s bottom line.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether the Trump administration will hold off on investigations into Tesla, in particular a technology the company calls Full Self-Driving, a misnomer because the vehicles could require human intervention at any moment. In October, the transportation department\u2019s auto safety regulator, the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration, launched the latest of several probes into the technology after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian.\n\nTransportation Secretary Duffy promised senators at a hearing earlier this month that he would let the Tesla investigations follow the facts \u2014 specifically vowing to buck any political pressure to go easy on the self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d of the president.\n\nMusk will need all the regulatory relief and other goodies from Trump that he can get.\n\nIn early January, Tesla said sales dropped in 2024, a first in more than a dozen years, as rivals such as BMW, Volkswagen and China\u2019s BYD come out with competitive EVs and steal market share.\n\nThen on Wednesday, Tesla reported revenue, profits and other key measures of financial health for the last quarter of 2024 all fell short of what analysts had expected. The stock climbed higher anyway.\n\n\u201cThings that would hurt other automakers,\u201c marvels Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, \u201ddon\u2019t seem to impact Tesla.\u201d\n\nBesides the business, Tesla shareholders must always keep one eye on the CEO himself. Lately, that\u2019s meant weighing Musk\u2019s foray into politics.\n\nIn Europe, a major market for his cars, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany and called British Prime Minister Keir Starmer an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who is running a \u201ctyrannical police state.\u201d\n\nOn Inauguration Day in the U.S., Musk made a straight-arm gesture during a speech that many interpreted as Nazi salute. He scoffed at the criticism, but the backlash was fierce nonetheless. In Germany, an image of Musk making the salute was projected onto his massive Tesla factory outside Berlin in protest. In Italy, a communist youth group hung an effigy of Musk upside down in the same square in Milan where the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was strung upside down, too.\n\n\u201cHow many of these Tesla buyers agree with Musk?\u201d said Felipe Munoz, a senior analyst at auto researcher Jato Dynamics. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of alienating potential customers.\u201d\n\nMusk also risks turning off regulators in Europe, who he hopes will soon approve the use of Full Self-Driving there.\n\nIf investors start losing faith in Musk, it\u2019s a long way down.\n\nThe run-up in Tesla stock alone since the election amounts to more than the annual economic output of 160 countries. Tesla\u2019s total market value has grown to about $1.3 trillion, more than the worth of General Motors, BMW, Ford, Ferrari, Porsche and a dozen other top car makers combined.\n\nMusk thinks that, if anything, the stock should be higher.\n\n\u201cI see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world \u2014 by far, not even close,\u201d he said Wednesday, before doubling down on that statement. \u201cThere is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next five companies combined.\u201d\n\nThat would mean surpassing the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia. Tesla is currently the seventh-most valuable company in the S&P 500.\n\nWedbush\u2019s Ives, the \u201cgolden age\u201d analyst, agrees the stock can only go up from here.\n\n\u201cThe bet for the ages that Musk made was on Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cMusk is going to have massive impact on deregulation in the beltway \u2014 and that is worth a trillion dollars.\u201d",

King County Metro defended the decision, the purchase of the vehicles was a necessity.\n\n\n\nKing County Metro's recent decision to purchase 120 Tesla Model Ys for their VanPool fleet has raised questions and sparked a heated discussion online.\n\nThe announcement, made public in a press release back in December, gained traction on Reddit this week, where it garnered over a hundred comments. While some applaud the move as a cost-effective step toward electrifying the region's transportation options, others are critical of the decision, questioning the use of taxpayer dollars and expressing discomfort over investing in a company associated with Elon Musk.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThe online discussion highlights increasing local frustration toward Tesla and its CEO, with some people putting their anger to action through vandalism at the South Lake Union storefront in Seattle or decorating their Tesla with bumper stickers criticizing Musk.\n\nRobert Lipman from Seattle has ties running deep to the brand. He shared with FOX 13 that he has personally faced this backlash.\n\n\"As a former employee and current Tesla owner, I\u2019m starting to feel a little ashamed to still be driving it,\" said Lipman. \"Anti-Tesla sentiment is pretty high.\"\n\nThis frustration seems to have extended to King County Metro, with several Reddit users expressing their disapproval of the purchase. One account, who shared the December press release, wrote, \"Any way to cancel this terrible decision?\"\n\nThe other side:\n\nIn response to the criticism, Sean Hawks, a spokesperson for King County Metro, defended the decision. He explained that the choice to purchase the Tesla Model Ys was not driven by luxury or status but by necessity. The county\u2019s vanpool fleet needed a 7-seater electric vehicle to meet climate goals, and Tesla was the only provider to answer the call after a public bid was put out.\n\n\"It was an easy decision because there\u2019s only one provider right now,\" Hawks explained.\n\nHawks also emphasized the Model Y is an \"economy vehicle\", pointing out that its cost was comparable to that of a gasoline-powered minivan. According to Hawks, the purchase was a significant step in Metro's broader goal to electrify its Vanpool fleet by 2030.\n\n\"This is a fantastic program that 900 groups of people use to get to work and destinations every single day. So we\u2019re really excited to green this fleet,\" Hawks said. \"One of the amazing things about the VanPool program is everything\u2019s paid for. It\u2019s the vehicle, the insurance, the maintenance. All those pieces really add up.\"\n\nBy acquiring these Teslas, VanPool users, will be able to plug in their loaned vehicles at home and avoid the gas pump entirely.\n\nDespite the current pushback, Hawks reassured that Metro would remain open to exploring other electric vehicle options in the future, should more battery-electric alternatives become available.\n\nThe debate over Tesla's presence in the region shows no signs of fading. In fact, a bill set for a hearing Tuesday in Olympia, if passed, could ban the sale of Tesla vehicles in Washington state.\n\nThe Source: Information in this story is from King County Metro and FOX 13 Seattle reporting.\n\nMORE NEWS FROM FOX SEATTLE\n\nMore snow to hit Seattle area overnight, icy roads expected Tuesday\n\nSchool closures and delays for Seattle and western WA\n\nSeattle weather: Will snowy weather continue on Monday?\n\nMore than 150 flights delayed, 60 canceled at Sea-Tac Airport\n\nTrump pauses tariffs on Mexico: Here\u2019s why\n\nA Day Without Immigrants movement planned Monday nationwide\n\nTo get the best local news, weather and sports in Seattle for free, sign up for the daily Fox Seattle Newsletter.\n\nDownload the free FOX Seattle FOX LOCAL app for mobile in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for live Seattle news, top stories, weather updates and more local and national coverage, plus 24/7 streaming coverage from across the nation.",

            "content": "Market share is falling for the high-flying growth stock.\n\nMore so than any other American company, Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) deserves credit for making the electric vehicle (EV) industry viable. After decades or even generations of talk about an electric car, Tesla has taken the concept mainstream, scaling production and turning a tidy profit against long odds, defying expectations.\n\nThat success in an industry that many think will eventually supplant traditional combustion vehicles, along with its big promises about autonomy, has allowed Tesla to earn a sky-high valuation and a market cap now well over $1 trillion, which compares to peers like General Motors and Ford that trade at single-digit multiples of their earnings.\n\nAccording to the stock chart below, things continue to look good for Tesla. As you can see, the stock has jumped 56% since the end of 2023, overcoming an earlier setback last year.\n\nHowever, now that Tesla's full-year results are in for 2024, a look at the numbers indicates that the business is much weaker than the stock surge indicates, and according to one number, Tesla could be in serious trouble.\n\nTesla's declining auto sales\n\nInvestors already knew that Tesla's vehicle sales fell in 2024, declining by 1.1% to 1.79 million, but the EV titan just confirmed that automotive revenue was also down last year, down 6% to $77.1 billion. Total revenue still rose 1% this year to $97.7 billion thanks to growth in its energy storage and generation business, and services, which are primarily software-based. But vehicles are the core component of the business, and its services, which made up $10.5 billion in revenue, depend on them as well.\n\nTesla's decline in automotive revenue means that both volume sales of its vehicles and average selling price declined. This occurred even as it rolled out the new Cybertruck, presumably expanding its production capabilities as well.\n\nTesla lowered prices on its vehicles last year. It's not fully clear why, but typically businesses lower prices to stay competitive with the market and move inventory, and those rules apply to Tesla as well. According to conventional laws of economics, when prices fall, demand is supposed to go up, but that's not what happened with Tesla. Instead, demand continued to fall.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has complained time and again about the impact of high interest rates on demand, but high interest rates have affected all automakers equally. Tesla acknowledged in its fourth-quarter earnings report that \"Affordability remains top of mind for customers.\"\n\nAs the chart below shows, Tesla's market share among all vehicles, not just EVs, has fallen over the last year in North America and Europe, while it's risen slightly in China, the world's largest EV market.\n\nAs you can see, Tesla's market share has plateaued over the last two years and even begun to decline. The company's challenges extend beyond the general slowdown in the electric vehicle market; it's also losing overall market share in the automotive industry.\n\nThere isn't a clear reason for that plateau, though there are several factors that seem to have caused it. Those include increasing competition from other EV makers, a base of early adopters for EVs that seems exhausted, concerns about range and charging, and perhaps some brand fatigue, especially as Tesla has been slow to update its fleet, unlike traditional automakers that release new models every year.\n\nCan Tesla return to growth?\n\nMusk continues to make big promises around autonomy, and if Tesla pulls off full self-driving and robotaxis the way he envisions it, the current pause in growth won't matter. The market, however, seems to be overlooking the evident challenges the company is facing.\n\nTesla said it has a capacity of three million vehicles, and it expects to return to vehicle growth in 2025, though it didn't give specific numbers. Analysts expect 19% revenue growth this year, most of which should come from vehicle growth.\n\nFor now, investors seem to trust Musk as the stock rose after hours in spite of missing estimates, but Tesla could have a long way to fall if demand continues to be challenged. Given its lofty valuation, Tesla stock seems to have more to lose than to gain at this point.",

CEO Elon Musk gave a long speech about the current state of the company and its future, and yet, he didn\u2019t mention Tesla\u2019s only new vehicle launched in the last 5 years.\n\nThat\u2019s because the program has been quite disappointing.\n\nTesla had over 1 million reservations for the electric pickup truck and Musk said that it could see Tesla selling 500,000 units per year. Tesla built the capacity at Gigafactory Texas for a planned production of 250,000 units per year.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nYet, Tesla worked through its entire reservation backlog by selling fewer than 40,000 units, and now it is having problems selling what it currently has in inventory.\n\nThe automaker offered discounts, referral incentives, and free Supercharging for life to try to move the truck.\n\nNow, Tesla has announced that it is launching Cybertruck leases in the US starting at $750 per month:\n\nLeases are less profitable than outright purchases, so Tesla generally waits until demand is down before introducing them to new vehicles.\n\nThere are a few other things that could help the Cybertruck in 2025.\n\nThe electric pickup truck has become eligible for the federal tax credit. Tesla is also planning to release the cheaper RWD version of the Cyhbertruck later this year, which could increase demand, but it\u2019s unclear by as much.\n\nTesla is also giving $1,000 off on the Cybertruck through its referral program.\n\nBut despite all these incentives, Tesla is having issues moving the Cybertruck. The automaker is still stuck with some Foundation Series Cybertrucks, and it announced this weekend that it is even offering free wraps to those buying inventory Foundation Series Cybertrucks.\n\nThat\u2019s worth more than $6,000 in some cases.\n\nWe previously reported that Tesla even buffed out the Foundation Series badges on some Cybertrucks to sell them as regular trucks because it was having issues selling the more expensive and exclusive version of the electric pickup truck.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nDespite all these incentives, Tesla can\u2019t move the Cybertruck. I am curious to see how many Tesla will be able to sell in 2025.\n\nI\u2019ve seen estimates as low as 30,000 units, which would be even lower than last year.\n\nThere are some at 100,000 units, and while I would not have doubted 6 months ago, now I think that\u2019s high.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of room to start thinking of the Cybertruck vehicle program as a failure compared to Tesla\u2019s planned production capacity. If Tesla would have worked on a more conventional electric pickup as well as cheaper EVs, I think it would be in a much better situation today.\n\nWhat do you think?

We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025, and we\u2019ll continue to expand our lineup from there. Tesla\u2019s CFO Vaibhav Taneja at the company\u2019s Q4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Results on January 29, 2025\n\nWhile he refrained from sharing product details, Taneja reaffirmed that the new model would retain Tesla\u2019s core attributes.\n\nAs always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features, and capable of full autonomy in the future, and despite the premium experience, the total cost of ownership is close to mass-market, less premium competitors. Tesla\u2019s CFO Vaibhav Taneja at the company\u2019s Q4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Results on January 29, 2025\n\nNot a de-contented Model 3 or Model Y\n\nTesla\u2019s new entry-level car will use a mixed-platform approach, borrowing modules or parts from its next-gen toolkit. Pictured is the Model 3 Performance for illustration.\n\nBefore you mistake the executive\u2019s comments for a stripped-down Model 3 or Model Y variant, consider the Q4 and Full Year 2024 financial report, released shortly after the earnings call. The \u2018Outlook\u2019 slide explicitly mentions \u201cnew vehicles\u201d and \u201cnext-generation platform\u201d which rules out de-contented existing nameplates:\n\nPlans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These vehicles will utilize aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup. Tesla\u2019s Q4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Results update presentation\n\nWhat we know about the \u2018Model Q\u2019\n\nOn December 9, 2024, Becky Peterson of The Wall Street Journal reignited speculation about a Tesla \u2018Model Q\u2019 by citing a Deutsche Bank report on X. The report suggests that Tesla discussed the entry-level EV with investors at Deutsche Bank\u2019s Autonomous Driving Day on December 5, 2024, in New York. Travis Axelrod, Tesla\u2019s Head of Investor Relations, reportedly participated in the discussion.\n\nThe entry-level Tesla could use a 53 kWh battery with Iron-based cells, giving it a range of about 250 miles. Pictured is an unofficial rendering from Sugar Design.\n\nAccording to the report, Tesla plans to manufacture the new model at an existing facility, integrating production into an established assembly line. The company aims to price the vehicle below $30,000, factoring in the $7,500 federal tax credit. \u2018Model Q,\u2019 as Peterson pointed out in a subsequent tweet, is an internal moniker at Deutsche Bank, and not an official name.\n\nIn the document titled \u201cMaster Plan Part 3 presentation\u201d published on April 5, 2023, Tesla discussed its battery strategy, laying out a table with the plan for vehicles in different segments. In this chapter, Tesla stated that its proposed compact vehicle would use a 53 kWh LFP battery, which we assume should give it an EPA-estimated range of about 250 miles on a single charge.\n\nCustomers should also get to experience Supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the compact car. Currently, FSD Supervised v13.2 is offered on carlines with Tesla\u2019s AI4 computer.\n\nMusk\u2019s shifting priorities\n\nOn October 23, 2024, during Tesla\u2019s Q3 2024 earnings conference call, Elon Musk dismissed the idea of a $25,000 Tesla, calling it \u201cpointless.\u201d However, the \u2018affordable model\u2019 that Tesla plans to introduce this year is expected to be positioned slightly higher, competing with the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EUV, which is also projected to start at around USD 30,000.\n\nI think having a regular 25k model is pointless. It would be silly. Like, it would be completely at odds with what we believe. Elon Musk, Tesla Q3 2024 earnings conference call on October 23, 2024\n\nMusk\u2019s statements at the time suggested that Tesla had scrapped its long-promised high-volume, budget-friendly model, instead prioritizing the Cybercab, the company\u2019s upcoming autonomous ride-hailing vehicle. However, the Cybercab is a different project to the aforementioned \u201caffordable models,\u201d with the 2024 Financial Update report stating that the autonomous model is \u201cscheduled for volume production starting in 2026.\u201d\n\nTopElectricSUV says\n\nTesla\u2019s statements and investor discussions from January suggest that the long-speculated entry-level model will finally materialize in 2025. If priced around $30,000, it would open Tesla ownership to a much wider audience while maintaining core attributes such as software innovation, autonomy, and premium ownership experience. Additionally, it would help Tesla expand its market share in countries where Chinese brands dominate the lower segments with their compact crossovers and high-riding models.\n\nAlso See: Next-gen Tesla Roadster: 7 Aspects that we can\u2019t wait to experience!\n\nFeatured image: Unofficial entry-level Tesla illustration by Sugar Design.",

Within this short period of time, the automaker has sold out the entire inventory of the White Interior option in North America.\n\nTesla offered a new Glacier Blue color for the Model Y Juniper when it launched the vehicle in China and Asia Pacific last month. However, looking at the North American Model Y Launch Series configurator, Tesla does not offer the Glacier Blue paint option in the US & Canada.\n\nOnly 4 colors are available to choose from for the 2025 Model Y Launch Series in North America. These include Stealth Grey, Ultra Red, Pearl White Multi-Coat, and Quicksilver.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nTesla Model Y Launch Series (Juniper) online configurator for the United States shows the White Interior as sold out and paint options are limited to 4 without the new Glacier Blue (listed above).

It\u2019s just been a week since the Launch Series orders were opened and the \u2018Black and White\u2019 interior inventory has completely drained out.\n\nThe only option available now is the \u2018All Black\u2019 interior. This entirely blacked-out interior theme does not appeal to a majority of Tesla customers. The white seats, door trims, and dashboard comparably look more futuristic and catchy to the eyes.\n\nAlthough the white seats of the \u2018Black and White\u2019 interior of Tesla vehicles tend to get dirty with jeans stains there are ways to clean it off. It\u2019s just a trade-off for the spaceship-like feel that comes with the white interior elements.\n\n\u2018Black and White\u2019 interior of the new 2025 Tesla Model Y Juniper refresh with the new white seats (see Black Interior image for comparison below).

Tesla bagged more than 100,000 Model Y Juniper orders in less than 2 weeks in China and APAC last month.\n\nThe North American customer base was also waiting for the new design-refreshed Model Y to place their orders. Although the price of the 2025 Model Y Launch Series is on the higher side, the futuristic looks and dozens of improvements from the previous generation have resulted in its staggering sales.\n\nThe initial batch of the new Model Y is called the Launch Series.

The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, and they have already caused ripple effects and a larger trade war with some of the companies.\n\nCanada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke on the phone over the weekend, and while Sheinbaum hasn\u2019t yet formalized or disclosed plans for counter-tariffs, Trudeau announced some on Saturday evening, according to Reuters. In the announcement, the Prime Minister said that Canada with also establish a 25-percent tariff on $155 billion worth of products from the U.S.\n\nTrudeau has said that the government will release an updated list of products and tariff details, though the initial list included products such as certain appliances, beer, wine, lumber and other goods. He also says that the government plans to start with $30 billion on Tuesday, as followed by the additional $125 billion later this month.\n\nThe Trump administration says the tariffs are aimed at \u201caddressing an emergency situation\u201d related to the import of illegal drugs including fentanyl, along with pointing the blame at illegal immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is taking bold action to hold Mexico, Canada, and China accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country,\u201d the White House writes on its fact sheet dedicated to the order.\n\nYou can see the full fact sheet from the White House here, or check out the full executive order here.\n\nREAD MORE ON U.S. PRODUCTION: Tesla Texas lithium refinery produces its first spodumene\n\nTrump follows up, auto workers weigh in on how tariffs will affect the industry\n\nOn Sunday, Trump also followed up with a post on his Truth Social account in response to criticism:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we\u2019re not going to be the \u201cStupid Country\u201d any longer. MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS! Why should the United States lose TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIZING OTHER COUNTRIES, and why should these other countries pay a small fraction of the cost of what USA citizens pay for Drugs and Pharmaceuticals, as an example? THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\n\nFollowing a repost of Trump\u2019s words on X, community notes pointed to a TD Economics saying that the U.S. has had a trade surplus with Canada for the last sixteen years straight when not including the energy sector, or oil, natural gas and electricity.\n\nMultiple others have weighed in on how the tariffs could affect the industry at large, highlighting the potential for price increases for the consumer, potential layoffs, and some even saying that it will shut the auto industry down altogether.\n\nIn a report from Bloomberg on Sunday, Flavio Volpe, the President of the Canada Automotive Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association, said that he doesn\u2019t think the country\u2019s auto parts makers will be able to remain profitable with the tariffs in place.\n\n\u201cThe auto sector is going to shut down within a week,\u201d Volpe said. \u201cAt 25 percent, absolutely nobody in our business is profitable by a long shot.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have warned of even more immediate effects, especially for Canadian and Mexican cities and states whose communities rely heavily on automotive manufacturing. One such city includes Windsor, Ontario, where John D\u2019Agnolo, the union president of a local Ford factory there, says substantial numbers of layoffs could be imminent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about thousands and thousands of jobs being lost,\u201d D\u2019Agnolo said. \u201cWe\u2019d truly be a ghost town, here in Windsor, if we lost this type of business.\u201d\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford has also warned that it could affect as many as 500,000 jobs across the province, which is Canada\u2019s most populated, with many of those being automotive roles.\n\nMany also expect the increased costs to be passed onto the consumer, though it\u2019s still unclear exactly what the repercussions of the tariffs could be. We could also see businesses absorb some or all of these costs, though some initial research seems to suggest that buyers will see higher sticker prices across the industry.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a lot of impact,\u201d Aruna Anand, chief executive officer of parts supplier Continental AG\u2019s North American business, said in an interview. \u201cThe question is who is absorbing the price and it becomes, are we able to absorb that price or is it going to be shifted to the end consumer?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a separate report from Reuters on Saturday, it was suggested that automakers such as General Motors (GM) and Toyota could, however, shift more production from overseas factories to those in the U.S., while major aluminum manufacturer Alcoa is considering re-routing plans that could potentially reduce tariffs. Many electric vehicle (EV) battery materials also come from metal mining operations in China, with some of these sectors just beginning to emerge domestically.\n\nOthers also report that the move could \u201cundermine competitiveness\u201d in the American auto industry, ultimately increasing the cost of building cars in the U.S.\n\n\u201cOur American automakers \u2026 should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce,\u201d says Matt Blunt, the President of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Stellantis, GM and Ford.\n\nDuring Tesla\u2019s Q4 earnings call last week, Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja also warned that tariffs could affect profitability for the company, since its all of its production facilities utilize parts from around the globe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs,\u201d Taneja said. \u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses. Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s still not quite clear at this time how the tariffs may affect Tesla\u2019s prices. While Tesla has regularly advertised having the \u201cmost American-made cars\u201d with final assembly for the market taking place at its factories in Texas and California, the company also gets a significant amount of components from Canada.\n\nIn a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in October, Tesla did disclose what percentage of its vehicle parts are made in either Canada or the U.S., as compared to other countries such as Mexico and Japan. Some of the figures also don\u2019t disclose where the remaining amounts come from, though they can give users an idea of how many components come from Mexico compared to either the U.S. or Canada.\n\nYou can see that data for Tesla\u2019s vehicles below, though it\u2019s also worth noting that it does not show the ratio of U.S. to Canadian parts\u2014just a combined percentage from the two countries. You can also view the full filing from the NHTSA here.\n\nCybertruck : 65 percent from U.S. and Canada; 25 percent from Mexico\n\n: 65 percent from U.S. and Canada; 25 percent from Mexico Model 3 Long Range : 75 percent from U.S. and Canada; 20 percent from Mexico\n\n: 75 percent from U.S. and Canada; 20 percent from Mexico Model 3 Performance : 70 percent from U.S. and Canada; 20 percent from Mexico\n\n: 70 percent from U.S. and Canada; 20 percent from Mexico Model Y (all trims) : 70 percent from U.S. and Canada; 25 percent from Mexico\n\n: 70 percent from U.S. and Canada; 25 percent from Mexico Model S : 65 percent from U.S. and Canada; 20 percent from Mexico\n\n: 65 percent from U.S. and Canada; 20 percent from Mexico Model X: 60 percent from U.S. and Canada; 25 percent from Mexico\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nTesla is offering a complimentary PPF wrap to people buying inventory Foundation Series Cybertruck in the US and Canada.\n\nThe EV maker made the announcement on the company\u2019s inventory page.\n\nTesla writes\u2026\n\n\u201cReceive a complimentary vehicle wrap when you take delivery of a new Foundation Series Cybertruck by March 31. Terms and Conditions Order and take delivery of Foundation Series Cybertruck by March 31, 2025, to receive a complimentary XPEL-installed vehicle wrap. Valid on orders placed in the US and Canada starting on February 1, 2025, or later. Eligible customers will receive a voucher within 14 days of their delivery date with redemption instructions. Installation must be coordinated directly with XPEL at one of their 125+ authorized installer locations in the US and Canada by June 30, 2025. The promotional offer is limited to available color options and includes a 1-year installation warranty through XPEL directly. The voucher will expire if not redeemed by June 30, 2025, and will not be reissued. The offer is only valid for the purchased Foundation Series Cybertruck and cannot be redeemed for cash or transferred to another person or vehicle. Offer is subject to change or end at any time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that Tesla is not doing the free Cybertruck wraps in-house but is paying XPEL to do the work.\n\nAlthough Tesla launched a wrap service with the Cybertruck, the EV maker unceremoniously ended the program after a few months.\n\nSo, is this a good deal?\n\nThe free wrap service is the second incentive Tesla offers people buying an inventory Foundation Series Cybertruck.\n\nIf you choose Tesla\u2019s \u201climited-edition\u201d Foundation Series Cybertruck, you also get free lifetime supercharger access.\n\nTogether with the wrap and the supercharger access, Tesla is offering close to $10,000 worth of complimentary add-ons to move Foundation Series Cybertrucks off the lot.\n\nThis could be enticing to some people, and a lot of new Cybertruck buyers say the incentives are nudging them towards an inventory Foundation Series Cybertruck rather than configuring a new one.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a steeper discount on a Cybertruck, the EV maker has recently cut Cybertruck lease prices by 25%.\n\nYou can now lease a Cybertruck for $750 a month. This is down from the $1,000 a month it used to cost less than three months ago.\n\nMore Cybertruck price cuts?\n\nLooking at Tesla, it seems like the EV maker is pulling a lot of demand levers to sell Cybertrucks, and if you are willing to wait a few months, you\u2019ll probably be able to get an even better deal.\n\nEarly Cybertruck owners are currently looking to start a petition pleading with Tesla to offer them the same perks that new buyers are getting.\n\nAt this point, some Cybertruck buyers might be afraid of missing out on these deals. Maybe demand spikes, and Tesla raises prices and pulls the plug on the incentives.\n\nIf you are thinking like that, fear not. Tesla recently announced that it\u2019s producing enough 4680 cells to power 130,000 Cybertrucks per year.\n\nCurrently, looking at Cybertruck sales so far, at these prices, it doesn\u2019t appear that there is even a demand for half that number (65,000) Cybertrucks per year.\n\nThis means Tesla will have to lower prices even further if the company wants to keep the Cybertruck production lines running at full speed.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s interesting to see Tesla offering more and more Cybertruck incentives rather than lowering prices.

We'll soon find out.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nTesla\u2019s Romanian arm invited me to check out a pre-production Model Y Juniper they brought to the brand\u2019s new headquarters in Bucharest. It was a long-range model, finished in Stealth Grey featuring the new base 19-inch \u201cCrossflow\u201d wheels. Inside, it had black faux leather upholstery, so it looks a bit dark in the photos. The lighting could have been better, especially given how dark the car, the wheels and the interior are. I had to crank up the ISO on my camera for the photos to be usable.\n\nThe car I checked out came from Tesla's factory in Germany, which will be the only source for Model Ys sold in Europe.\n\nWalking into the backroom where the new Model Y was on display, I was struck by how different its presence is compared to the pre-facelift model. The front light bar and the more chiseled look of the front end work wonders with the rest of the design, and my first impression was that it looked way better than before.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs/Andrei Nedelea Photo by: InsideEVs/Andrei Nedelea\n\nThe headlight projectors have been moved down to where the fog lights were on the older model, but you don\u2019t notice them too much unless they\u2019re on. This has to be one of the best applications of a two-tier front light design because you mostly look at the full-width light bar, which certainly grabs your attention.\n\nFrom the side, not much is different aside from the wheels. The mirrors are the same size as before, but the plastic housing now has a horizontal crease that breaks up their height. The exterior highlight for me was the rear light bar, which is unlike any I\u2019ve seen on a car. Before seeing the car in person, I didn\u2019t understand why Tesla was so proud of this design feature, but now I do.\n\nUnlike basically all other cars with a rear light bar, you don\u2019t actually see it in the Juniper. It\u2019s hidden, and the light you see is what shines on a silver panel; this doesn't always come across in photos, but in real life it's quite striking.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique look that helps the car stand out and makes the pre-refresh model look old-fashioned. The subtle, diffuse light from the rear light bar contrasts with the harsh outline of the boomerang-shaped brake lights when they light up\u2014I took a photo of the car with the brake lights on to highlight this difference.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs/Andrei Nedelea Photo by: InsideEVs/Andrei Nedelea Photo by: InsideEVs/Andrei Nedelea\n\nThe interior of the Model Y Juniper is completely new, with nothing obvious being carried over. Just like with the Model 3 Highland, all the materials were nicer to the touch than before, and the assembly quality also seemed better. It feels a lot fancier than before, and it finally deserves to be called a \u201cpremium\u201d interior, which was a bit of a stretch for its predecessor.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs/Andrei Nedelea 2025 Tesla Model Y\n\nTesla\u2019s decision to remove the stalks behind the steering wheel in the updated Model 3 was almost unanimously disliked. The manufacturer listened and kept the indicator stalk in the new Model Y (so there's no need to stick on one of these aftermarket stalks) even though the rest of the interior makeover closely mirrors the Model 3 Highland. This includes the main screen that has a thinner bezel, as well as the addition of a second screen in the back.\n\nThe rear screen is still placed too low to serve a real entertainment purpose, so even though you can do a lot more through it, you\u2019ll mainly just adjust climate settings here. While in the back, I noticed two new buttons on the side of the seat squab. These are used to electrically fold the rear seat and then put it back up again.\n\nGallery: 2025 Tesla Model Y 17 InsideEVs/Andrei Nedelea\n\nIn the older Model Y, you couldn\u2019t do this electrically, and you had to unlatch them and then put them back up manually. There are also buttons in the trunk, which serve the same purpose, and the little icons on the buttons show what they do when viewed from the exact perspective you have when operating the buttons\u2014the ones on the sides of the seat show a lateral perspective while the ones in the trunk give you a three-quarter look at what the buttons do.\n\nAlso new for the Model Y Juniper is a drain plug in the floor of the frunk, similar to what you get in a Ford Mustang Mach-E. Some owners missed having a drain in their Tesla\u2019s frunk, so they installed one themselves, but the revised model has one from the factory, and you can simply remove the plug, and all the liquid inside will drain under the car.\n\nAll these changes add up and make the revised Model Y feel more different from its predecessor than you may expect. We haven\u2019t had a chance to drive it yet, but we should get one of these cars to review sometime in February.\n\nGiven that it features a softened suspension setup complete with frequency-selective dampers, dramatically improving ride comfort in the updated Model 3 (but affecting its sportiness somewhat) we expect the same from the refreshed Model Y.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "It might be a brand-new year, but it has been anything but quiet for the folks at Tesla (TSLA 3.86%). Headlines have screamed about Tesla's sales decline and have gone as far to call the Cybertruck a \"cyberflop.\" Headlines have screamed about the company's aging vehicle lineup and CEO Elon Musk's growing political agenda and antics.\n\nBut for all the negativity, investors might lose track of the positive developments. Here are three reasons not to sell, despite the negative narratives.\n\nCybertruck or cyberflop?\n\nWhen it comes to the Cybertruck, allegedly Tesla's Ford Motor Company F-150 Lightning fighter, critics didn't hold back their opinion. Said Robby DeGraff, manager of product insights at AutoPacific, according to Automotive News:\n\nThe initial sales targets for the Cybertruck preached by Musk years ago are nothing short of comical. It's just a dumb product, top to bottom. Look at the Tesla Model 3 -- it's really, really good. I wish Tesla could have mirrored that excellent execution elsewhere rather than wasting time on the Cybertruck.\n\nIf one critic wasn't enough, here's another taste. According to Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars, according to Automotive News:\n\nI think the Cybertruck can be officially considered a flop now. Remember, this was going to be Tesla's F-150. The new benchmark, foundational vehicle for the Tesla brand to keep it super powerful, super profitable and high volume.\n\nThose are pretty harsh comments, but to be fair, the Cybertruck doesn't appear to be a flop just yet. The Cybertruck broke into the top 10 EVs sold in the U.S. at No. 5, with nearly 39,000 units sold. That edged out Ford's F-150 Lightning, ranked No. 6 with just over 33,500 units sold, and it was enough to displace Rivian's R1T from the ranking list.\n\nIsland of success\n\nTesla in a way finds itself on an island of success in China, which is a rare feat for foreign automakers these days. China's brutal price war and surge of new energy vehicles, which includes plug-in hybrids, hybrids, and fully electric vehicles, has destroyed margins and sent many foreign automakers scrambling to salvage market share.\n\nTesla is one of the few, if not the only, foreign automaker competing well in China currently. Tesla announced its China sales rose 8.8% to a record high of more than 657,000 vehicles in 2024. Better yet, Tesla ended the year in China on a strong note with a 12.8% sales gain in December, compared to the month earlier.\n\nTesla's success in China will be more important than ever, with competition increasing and the company's global sales posting its first decline in company history. In fact, Tesla delivered nearly 37% of its vehicles to customers in China, making it a critical market.\n\nDown but dominating\n\nYou've heard of the phrase \"down but not out,\" but have you heard of the phrase \"down but still dominating\"? Probably not, but that's exactly what Tesla is doing in the U.S. EV market.\n\nTesla's Model Y and Model 3 posted 6.6% and 17.4% sales declines in 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year. However, despite the sales decline, the two models still ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, and dominated in U.S. EV sales.\n\nIn fact, taking a look at the top 10 graphed shows just how dominating Tesla still is.\n\nWhile Tesla's U.S. sales declined 5.6%, compared to the prior year, and its market share dropped to 48.7% from 65% in 2022, the EV maker still dominates the top of the charts. It was simply inevitable that Tesla couldn't continue controlling the entire EV market.\n\nWhat it all means\n\nIt's a brand-new year, but it's the same polarizing Tesla that investors either love or hate. Tesla's global deliveries might have declined slightly, but that's to be expected, with a plethora of new vehicle models launching and price competition intensifying.\n\nWhat matters is that Tesla is still dominating in the U.S. and is one of few foreign automakers still doing well in China. Tesla will also receive some reinforcements as the company's Model Y refresh has launched in China, Europe, and the U.S. markets. Ultimately, Tesla has positioned itself for another solid year within the ever-evolving EV industry, so don't worry about the negative narratives.",

Freeland has been running to lead Canada\u2019s Liberal Party and aims to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau following his announcement of plans to step down.\n\nREAD MORE ON GLOBAL TARIFFS: Tesla joins group of automakers suing EU for EV tariffs from China-built cars\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, Freeland says that Canada should target products coming from states that voted for Trump and those made by his \u201cbillionaire buddies\u201d to help exert the political pressure needed to overturn the tariffs. Others in the Canadian government have vocally opposed Freeland\u2019s approach to the tariffs, including fellow Liberal Party candidate Mark Carney, who has advocated for a less aggressive response.\n\nAlong with those against Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has said that it will establish 10 percent tariffs against China on a wide range of products, potentially including materials needed for electric vehicle (EV) batteries.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nTesla has been known to tweak its referral program discounts from time to time and also adjust pricing of inventory (in-stock) models when it needs to move cars off the lot. Right now it\u2019s doing both. The company just boosted the referral program discount to $2,500 on the Model 3 and started cutting the prices of in-stock inventory Model Y cars to make room for the recently unveiled refreshed Model Y. Tesla\u2019s also continuing to offer referral and loyalty discounts on the Model S, Model X, Model Y, Model 3, and CyberTruck. Though, the \u201cLaunch Version\u201d of the new refreshed Model Y is currently ineligible for the referral or loyalty discount.\n\nAlso, buyers of both the Model 3 and Model Y in the US are still eligible for the $7,500 EV tax credit, which may not be around for much longer under the new administration. So, if you\u2019ve had your eye on a Model 3 electric sedan or Model Y electric CUV, now may be a good time to pull the trigger.\n\nThe Model 3 underwent its own design refresh last year, with the newer \u201cHighland\u201d model being offered in the US and Canada starting last January. And now its younger but bigger brother, the Model Y, got its own design refresh, code named \u201cJuniper,\u201d with deliveries expected to begin in the United States as early as next month (March 2025). The new Model Y is only available currently in a special \u201cLaunch Edition,\u201d which includes Full Self-Driving, speed boost, upgraded paint and wheels, as well as other upgrades. But with the new Model Y on the table, the company has begun offering inventory discounts on in-stock inventory Model Ys.\n\nThe refreshed Model Y offers a number of enhancements over its predecessor, including sportier lines, a new light bar across the front and back, a rear-seat infotainment screen, an additional front-facing camera, and interior design and lighting accents. It also offers a mild 3% improvement in range, with the launch edition Model Y sporting an EPA rating of 320 miles compared to a comparably equipped \u201cold\u201d Model Y Long Range AWD model, which is rated for 311 miles.\n\nSome were surprised to see that Tesla kept the turn signal stalk on the refreshed Model Y, whereas they have removed it from their other refreshed models. Personally, I welcome this decision as I\u2019ve found the steering wheel mounted turn signal buttons on the new Model 3 a bit hard to get used to. The right-side shift stalk has been removed from the refreshed Model Y, with gear selection now located on the left side of the main touch screen, just like the refreshed Model 3.\n\nTo get an idea of the referral discount on the Model 3, you can now order a brand new Long Range RWD Model 3 for $39,990 before incentives. In New York state, that goes down to $31,990 for select buyers after the Federal Tax Credit of $7,500 and NY State Tax Credit of $500, both of which are still active.\n\nAs for the existing Model Y, we found an inventory brand new Model Y near us for $44,630 ($37,130 after federal tax credit). This is after the $500 referral or loyalty credit has been applied.\n\nIn order to get the referral or loyalty credit, be sure to use a referral link when you order the car. If you\u2019re an existing Tesla customer, use you own referral link (though this isn\u2019t strictly necessary). If you are not yet a Tesla owner and have a friend or family member who does own a Tesla, ask them for their referral link. If you need a referral link for the discount, feel free to use one of the ones listed below.\n\nTesla Referral Links for 2025:\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith this new $2,500 referral discount, and the availability of both the federal tax credit as well as additional EV incentives in some states, now is a great time to buy a brand new Tesla Model 3. And with inventory discounts as well as tax credits still available on the Model Y, new buyers can pick up the popular hatchback at an excellent price as well. With the federal tax credit for EVs in jeopardy this year, prospective buyers may not want to wait too long to pick up a new EV in 2025.\n\nRelated Reading:",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nTesla has once again lowered Cybertruck lease prices. This is the second time Tesla has lowered Cybertruck lease monthly payments since introducing the option less than 3 months ago this past November.\n\nNow, the Cybertruck AWD lease costs only $750 a month. This is down from $1,000 a month in November and $900 a month in December.\n\nAll these price cuts mean a 25% price decrease in monthly lease payments in less than 3 months. If Tesla similarly discounted the Cybertruck purchase price by 25%, it would give the vehicle a $60,000 starting price.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting here is that Tesla launched the Cybertruck lease option after ending the Foundation Series Cybertruck program and introducing the regular Cybertruck, which has an $80,000 starting price.\n\nThis means all the lease payment price cuts have been for the non-Foundation Series Cybertruck. Also, since introducing the lease program the Cybertruck has always qualified for the $7,500 tax credit through the lease loophole.\n\nWhat this means is that all of the lease payment cuts and the entirety of the 25% discount are coming directly out of Tesla\u2019s bottom line.\n\nThe $750 monthly lease price is for the base model Cybertruck AWD; however, Tesla has surprisingly increased the monthly lease payment for the performance tri-motor Cybertruck, although it\u2019s only by $1.\n\nIn November, leasing a performance Cybertruck used to cost $1,204 a month. However, this price dropped to $999 a month in December, and now it has increased by $1 to $1,000.\n\nOverall, even after this \u201cprice increase,\u201d Tesla has still discounted the Cybertruck performance lease price by over 20% in less than 3 months.\n\nHowever, going back to the base model Cybertruck AWD, Tesla has increased the end-of-lease buyout price for the vehicle after the latest lease payment cuts.\n\nBefore the latest price cuts, the Cybertruck AWD lease buyout used to cost $54,950; however, as of today, this number has increased to $57,400.\n\nSimilarly, Tesla has increased the end-of-lease buyout for the Cybertruck performance; It\u2019s now up from $67,500 to $71,730.\n\nAt these prices, the end-of-lease buyout numbers suggest that Tesla expects the Cybertruck to hold over 70% of its value after 3 years and driven 30,000 miles.\n\nOverall, It\u2019s interesting to see Tesla simultaneously lowering the Cybertruck monthly lease payment and increasing the end-of-lease buyout price.

            "content": "A news study has ranked popular vehicles according to annual running costs.\n\nFuel, insurance, maintenance and taxes were all factored into the rankings.\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 topped the list as the most affordable, but only by a small margin.\n\nWe all fixate on the purchase price or monthly loan/lease cost when looking to get a new car, when the true cost of running a vehicle is affected by all kinds of other factors. Two years down the road the car that looked dirt cheap, might turn out to have cost you more than the one you crossed off your shopping list for being too expensive.\n\nBut which models really do have the lowest running costs, and which have the worst? A new study by Self set out to answer that question by crunching the numbers on 50 popular vehicles in the US on sale between 2022-24.\n\nRelated: Which Brand\u2019s Cars Cost Least To Run Over 10 Years?\n\nFor each car, truck or SUV, analysts calculated the energy or \u2018fuel\u2019 costs, insurance and maintenance costs and the price of taxes and fees. We\u2019ll get to the winners and losers in a second, but first let\u2019s consider the cost of running the average vehicle based on the data.\n\nAverage running costs\n\nCost % of annual costs Annual fuel costs $2,246 34.8% Annual insurance costs $1,763 27.3% Annual maintenance costs $1,633 25.3% Annual fees and taxes $820 12.7% Total $6,462 Self SWIPE\n\nThe average annual total cost came to $6,462, more than 34 percent of which ($2,246) is swallowed by fuel, the single biggest expense. Insurance and maintenance accounted for just over 25 percent each, with annual taxes and fees making up the rest.\n\nBut those numbers are skewed when you break the cars down by fuel type. The total running costs of the average hybrid ($5,485) are slightly lower than those for the average EV ($5,517) and much lower than for the average ICE car ($6,544). But within those columns there are also big differences. The average EV costs much less in fuel than the other two, but is far more expensive to insure.\n\nRunning costs by powertrain\n\nElectric Gasoline Hybrid Annual fuel costs $676 $2,364 $1,549 Annual maintenance $1,297 $1,657 $1,518 Annual insurance $2,368 $1,725 $1,670 Annual fees & taxes $1,176 $798 $748 Total per year $5,517 $6,544 $5,485 Self SWIPE\n\nWhich is why when we look at the big table of car models, yes, the Tesla Model 3 comes top with an annual running cost of $5,061, but the combustion Hyundai Elantra is only $43 behind. The Elantra costs $979 more in energy and $292 in servicing every year, but is $694 less expensive to insure and saves you $533 in taxes and fees.\n\nPredictably, the pricey end of the table is dominated by trucks and SUVs, the most expensive of which is the Chevy Tahoe. One of those monsters will cost you a hefty $3,276 every year in gas, and $8,644 overall.\n\nRunning costs by model\n\nRank Brand Model Type Annual Fuel cost Annual Maintenance Annual Insurance Annual Fees & Taxes Annual Running Cost 1 Tesla Model 3 Electric $636 $1,143 $2,241 $1,041 $5,061 2 Hyundai Elantra Gasoline $1,615 $1,435 $1,547 $508 $5,104 3 Toyota Corolla Gasoline $1,615 $1,497 $1,511 $559 $5,182 4 Kia Forte Gasoline $1,712 $1,491 $1,540 $493 $5,235 5 Honda Civic Gasoline $1,712 $1,608 $1,413 $549 $5,282 6 Honda Accord Gasoline $1,737 $1,550 $1,492 $601 $5,380 7 Tesla Model Y Electric $708 $1,339 $2,399 $947 $5,393 8 Nissan Altima Gasoline $1,737 $1,559 $1,581 $571 $5,449 9 Toyota Camry Gasoline $1,712 $1,598 $1,544 $608 $5,462 10 Honda CR-V Hybrid $1,549 $1,518 $1,670 $748 $5,485 11 Honda HR-V Gasoline $1,977 $1,593 $1,585 $570 $5,725 12 Nissan Rogue Gasoline $1,820 $1,537 $1,795 $657 $5,809 13 Subaru Crosstrek Gasoline $1,943 $1,617 $1,645 $641 $5,845 14 Ford Maverick Gasoline $2,248 $1,494 $1,464 $643 $5,849 15 Ford Escape Gasoline $1,977 $1,451 $1,745 $694 $5,867 16 Jeep compass Gasoline $2,048 $1,441 $1,746 $654 $5,888 17 Chevrolet Trax Gasoline $1,911 $1,852 $1,647 $506 $5,916 18 Chevrolet Malibu Gasoline $1,849 $1,975 $1,544 $551 $5,919 19 Subaru Forester Gasoline $1,943 $1,618 $1,670 $689 $5,921 20 Tesla Model S Electric $684 $1,410 $2,463 $1,540 $6,097 21 Subaru Outback Gasoline $1,977 $1,609 $1,725 $811 $6,122 22 Toyota RAV4 Gasoline $1,977 $1,657 $1,748 $750 $6,132 23 Chrysler Pacifica Gasoline $2,440 $1,535 $1,370 $852 $6,197 24 Kia Sorento Gasoline $2,124 $1,523 $1,829 $734 $6,211 25 Mazda CX-5 Gasoline $2,011 $1,731 $1,713 $764 $6,219 26 Hyundai Tucson Gasoline $2,205 $1,559 $1,821 $748 $6,333 27 Kia Sportage Gasoline $2,340 $1,509 $1,807 $689 $6,346 28 Ford Edge Gasoline $2,340 $1,521 $1,856 $793 $6,510 29 Chevrolet Equinox Gasoline $2,124 $2,042 $1,737 $680 $6,583 30 Hyundai Santa Fe Gasoline $2,389 $1,508 $1,946 $813 $6,657 31 Jeep Grand Cherokee Gasoline $2,548 $1,492 $1,863 $838 $6,741 32 Jeep Wrangler Gasoline $2,866 $1,398 $1,812 $746 $6,823 33 Toyota Highlander Gasoline $2,340 $1,764 $1,877 $857 $6,838 34 Toyota Tacoma Gasoline $2,797 $1,595 $1,557 $898 $6,847 35 GMC Terrain Gasoline $2,248 $2,105 $1,792 $731 $6,876 36 Honda Pilot Gasoline $2,493 $1,713 $1,789 $930 $6,925 37 Chevrolet Colorado Gasoline $2,797 $1,926 $1,541 $819 $7,083 38 Hyundai Palisade Gasoline $2,655 $1,647 $1,969 $895 $7,166 39 Ford Explorer Gasoline $2,730 $1,516 $1,968 $1,083 $7,297 40 Kia Telluride Gasoline $2,730 $1,712 $1,981 $961 $7,385 41 Chevrolet Traverse Gasoline $2,730 $1,952 $1,886 $863 $7,431 42 GMC Sierra Gasoline $2,866 $1,956 $1,656 $978 $7,456 43 Toyota Tundra Gasoline $2,797 $1,596 $1,787 $1,280 $7,460 44 Ford Bronco Gasoline $3,185 $1,603 $1,899 $994 $7,681 45 Ford F-Series Gasoline $3,276 $1,530 $1,683 $1,208 $7,697 46 Chevrolet Silverado Gasoline $3,185 $1,871 $1,614 $1,029 $7,699 47 Toyota 4Runner Gasoline $3,276 $1,576 $1,897 $1,071 $7,820 48 RAM RAM Pickup Gasoline $3,583 $1,690 $1,663 $1,045 $7,981 49 Lexus RX Gasoline $2,871 $2,085 $2,051 $1,039 $8,046 50 Chevrolet Tahoe Gasoline $3,276 $1,991 $2,058 $1,319 $8,644 Self SWIPE\n\nNext, the study team used the same data to rank brands according to running costs, and again, Tesla came top, with a total annual cost of $5,517. Nissan grabbed second spot, despite its best performing single model making it no higher than eighth in the model table. The average Nissan costs $5,629, whereas the study says you\u2019ll pay $5,759 for a Honda, $5,963 for a Subaru and $6,315 for a Hyundai even though the Elantra scored well in the by-model rankings.\n\nMost expensive brand? That dubious honor goes to Lexus, whose cars will on average cost you more than $8k every year, though it should be noted that most other luxury brands are missing from this list, and would likely cost you far more.\n\nRunning costs by brand\n\nBrand Fuel Costs Annual Maintenance Annual insurance Annual Fees & Taxes Total per year Tesla $676 $1,297 $2,368 $1,176 $5,517 Nissan $1,779 $1,548 $1,688 $614 $5,629 Honda $1,894 $1,596 $1,590 $680 $5,759 Subaru $1,955 $1,615 $1,680 $714 $5,963 Hyundai $2,216 $1,537 $1,821 $741 $6,315 Chrysler $2,440 $1,535 $1,370 $852 $6,197 Mazda $2,011 $1,731 $1,713 $764 $6,219 Kia $2,226 $1,559 $1,790 $719 $6,294 Jeep $2,487 $1,444 $1,807 $746 $6,484 Toyota $2,359 $1,612 $1,703 $860 $6,534 Ford $2,626 $1,519 $1,769 $903 $6,817 Chevrolet $2,553 $1,944 $1,718 $824 $7,039 GMC $2,557 $2,031 $1,724 $855 $7,166 RAM $3,583 $1,690 $1,663 $1,045 $7,981 Lexus $2,871 $2,085 $2,051 $1,039 $8,046 SWIPE\n\nSource: Self",

Joe Fay (@jf.okay), a proud owner of a 2024 Tesla Cybertruck, certainly has. Here is his unique story, which I stumbled upon while browsing the Tesla Cybertruck TikTok page.\n\nReader Warning: If you are offended by someone playing a joke, you should avoid this story.\n\nJoe says,\n\n\"I've owned a Tesla Cybertruck for about a year, and I had no idea this feature existed. It never ceases to amaze me.\"\n\nHas This Happened to You?\n\nI'm sure many car or truck owners have found themselves in a situation where they need to fill up with gas or charge their electric car and wish the gas door or charge port was on the other side.\n\nIt never fails that when you pull into fill up, the gas filler door is on the wrong side. So you pull back out, circle the island, and sure enough, someone else pulls in right in front of you. It can be infuriating.\n\nWhat New Feature Is Joe Talking About?\n\nNow imagine buying a new Tesla Cybertruck, and when you purchased your new electric truck, they never told you there were two electric charge ports. You know about the charge port hidden in the wheel cladding on the driver's side because they showed that to you.\n\nImagine the excitement of buying a new Tesla Cybertruck, only to discover a hidden treasure-a second electric charge port on the passenger side rear wheel cover. Joe stumbled upon this secret while washing his new truck, and now he's bursting with the need to share this thrilling revelation with everyone.\n\nJoe is like a little kid on Christmas morning when he finds the toy he wants Santa to bring.\n\nImagine Joe's Excitement\n\nJoe says, \"I've owned my 2024 Tesla Cybertruck for about a year now, and I had no idea that this feature existed. Tesla, you did a really good job of hiding it.\"\n\n\"So, if you didn't know, the Cybertruck has a charging port on the left side of the truck, and you can open it just by pushing the charge port door, and it automatically opens.\"\n\n\"However, I had no idea that if you come over to the other side, it also has a charge port right there, so that means I can charge the truck on both sides.\"\n\n\"So here it is on the truck's right side, the driver's side; I can plug it in right there. What I didn't know is that I can tap the other side or push the charger right here, and it will also open the charging door, and there is a second charger on the right side of the truck.\"\n\n\"This is absolutely crazy, and I didn't know there was a second charger. Tesla did such a good job hiding it that I was unaware of this great feature. So, now I can pull up to the charger in any direction and charge my Cyberetruck from either side. How cool is that?\"\n\nJoe concludes, \"It's insane. I've owned the Cybertruck for a year, and I had no idea.\"\n\nHowever, the Cybertruck Only Has One Charging Port\n\nIs Joe's electric truck a unicorn?\n\nAfter some investigating, Joe made the video as a spoof. He was playing a joke intended to have a little fun. When I watched his TikTok video, he had a wristband on his right hand in the first part, and when he walked around the Cybertruck to the passenger side, the wristband was on his left hand.\n\nWith a sleight of hand, Joe inverted the video to make it look like the Cybertruck has a charging port on the passenger side. Joe wanted to try his hand at being a magician. Now you see it, now you see it again.\n\nLessons Learned From This Cybertruck Story\n\nI believe Joe was having fun. Or, he could be pointing out that it would be helpful if EVs had a charging port on both sides of the vehicle.\n\nThe Cybertruck's Charging Port Location is Different Than Other EVs\n\nWhy did Tesla hide the Cybertruck's charging port above the rear wheel?\n\nCarsDirect states, \"We really don't know why Tesla put the charging port where it did. The Cybertruck's odd taillight and high-up placement probably stopped the automaker from hiding the charging port there as it does in its other EVs.\"\n\nWhere Is the Charging Port On Other Electric Trucks?\n\nThe location of the Cybertruck's charging port differs from other electric trucks like the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and GMC Hummer EV Pickup.\n\nThe charging port on the Ford F-150 Lightning is positioned in front of and below the driver's side mirror, and the Rivian R1T has a charging port located just underneath the front left headlight. The GMC Hummer EV Pickup and Chevrolet Silverado EV have charging ports located directly in front of the left rear taillight. All of these pickup trucks have their charging ports on an end of the vehicle that's for ease of use.\n\nWhy Did Tesla Put the Cybertruck's Charge Port In an Odd Location?\n\nCarsDirect says, \"It could have something to do with cost. Integrating the charging port into the fender could be cheaper for Tesla when it comes to manufacturing. Or, it could be that Tesla CEO Elon Musk just wanted to do something different.\"\n\nFinal Thoughts and Questions for You\n\nI think it's the latter. Elon Musk wanted the Cybertruck to be so different from any other electric truck that he made it as controversial as possible. He succeeded.\n\nMusk says the Ford trucks are boring. A report from Business Insider says, \"Elon Musk apparently isn't a fan of Ford's traditional pickup trucks, and his distaste for the vehicles spawned the Cybertruck, according to the billionaire's biographer, Walter Isaacson.\n\nIsaacson says, \"He's sitting there with his design chief Franz von Holzhausen and looking at a Ford truck, and he said, 'No, these things are boring.\"\n\nIsaacson added. \"And everybody's pushing back on him at this meeting. He (Musk) finally says, 'Yeah, stop it. We're gonna do it. We're gonna make it edgy.\"\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAre you considering purchasing a Tesla Cybertruck or a more traditional EV?

            "content": "Elon Musk has shared when he expects to take Starship to Mars for its first uncrewed mission, and he also says Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robot will be on board for the flight.\n\nOn Friday, Musk wrote on X that SpaceX\u2019s reusable Starship rocket will take Optimus to Mars at the end of 2026, with human landings expected to commence a few years later.\n\n\u201cStarship departs for Mars at the end of next year, carrying Optimus,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIf those landings go well, then human landings may start as soon as 2029, although 2031 is more likely.\u201d\n\nHold on \u2014 Tesla Optimus (@Tesla_Optimus) March 15, 2025\n\nLast year, the SpaceX and Tesla head also expectations that SpaceX would be able to begin uncrewed launches in 2016, with early launches including both Optimus and a Cybertruck unit.\n\nMusk also followed up the announcement with a post on X on Saturday morning, noting that he expects SpaceX to launch more than 90 percent of Earth\u2019s payload mass to orbit this year. Meanwhile, he says China will make up just around 5 percent, while the rest of the world, including other parts of America, would also make up just 5 percent.\n\nHe also predicted that that number would go up even further to nearly 100 percent, once SpaceX\u2019s reusable rocket is being launched more frequently.\n\n\u201cWhen Starship is launching at high rate, SpaceX will probably carry >99 percent of Earth\u2019s payload mass to orbit. This is necessary to make Mars a self-sustaining civilization,\u201d Musk added.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT SPACEX\u2019S STARSHIP: Texas awards SpaceX $17.3M grant to expand Bastrop tech hub\n\nTo be sure, Musk has been known to make ambitious claims about when his companies\u2019 products would achieve certain milestones. For example, Musk predicted in 2018 that SpaceX could launch a rocket to Mars with humans aboard by 2024, though SpaceX only began testing the company\u2019s reusable Starship in 2023.\n\nStill, the company has been routinely testing Starship since then, and with increasing frequency, and in October, SpaceX performed the first catch of the Starship\u2019s Super Heavy booster after liftoff to demonstrate the concept that a reusable rocket could be possible. In a launch earlier this month, SpaceX again successfully caught the Super Heavy Booster, though it lost the upper stage to a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d effectively meaning that it had exploded in air and showered surrounding areas with rocket parts.\n\nThe explosion was the second consecutive launch in which debris from Starship reigned down, highlighting the continued importance of testing as SpaceX aims to make the rocket a viable product for reusable space travel.\n\nOn Friday, SpaceX also launched its Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) to rescue astronauts that have been stuck on the orbital craft, after a Boeing launch was originally intended to bring them back to Earth. While SpaceX attempted to rescue the two astronauts in September, issues with the Starliner craft\u2019s thrusters discovered upon arrival made NASA hold off on approving the return mission.",

            "content": "After it reported fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday night, Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) investors weren't sure how to react. Shares bounced around yesterday before ultimately closing about 3% higher. That positive momentum continued today, and it wasn't solely from investors digesting those results.\n\nThe stock jumped as much as another 5% today and was still trading 2.6% higher at 2:35 p.m. ET.\n\nThe tariff quandary\n\nReactions to Tesla's fourth-quarter financial results were mixed. Competition and slowing demand growth led to lower vehicle pricing, which resulted in sales and earnings missing expectations.\n\nBut the stock rose anyway as eyes turned more toward the progress with Tesla's self-driving software and the new products that could follow this year. In the investor conference call, CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch unsupervised self-driving electric vehicles (EVs) as a paid service for the first time this June. It will initially be limited to Austin, Texas, but that's big news for shareholders. The company said it can then quickly launch the service in many other locations if all goes well.\n\nBut today's stock jump also comes for another reason. Reports that the Trump administration will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico beginning tomorrow are rattling many North American automakers. Auto giants like General Motors and Ford have production plants in both countries outside the U.S. Auto parts also flow back and forth as the supply chain supports vehicle production.\n\nBut Tesla supplies its U.S. customers from manufacturing plants in California and Texas. That could mean that some market share it has ceded to other automakers returns. Or at least its vehicles could become more competitive in price as tariff costs are passed on to consumers.\n\nCNBC reports that factories in Canada and Mexico produce about 4 million vehicles annually destined for the U.S. But none are from Tesla. Now, Tesla's domestic competitors might see tariffs imposed on imported parts for EVs from those countries. Those automakers will have to decide whether to accept higher losses on EVs or increase vehicle prices. Either way, it would benefit Tesla.",

Read our privacy policy\n\nOn the 21st November 2019, I was in Los Angeles for the LA auto show when I got a surprise call from Elon Musk\u2019s office: would I like to go to the launch of the Cybertruck at Space X HQ? Oh, and the dress code is cyber punk.\n\nWell, that was worth rearranging a flight for, so I donned my best mysterious black gear and went along. I was warned by a fellow punkster when I turned up that it would be unlike any car launch I\u2019d ever been to \u2013 and it was. There were only a handful of media there, the rest of the crowd was made up of owners and fans \u2013 including some from the UK \u2013 and yes, as they had warned, middle aged men shouted out \u201cI love you, Elon,\u201d when the boss walked out on stage.\n\nI remember when the car drove on and thinking that it must be a joke \u2013 a stainless steel, angular monstrosity couldn\u2019t be the real Cybertruck, could it? It could, and it was.\n\nopen image in gallery Elon Musk launches the Tesla Cybertruck and smashes the unbreakable glass ( Steve Fowler )\n\nIt was supposed to be indestructible, until the famous sledgehammer incident that smashed the unsmashable glass. The rest is history.\n\nI eventually went back to my hotel, still buzzing, logged on to the Tesla website and immediately put a \u00a3100 deposit on a Cybertruck. I was hooked. My order still stands to this day, although I suspect we\u2019re no nearer to ever seeing the Cybertruck on sale on this side of the Atlantic.\n\nNow, five years on, I\u2019m back in LA and planning to drive a Cybertruck. Sadly, I\u2019d left my wallet back at home with my UK driving licence in it, so despite my booking and having my international driving permit with me, Turo would not loan me a car.\n\nPlan B. There\u2019s a Tesla store down the road in Pasadena\u2026 Would they? Apparently, an international driving permit is just fine, so my new friend Mike closed the store, took me into the dingiest alley at the back and into a car park where a somewhat dishevelled Cybertruck was waiting for me.\n\nOur EV editor Steve Fowler was at the Tesla Cybertruck launch in 2019 - and ordered one!\n\nMy first impression, other than how dirty the stainless-steel bodywork can get with finger marks all too apparent around the doors, was that it looked smaller than before. This wasn\u2019t going to be the challenge I thought it might be just to leave the parking lot.\n\nGetting into the Cybertruck takes practice: there\u2019s the usual waving of the Tesla key card at the side of the door pillar, then you must thumb an area below to release the door. If you manage it first time, you\u2019re a genius.\n\nGetting up into the truck (it\u2019s not a car, remember) isn\u2019t the exercise I was expecting, either. Air suspension will raise the Cybertruck for off-road work or lower it to get in and out \u2013 and the lowest setting makes it no worse than a large SUV to climb into.\n\nSitting in the Cybertruck is a tale of two halves: the front half is easy and like any other Tesla. You can\u2019t see the end of the bonnet (or hood as Mike called it) but the windscreen is deep and the door mirrors large. Simple.\n\nLook in the rear-view mirror and behind the spacious rear cabin is a window with a great view rearward. Behind that \u2013 like in all pick-ups \u2013 is a long load bed with a powered, retractable cover. It\u2019s long back there \u2013 and that\u2019s when you realise this is a near 5.7-meter-long vehicle that\u2019s also two metres wide.\n\nopen image in gallery Tesla Cybertruck ready for our test drive in Pasadena ( Steve Fowler )\n\nAs you\u2019d hope, there\u2019s loads of space for five inside, with lots of storage including the usual deep bins in between the front seats, cupholders and twin wireless phone chargers. And as well as the huge pick-up bed at the back, there\u2019s a big frunk at the front, which is accessed by the whole front of the truck \u2013 including the LED light strip \u2013 hinging upwards.\n\nThe dash looks like any other Tesla with no sign of any air vents, they\u2019re hidden in full-width slots, while a big touchscreen sits in the middle. It\u2019s bigger than in other Teslas at 18.5-inches but works just like the one in the new Model 3 (and like the Model 3 there\u2019s a second screen \u2013 this time 9.4-inches \u2013 for those in the back too play with).\n\nThat means you must put your foot on the brake to power up the Cybertruck and slide a button on the touchscreen forward into drive to move off.\n\nOh, and there are no stalks, just like in the Model 3. Indicators are buttons on the left side of the small, rectangular steering wheel, with everything else taken care of by a combination of the touchscreen, voice control or two scroll wheels on the steering wheel.\n\nopen image in gallery Tesla Cybertruck is 5,682mm long ( Steve Fowler )\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, it takes a while to get used to in the Model 3, but the Cybertruck is different, and that\u2019s mostly due to the steering.\n\nBefore we\u2019d got into the car, Mike had warned me about the steer-by-wire steering, which I was reassured to know had fail safes. The steering, Mike told me, was rather quick.\n\nAnd so it was, with just a tiny turn of the wheel as we moved forward enough to pull the Cybertruck around the car next to it \u2013 rear-wheel steering helps to make the big truck feel far wieldier than its dimensions suggest.\n\nThe super-fast steering also means that you\u2019re never likely to have to turn the steering more than a quarter of a turn in most manoeuvres \u2013 the joy of steer-by-wire. It also means that those indicator buttons are easier to get your head around as you\u2019re never going to have to work out which one to press with the steering wheel upside down.\n\nIt all becomes very intuitive very quickly, and just like driving any other Tesla with a quick squirt of power you can dart in and out of traffic and up onto the freeway.\n\nopen image in gallery We visited the Tesla store in Pasadena, California for our Cybertruck test drive ( Steve Fowler )\n\nJust like any other Tesla, the ride is just about on the comfortable side of firm \u2013 less bouncy than many rival petrol-powered trucks \u2013 while there are a few creaks from around the cabin, which is another Tesla trait.\n\nMy test car is the Cybertruck All-Wheel Drive that costs $79,990 (\u00a363,000), whizzes from 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds and claims a maximum range judged by the US EPA standard of 318 miles from the huge 123kWh battery. The only other model currently available is the Cyberbeast at $99,990 (\u00a379,100), with three motors rather than the All-Wheel Drive\u2019s two, meaning an increase in performance from 0-60mph in 2.6 seconds and a decrease in range to 301 miles.\n\nOut on the freeway, my life was about to change with my first experience of Tesla\u2019s full self-driving mode, which Mike was eager to demonstrate. Once he\u2019d put a route into the navigation \u2013 and it was clear we were going way beyond our allotted 20-minute slot \u2013 I hit the scroll wheel and the car took over.\n\nOfficially full self-driving is still in beta and US law states that the driver must remain in control and ready to take over in a split second; the car even watches your eyes and will warn you to hold the steering wheel if you\u2019re gaze wanders too long to the touchscreen or elsewhere.\n\nopen image in gallery Tesla Full Self-Driving took care of most of our test drive ( Steve Fowler )\n\nI\u2019m a fan of adaptive cruise control where your car will stay in its lane, keep a set distance from the car in front doing the steering and braking for you and changing lanes on some cars. That\u2019s about as autonomous as you can get in the UK these days.\n\nFull self-driving is another level, allowing the Cybertruck to do all that on the freeway plus it will take the exit, slow down, stop at the stop sign, indicate, and turn across the traffic when there\u2019s an appropriate space.\n\nWe\u2019re now cruising through Pasadena, stopping at red lights, automatically starting again, ebbing and flowing with the rest of the traffic and taking turns after instruction from the navigation system.\n\nThen we move into a left-hand lane, stop again at the traffic lights, move off on green to go across a lane of oncoming traffic, speed up as we go around a bend, indicate and merge onto another freeway. But the Cybertruck doesn\u2019t just want to stay in the inside lane, it indicates and pulls into the next lane when it spots a gap, using the Tesla\u2019s acceleration to good effect.\n\nopen image in gallery Tesla Full Self-Driving drove us through the streets of Pasadena and on the freeway ( Steve Fowler )\n\nOff the freeway again at the next off-ramp, which Mike said the Cybertruck didn\u2019t do last time he was there \u2013 it\u2019s learning and updating all the time \u2013 through some more traffic and, eventually, back to the parking lot at the back of the Tesla store where I must take over to park up. Again, that rear-wheel steering makes it easy to get around some tight spaces. It was nice to know I still had a role \u2013 although further updates are likely to park the car, too. And there was I thinking it was me who was supposed to be taking the test drive, not the car.\n\nSo, how did I feel with Tesla\u2019s full self-driving doing the work? I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I was a bit nervous at first, but eventually I just sat there open-mouthed at the incredible experience that worked seamlessly. It is fantastic.\n\nOf course, Elon Musk\u2019s vision is that Tesla will make Robotaxis and Robovans to transport people around eventually, while owners\u2019 Cybertrucks and Tesla cars will also have full self-drive capability and can be put to work when the owners aren\u2019t using them.\n\nHaving experienced full self-driving for the first time it doesn\u2019t feel that far off. As Mike said, it\u2019s learning and improving all the time, and already can take the edge off tiring and tedious drives.\n\nopen image in gallery We enjoyed our Tesla Cybertruck test drive so much we went for another one in Scottsdale, Arizona ( Steve Fowler )\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the Cybertruck isn\u2019t an experience to drive. It\u2019s another Tesla that just makes you smile, from the way it looks, the technology inside and the way it drives.\n\nIn fact, I loved it so much that when I was staying with my US folks in Scottsdale, Arizona a few days later, we took another test drive and they were so impressed there could be another Cybertruck order in the offing.\n\nI\u2019ve no pretensions about the Cybertruck coming to the UK and my deposit coming good. As much as the Cybertruck feels at home on the US streets, its size will make it tricky in the UK \u2013 it\u2019s bigger than a Range Rover. But if I lived in the US and I had the money, I\u2019d have a Cybertruck in a heartbeat. It made me smile, and cars that make you smile are still a very good thing.",

The company was able to book these bitcoin-derived profits due to a change in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidelines for crypto assets.\n\nWhat The New Rule Means For Bitcoin-Owning Companies\n\nThe new rules or ASU 2023-08 allow companies with bitcoin holdings to account for its value on a mark-to-market basis or depending on where it's trading at in the markets.\n\n\"The primary advantage of the FASB\u2019s new rules concerning the new mark-to-market rule for corporate digital asset holdings are that it will allow companies to provide the value of their digital assets in real time,\" Miller & Company LLP Managing Partner & CPA Paul Miller told Investopedia.\n\nUnder previous FASB guidelines, bitcoin was treated as an \u201cindefinite-lived intangible asset,\u201d forcing companies to write down its value when prices dropped but preventing them from recording gains unless the asset was sold.\n\nThe old system frustrated MicroStrategy\u2019s founder, Michael Saylor, who argued it got in the way of adoption of bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset.\n\n\n\nWhy MicroStrategy May Land a Huge Tax Bill\n\nBitcoin's been on a tear last year and remains strong well into this year. Based on the new rules, MicroStrategy's bitcoin buying spree has left it with roughly $18 billion in unrealized bitcoin gains, The Wall Street Journal reported recently. That could create a tax bill worth billions for MicroStrategy.\n\nThis reclassification of crypto assets on its books has made MicroStrategy potentially vulnerable to a 15% tax on unrealized bitcoin gains under the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT). That means the company could face taxes on these gains starting 2026, even without selling a single coin\u2014a risk it acknowledged in a recent regulatory filing.\n\n\"As a result of the enactment of the IRA and our adoption of ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2025, unless the proposed regulations with respect to CAMT are revised to provide relief, we could become subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in the tax years 2026 and beyond,\" MicroStrategy said.\n\nAlthough MicroStrategy remains one of the biggest corporate bitcoin owners, other listed companies, such as Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), Semler Scientific (SMLR), are following its bitcoin buying playbook and could be affected by this rule change.",

On the earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that paid, unsupervised FSD (Full Self-Driving) is coming to Austin, Texas, in June.\n\nShares in the electric vehicle maker jumped nearly 4% in early trading on Thursday.\n\n\"With Unsupervised FSD expected to be available throughout the US by the end of 2025 and the rest of the world by the end of 2026 this will be a focus of the bulls,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Thursday morning.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $25.7 billion, well short of the $27.2 billion expected by analysts and up just 2% from a year ago. For the full year 2024, revenue rose 1% to $97.7 billion.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share came in at $0.73, less than the $0.75 Wall Street analysts were forecasting, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nOperating income totaled $1.58 billion, down 23% from last year, while adjusted net income rose 3% to $2.6 billion.\n\nTesla said its operating income was negatively impacted by costs associated with artificial intelligence and other R&D projects, as well as lower average selling prices for its current vehicles.\n\nIn its shareholder presentation, Tesla said it expects its auto business to return to growth in 2025 after total auto revenues fell 8% in the fourth quarter compared to last year and 6% in 2024 compared to 2023. Total auto production fell 7% in the fourth quarter while deliveries rose 2%.\n\n\"In terms of both growth and profitability, results missed consensus expectations and the outlook was relatively lacking in detail \u2014 calling for a 'return to growth' for the vehicle business (vs. consensus expectation for low teens YoY growth),\" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote after the earnings were released. \"There was no reference to Elon Musk's prior mention of 20% to 30% volume growth for 2025.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 495,930 vehicles globally in 2024, missing analyst estimates of around 510,400. In 2024, Tesla delivered 1.78 million vehicles, a 1% drop from the prior year and marking the company's first year-over-year decline, suggesting new competition, demand, and global economic conditions may be hurting the company.\n\nTesla said in a Thursday filing that it expects capital spending to surpass $11 billion this year and in the next two fiscal years.\n\nIn October, the company had projected spending between $8 billion and $10 billion in 2026.",

Over the past three years, the Elon Musk-led company reports $10.8 billion of U.S. income on which its current federal tax was just $48 million.

The company expects storage deployments will grow at least 50% this year.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible,\u201d Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during an analyst conference call.\n\nGross profit at Tesla\u2019s energy generation and storage segment increased to $2.6 billion in 2024 from $1.1 billion the year before as revenue climbed 67% to $10.1 billion from $6 billion in the same period, according to Tesla.\n\nThe segment\u2019s profit margin grew to 26.2% in 2024, up from 18.9% in 2023, driven by cost reductions, including benefits from Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, Tesla said. Revenue from the tax credits soared to $756 million last year from $115 million in 2023.\n\nMusk is bullish on energy storage. \u201cIt is something that enables far greater energy output to the grid than is currently possible,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThis will drive the demand of stationary battery packs, and especially the grid scale ones, to insane [levels], basically as much demand as we could possibly make.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tesla said its Powerwall and Megapack production is supply constrained as the company enters new markets and demand for energy storage products continues to grow.\n\nAs part of its market risk disclosures, Tesla warned investors that its solar and storage business faces risks from changes in governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives.\n\n\u201cThese incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning,\u201d Tesla said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday. \u201cLikewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use.\u201d\n\nOverall, Tesla\u2019s net income plunged to $7.1 billion in 2024 from $15 billion the year earlier. Not counting certain one-time items, its income fell to $8.4 billion last year from $10.9 billion in 2023.\n\nTesla\u2019s revenue inched up to $97.7 billion last year from $96.8 billion in 2023.\n\nTesla\u2019s fourth-quarter results were \u201cmostly disappointing, but not particularly narrative changing,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts said Thursday. \u201cTesla's 4Q results are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics.\u201d",

Cory and I have this mutual friend, a Tesla Model 3 owner, who\u2019s looking to dump it as soon as possible. But so far, nothing\u2019s doing it for him, even that EV6. \u201cHe said it felt just too big and bulky behind the wheel.\u201d\n\nOur friend is an EV convert who went from a Golf hatchback to a Bolt EV, and now a Model 3. However, he, like the two of us, was mortified at Elon Musk\u2019s not-a-sieg-heil-but-actually-was a-sieg-heil at President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Thus, he decided that it was time for his Model 3 sedan to go. He likes the Tesla, but this latest stunt crossed a line, and now he feels gross every time he drives his car.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nHe\u2019s been having a hard time finding a suitable replacement. \u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends buy front-wheel-drive Polestars,\u201d I said in response to a listing for a suspiciously cheap used early-generation Polestar 2. I guess it could have been okay, but I didn\u2019t want him to end up with a weird and basic trim of the Polestar only be stuck with a car that no one wants if he decided somewhere down the line that he hated it.\n\nThe rest of the search went predictably bad. His search went both used and new; if it was new, it was going to be one of the competitive lease deals that turned ICE drivers into EV owners. Otherwise, it would have been a used car, since the pricing of used EVs is so low. His search wasn\u2019t going well. The Nissan Ariya felt too middling to be a replacement for the Model 3. The Mustang Mach-E was too pricy. The Volkswagen ID.4 made sense as a lease deal, but the range on Volkwagen\u2019s $149-a-month special was too low for him. Also, I had learned from a VW salesman the week prior on a personal visit, that it didn\u2019t really exist on any dealership lots. Practically every eligible unit for the dirt cheap ID.4 lease was sold the weekend the special was announced.\n\nMy friend\u2019s shopping woes, coupled with my own inability to find an EV I would like to spend money on, are why I\u2019ve spent the past two weeks worried about the future of the market. Maybe I spent too much time in China last year, driving EVs that feel five to 10 years ahead of ours. But I think that EV drivers looking to move on from Tesla\u2014and there seem to be a lot of them\u2014face a conundrum about what to get next without compromising on range, charging or software.\n\nTo be clear, there are certainly good EVs in the U.S. market right now. Even great ones. But many of those are crazy expensive. And as the American auto industry starts to waffle on EVs with the Trump administration\u2019s rules coming in, it\u2019s hard to see who\u2019s advancing fast enough to keep ex-Tesla owners from going back to gas cars.\n\nTesla\u2019s models make up the bulk of sales in the U.S. EV market, yet as drivers pivot away, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll find what they\u2019re looking for elsewhere. If these folks leave Tesla, where the hell will they go? The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y have hit a real sweet spot among EV buyers and drivers. I don't think regular brands have done the same. Thus, I am worried that as buyers get fed up with Musk and want to jump ship, there won\u2019t be a ship to jump to.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs\n\n\n\nNow, I know the Model 3 and Model Y aren\u2019t perfect. Both the ride quality and fit and finish on pre-facelift models are terrible. The two cars often get a lot of hype for their Autopilot and Full Self-Driving tech, to sometimes gristly consequences; it\u2019s not even a true eyes-off, hands-off semi-autonomous driving system. There are no physical rear door handles for the interior, there is a shocking lack of buttons on the car\u2019s interior, and they\u2019re notoriously expensive to insure because of how they\u2019re made and how annoying it is to get replacement parts or a mechanic that\u2019s certified to repair the vehicle.\n\nAnd yet, it\u2019s consistently sat at the top of the sales charts, despite being electric. The Model Y and Model 3 have sat on top 10 lists for a long time. Some would argue that it\u2019s because of the Tesla Supercharger network, but I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s actually the cars themselves. (Or even how seamlessly they work with that charging network.) It\u2019s easy to hate Tesla, but people get lost in the discourse over the CEO and forget why people buy these things to begin with.\n\nThe cars are kind of likable. And there\u2019s still a lot they do better than other EVs out there. Try a Tesla smartphone app and then try the one for the Kia EV6. You\u2019ll feel like you traveled back in time.\n\nThe Model 3 and Model Y clearly were meant to be somewhat premium entries, competitors to cars like the BMW 3-Series and X3. Whether or not you think they match that level of refinement (I don\u2019t), I\u2019d argue they dynamically match or better the BMWs. They accelerate as quickly as a sporty ICE premium compact and have direct and communicative steering up there with some of the best sports cars I\u2019ve driven in recent memory. The two aren\u2019t physically large cars, but they don\u2019t feel dinky, either, slotting right in the perfect space between compact and midsized.\n\nThe central-mounted screen is responsive and feature-packed. They have integration with Apple Music and Spotify as well as AAA-level video games, all baked into the car itself. This is all sold through a no-haggle direct-to-consumer network for a reasonable monthly price. Some of these things may not be your or my cup of tea, but they are big reasons why consumers choose Tesla products. On the used market, the Model 3 and Model Y are some of the best deal-per-dollar things on the market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss a lot about that car,\u201d said a different friend of mine, Shane. This person, also outraged by Musk\u2019s antics, dumped his Model 3 for a used gas-powered Porsche Macan. He liked the Tesla\u2019s software. The Model 3\u2019s generally brilliant route planning and seamless charging scheduling were ace. It drove great, and the car was quick and handled well. It handled so well, he struggled to find a replacement that matched the level of dynamic ability and convenience.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs\n\nHe tried a Honda Prologue. The price was right, but the driving experience was uninspiring. The Volvo XC40 Recharge was better, but he didn\u2019t like that car\u2019s older software or squishy brakes. Everything else was just too expensive.\n\nSure, two anecdotes don\u2019t necessarily make a trend. We\u2019ve got a whole list of Tesla alternatives here at InsideEVs, and the EV market still continues to grow amongst non-Tesla competitors. But the truly better stuff is still in the ultra-luxury price bracket.\n\nA Rivian R1 or Lucid Air may offer a similar software experience, but both cars are far larger and more expensive. They might be good Model S or Model X alternatives, but the $30,000 price delta won\u2019t sway a Model 3 or Model Y owner.\n\nHyundai, Kia and General Motors do make solid alternatives, as evidenced by the three entities occupying second and third place in U.S. EV sales. But, right now, neither brand\u2019s software stack can\u2019t hold a candle to Tesla\u2019s. For some, this will be a positive, but I suspect that the buyer who loves the hyperconnected tablet-style layout will feel like they\u2019re going backward.\n\nSales of other EVs in the segment are low-key a rounding error, or the products are just too expensive. I question if some are truly selling on desire for their EV experience, or a desire to get a reasonably priced car that isn\u2019t even all that reasonably priced.\n\nIn countries outside of the U.S., buyers are free to navigate to one of the many competitors that are at least cheaper. Or they can buy a Chinese brand like BYD, MG or Zeekr that follows the Tesla formula a little closer. If you\u2019re in the U.S. or Canada, you can\u2019t buy those cars. That\u2019s really bad.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs Zeekr Mix\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m a pessimist, but things don\u2019t feel great. Earlier this year, the market felt precarious, as everyone waited with bated breath as to what the Trump administration would bring. EV subsidies and investment on the federal level were on the chopping block, but there were still plans that more brands were on their way to introducing reasonably priced, affordable EV choices, namely to fight off global Chinese influence.\n\nNow, everything\u2019s up in the air. The Trump administration\u2019s charging grant freeze and attack on EVs (and vehicle manufacturing in general) feels meaner, stronger and more nonsensical than anyone predicted; even brands that metaphorically kissed the ring at Mar-a-Lago are openly decrying these proposed tariffs and rollbacks that stand to hurt their entire business.\n\nOn the other hand, other companies like Stellantis are plenty happy to throw down their EV ball and go right back to slinging not-so-good ICE cars. They\u2019ll let the \u201cmarket\u201d sort out their slower jog to electrification now, at least until some more advanced startup or other company\u2019s breakthrough renders them even more irrelevant. To assume that Trump\u2019s reversal of Biden\u2019s pro-EV policies won\u2019t affect sales and car development at all is a fantasy. And it\u2019s also a fantasy to think that a lot of people aren\u2019t moving on from Tesla because of Musk. They may well just throw in the towel on EVs, period, and that\u2019s not good for this sector as a whole.\n\nPolestar\u2019s new CEO seems to get this. He\u2019s openly targeting disgruntled ex-Tesla owners. While Polestar\u2019s lineup isn\u2019t exactly some one-to-one replacement for the Model 3 and Model Y\u2014far from it, in fact\u2014this is a smart move. If there\u2019s a vacuum, you move in to fill it. You might even liken that to how people flocked to Bluesky and Threads after Musk took over X and flushed it down the tubes; where\u2019s the EV equivalent of that?\n\nI suppose there is a glimmer of hope. Honda\u2019s working on a self-developed EV platform and operating system that seems way more advanced than what\u2019s being used in their current ICE or EV cars. Volkswagen is tapping into Rivian specifically for better software. Some experts say that the OGs of emulating and beating Tesla, the Chinese, could have a few models on sale in the U.S. in the near future, tariffs be damned.\n\nMore models are coming, but if they\u2019re looking to take up the disgruntled Tesla owners who loved their software-driven electric cars, then automakers need to hurry up and introduce something new, and fast.\n\nContact the author: Kevin.Williams@InsideEVs.com\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla paid a total of $0 in federal income taxes in 2024, new tax reports show, despite the company having raked in billions of dollars in income and being the most valuable car company in the world.\n\nCiting Tesla\u2019s year-end financial report released this week, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) reports that Tesla paid a 0 percent federal income tax rate last year, even as the company reported $2.3 billion in income.\n\nIn 2023, Tesla paid $48 million in taxes on $3.1 billion in income \u2014 a 1.5 percent rate. And, in 2022, when it reported $5.5 billion in income, Tesla also paid a 0 percent tax rate.\n\nThis brings Tesla\u2019s average tax rate over the past three years to 0.4 percent, or 50 times less than the statutory corporate tax rate of 21 percent.\n\nThis is despite the fact that Tesla is valued at over $1.2 trillion and is owned by the richest man in the world, with a net worth of over $400 billion and who was awarded a $101 billion pay package by Tesla shareholders last year \u2014 though this package has been rejected by a judge.\n\nDue to the nature of the U.S. tax system, which heavily favors corporations and the wealthy and enables sophisticated tax dodging methods, Musk is also one of the many ultrarich Americans who pay a far lower tax rate than the average American. Advocates for fairer taxation have said that, due to the way that tax law is written and enforced, it is essentially optional for Musk and other billionaires to follow tax guidelines, allowing them to hoard more and more wealth while the working class struggles to get by.\n\nAccording to ITEP, Tesla was able to avoid paying $500 million in taxes by using accelerated depreciation, a tax avoidance method and incentive for businesses which allows companies to write off the costs of an asset faster than it would normally actually lose value. The company dodged another $300 million in its tax bill by claiming \u201cunspecified \u2018U.S. tax credits,\u2019\u201d ITEP said.\n\nCompanies\u2019 ability to use accelerated depreciation as a tax avoidance method was expanded by Donald Trump and Republicans\u2019 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent and has supercharged the growth of the wealth gap in the U.S., creating an explosion of wealth for the richest Americans.\n\nTrump and the GOP have pledged to be extremely friendly to corporations in Trump\u2019s second term in office. The president campaigned on tax cuts across the board \u2014 but research has found that his tax plans would actually raise taxes for the working class while cutting taxes for the top 5 percent richest Americans.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are reportedly circulating options to expand the already massive tax benefits given to corporations and the wealthy in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 options that include slashing benefits for working class Americans in order to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. This could give massive corporations like Tesla yet more tax cuts.\n\nITEP points out that there are also bipartisan proposals to give corporations more tax dodging tools, like a compromise bill proposed in the Senate last year that would, among other things, retroactively give companies the ability to receive a tax break on supposed research \u2014 though the bill gives an extremely wide definition of what a company could qualify as research.\n\nUnlike mainstream media, we\u2019re not capitulating to Trump. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. At Truthout, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won\u2019t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests.

            "content": "A Tesla driver in Torrance was killed after a crash Tuesday, with police unable to rescue the motorist due to the intense lithium ion battery blaze.\n\nA driver in Torrance is dead after police say they were unable to save the person from their Tesla because of its burning lithium ion battery.\n\nTorrance police responded to a single-vehicle collision involving a Tesla at the intersection of Madrona Avenue and Plaza Del Amo on Tuesday at about 10:15 p.m., according to a Police Department news release.\n\nA 2025 Tesla Model Y was southbound on Madrona Avenue when, for unknown reasons, the electric car swerved to the right, collided with a traffic pole and caught fire with the driver trapped inside, authorities said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficers tried to get into the vehicle to save the driver, but, \u201cdue to the intensity of the flames and heat, they were unable to rescue the occupant,\u201d the department said.\n\nThe fight to put out the fire was then further complicated by \u201cchallenges associated with the vehicle\u2019s lithium-ion batteries,\u201d officials said.\n\nThe driver, who was the only occupant, was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe incident is the latest example of the safety risks emergency crews can face when responding to incidents that involve high-voltage lithium ion batteries that power electric vehicles, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report published in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat risks do lithium ion batteries pose for first responders?\n\nDepending on the severity of the crash, an electric vehicle\u2019s high-voltage, lithium ion battery could be at risk of being damaged, catching fire or delivering an electric shock to anyone who touches it.\n\nAccording to the study, when a lithium ion battery is damaged, there is a risk of thermal runaway \u2014 when temperatures and pressures in damaged battery cells increase uncontrollably and the battery can end up venting and igniting toxic gases and exploding.\n\nThere\u2019s also the risk of dangerous electric shock because the vehicles rely on much more electric power than the body can withstand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf a crash damages the electrical isolation system, a person who touches the vehicle\u201d or an exposed connector can be shocked and suffer serious injury or death, the report stated. If there is leftover energy in the battery and the battery is damaged, that can also provide a shock or reignite a fire.\n\nCalifornia Electric vehicle fire forces evacuations in Ojai A fire in the battery of a hybrid electric vehicle forced the evacuation of several dozen homes in Ojai on Saturday.\n\nAs part of its study, the National Transportation Safety Board reviewed three electric vehicle crashes that resulted in fires and one non-crash fire involving an internal battery failure and analyzed the risks for emergency responders. Three of the incidents occurred in California \u2014 Lake Forest, Mountain View and Hollywood.\n\nIn the Lake Forest crash, a 2016 Tesla Model X reignited three times (twice where it had crashed and once at the tow yard) even though first responders had poured water on it and suppressed the fire.\n\nAre there protocols in place for these risks?\n\nYes.\n\nCalifornia \u2018Horrifying\u2019 fire at California lithium battery plant sparks calls for new clean energy rules When a massive fire erupted at one of the world\u2019s largest lithium-ion battery storage facilities in Monterey County, it didn\u2019t just send a toxic plume of smoke over nearby communities \u2014 it cast a shadow of doubt over the future of California\u2019s clean energy industry.\n\nIn 2011, the NTSB began working with the National Fire Protection Assn. to assist first responders, such as firefighters, and second responders, such as tow operators, in handling lithium ion batteries after a crash. The partnership included electric and hybrid vehicle manufacturers and called on the group to develop post-crash protocols for dealing with vehicles powered by such batteries, the report stated.\n\nIn 2015, the National Fire Protection Assn. began publishing emergency field guides for alternative fuel vehicles as part of its safety training program. The association has 70 vehicle manufacturer guides on its website.\n\nThe basic guidelines for first responders include:\n\n",

Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nTesla reported earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter that missed analysts' estimates. The stock initially fell in after-hours trading before rebounding. Here is how the company did compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG: Earnings per share: 73 cents adjusted vs. 76 cents expected\n\n73 cents adjusted vs. 76 cents expected Revenue: $25.71 billion vs. $27.26 billion expected Tesla's revenue increased just 2% from $25.17 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue fell 8% to $19.8 billion from $21.56 billion in the same quarter last year, and of that, $692 million came from regulatory credits. Operating income declined 23% year over year to $1.6 billion. The company cited reduced average selling prices across its Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X lines as a major reason for the decline. Net income dropped 71% from a year earlier to $2.32 billion, or 66 cents a share, from $7.93 billion, or $2.27 a share. Last year's net income figure was bolstered by a $5.9 billion one-time noncash tax benefit.\n\nTesla's earnings report follows a steep rally in the company's stock price tied to the election of President Donald Trump. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was the biggest backer of Trump's campaign efforts and is now leading the president's new government efficiency advisory board. The company's stock price has rallied sharply since Trump's victory in November as investors bet that Musk's influence would lead to both favorable policies and less oversight of his companies. Operating margin for the quarter came in at 6.2%, narrowing from 8.2% during the same period a year earlier and 10.8% in the previous quarter. In early January, Tesla reported deliveries for the fourth quarter of 495,570. For the full year, deliveries came in at about 1.8 million, marking the company's first annual decline. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.\n\nHefty discounts\n\nTo end 2024, Tesla offered a range of discounts on inventory vehicles and special discounts for buyers in North America who were referred by another Tesla customer. In China, Tesla cut prices on its popular Model Y SUVs before debuting a refreshed version, the Model Y Juniper. In its shareholder deck on Wednesday, Tesla noted that \"affordability remains top of mind for customers.\" The company said it intends to \"review every aspect\" of its cost of goods sold per vehicle to help make its EVs affordable.\n\nMusk has been telling investors in recent quarters to focus less on the core business as it exists today and more on a future of autonomy and robotics. In October, Tesla drummed up excitement among fans by showing off an early prototype version of a Cybercab at its \"We, Robot\" event. However, Tesla still does not produce robotaxis. Instead, the company sells a premium version of its partially automated driving system called FSD, short for Full Self-Driving (Supervised). Meanwhile, Google's Waymo has a growing commercial robotaxi offering in some U.S. markets, and China's WeRide and Pony.ai are testing and commercially operating driverless ride-hailing services. While Tesla did not give specific guidance for this year, the company said, \"we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.\" It also reiterated plans to \"unlock an unsupervised FSD option\" eventually and said it expects to \"begin launching\" its driverless ride-hailing business \"later this year in parts of the U.S.\" Musk said in the opening remarks of Tesla's earnings call that the company would be \"launching unsupervised Full Self-Driving as a paid service\" in Austin in June. \"We already have Teslas operating autonomously at our factory in Fremont and will soon be doing that at our factory in Texas,\" Musk said. Musk acknowledged that he has made big self-driving promises and predictions that have not come through for many years. He said, with a laugh, \"I'm telling you there's a d--- wolf this time. And you can drive it. In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf!\" Musk added later in the call that Tesla will \"look to release Unsupervised FSD in many regions\" of the U.S. by the end of this year. He said there is \"significant interest\" from \"a number of major car companies about licensing\" the technology, but without providing any names or offering a timeline. The company uses online forum Say Technologies to solicit and choose investor questions for executives to answer on the calls. As of Tuesday, more than 100 inquiries had flooded in about Tesla's plans around autonomous vehicle technology. Additionally, many shareholders submitted questions about Musk's obligations at the White House, and about the effect of his political and public conduct on the company. Musk has recently made offensive jokes and gestures making light of the Holocaust, and has promoted Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant party AfD, or Alternative fur Deutschland, ahead of the country's elections in February. As reported earlier by CNBC, Tesla's brand value shed $15 billion in 2024, owing to multiple factors including the company's aging lineup of EVs, and Musk's incendiary political rhetoric and conduct, according to research by Brand Finance. Tesla's energy business fared much better in the quarter than its core automotive unit. The company reported energy generation and storage revenue of $3.06 billion for the three months that ended Dec. 31, 2024, up 113% from the same period in the prior year.

            "content": "Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted profits rose slightly amid a big push to sell its electric vehicles with offers of zero financing and other incentives, but the results still fell short of Wall Street forecasts.\n\nThe electric vehicle, battery and robotics company run by Elon Musk said Wednesday that quarterly net income adjusted for one-time items rose 3% to $2.6 billion, or 73 cents a share \u2014 less than analysts\u2019 estimate of 77 cents.\n\nTesla stock initially fell after trading closed Wednesday, then reversed course to rise more than 4% after Musk told analysts on a conference call that the company was on track to offer unsupervised \u201cfull self-driving\u201d technology to its customers as a paid service starting in Austin in June.\n\n\u201cIt went from a theoretical, \u2018We hope to launch something in 2025,\u2019 to a set timeline,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cThat\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d\n\nTesla has been losing market share in several countries as traditional car makers and other EV companies, such as China\u2019s BYD, offer customers alternatives. Its stock has surged nonetheless, rising by more than 50% since President Donald Trump was elected, on investor optimism that Musk\u2019s advisory role in the new administration will help the company.\n\nIn its letter to shareholders and on the analyst call, Tesla it was hoping to lift sales by driving the cost of its vehicles down, highlighting that one cost measure fell below $35,000, the lowest in its history. It said production of \u201cmore affordable\u201d models are expected to start in the first half of the year, with Musk emphasizing that \u201cmaximizing volume\u201d was priority.\n\nBut then he quickly pivoted in the conference call to other goals and parts of the business, and the stock started climbing.\n\n\u201cAI and robotics - that will bear immense fruit,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI see a path, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s an easy path, but I see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world \u2014 by far, not even close,\u201d leapfrogging the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Tesla is currently the seventh-most valuable company in the S&P 500 with a market value of $1.25 trillion.\n\nTesla\u2019s unadjusted profits for October through December period were down dramatically, though the year-earlier period was a poor comparison because the results included a large one-time tax benefit. The company said it made $2.31 billion last quarter, down 71% from the $7.93 billion profit in the same period in 2023.\n\nRevenue rose 2% to $25.7 billion, less than Wall Street\u2019s forecast of $27.1 billion, according to FactSet. Tesla offered a series of incentives during the quarter to drum up demand for its electric vehicles including low-interest loans and lower prices. Tesla\u2019s gross profit margin fell to 16.3% for the quarter, down 1.3 percentage points from a year earlier.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla said it sold 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, the first drop in more than a dozen years despite offers of 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. The fourth quarter showed signs of a rebound, though, with a record 495,570 vehicles sold.\n\n\u201cThe bulls got what they wanted, and the bears got data to support them as well,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a big fan of the stock. \u201cBut ultimately what will drive the stock is autonomous driving, and this is the bullish I\u2019ve ever heard Musk.\u201d\n\nFor the full year, Tesla posted profits before one-time items of $8.42 billion, down 23% from the year earlier.\n\nInvestors are expecting that Musk\u2019s close relationship with Trump will translate into lighter regulation on the car company, fewer investigations and help in speeding the development of autonomous driving.\n\nBut the Trump administration has also vowed to cut government incentives to customers to buy EVs and says it will loosen emission standards. The latter especially could hurt Tesla because it has a big business in selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers that fall short of the standards.\n\nThe latest financial report showed that in the fourth quarter Tesla sold $692 million in these credits, a spigot of cash that could be turned off if Trump follows through on his vow.",

Among other developments, Musk said the company plans to start using the unsupervised version of the self-driving software with Tesla vehicles at the company's Austin, Texas factory starting in June, with a broader public release possible this year.\n\nTesla said it expects vehicle sales, which fell in 2024 for the first time, to return to growth this year. The company also said its plans for a more affordable model are still on track to enter production in the first half of the year, though no official announcement has been made about what the more affordable Tesla will look like or cost.\n\nTesla shares rose 4% to around $405 in after-hours trading, after falling more than 2% during the regular session. The stock has more than doubled over the past 12 months, with much of that gain coming since the early-November presidential election amid hopes that Musk\u2019s close ties with President Donald Trump will directly benefit the automaker.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Tesla\u2019s chart and apply technical analysis to identify crucial price levels worth watching out for.\n\nFlag Pattern in Focus\n\nSince hitting a record high last month, Tesla shares have consolidated within a flag, a bullish chart pattern that indicates a brief pause in the stock\u2019s uptrend before another move higher. Indeed, the price looks sets to gap above the pattern\u2019s upper trending on Thursday in a move that could resume the stock\u2019s upward momentum.\n\nInvestors should also watch for an increase in trading volume, which has been in steady decline throughout the recent flag pattern.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze Tesla\u2019s chart to identify a longer-term bullish target and also point out several major support levels to watch during possible retracements.\n\nBullish Price Target to Watch\n\nTo project a bullish target, investors can use the bars pattern tool, which analyzes prior trends on the chart to forecast how a future move higher might look.\n\nWhen applying the tool to Tesla shares, we take the stock\u2019s trending move from October to December and overlay it from the flag pattern\u2019s lower trendline. This predicts a target of around $790, a location about double Wednesday\u2019s closing price where investors may decide to lock in profits.\n\nWe selected this earlier trend as it followed a prior consolidation period of similar duration to the stock's current flag pattern.\n\nMajor Support Levels to Monitor\n\nDuring dips, investors should initially watch the $360 level, a location where the shares could find support near two minor peaks that formed on the chart in November.\n\nSelling below this level could see a more substantial fall to around $300. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near the physiological round number and the prominent July 2023 swing high, which marked the stock\u2019s record high until last November\u2019s election-driven breakout.\n\nFinally, further selling opens the door for a decline to the $265 level. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region, given it finds a confluence of support from the upward sloping 200-day moving average and a trendline that connects multiple peaks on the chart stretching back to October 2023.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "content": "Tesla's stock has added nearly $600 billion to its market value since reporting the last quarterly numbers. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)\n\n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]\n\nTesla Inc. shares have nearly doubled in value since the last time the company reported earnings \u2014 a set-up that usually spells high expectations for upcoming results. But its car-selling business has become a sideshow to Elon Musk\u2019s political prominence.\n\nA large chunk of its mammoth market value has been propped up by hopes it will be among the first to develop and market fully self-driving vehicles. Those expectations were turbocharged by Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, as investors bet the closeness between Tesla\u2019s CEO and the U.S. President will pave the way \u2014 ignoring cash flow risks from a possible roll-back of EV incentives.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if the company\u2019s ability to profitably build and sell the cars no longer counts. Trading in the options market suggests investors are preparing for a 7% move in either direction off Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report, due after market close Jan. 29. That would be the stock\u2019s smallest post-results swing since October 2022. Shares fell as much as 3.4% on Jan. 29, while the broader S&P 500 Index declined 0.9%.\n\n\u201cThe market is behaving as if Tesla\u2019s results don\u2019t matter, and that may catch investors flat-footed in case of a large shock,\u201d said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. \u201cThe electric car business is still about $200 billion in market value, but it is still the funding mechanism for a lot of the actual sideshows.\u201d\n\n(Bloomberg Television via YouTube)\n\nThe stock has added nearly $600 billion to its market value since reporting the last quarterly numbers. Yet in many ways, Tesla shares have become a vehicle for investors to wager on Musk himself, rather than the company. That has advantages, but also poses risks.\n\nImage\n\n(Bloomberg)\n\nOn one hand, the shares are now unencumbered by mundane details of growth and profitability. Earlier this month, the EV-maker reported fourth-quarter deliveries that missed analysts\u2019 projections, and marked the first drop in annual sales in more than a decade. The stock, which is one of the most expensively valued in the S&P 500 Index, fell on the day before quickly rebounding.\n\nThe flip side is Tesla is now vulnerable to the twists and turns of a potentially volatile relationship. Musk last week openly questioned if companies that joined the Stargate artificial intelligence venture announced by Trump had the funds to follow through on promises. Trump and the Republican party are generally anti-EV, and the president has ordered his administration to consider eliminating related subsidies and policies.\n\nRELATED: Newsom, Musk Clash Over California EV Incentive Plan\n\nThat can be a major headache for Tesla, which in the third quarter of 2024 generated $739 million in revenue from selling regulatory credits to car manufacturers that need to comply with strict pollution standards. In the quarter before that, it hauled in $890 million. Barclays analyst Dan Levy estimates that about two-thirds of Tesla\u2019s U.S. sales, or 20% of its global sales, benefit from EV tax credits that encourage consumers to buy electric cars. It\u2019s not yet clear how the different subsidies and incentives will be impacted.\n\nDavid Bell, CEO of CloneOps.ai, discusses the impact of AI on the trucking industry. Tune in above or by going to RoadSigns.ttnews.com.\n\n\u201cFundamentals remain secondary versus the broader theme of narrative command for Tesla, which has gone into hyperdrive since the U.S. Elections last November,\u201d Levy wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note this move has very little to do with EVs, as the Election catalyst is objectively a negative for EVs.\u201d\n\nThe pitfalls of ascribing eye-watering valuations to future potentials \u2014 be it artificial intelligence or robotaxis \u2014 came into sharp focus Jan. 27, when the biggest U.S. technology stocks nosedived on fears that Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek could disrupt the current AI business model.\n\nBetween $500 billion and $600 billion of Tesla\u2019s current market capitalization is based on its EV and energy businesses, according to Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally, with the rest pinned on efforts toward self-driving cars and humanoid robots. Calculations by Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, show that over 90% of Tesla\u2019s share price is tied to what the company might do in the future.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nStill, some say the very nature of Tesla\u2019s core business can also protect it from a sudden DeepSeek-like shock.\n\n\u201cAny company is subject to disruption, but since the auto manufacturing business has a much longer cycle than computer software/hardware, I think that Tesla\u2019s vulnerabilities will occur a bit more slowly,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nA look into how traders are positioning for Tesla\u2019s earnings report on Jan. 29 also shows optimism continues to rule. Citigroup equity and derivatives trading strategist Vishal Vivek estimated that options market positioning was about \u201c7 out of 10 bullish.\u201d\n\n\u201cMusk can engineer a stock rally with just a few words on the conference call even if the fourth-quarter numbers themselves are bad,\u201d said Adam Crisafulli, founder of market intelligence firm Vital Knowledge. \u201cThat makes the stock extremely difficult to assess, especially around earnings.\u201d",

            "content": "\u201cUncertainty is the enemy of economic progress,\u201d Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures, told me.\n\nThe lack of clarity is understandably causing investors to throw on the brakes. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked internally about, let\u2019s be a little bit more cautious, let\u2019s be a little more judicious with our dollars right now,\u201d Gabriel Kra, co-founder at the climate tech firm Prelude Ventures, told me. \u201cWe\u2019re not out in the market, but I would think this would be a really tough time to try and go out and raise a new fund.\u201d\n\nThis reluctance comes at a particularly bad time for climate tech startups, many of which are now reaching a point where they are ready to scale up and build first-of-a-kind infrastructure projects and factories. That takes serious capital, the kind that wasn\u2019t as necessary during Trump\u2019s first term, or even much of Biden\u2019s, when many of these companies were in a more nascent research and development or proof-of-concept stage.\n\nI also heard from investors that the pace of Trump\u2019s actions and the extent of the economic upheaval across every sector feels unique this time around. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a pretty different economic construct,\u201d Beebe told me, citing the swirling unknowns around how Trump\u2019s policies will impact economic indicators such as inflation and interest rates. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this kind of economic warfare in decades,\u201d he said.\n\nEven before Trump took office, it was notoriously difficult for climate companies to raise funding in the so-called \u201c missing middle, \u201d when startups are too mature for early-stage venture capital but not mature enough for traditional infrastructure investors to take a bet on them. This is exactly the point at which government support \u2014 say, a loan guarantee from the Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Programs Office or a grant from the DOE\u2019s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations \u2014 could be most useful in helping a company prove its commercial viability.\n\nBut now that Trump has frozen funding \u2014 even some that\u2019s been contractually obligated \u2014 companies are left with fewer options than ever to reach scale.\n\nOne investor who wished to remain anonymous in order to speak more openly told me that \u201ca lot of the missing middle companies are living in a dicier world.\u201d A 2023 white paper on \u201ccapital imbalances in the energy transition\u201d from S2G Investments, a firm that supports both early-stage and growth-stage companies, found that from 2017 to 2022, only 20% of climate capital flowed toward companies at this critical inflection point, while 43% went to early-stage companies and 37% towards established technologies. For companies at this precarious growth stage, a funding delay on the order of months could be the difference between life and death, the investor added. Many of these companies may also be reliant on debt financing, they explained. \u201cUnless they\u2019ve been extremely disciplined, they could run into a situation where they\u2019re just not able to service that debt.\u201d\n\nThe months or even years that it could take for Trump\u2019s rash funding rescission to wind through the courts will end up killing some companies, Beebe told me. \u201cAnd unfortunately, that\u2019s what people on the other side of this debate would like, is just to litigate and escalate. And even if they ultimately lose, they\u2019ve won, because startups just don\u2019t have the balance sheets that big companies would,\u201d he explained.\n\nKra\u2019s Prelude Ventures has a number of prominent companies in its portfolio that have benefitted from DOE grants. This includes Electric Hydrogen, which received a $43.3 million DOE grant to scale electrolyzer manufacturing; Form Energy, which received $150 million to help build a long-duration battery storage manufacturing plant; Boston Metal, which was awarded $50 million for a green steel facility; and Heirloom, which is a part of the $600 million Project Cypress Direct Air Capture hub. DOE funding is often doled out in tranches, with some usually provided upfront and further payments tied to specific project milestones. So even if a grant has officially been awarded, that doesn\u2019t mean all of the funding has been disbursed, giving the Trump administration an opening to break government contracts and claw it back.\n\nKra told me that a few of his firm\u2019s companies were on the verge of securing government funding before Trump took office, or have a project in the works that is now on hold. \u201cWe and the board are working closely with those companies to figure out what to do,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf the mandates or supports aren\u2019t there for that company, you\u2019ve got to figure out how to make that cash last a bunch longer so you can still meet some commercially meaningful milestones.\u201d\n\nIn this environment, Kra said his firm will be taking a closer look at companies that claim they will be able to attract federal funds. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we understand what they can do without that non-dilutive capital, without those grants, without that project level support,\u201d he told me, noting that \u201cseveral\u201d companies in his portfolio will also be impacted by Trump\u2019s ever-changing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. Prelude Ventures is working with its portfolio companies to figure how to \u201csmooth out the hit,\u201d Kra told me later via email, but inevitably the tariffs \u201cwill affect the prices consumers pay in the short and long run.\u201d\n\nWhile investors can\u2019t avoid the impacts of all government policies and impulses, the growth-stage firm G2 Venture Partners has long tried to inoculate itself against the vicissitudes of government financing. \u201cNone of our companies actually have any exposure to DOE loans,\u201d Brook Porter, a partner and co-founder at G2, told me in an email, nor have they received government grants. If you add up the revenue from all of the companies in G2\u2019s portfolio, which is made up mainly of sustainability-focused startups, only about 3% \u201chas any exposure to the IRA,\u201d Porter told me. So even if the law\u2019s generous clean energy tax credits are slashed or the programs it supports are left to languish, G2\u2019s companies will likely soldier on.\n\nThen there are the venture capitalists themselves. Many of the investors I spoke with emphasized that not all firms will have the ability or will to weather this storm. \u201cI definitely believe many generalist funds who dabbled in climate will pull back,\u201d Beebe told me. Porter agreed. \u201cThe generalists are much more interested in AI, then I think in climate,\u201d he said. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s been a rash of generalist investors announcing pullbacks, though Kra told me he knows of \u201ca couple of firms\u201d that are rethinking their climate investment strategies, potentially opting to fold these investments under an umbrella category such as \u201chard tech\u201d instead of highlighting a sectoral focus on energy or climate, specifically.\n\nLast month, the investment firm Coatue, which has about $70 billion in assets under management, raised around $250 million for a climate-focused fund, showing it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for the generalists\u2019 climate ambitions. But Porter told me this is exactly the type of large firm he wouldexpect to back out soon, citing Tiger Global Management and Softbank as others that started investing heavily during climate tech\u2019s boom years from 2020 to 2022 that he could imagine winding down that line of business.\n\nStrategic investors such as oil companies have also been quick to dial back their clean energy ambitions and refocus their sights on the fossil fuels championed by the Trump administration. \u201cCorporate venture is very cyclical,\u201d Beebe told me, explaining that large companies tend to make venture investments when they have excess budget or when a sector looks hot, but tighten the purse strings during periods of uncertainty.\n\nBut Cody Simms, a managing partner at the climate tech investment firm MCJ, told me that at the moment, he actually sees the corporate venture ecosystem as \u201cquite strong and quite active.\u201d The firm\u2019s investments include the low-carbon cement company Sublime Systems, which last year got strategic backing from two of the world\u2019s largest building materials companies, and the methane capture company Windfall Bio, which has received strategic funding from Amazon\u2019s Climate Pledge Fund. Simms noted that this momentum could represent an overexuberance among corporations who just recently stood up their climate-focused venture arms, and \u201cwe\u2019ll see if it continues into the next few years.\u201d\n\nNotably, Sublime and Windfall Bio both also have millions in DOE grants, and another of MCJ\u2019s portfolio companies, bio-based chemicals maker Solugen, has a \u201c conditional commitment \u201d from the LPO for a loan guarantee of over $200 million. Since that money isn\u2019t yet obligated, there\u2019s a good chance it might never actually materialize, which could stall construction on the company\u2019s in-progress biomanufacturing facility .\n\nSimms told me that the main thing he\u2019s encouraging MCJ\u2019s portfolio companies to do at this stage is to contact their local representatives \u2014 not to advocate for climate action in general, but rather \u201cto push on the very specific tax credit that they are planning to use and to talk about how it creates jobs locally in their districts.\u201d\n\nGetting startups to shift the narrative away from decarbonization and climate and toward their multitudinous co-benefits \u2014 from energy security to supply chain resilience \u2014 is of course a strategy many are already deploying to one degree or another. And investors were quick to remind me that the landscape may not be quite as bleak as it appears.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made more investments, and we have a pipeline of more attractive investments now than we have in the last couple of years,\u201d Porter told me. That\u2019s because in spite of whatever havoc the Trump administration is wreaking, a lot of climate tech companies are reaching a critical juncture that could position the sector overall for \u201ca record number of IPOs this year and next,\u201d Porter said. The question is, \u201cwill these macro uncertainties \u2014 political, economic, financial uncertainty \u2014 hold companies back from going public?\u201d\n\nAs with so many economic downturns and periods of instability, investors also see this as a moment for the true blue startups and venture capitalists to prove their worth and business acumen in an environment that\u2019s working against them. \u201cNow we have the hardcore founders, the people who really are driven by building economically viable, long-term, massively impactful companies, and the investors who understand the markets very well, coming together around clean business models that aren\u2019t dependent on swinging from one subsidy vine to the next subsidy vine,\u201d Beebe told me.\n\n\u201cThere is no opportunity that\u2019s an absolute no, even in this current situation, across the entire space,\u201d the anonymous climate tech investor told me. \u201cAnd so this might be one of the most important points \u2014 I won\u2019t say a high point, necessarily \u2014 but it might be a moment of truth that the energy transition needs to embrace.\u201d",

But the company\u2019s large swaths of investors seem more focused on CEO Elon Musk\u2019s bromance with President Donald Trump than the troubling noises coming from the car company behind Musk\u2019s fortune.\n\nShares of Tesla are up 57% since the close of trading on Election Day \u2014 even with some of the company\u2019s troubles, which include a change in federal emission regulations that could reduce the billions of dollars it gets from the sale of regulatory credits, and increased competition for electric car buyers. Tesla also nearly lost its title as the world\u2019s largest maker of EVs to Chinese automaker BYD at the end of last year, even though BYD has yet to enter the US market. But with the growing sales of EVs in China, Tesla seems likely to lose that title this year, especially if its sales continue to decline.\n\nBut Musk\u2019s close connection to Trump has investors hoping that the new administration will clear the way for some of his grand plans, including approval of true self-driving cars that don\u2019t have accelerator or brake pedals or steering wheels, which Musk has promised for years. Aside from regulations, however, Tesla\u2019s technology \u2014 including \u201cFull Self Driving,\u201d or FSD \u2014 has not lived up to Musk\u2019s claims and promises in the past, and has faced investigations into its safety by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The current version of FSD requires a person to be in the driver\u2019s seat, ready to take control of the car should a problem arise.\n\nMusk insists, however, that truly driverless \u201cCybercab\u201d robotaxis from Tesla will be available by 2026 and that its service will make the company by far the most valuable in the world. While even Musk admits \u201cI tend to be a little optimistic with time frames,\u201d he also said that only regulatory hurdles are keeping keep his next generation of self-driving robotaxis from being a reality soon. There are analysts who agree with his view.\n\n\u201cI think the Trump tailwind is just starting for Musk and Tesla, and the value of autonomous vehicles and FSD is going to be unleashed,\u201d said Dan Ives, analyst with Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull. \u201cIn our view Tesla continues to be the most undervalued AI play in the market.\u201d\n\n\u2018A demand problem\u2019\n\nBut there are still Tesla bears who don\u2019t believe that autonomous driving is as close as Musk promises. They also say that the softening growth in the American electric vehicle market is a major problem for the company. Shares of Tesla have lost 17% of their value since their peak a month ago, despite still being far above the pre-election price.\n\nGordon Johnson, an analyst who is one of the most vocal critics of Tesla, says the controversy surrounding Musk, including his support for Trump and far-right political parties in Germany and the UK, is hurting demand for Tesla cars among liberal American and European buyers who are more inclined to spend the money on an EV.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s hurting Tesla tremendously. He\u2019s gone full MAGA,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMany Tesla buyers won\u2019t consider buying a Tesla again.\u201d\n\nElon Musk steps onstage as Donald Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee, addresses a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in October.

Those rules didn\u2019t just govern what came out of a gasoline engine\u2019s tailpipe. They also enabled makers of cars that polluted too much to buy \u201cregulatory credits\u201d from manufacturers of zero-emissions cars, like Tesla, to bring themselves into compliance.\n\nTesla is by far the greatest beneficiary of those purchases: It reported $2 billion in credit sales in the first nine months of 2024. Although some of those credits come from automakers complying with state regulations, rather than federal regulations, Trump has also vowed to block those tougher state emission rules, although a court fight over such a move is virtually certain.\n\nInvestors will be looking for guidance from Musk and Tesla on Wednesday on the future of those credit sales.\n\nTrump has also vowed to eliminate a $7,500 tax credit to EV buyers, a move that could further cripple the EV market in the United States. Automakers would likely further cut the price of EVs to make them more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.\n\nIt\u2019s once again not clear when such a move would take effect. But Musk is on record saying he approves of removing what he called a \u201csubsidy\u201d for EV sales. Some analysts argue that legacy automakers \u2014 which are losing money on all their EVs, largely due to startup development costs \u2014 are more likely to pull back on their EV production and offerings altogether, and thus provide less competition for Tesla.\n\nThe end of the credit \u201cwill widen Tesla\u2019s competitive moat by making competing EV models even more uneconomic, as we believe TSLA is the only profitable manufacturer of EVs,\u201d wrote Garrett Nelson, analyst for CFRA Research, in a note to clients the day after the election. \u201cFor these reasons, we now view Tesla shares as deserving of higher multiples, but acknowledge challenges in the near term.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson said the loss of the EV tax credit will make it more difficult for Tesla\u2019s cars to compete with gasoline-powered cars. And the company already has more capacity to build cars than it has buyers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge negative for Tesla,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey have a demand problem. They can\u2019t sell out their existing capacity. Nine out of 10 car buyers are choosing gasoline-powered cars, not EVs. This makes EVs less competitive.\u201d\n\nTesla could respond to the loss of EV tax credit in 2019 by cutting the price of its vehicles, just like it did when an earlier version of the tax credit was sunset for Tesla buyers in 2019. And with its profits from EV sales, it can cut prices more than its legacy automaker competitors. Even with the tax credit, Tesla has been responding to slowing demand and greater EV competition with a series of price cuts in recent years, squeezing its profit margins.\n\nTesla might still be able to adapt\n\nA Cybertruck at a Tesla dealership in Manhattan on October 31, 2024. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThere is also the question of how focused Musk has been on running things at Tesla, as he spends much of his time and attention in Mar-a-Lago or Washington DC. He has always had a broad range of other companies and interests, including rocket and satellite company SpaceX, social media platform X and artificial intelligence company xAI, among others. He now has an office at the White House as he focuses on plans to identify federal programs that can be cut by the new administration, to further take him away from the Tesla offices and factories where he once worked around the clock.\n\nThis past week, Tesla rolled out an updated version of the Model Y, its best-selling car, but there was no event hosted by Musk to hype the changes, as he has done for all past model roll outs. He has ambitious goals for new vehicles, including a lower-priced model, as well as the Cybercab. But even some Tesla bulls have doubts about Musk\u2019s target dates.\n\n\u201cHitting target dates for Tesla is like the Jets draft picks. They\u2019ve not been very accurate,\u201d Ives, the Wedbush Securities analyst, said.",

For this year, Wall Street analysts estimate a 16 percent rise to 2.1 million vehicles.\n\nIn the run-up to this week\u2019s earnings report and conference call, Tesla investors submitted questions asking whether the automaker still plans to launch a ride-hailing service with autonomous vehicles in Texas and California this year as promised.\n\nSign up for the weekly Automotive News Mobility Report newsletter for the latest developments at the intersection of transportation and technology.\n\n\u201cWhat hurdles still exist to make this happen?\u201d asked one Tesla investor in an online forum set up to capture questions for the earnings call. The top-voted submissions are typically presented to Musk for comment.\n\nAnother question asked whether there\u2019s interest by rival automakers in licensing Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving software, which currently functions as a driver-assistance tool. Musk has promised that the software will move from a \u201csupervised\u201d feature to \u201cunsupervised,\u201d meaning fully autonomous, prior to launching the commercial robotaxi service.\n\nWith softer sales last year for its electric vehicles in major global markets, including the U.S. and Europe, Musk has pivoted from chasing EV volume to betting on artificial intelligence for the autonomous vehicles he\u2019s been promising for a decade.\n\nTesla plans to manufacture a dedicated robotaxi vehicle, the Cybercab, in 2026, the company has said. Meanwhile, Tesla has said its Full Self-Driving software will make millions of existing vehicles autonomous and capable of serving as robotaxis.\n\nTo drive sales volume, Tesla said it will launch more affordable vehicles in the first half of 2025 but hasn\u2019t offered details beyond saying that it would use a modified version of a current vehicle platform. Some analysts think the new vehicles will be lower-cost versions of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover.\n\n\u201cIs there a new affordable Tesla model coming soon?\u201d asked one investor. \u201cWhen will the lower-cost model launch?\u201d asked another one.\n\nTesla launched a freshened version of its bestselling Model Y in the U.S. on Jan. 22, starting with a pricey special edition with a sticker price of $61,380 with shipping, a $12,000 premium over the comparable older version still on sale.

Meanwhile, he says China will make up just around 5 percent, while the rest of the world, including other parts of America, would also make up just 5 percent.\n\nHe also predicted that that number would go up even further to nearly 100 percent, once SpaceX\u2019s reusable rocket is being launched more frequently.\n\n\u201cWhen Starship is launching at high rate, SpaceX will probably carry >99 percent of Earth\u2019s payload mass to orbit. This is necessary to make Mars a self-sustaining civilization,\u201d Musk added.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT SPACEX\u2019S STARSHIP: Texas awards SpaceX $17.3M grant to expand Bastrop tech hub\n\nTo be sure, Musk has been known to make ambitious claims about when his companies\u2019 products would achieve certain milestones. For example, Musk predicted in 2018 that SpaceX could launch a rocket to Mars with humans aboard by 2024, though SpaceX only began testing the company\u2019s reusable Starship in 2023.\n\nStill, the company has been routinely testing Starship since then, and with increasing frequency, and in October, SpaceX performed the first catch of the Starship\u2019s Super Heavy booster after liftoff to demonstrate the concept that a reusable rocket could be possible. In a launch earlier this month, SpaceX again successfully caught the Super Heavy Booster, though it lost the upper stage to a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d effectively meaning that it had exploded in air and showered surrounding areas with rocket parts.\n\nThe explosion was the second consecutive launch in which debris from Starship reigned down, highlighting the continued importance of testing as SpaceX aims to make the rocket a viable product for reusable space travel.\n\nOn Friday, SpaceX also launched its Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) to rescue astronauts that have been stuck on the orbital craft, after a Boeing launch was originally intended to bring them back to Earth. While SpaceX attempted to rescue the two astronauts in September, issues with the Starliner craft\u2019s thrusters discovered upon arrival made NASA hold off on approving the return mission.",

Sure, the $94,990 starting price puts it out of reach for many, but no other production car on the planet can accelerate as quickly as a Plaid for the money.

In our opinion, if the US wants to be a leader in autonomy, it must ultimately embrace electric mobility,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cIn our view, this could enhance the market's appreciation for what Tesla brings to the table beyond the EV market.\u201d\n\nAnd this also means a demand for visual data, which Tesla collects in troves.\n\n\u201cJust as chatbots need textual data to train LLM foundation models, physical robots need vision data to train their VLA [vision, language, actuation] foundation models,\u201d Jonas said.\n\nSHANGHAI, CHINA - JULY 07: Tesla Bot Optimus is on display during the 2024 World AI Conference & High-Level Meeting on Global AI Governance at Shanghai World Expo Exhibition and Convention Center on July 7, 2024 in Shanghai, China.

Embodied AI will power Optimus, and renewed focus on this kind of AI development and efficiency coming from products like DeepSeek AI could boost this business for Tesla. Musk has predicted there could be half a million Optimus robots in service by 2027, a trillion-dollar total addressable market.\n\nThere\u2019s also a national security element that could fuel more spending. Government focus on what embodied AI means not only on the roads but also with drones in a military campaign, for instance, will only fuel more spending and investor attention on the embodied AI theme, Jonas said.",

Musk made the comments, a common refrain among right-wing groups concerning Germany\u2019s World War II crimes, to supporters as part of his support for AfD ahead of the country\u2019s Feb. 23 election.\n\n\u201cChildren should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents\u201d Musk told the audience.\n\nThe comments drew swift criticism in Germany as Musk\u2019s support for the AfD\u2019s anti-immigrant positions has grown. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats and the country\u2019s biggest labor union slammed the billionaire\u2019s actions.\n\nThe comments over the weekend particularly touched a nerve in Poland as world leaders commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp. Some 6 million Poles - half of them Jews - died after German troops invaded the country after 1939.\n\n\u201cMaybe Mr. Musk with his billions doesn\u2019t feel threatened,\u201d Sports Minister Slawomir Nitras told Tok FM radio on Monday. \u201cBut every normal person living in the center of Europe, who remembers what happened eighty years ago, cannot look on indifferently.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that probably no normal Pole should buy a Tesla anymore,\u201d said Nitras, a senior figure in the ruling Civic Platform party of Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\nThe call for boycott coincides with a launch in February of a new government plan to encourage electric vehicle purchases in Poland that may benefit Tesla. It envisages as much as 40,000 zloty ($9,958) in subsidies for individual car purchases.\n\nTesla was Poland\u2019s most popular EV brand with more than 4,400 cars sold last year, according to data from Samar research institute. The company runs five showrooms and 15 supercharger facilities in Poland.",

When I arrive and step out of my Tesla Cybertruck, I don't have the fatigue that typically comes with driving for hours.\n\nOn the days I travel, I often have a full schedule of Social Security disability psychological assessments to conduct. It's mentally exhausting work that demands focus and compassion.\n\nI credit my Cybertruck, affectionately named Brick House, for helping me arrive for the day without feeling drained.\n\nBut the general public thinks my truck is a political statement and not something that helps me.\n\nI first turned to Tesla because I needed a car with self-driving features\n\nMy road to driving a Cybertruck began in 2012 when I was a doctoral student commuting weekly from Phoenix to Tucson, Arizona, for an advanced practicum clinical training.\n\nThose drives up and down Interstate 10 were brutal. Sometimes, I'd have to pull over to take a quick nap to finish the drive safely, but I would still arrive home exhausted. During those drives, I often thought about my favorite childhood cartoon, \"The Jetsons,\" and how their cars drove themselves. That was the future I dreamt of. I wanted my car to drive me.\n\nIn early 2013, I heard about Tesla and its promise of Full Self-Driving. I immediately vowed not to buy another car until I had a Tesla. In 2021, I could finally lease a Tesla Model 3 Long Range with Full Self-Driving, which I affectionately named Ma'Lady.\n\nOver the next three years, Ma'Lady and I drove more than 35,000 miles, crisscrossing Arizona and conducting psychological examinations in rural towns. Ma'Lady became more than a car; it was a lifeline that kept me safe on Arizona's backroads and highways. Interestingly, I never experienced any backlash when driving the Model 3.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe Cybertruck then became the right vehicle for me\n\nIn 2024, a few months after my Model 3 lease ended, I knew I wanted to purchase my next car. Since the vehicle is technically for my business, it needed to be big enough for a specific tax code. The Cybertruck was the only one that fit the bill.\n\nMy long-awaited Cybertruck reservation eventually came through. But I then hesitated to upgrade to a Cybertruck because of all the controversy surrounding Tesla, the Cybertruck specifically, and Elon Musk.\n\nI'd already bought a different vehicle with driver assist, but it didn't compare to Tesla's Full Self-Driving. The exhaustion I felt after driving for hours in the other vehicle, seeing patients, and writing reports was extreme.\n\nA health scare landed me in the ER and reminded me how crucial it is to minimize stress. Tesla's Full Self-Driving significantly reduces the stress of driving all over Arizona.\n\nThe author using her Cybertruck's Full Self-Driving feature. Courtesy of Danny Earl Mitchell\n\nI left the hospital, went to my credit union, picked up my check for the Cybertruck, drove directly to FedEx, and overnighted the check to Tesla. Two days later, I was picking up my Cybertruck.\n\nUnfortunately, the Cybertruck draws a lot of attention\n\nThe reactions I get when driving the Cybertruck have been surprising. It's fun to see kids wave and snap pictures of my quirky-looking stainless-steel ride. Most aren't shy about it. Some ask whether it's OK; others will walk up, pose, and take pictures or videos. Their innocent responses are truly heartwarming.\n\nWhat's heartbreaking, though, is the way many adults respond. I've been flipped off, mean-mugged, and given many thumbs down. I've also experienced being shouted at in traffic and others aggressively merging in front of me.\n\nA close friend even refused to ride in my Cybertruck, sharing his disdain for Tesla's CEO.\n\nWith the added controversies since the 2025 presidential inauguration and Musk's actions, I'm concerned people will become more aggressive with their actions toward my Cybertruck and become physical versus just mean-mugging and flipping me off.\n\nIt's like driving a Cybertruck makes me a target for adults' opinions about Musk. To be clear, I bought the truck before he became a polarizing political figure. I cannot ignore Musk's behavior, and yet, I cannot take back the money I've already spent on buying the Cybertruck.\n\nTesla's Cybertruck keeps me safe\n\nMy Cybertruck isn't just a luxury or trying to look cool. Driving my Cybertruck is about functionality and safety. Arizona's two-lane highways, with fatigued drivers and narrow roads, can be dangerous.\n\nTesla's Cybertruck technology keeps me centered, monitors for hazards, and reduces the mental toll of long drives.\n\nI'm not financially able to sell or trade in the truck to avoid all the troubles. It's simply not feasible. When it's time for me to purchase another vehicle, I'm sure other auto manufacturers will have a version of Full Self-Driving, and I'll be able to point my dollars toward a more affirming brand.\n\nBut right now, I'm just leaning into the positives of my Cybertruck.",

            "content": "The electric vehicle giant will update investors with its latest quarterly results.\n\nIt feels like the investing world took the spotlight off of Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) in 2024. Investors were enamored with artificial intelligence (AI) stocks such as Nvidia and Palantir. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has been focused on other endeavors -- both business and political -- over the last few quarters. With the excitement around electric vehicles (EVs) fizzling out and growth stalling in the industry, Tesla shareholders (and perhaps the CEO himself) seem to have lost enthusiasm for the company.\n\nAnd yet, as I write this today, shares of Tesla stock are up 100% in the past 12 months. The EV maker and technology company has crushed the market and trades at a market cap of $1.3 trillion. It is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 after the market closes. Should you buy shares before the earnings report? Let's take a closer look.\n\nSlowing revenue growth, declining profit margins\n\nWhen analyzing Tesla stock, we need to first look at how many cars it is selling to customers each period. Historically, the company was growing its unit volumes like gangbusters, but in 2024 it faced a slowdown. Tesla's trailing-12-month deliveries have stalled out for a few quarters now. In fact, deliveries in 2024 were lower than in 2023. That is a huge slowdown surely impacted by slowing market-share gains for the EV category, especially in the United States.\n\nMore concerning is the fact Tesla has implemented large price cuts in order to get products out the door. Over the last 12 months ending in Q3 of 2024 (we get Q4 numbers this week), Tesla's gross margin was 18%, and operating margin was only 8.5%. This operating margin figure is just around half the level the company hit a few years ago, which is a troubling development for the company.\n\nGiven the price cuts and slowing deliveries, we shouldn't expect anything radically different when Tesla reports its Q4 financials. Revenue growth will be weak at best, and profit margins likely will still be much lower than where they were a few years ago.\n\nAmbitious but confusing growth plans\n\nThe EV business is not performing too well at the moment. Tesla investors like to remind you, though, that the company has ambitions to be more than just an EV maker. It is working on solar technology, commercial battery cells, self-driving technology, and what it calls the Cybercab, as well as AI and humanoid robot research.\n\nAll these innovations sound exciting. In fact, the company is growing its battery cell business quite quickly (although it is not going to be meaningful for a stock valued at $1.3 trillion). However, the product roadmap should leave investors skeptical that these will be material to Tesla's financial performance in the coming years. For one, Tesla has been promising self-driving cars for a long time, as well as the infamous robotaxis. They still have not shown up yet. The humanoid robot called Optimus looks like a great idea but seems far from being implemented. There has been some fantastic reporting that the demonstrations for Optimus were exaggerating Tesla's technology in the humanoid robot field.\n\nWhat perhaps is the most concerning is Tesla's lack of investment in AI. Elon Musk has founded a separate company called xAI which has raised $6 billion in funding. Is his focus on AI going to be at Tesla or in an entirely separate company? If it is all going to be in this new enterprise, that clearly would not be good for Tesla's business.\n\nShould you buy Tesla stock today?\n\nLooking at the facts above, it is hard to be optimistic about Tesla's business right now. The EV segment is sputtering, and it is unclear what value these new segments will bring, or if Musk will even implement them at Tesla.\n\nThese may not be the most concerning things about Tesla stock. What pops out the most is the company's valuation. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 111, which is close to four times the S&P 500 index average. This is for a business that isn't growing quickly, is seeing declining margins, and has made little to no progress in diversifying its operations.\n\nWhether Tesla beats or misses on its earnings per share (EPS) targets -- which will affect the stock price movement the following day -- Tesla stock looks like a risky bet at today's prices for those looking to buy and hold over the long term. It seems prudent to avoid buying Tesla stock before its Q4 earnings update.",

Rather than focusing on Tesla\u2019s first annual sales decline in over a decade, they\u2019re becoming increasingly optimistic about Tesla\u2019s AI potential.\n\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler and Wedbush were among the teams raising their 12-month price targets this week, with Piper Sandler naming Tesla its top \"buy-and-hold idea\" and Wedbush calling the new administration a \"total game changer\" for the company.\n\nWatch: GM's CEO Marry Barra on the company's EV plans\n\n\u201cThe $7,500 credit rollback is more of a negative for new entrants and Detroit\u2019s big three automakers,\u201d Ives told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cFor Tesla, 90% of what's going to drive the stock is autonomous and AI \u2026 that's the ultimate story.\u201d\n\nIves predicts Tesla\u2019s valuation will reach $2 trillion by the end of this year, driven by what he described as a \u201cregulatory friendly\u201d White House that will \u201cfast-track the autonomous future.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas also sees AI as a key growth driver for Tesla. In a recent note to investors, the Tesla bull wrote that AI and robotics have become top of mind for clients following Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s CES presentation. The AI chip juggernaut announced a partnership with Toyota (TM) for autonomous vehicles and another deal with automotive company Continental and self-driving truck firm Aurora.\n\nHowever, Jonas has not yet priced embodied AI into his value modeling for Tesla.\n\n\u201cWe are receiving more incoming client requests to discuss humanoids than the entirety of our auto OEM, dealer and supplier coverage combined \u2026 While we continue to view Tesla as sort of an embodied AI \u2018ETF\u2019 and well positioned due to the underpinnings of our DREAMS framework, we note that we do not currently ascribe any value to Tesla for embodied AI in our $430 price target or $800 bull case,\u201d Jonas wrote in a note to clients.\n\nJonas also sees the Trump administration\u2019s tariff policies as a potential catalyst for the company. He views Trump\u2019s aggressive use of tariffs as a push to accelerate onshoring of AI-enabled technology, a move that could create future growth opportunities for Tesla.",

            "content": "Tesla versus Tesla customers. There is a clash between Elon Musk's company and some owners of the Cybertruck, the edgy electric pick-up truck which started delivery in the United States from the end of 2023. According to foreign press reports, the manufacturer is refusing trade-in requests for the vehicle.\n\nThis is unheard of for the company, which historically even accepts combustion cars from other brands. But apparently not the Cybertruck. Therefore, it is not possible to return the pick-up and buy another Tesla. Why?\n\nTerms and conditions\n\nA few months ago, the manufacturer explained that the model was still too 'fresh' and that it preferred to sell new models rather than take back used ones, even if they were in perfect or near perfect condition.\n\nGallery: Tesla Cybertruck, the edgy cars that inspired it 8\n\nSome fans had defended the company's decision by pointing out that the purchase contract for a Cybertruck 'Foundation Series' blocks the resale of the vehicle for one year, with a few exceptions. Ironically, the clause also excludes trade-ins with Tesla itself.\n\nGoal: Free Supercharging for life\n\nNow, however, the first year has passed and the company's policy has not changed. And, even more ironically, it seems that many motorists wanted to replace their Cybertruck Foundation Series with another Cybertruck Foundation Series. The aim would be to take advantage of the benefits the manufacturer offers new customers to get rid of unsold examples. One of these is the free lifetime Supercharger access.\n\nIt is hard to understand why free charging would entice so many drivers to spend $20,000 on a new pick-up: it would take tens of thousands of miles to recoup the investment. The fact remains that Tesla's refusal is rather strange.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Tesla\u2019s first major update of 2025, software update 2025.2, is now rolling out to select vehicles in North America and Europe. While the update isn\u2019t widespread yet, it is rolling out to most vehicles, including HW3 and HW4 cars. The Cybertruck and legacy Model S/X vehicles are currently the only vehicles that haven\u2019t received this update.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at everything we know that\u2019s included in this update.\n\nThird-Party Charger Preconditioning\n\nFirst up, vehicles will now support preconditioning for third-party chargers. While this was previously available in Europe for approved third-party chargers that met Tesla\u2019s strict standards, it\u2019s now available in North America for the first time.\n\nWhat\u2019s New: When you navigate to a charging location, whether it\u2019s listed in the vehicle\u2019s charging locations or not, the vehicle will now precondition the battery for faster charging. It looks like the vehicle will automatically determine if the destination is an EV charging location and enable preconditioning. If the destination is a charging location, you\u2019ll see a little banner show up, letting you know the vehicle\u2019s battery is now being preconditioned. There isn\u2019t a button to manually precondition the battery yet.\n\nWhat\u2019s Not Added: In Europe, the vehicle's charging filter shows approved third-party chargers. Unfortunately, it does not look like this is being added in North America, where Tesla only displays Superchargers and destination chargers. However, the above feature still applies in North America, where the vehicle will precondition the battery for fast chargers such as Electrify America.\n\nThe video below shows how the feature will work:\n\nMuchos me hab\u00e9is pedido que haga un v\u00eddeo de c\u00f3mo se activa el precalentamiento en cargadores \"no Tesla\". Pues simplemente, en la ruta que elij\u00e1is, puls\u00e1is sobre el cargador en cuesti\u00f3n y autom\u00e1ticamente se activa solo. pic.twitter.com/snMoPDx6Dr \u2014 Gerard (@Gerard_Otero76) January 26, 2025\n\nRear Cross-Traffic Chime\n\nFollowing up on the addition of rear cross-traffic alerts showing up as red indicators as part of the 2024 Tesla Holiday Update, Tesla is now adding an alert chime to go with it. Now, there is a visual indicator on the screen, as well as an audible indicator that a vehicle or object has been detected crossing behind you.\n\nThis is a great addition and almost looked like a glaring omission in the initial release of the feature. Tesla likely wanted to make sure the feature was working as expected in the wider fleet before introducing a more drastic alert.\n\nThe chime is enabled by default, but if you want to disable it, you can go to Controls > Safety > Rear Cross-Traffic Chime to disable it. Joe Mode will reduce the chime\u2019s volume if you prefer that instead.\n\nInterestingly, the rear cross-traffic alerts feature was a feature that Musk said \u201cYes\u201d to back in 2020.\n\nHands-Free Trunk/Frunk for Android\n\nJust recently, we reported that Tesla was adding ultra-wideband support for Android - which would include two new major new features.\n\nImproved Phone Key Reliability: Ultra-wideband (UWB) is an alternative to Bluetooth, which offers highly accurate positioning and tracking of devices. It uses about the same amount of energy as Bluetooth Low Energy but with increased location accuracy. By having your phone communicate with the vehicle over UWB, the vehicle knows exactly where your phone is in relation to the car, drastically increasing the reliability of your vehicle\u2019s phone key.\n\nHands-Free Trunk and Frunk Opening: More precise location tracking enables new features such as Hands-Free Trunk and Hands-Free Frunk support. This feature has been available on iOS devices for approximately a year and will now be available on Android devices.\n\nSupported Models: Unfortunately, not all models are supported, and your vehicle needs to have ultra-wideband sensors. Supported models include the 2021+ Model S and Model X, the 2024+ Model 3, the Cybertruck, and the upcoming 2025+ Model Y. Only the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck support the hands-free frunk.\n\nSupported Phones: Most recent Android phones support ultra-wideband, especially flagship devices, however, it\u2019s not available on all phones. If you have a Google Pixel 6 or higher, Samsung Fold 2 or higher, Samsung S21+, or other recent Android phone, then your phone already supports ultra wideband.\n\nUsers with Android devices with UWB will initially be prompted to \u201cUpgrade\u201d their phone key when opening the Tesla app. This will switch your phone key from using Bluetooth to ultra-wideband. Once upgraded, you can go to Controls > Locks > Hands-Free Frunk / Trunk in your vehicle settings to enable the new hands-free feature. If you aren\u2019t prompted for the upgrade, you\u2019ll find it under Security & Drivers > Phone Key > Upgrade in the Tesla app.\n\nWeather Information\n\nWith every Tesla update, there are smaller features, and this one is no different. In this update, the weather information is now displayed for both the final destination and any additional stops (waypoints) you have set along the way. Previously, the weather would only be displayed for your current location and your destination.\n\nBattle of Polytopia\n\nNext up, Battle of Polytopia is receiving another update. This time \u201cThe Forgotten\u201d skin is being added for the recently-added Aquarion faction, adding some old-world Atlantis vibes to the fishy folk. Additional language support and balance changes are also included in this Battle of Polytopia update.\n\nCybertruck Charging Improvements\n\nLast month we reported that The Cybertruck is expected to receive charging and regenerative braking improvements soon. Tesla was aiming at releasing these updates in the 2025.2 update, so there\u2019s a chance that these cold weather improvements are also included in the 2025.2 update, but we won\u2019t know for sure until the Cybertruck starts receiving this update in the coming days or weeks.\n\nOther Features?\n\nSince this update hasn\u2019t rolled out to all models or regions yet, it\u2019s possible we may see some additional features added in this update, although at this point, it may only be features for the Cybertruck or the legacy Model S and Model X.\n\nFinally, as usual, Tesla includes minor fixes, performance enhancements, security fixes, and improvements. If you notice any undocumented changes, please let us know.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nYesterday, as I was scrolling through the \u201cTesla Tips & Tricks\u201d group on Facebook, I stumbled upon a post that caught my attention immediately. It wasn\u2019t just another Tesla owner showing off their new range stats or a shiny wrap job. No, this was something entirely different. A gentleman named Adam Jones, from Canada, had shared a story about his recent purchase: a used 2017 Tesla Model X 100D with only 15,500 miles on it. But there was a catch: the whole floor and seats in the back were missing.\n\nAdam wrote, \u201cHey everyone. So I bought a used Model X, and apparently, it used to be a Tesla mobile mechanic car. The whole floor and seats are missing. I was just wondering if anyone has any suggestions on what I can do, or where I can find the 5 seats that go in the back. Tesla is charging me an arm and a leg.\u201d\n\nNow, you\u2019ve got to admit: this is not your typical used car story. Adam mentioned that he bought this Model X because he got a great deal. And with just 15,500 miles on the odometer, it\u2019s practically new. But what he didn\u2019t realize was that this car, used for Tesla\u2019s mobile mechanic services, was stripped down to maximize cargo space for tools and equipment. That left Adam with a spacious, albeit incomplete, Tesla.\n\nI chatted with Adam and he sent me a few additional images.\n\nThe Search for The Model X Seats\n\nAdam\u2019s predicament sparked a lively discussion in the comments. Many Tesla enthusiasts offered practical suggestions. The most straightforward solution? Find the rear seats from a salvage yard. Junkyards often have an updated online inventory, so you can search by make and model without wasting time visiting in person. These places typically have seats from totaled Teslas, and some will even install them for you, saving you the hassle of doing it yourself.\n\nAnother critical point for Adam to consider is the legal side. In some states, it\u2019s actually illegal to sell a vehicle without the proper seating as it was originally manufactured. If the seller was a dealer, Adam might have legal recourse. Even if the vehicle was sold \u201cas is,\u201d retail laws in certain areas could obligate the dealer to provide and install the missing parts. Adam would need to check his local laws to see if this applies to him.\n\nThe Creative (and Hilarious) Solution for Repairing This Model X\n\nBut not everyone was focused on practicality. A commenter named Ronald Dennis suggested a more unconventional approach: \u201cTake that thing to Home Depot and build in some flooring and carpeting and throw a couch in there! Some cabinetry, fridge, for example.\u201d\n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s not a bad idea. With some creativity, Adam could turn this Model X into a unique mini RV. Tesla vehicles already have impressive features like climate control and access to power, making them ideal for camping or road trips. This could open up a whole new use for a Model X that might otherwise sit in a garage waiting for seats.\n\nIf Adam needs some inspiration, he might want to check out this story of a man who built his own Tesla Cybertruck on a budget. It\u2019s proof that with a little ingenuity and elbow grease, the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAdam\u2019s story highlights something we often forget when buying a used vehicle: the history matters. While the low mileage was certainly a selling point, it\u2019s clear that this Model X had a very specific job before it ended up on the resale market. For those considering a used Tesla, it\u2019s a reminder to dig deeper into the vehicle\u2019s past.\n\nAnd for those of you wondering whether a Model X is worth the hassle in snowy climates or for long road trips, you might find comfort in this article about a Model X owner who laughs at the naysayers. It\u2019s all about understanding the versatility of this vehicle and making it work for your needs: seats or no seats.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Adam?\n\nAdam has a few paths forward. He could go the salvage yard route and restore the Model X to its original setup. He could turn it into a custom camper, giving him a unique way to enjoy Tesla ownership. Or, he might even have a case against the dealer, depending on his local laws.\n\nFor those interested in customizing their Tesla interiors, there are companies offering vegan upholstery options and custom-made interiors. Adam might take this opportunity to make his Model X truly one-of-a-kind.\n\nWhat Do You Think?\n\nHave you ever purchased a used vehicle that came with unexpected surprises like Adam\u2019s Model X? If so, how did you handle it? Would you restore it to its original condition, or would you turn it into something entirely different, like Ronald suggested?\n\nLet us know in the comments! And if you\u2019ve ever considered turning your Tesla into a Christmas display, you might find this story both amusing and cautionary. Share your thoughts below, please.

            "content": "Tesla is refusing to do the right thing about \u2018Full Self-Driving\u2019 package transfers and instead holds its own incapacity to deliver the package over the head of its owners.\n\nI just had a conversation with Tesla about doing the right thing about FSD transfer. I got an answer: a \u201ccategoric no\u201d.\n\nTesla is literally using its own incapacity to deliver a feature it promised and sold to people, unsupervised self-driving, as a demand trigger to get people to order new cars.\n\nThe Context\n\nFor those who are not aware, Tesla has been selling since 2016 something called \u201cFull Self-Driving package\u201d, FSD for short, that includes advanced driver assist features, and the automaker has been promising that it will eventually result in unsupervised self-driving capability through over-the-air software updates.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nAt first, Tesla claimed that all cars produced since 2016 would be able to achieve that. However, Tesla quickly found out that it was wrong and introduced a new computer called HW3 in 2019 and retrofited vehicles with it.\n\nIn 2023, Tesla introduced again a new computer, HW4, but the automaker claimed that it would just add more computing power to improve capacity in the future, and it was still confident that it could deliver on its self-driving promises with HW3 cars.\n\nIn fact, Tesla CEO Elon Musk even claimed that software updates on HW4 cars would lag 6 months behind updates on HW3 cars as Tesla focuses on delivering on its self-driving promises on the older vehicles.\n\nThat lasted less than a year. Since last year, Tesla has been focusing updates on HW4 as it is reaching the compute limits of HW3. As we previously reported, Tesla is now using both nodes on the HW3 computer \u2013 meaning that it doesn\u2019t even have any compute redundancy, which is required for level 4-5 autonomy.\n\nLate last year, Tesla finally signaled that it might be reaching the limits of HW3 and said that it would provide computer retrofits if needed, but there\u2019s no retrofit in sight despite HW3 falling now months behind HW4 cars.\n\nWith the questionable hardware situation and the even more questionable data pointing to Tesla being way behind schedule on its self-driving ambition, Tesla FSD owners are asking for a simple thing from the automaker, and it can\u2019t even do that.\n\nThe Problem\n\nWith the situation looking dire for HW3, Tesla owners have been asking the automaker for years to link the FSD software package to the owner rather than the car \u2013 meaning that if you upgrade your car to a new Tesla, you can transfer your FSD software package, which you paid up to $15,000 for and Tesla never fully delivered, to the new car.\n\nDoesn\u2019t this sound fair? Tesla sold you a product they never delivered, and you are only giving them another shot on the newer hardware with a new car, which has a higher chance of success.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t cost Tesla anything since it\u2019s just a software package that it transfers to hardware that is standard on all cars.\n\nYet, Tesla has refused to do the right thing here. Musk was asked several times by Tesla owners about doing that and refused. Instead, he devised a plan to use Tesla\u2019s own inability to deliver self-driving capability as a demand trigger.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Musk finally agreed to allow FSD transfers, but not because it was the right thing to do. Instead, he said it would be a \u201cone-time amnesty\u201d for a single quarter. Tesla used this to boost sales in the quarter.\n\nTesla ended up bringing back the incentive four more times when it needed to boost orders, making Musk a liar for saying it would only be for a quarter. By claiming it\u2019s only for this one time, Tesla is creating urgency in trying to get people to upgrade \u2013 instead of doing the right thing and offering everyone who bought FSD the ability to transfer until Tesla actually delivers on its promise.\n\nCurrently, Tesla is not offering it because it doesn\u2019t need to. There are plenty of other factors boosting demand right now including the new Model Y, the fear of losing the tax credit in the US, and in Canada, Tesla just announced a price increase coming next month \u2013 pushing people to take delivery this month.\n\nI reached out to Tesla about transferring my FSD on a new car this week, and I was told \u201cthe FSD transfer window is closed right now\u201d. After explaining all this above to the salesperson and highlighting that it\u2019s the right thing to do not to charge me $11,000 for a software package that I already bought and they never delivered, they agreed to run it up the chain.\n\nThe next day, I was told that upper management responded: \u201ca categoric no.\u201d\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nIt\u2019s such a simple thing to do. It\u2019s not only the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also smart for Tesla as it reduces the obvious liability of having HW3 cars that paid for FSD.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s clear that Tesla will never be able to deliver on its promised unsupervised Full Self-Driving capabilities on HW3 cars. Should we really be surprised? Tesla was wrong before and had to upgrade cars from HW2.5 to HW3, which is now 6 years old.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t know what hardware it needed to deliver self-driving then, and there\u2019s a good chance it doesn\u2019t know now. But even then, would anyone seriously believe that Tesla would deliver unsupervised self-driving capability on 6-year-old hardware? I think not.\n\nTherefore, every HW3 vehicle Tesla sold with a FSD package is a liability. It makes for them to remove the packages from those cars and move them to more recent vehicles with a higher chance of ever delivering on their promise \u2013 even though there\u2019s plenty of room for doubt with those cars too.\n\nRegardless, It\u2019s about doing the right thing for your customers instead of using your own inability to deliver a product you promised as a demand lever for more orders. It\u2019s worse than the tactics used by car dealerships that Tesla despises so much.\n\nAs usual, I want to highlight that I think FSD is an incredible product, and if it was developed without Elon Musk claiming that it would achieve unsupervised self-driving by the end of every year for the last 5 years and Tesla selling the product to customers before it is ready, I think it would be much more celebrated.\n\nBut instead, Tesla and Musk are doing those things, and many people see it as a fraudulent and dangerous product. It doesn\u2019t help when the CEO grossly misrepresents data about the program.",

It has just 34 miles on the odometer and is built on the restyled and updated Model 3. However, the back of the car underwent a major redesign to accommodate a casket.\n\nPhoto by: Derks Funeral Mobility\n\nThe sheet metal from the front doors rearward is all-new, with a roof that bulges upward and outward at the back, ending in a massive hatch. The rear taillights, reintegrated into the redesigned rear fascia, remain unmodified. While the rear doors are gone, the Tesla features a pair of storage cubbies on both sides of the car behind the front doors.\n\nInside, the front cabin is unchanged from a stock Model 3. It has the brand\u2019s minimalistic styling and a large screen in the center of the dash. A partition separates the front seats from the massive cargo area that looks finished in high-quality materials. There\u2019s even an elegant lighting element in the ceiling that mimics a Rolls-Royce.\n\nCheck out the full listing here for more photos and info.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Beyond the immediate frustration for Tesla owners, incidents like these have broader implications.\n\nA Tesla owner in Australia shocked viewers after sharing security footage of their car being vandalized by a pedestrian, Australian news site news.com.au reported.\n\nThe incident, which occurred in Epping, Victoria, was captured by Tesla's Sentry Mode, a built-in camera system designed to monitor the car's surroundings.\n\nThe footage shows an elderly woman keying the vehicle, leaving a deep scratch from the rear passenger door to the left guard. It was shared on the Tesla Owners Australia Facebook page.\n\n\"Not sure if it is worth going through insurance,\" the car owner wrote on Facebook.\n\nThis incident is far from isolated. Teslas across Australia have frequently fallen victim to vandalism, often captured by Sentry Mode. This feature, part of Tesla's driver assistance package, activates when it detects suspicious motion near the vehicle. It can flash the car's lights, honk the horn, and record video to deter perpetrators. However, maintaining surveillance reduces the car's driving range.\n\nBeyond the immediate frustration for Tesla owners, incidents like these have broader implications. Vandalism of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure may discourage drivers from switching to an EV, slowing their adoption. While EV critics often point to the environmental impact of battery production and charging, studies show that EVs are cleaner over their lifetime compared to gas-powered cars. Transitioning to clean energy involves far less mining overall than the ongoing extraction of dirty fuels and no air pollution from driving.\n\nThis isn't the first time EVs have been vandalized. Footage from different Tesla owners shows a man puncturing a Cybertruck tire, another man throwing concrete through a Model Y window, and a kid spraying a vehicle with shaving cream. EV charging networks are even getting their cords cut.\n\nDespite these challenges, governments and EV companies are working to accelerate EV adoption, from federal tax credits to free charging to lower costs.\n\nIn response to the keying incident in Australia, fellow Tesla owners expressed outrage.\n\n\"What's with all the hate for Teslas in Australia?\" one person commented on Facebook.\n\n\n\n\"This type of behaviour is increasing and far too common here,\" said another.\n\nAs one person put it: \"I honestly can't comprehend the hatred towards EVs or renewables.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more and waste less, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "On January 23, Tesla released an updated version of Model Y, one of its best-selling cars in Canada, Europe, and the United States, weeks after it was released in China. Elon Musk\u2019s EV maker has introduced a new price of $60,000 in the US for a revamped version, 25% higher than its predecessor which cost around $50,000. Starting at $59,990 for the \u201cLaunch Series,\u201d this update shows Tesla\u2019s continued drive to stay ahead in the electric vehicle market.\n\nTiming is crucial for Tesla, as vehicle deliveries have dropped in early 2024 compared to last year. The company has told investors it\u2019s balancing \u201ctwo major growth waves,\u201d driven by the Model Y\u2019s popularity. Plans for new, more affordable models are also in the works, though pricing details are still unclear.\n\nTesla Model Y Global Launch\n\nWith the launch, Tesla now offers four versions of the Model Y in the U.S., with the new model priced higher than even the performance variant. The new variant includes the supervised full self-driving software, which was previously an $8,000 optional add-on in other Model Y cars. The deliveries of new cars will begin in March 2025.\n\nAs market conditions change, analysts believe even small updates could reignite interest in the Model Y. With a loyal customer base, Tesla\u2019s facelift might attract existing owners who were starting to feel bored with the previous model\u2019s familiarity.\n\nTesla Model Y Features: What\u2019s New?\n\nThe refreshed Model Y comes with several exciting upgrades that boost both its looks and functionality. On the exterior, the front end has been redesigned with a sleek, modern light strip, aligning with Tesla\u2019s upcoming Cybercab and giving the vehicle a futuristic appeal.\n\nInside, the Model Y gets notable enhancements, including ambient lighting for a more luxurious feel, a larger second-row touchscreen for easier control by rear passengers, and power-folding rear seats to make cargo management more convenient for owners.\n\nWhat\u2019s Tesla\u2019s Next Big Move?\n\nWith Tesla seeing lower global delivery numbers and tough competition, the big question is whether these upgrades will be enough to keep interest and sales strong. The updated Model Y is set to debut in China in March, kicking off its rollout. However, Tesla has yet to confirm when it will launch in Europe and the U.S., which could impact its edge in these important markets.\n\nTesla Stock Update\n\nTesla stock had a wild week, with prices swinging a lot. Last week, Tesla shares ranged from $406.31 to $439.74, closing at $415.11 on January 23rd, down 2.11% from the previous day. This marks a 3.36% drop from the week\u2019s starting price of $428.22.",

It is the Autopilot computer, where all the vehicle\u2019s cameras connect, enabling real-time data processing and analysis.\n\nThis particular unit is not the standard FSD unit that\u2019s being shipped with the current, now \u201cfirst-gen\u201d Model Y. The biggest sign that it differs from the current AI4 computer is that it features a connector for the front bumper camera. While the 2024 Model 3 was expected to come with a front bumper camera, it was only ever available on the Cybertruck and will soon be available on the new 2025 Model Y.\n\nThis is similar to the physical connector for the front bumper camera present in newer iterations of the Model S and Model X computers. These vehicles were originally slated to get a bumper camera last year, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet. We reported back in 2022 that they received the additional camera hook-ups but no camera.\n\nTesla recently issued a recall for the AI4 computer, citing physical and software issues that could cause a potential short on the board. According to Green, this board is not the recalled unit but could instead be a replacement unit. However, why the board includes a front bumper camera connection remains a mystery.\n\nNot a Juniper FSD Computer\n\nWe know that this isn\u2019t the correct part for the refreshed Model Y Juniper because it lacks a connector for the secondary rear screen in the upcoming model.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla has labeled this computer unit as \u201cMY Reloaded\u201d - previous versions of the computer for the Model Y were listed as just \u201cMY.\u201d In addition, all the other computer versions have been pulled from Tesla\u2019s Electronic Parts Catalogue - only this one is now available as Part #2003160-S0-E.\n\nSpeculation\n\nThis new FSD hardware doesn\u2019t appear to match the current or new Model Y, so what could it be? Well, there are a few things here. Tesla wouldn\u2019t bother populating that front bumper camera slot for no reason - and this computer is a slightly different form factor than the one that goes in the Model S and Model X - so they\u2019re not just sharing parts between the Model S and Model Y.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that Tesla is planning to replace any faulty AI4 computers with this updated part. But could Tesla be open to offering a retrofit for the front bumper camera? It\u2019s important to note that this is not the hardware upgrade that many HW3 owners are waiting for. It is a different form factor than the HW3 computer and wouldn\u2019t fit in HW3 vehicles. If anything, this is a potential replacement for the AI4 computer to support forward compatibility if FSD ever requires a bumper camera.\n\nBumper Camera Retrofit?\n\nIs Tesla planning to offer a front bumper camera retrofit? Maybe. Tesla doesn\u2019t typically offer retrofits. They did for several items in the past, but they have largely stopped doing so.\n\nTesla included a front bumper camera on the refreshed Model Y Juniper, as well as on the Cybertruck - and it could be extremely useful for both Actually Smart Summon and FSD to remove the frontal blind spot.\n\nHowever, it could be an optional feature rather than a retrofit feature. Until FSD Unsupervised arrives, we won\u2019t know for sure whether a bumper camera is required.\n\nFor now, it would be best to keep an eye on this. Just like the Model S and Model X having the slot populated, it may not necessarily happen, but it leaves the door open for a future upgrade if necessary.",

            "content": "The British campaign group Led By Donkeys has claimed responsibility for the stunt that authorities say may have breached German laws on the use of symbols linked to illegal organizations.\n\nGerman authorities are investigating images projected onto the Tesla Gigafactory just outside Berlin that depicted Elon Musk apparently performing a Nazi-style salute at US President Donald Trump's recent inauguration.\n\nThe projection appeared on the outer facade of the electric vehicle factory in Gr\u00fcnheide, just outside the capital's city limits, on Thursday night, with the image of Tesla owner Musk accompanied by the German word \"Heil\" (hail).\n\nIn conjunction with the name of Musk's company, this formed the phrase \"Heil Tesla\" \u2014 a play on \"Heil Hitler,\" the phrase which accompanied the use of the Nazi stiff-armed salute during dictator Adolf Hitler's time in power.\n\nMusk made a gesture twice in quick succession during a speech in Washington at an event celebrating the start of Trump's second term in office. The move has sparked a debate as to whether his raised-arm gesture constituted a Nazi salute, and has been celebrated by US white nationalists.\n\nNow, German security services have launched an investigation into the suspected use of symbols of anti-constitutional organizations, including the depicted salute itself, the use or display of which is illegal in Germany.\n\n\"After an appraisal by the responsible public prosecutor in Frankfurt (Oder), the projection of several logos by as-yet unknown individuals and the distribution of the images online at least merits an initial suspicion of the use of symbols of anti-constitutional organizations,\" read a police statement.\n\n'Led By Donkeys': UK campaign group claims responsibility\n\nResponsibility for the stunt has now been claimed by the British political campaign group Led By Donkeys, in conjunction with the German satirical Center for Political Beauty.\n\nSome on the political left in Germany contended that if authorities convict any of the group's members for projecting an illegal image, it would show \u2014 in Germany at least \u2014 that the gesture was indeed a Nazi salute and not a means of thanking the members of the audience at his speech as Musk and other have said.\n\nFollowing the publication of the images online, several social media users and news outlets initially questioned the veracity of the stunt.\n\nAfter initially denying that the action had actually taken place, a German police spokesman later told local public broadcaster RBB that officers were \"no longer assuming that it didn't happen,\" having analyzed images online and been present at the site.\n\nOriginally established as an anti-Brexit campaign group in December 2018, Led By Donkeys has regularly carried out similar stunts in the United Kingdom, targeting populist British politicians such as former Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson and far-right Brexit hard-liner Nigel Farage in videos beamed onto famous buildings such as the Houses of Parliament in London.\n\nActivists promise more stunts in the future\n\nPhilipp Ruch, artistic lead for the Center for Political Beauty, told the German dpa news agency that activists had used a special projector to beam a video onto the outside of the Tesla building from a distance of several hundred meters. He promised similar stunts in the future.\n\n\"The world's richest man, Elon Musk, is promoting the far right in Europe,\" wrote Led By Donkeys in a social media post accompanying the video that had been projected onto the factory. \"Don't buy a Tesla.\"\n\nA group spokesman told the British Press Association that Musk was \"using his wealth from Tesla to back far-right parties and degrade democracy,\" and that he \"shouldn't be surprised if people don't fancy driving round in his cars for much longer. Increasingly, it's not a great look.\"\n\nMusk has yet to comment on the stunt, but responded earlier this week to claims he made two Nazi salutes by saying: \"Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\" He later also posted a series of puns on X using the names of Nazi war criminals.\n\nEven after calling for people to \"give one another a bit of grace\" following Musk's gestures on Inauguration Day, the US Anti-Defamation League has condemned the post on X.\n\n\"Making inappropriate and highly offensive jokes that trivialize the Holocaust only serve to minimize the evil and inhumanity of Nazi crimes, denigrate the suffering of both victims and survivors and insult the memory of the six million Jews murdered in the Shoah,\" the group said.\n\nmf/sms (AFP, dpa)",

Time for a poke around\n\nSkip 10 photos in the image carousel and continue reading Turn on Javascript to see all the available pictures. 1 / 10\n\nPrecisely two weeks after it surfaced on t\u2019internet, we\u2019ve now had our first chance to poke around the refreshed Tesla Model Y ahead of its arrival in Europe in March. Fancy a game of Spot the Difference? And by \u2018refreshed\u2019 we mean exactly that: this \u2018new Model Y\u2019 is in fact a mid-life facelift, and so all the Big Stuff \u2013 yup, motors and batteries \u2013 has been left well alone.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nAfter 3.5 million sales in five years the name of the game for the best-selling car in the world is\u2026 efficiency. Not terribly exciting, but a raft of changes to the exterior have unlocked more range and more speed. We\u2019ll get to the numbers shortly. First, you\u2019ll notice the headlights have been ditched in favour of a full-width, three-piece lightbar akin to the Cybertruck and Cybercab, sitting atop a new (and lower) nose complete with aero ducts for greater effi\u2026 yeah, that.\n\nHidden down there is a new front camera, which gets its own fluid washer and heating so that it, y\u2019know, works in winter. Meanwhile Tesla says the standard 19in wheels are better at slipping through the air, as are the redesigned tailgate, spoiler (made from advanced thermoplastics) and rear fascia. The diffuser is longer and wider, and adds downforce.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nThere\u2019s another lightbar back here too, but this one\u2019s a single-piece measuring 1.6m across and is actually hidden from view, so what you see is its reflection and not the light itself. Intriguing. Inside, Tesla is promising more comfort than before, with front- and second-row seats (now all heated and ventilated for good measure) redesigned to offer more support. It has also stiffened the body, fiddled with the suspension geometry and borrowed damping tech from the latest Model 3 in an effort to improve the ride. The Model Y ought to be quieter too, with acoustic glass used, er, everywhere, while extra sound-damping materials allegedly reduce road, impact and wind noise. Shh. Oh, and your eyes are not deceiving you, there is \u2013 praise be! \u2013 an indicator stalk, rather than the steering wheel arrows that were so clumsily applied to the Model S. Seems like Tesla is listening to feedback. There is still a combination of haptic and physical buttons, but of course most of the features are scattered about the touchscreen anyway.\n\nLooking for more from the USA?

The ageing model lost some sales momentum last year, hurt by competition from rivals in China, while in other markets demand for electric vehicles has weakened.\n\n(Reporting by Gursimran Kaur in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona and Rashmi Aich)",

            "content": "Kia owners were supposed to get access to Tesla Superchargers on January 15, but that timeline was recently delayed. Some owners had figured out a loophole to charge, but it turns out, that loophole is now closed.\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy time for the North American EV industry\u2019s transition to NACS, the charging standard originally advanced by Tesla and now standardized by SAE.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently seen several brands added to the \u201ccoming soon\u201d list, and even beyond that, VW and Honda have both made their own announcements that access is coming soon.\n\nBut this past couple weeks were supposed to be even busier, with Kia having previously planned to roll out Supercharger access on January 15th, according to an announcement the company made back in September. Unfortunately there was a delay, and Kia owners will have to wait until later this quarter for official support.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nIn the meantime, though, owners had found that you could trick the system into letting you charge by telling it that you have a Hyundai. Hyundai and Kia both build their EVs on the same E-GMP platform, so there are a lot of similarities between them.\n\nKia, like Hyundai, is also in the process of shipping some of the first vehicles with a native NACS port, with the 2025 EV6 including a native NACS port, much like the 2025 Ioniq 5 does. So this similarity seemed to be able to trick the Supercharger network, and Kia EV6s could charge on it for a little while, assuming use of a third-party adapter.\n\nLast week, we reported on this loophole, and were hearing of many owners who had success charging.\n\nBut that method no longer works, according to several Kia owners. Now, when attempting to charge at a Tesla Supercharger with an EV6 and adapter, the Tesla app will tell you \u201cUnknown error occurred \u2013 Your vehicle is not able to charge at Superchargers at this time.\u201d This has been confirmed to be the case even on Supercharger sites that were previously working.\n\nProbably one of the reasons for this is the use of third-party adapters. While third-party adapters are available, manufacturers are always wary when owners use non-verified equipment \u2013 especially when it\u2019s related to the most expensive part of the car, the battery. Since first-party adapters aren\u2019t available yet, everyone would probably rather wait until they are.\n\nKia themselves told us that \u201cwarranty coverage may be impacted by use of a third party or aftermarket adapter, and we expect to have our authorized version available in late Q1 2025\u201d when we contacted them about our previous article (though we\u2019re not sure how that would shake out legally \u2013 there are a lot of laws covering car warranties and what can and cannot void them).\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen some mix-ups with Supercharger access. Last November, Tesla announced that Nissan cars had access to Superchargers, but it turned out they jumped the gun. Everything is hunky-dory now for Nissan, and it seems like a bunch of new brands will gain access in the coming months, but we expect a few more fits and starts along the way (chaos tends to happen when you fire the whole Supercharger team for no reason).\n\nBut, once EV6s do gain access to Superchargers, we expect to see them show exceptional charge performance. The EV6\u2019s cousin, the Ioniq 5, recently showed that it can charge faster than a Tesla, even on Tesla\u2019s home turf. The EV6 should be able to accomplish similar feats, once it is unleashed onto North America\u2019s biggest charging network.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy one of the fastest-charging EVs on the road today, use our link to check local dealers and get in line for when they get the new 2025 Kia EV6s in stock.\n\nBut when you\u2019re charging at *home*, charge your electric vehicle using rooftop solar panels.

There\u2019s only one trim listed on the website currently, the Long Range all-wheel drive christened as the \"Launch Series.\"\n\nThe automaker said deliveries of the U.S.-spec version would begin in March at $59,990 before factoring in destination, taxes and incentives. That makes this trim about $12,000 more expensive than the equivalent trim of the current generation Model Y.\n\nGallery: 2025 Tesla Model Y Juniper (U.S. Spec) 30 Tesla\n\nIt gets a small range boost, 320 miles compared to the 311 miles on the current Long Range AWD version. It can apparently add 154 miles of range in 15 minutes of DC fast charging. On the performance front, it appears to be considerably quicker. Its 0-60 miles per hour time is 4.1 seconds, compared to 4.8 seconds before.\n\nThat said, the Launch Series appears to follow a similar philosophy as the Foundation Series Cybertruck. It's fully kitted out with Full-Self Driving (Supervised) as standard, a vegan suede interior and Launch Series badging all around.\n\nWe expect Tesla to release other trims sometime down the line. And they will all have plenty of things in common. That includes the most notable visual upgrades that we saw on the China-spec version earlier this month. The design is now sleeker and draws inspiration from the Robotaxi and the Cybertruck. It sports a sleek, full-width light bar up front and a chunky one at the rear.\n\nThe cabin is now claimed to be quieter thanks to upgraded suspension, acoustic glass and redesigned body castings, which Tesla says contribute to a \"whisper-quiet\" ride. There's an additional 8-inch touchscreen at the back and the second-row seats, which previously had manual fold, are now powered. The front seats now get ventilation\u2014they already had heating and power adjustability before. Tesla has also dialed down the hyper minimalism a bit by installing a turn signal stalk.\n\nThe Model Y has been Tesla's best-seller and also the best-selling car in the world in 2023 of all categories. Tesla will hope to drive significant volumes of this updated version, given that its lineup has been aging, its sales dropped for the first time in a decade last year and rivals are quickly catching up.\n\nThe Model Y Launch Series seems rather expensive, but we're expecting more affordable versions eventually. We'll see how much they can help revitalize Tesla's sales this year.\n\nHave a tip?

            "content": "Tesla has announced that its redesigned Model Y SUV is coming to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in March, with a starting price just shy of $60,000.\n\nThe news comes just two weeks after Tesla revealed the new-look Model Y and said the SUV was coming to China and other Asian markets, also in March. Thursday\u2019s announcement means the company is effectively launching the revamped SUV simultaneously around the globe \u2014 a departure from the multiple-month gap between the Asian and North American launch of the Model 3 sedan refresh in late 2023 and early 2024.\n\nThe redesigned Model Y is being launched at a crucial time for Tesla, which delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than it did in 2023. Tesla has repeatedly warned investors that it is in between \u201ctwo major growth waves\u201d coming off the success of the Model Y and promised that it will roll out mysterious new models meant to be built on existing production lines. Those models will likely be cheaper than Tesla\u2019s current offerings (which start in the low $40,000 range), but it\u2019s not clear by how much.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has implied those new models, plus the Cybercab that was teased last October, will help bridge the company\u2019s evolution from an automaker into a robotics and AI player.\n\nBut at the same time, Tesla\u2019s vehicle lineup has been aging. Tesla has now refreshed each of its core vehicles \u2014 the Model S and 3 sedans and the Model X and Y SUVs. It has only launched one truly new model in the last four years, the Cybertruck. While it became the best-selling electric truck in the U.S. in 2024, the Cybertruck did little to boost the company\u2019s bottom line last year, and it does not seem to be the runaway hit Musk had hoped for.\n\nThe new-look Model Y could offer some relief, although it is coming in at a higher price point than the existing versions. The starting price for the \u201cLaunch Series\u201d special edition, which is an all-wheel-drive variant, is $59,990. That gets buyers a 320-mile range battery and it includes Tesla\u2019s most advanced driver-assistance software, which it calls \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised)\u201d \u2014 typically an $8,000 option. The older Model Y currently starts at $44,990 for a 337-mile rear-wheel drive version.\n\nThe most noticeable changes to the new Model Y come on the exterior, where the bubbly front fascia has been ditched in favor of a more cinched nose with a thin light bar that stretches across the hood. The rear of the vehicle also now has a light strip that stretches the full width.\n\nInside the refreshed SUV, Tesla has added a configurable light strip that rims the cabin. There\u2019s a new rear-passenger touchscreen and some quality-of-life upgrades like powered rear seats and improved suspension.",

He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.\n\nJust a couple weeks after launching the refreshed \u201cJuniper\u201d Model Y in China and other Asia-Pacific markets, Tesla has started taking orders in the Americas (US, Canada, Mexico, and Chile) and Europe. The Launch Series is the only trim level currently available to order in the US, offering a \u201cfully loaded\u201d setup with special badging, the Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assist, and Acceleration Boost for $59,990 before discounts and estimated savings.\n\nThe refreshed version of Tesla\u2019s top-selling vehicle brings a new design for the front and rear lights, an updated interior with an 8-inch touchscreen for the backseat, acoustic glass treatment, a new sound system with more speakers, and a retuned suspension. There\u2019s no mention of it, but in a few of the pictures (included in our gallery below), it looks like there\u2019s also a turn signal stalk poking out to the left of the steering wheel instead of dropping it for on-wheel buttons like other recent Teslas.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other issues affecting Tesla\u2019s brand reputation among buyers, and it recently reported its first year-over-year drop in sales that a new lighting setup might not be enough to address.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 23 New Tesla Model Y (2025) Image: Tesla\n\nIt also has the same new front-facing camera that Tesla says adds \u201cEnhanced visibility for Autopilot and Actually Smart Summon capabilities.\u201d\n\nJust like the previously announced markets, it is scheduled to start deliveries in March.

            "content": "Miles keep accumulating on our long-term review 2023 Tesla Model Y, but I don\u2019t drive it much anymore. Sure, I still go all over the place in our Tesla, but I don't drive\u2014the car does. Its Full Self Driving (FSD) software can take me pretty much wherever with me simply supervising. I'm covering thousands of miles doing exactly that as a passenger behind the wheel.\n\nI\u2019m not using FSD because it\u2019s bringing me much utility or, much less, enjoyment. I\u2019m using it because we paid $15,000 for this software (it costs $8,000 today), and I\u2019m going to do my job and report on how it works, dammit.\n\nThat\u2019s despite FSD giving me many, many reasons to forsake it, to decide that my safety and sanity are worth more than what it cost. Yet the Full Self Driving note I created in my phone to log the system\u2019s transgressions has an ever-increasing abundance of entries as we pile the miles onto our Model Y.\n\nDumb and Dangerous Decisions\n\nFor example, there was the time it failed to recognize an increased speed limit sign and continued bumbling along at a 15-mph deficit. In stark contrast, later in that same drive, it detected a 55-mph speed limit sign specific to vehicles towing (which it wasn\u2019t), decelerating from 75 mph so rapidly that traffic behind had to swerve around the Model Y. Moments later, FSD decided to change lanes to follow the navigation route toward its next turn\u2014still some 10 miles away\u2014cutting someone off in the process.\n\nAnother time on a two-lane highway, it attempted to pass by changing from the left lane into the right lane immediately before an on-ramp. It nearly collided with a vehicle merging on, avoiding that by moving left to fall back behind the traffic it just tried to get by.\n\nOn a different day, FSD deviated from my navigation route because it neglected to recognize that the lane it was occupying became right turn only. After making that turn, it wanted to correct its error and resume the route by making a U-turn at the next intersection, where a \u201cNo U-Turn\u201d sign was clearly posted. It tried to make its illegal U-turn from the right side of that double-protected left turn, such that if I hadn\u2019t intervened it would\u2019ve overlapped with the vehicle turning from the left-side lane.\n\nOr, when crawling through freeway traffic in the left lane, it began inexplicably swerving side to side, rather displeasing a motorcyclist legally lane-splitting.\n\nFSD\u2019s errors aren't always dangerous. More often, they\u2019re just asinine. Like when our Model Y didn\u2019t react to a green arrow for a protected right turn, inconveniencing me and drivers behind. Or entered a packed intersection as a yellow light expired, coming to a stop inside a crosswalk. Or braked hard after it accelerated up a freeway on-ramp because it detected an inactive traffic control signal. Or when it encountered an unexpected road closure and drove around the same block three times because each time it arrived back at the closure it failed to recalculate its route. Who knows how long FSD might\u2019ve kept circling had I not turned it off.\n\nIs Tesla FSD 13 Better?\n\nAll these errors occurred with older FSD software. With the newest version 13 Telsa recently added to our Model Y via over-the-air update, FSD is hugely improved. It moves more fluidly and confidently. Crucially, how often I must take over to prevent it from doing something sketchy has been reduced from frequently to nearly never (as we go to press, our Model Y is on \u201cbeta\u201d version 13.2.2). Nevertheless, FSD 13 continues to make utterly baffling and deeply idiotic driving decisions.\n\nFSD 13 offers three profiles for its behavior. In the \u201cStandard\u201d logic, it nearly refuses to get around traffic to reach the speed limit or its set maximum speed, even when passing on the left would be simple and safe. Using the \u201cHurry\u201d logic makes it more assertive but also impolite as it then hogs the left lane, brazenly uses right lanes to speed past other drivers, and begins lane changes on the first click of the turn signal. \u201cChill\u201d logic is unbearable for getting places in a timely manner.\n\nTwice in a week, FSD 13 completely missed freeway exits because it shifted over too late to negotiate fitting in with other traffic. Those bungles are bizarre given FSD 13\u2019s tendency to otherwise move toward exits literal miles early, often abdicating the fast-moving left lane to fall behind slow vehicles to the right\u2014vehicles it could\u2019ve passed had it stayed put for longer. When merging onto a freeway, it will stubbornly attempt to fit into a gap regardless of whether those other closest drivers seem willing to allow it, ignoring suitable openings immediately ahead or behind. Generally, its lane shifting strategy is poor; I\u2019ve counted as many as eight back-and-forth lane changes within a minute as FSD 13 tries to figure out what to do. The day this article was due, it veered toward a wall as two lanes converged into one.\n\nIf simple cruise control was the genesis for any self-driving tech, then FSD 13 represents an ignominious legacy as it struggles to maintain speeds. Once, it gradually relaxed its cruise speed to 64 mph in a 65 mph zone, when the maximum speed I allowed for it was 75 mph. There was absolutely no traffic, faulty input, or other detectable reason for this slowing. At other times, it doesn't keep up with leading traffic accelerating to the speed limit, driving slower than necessary and letting a gap ahead grow even when the Hurry logic is selected.\n\nOne would also hope that software ostensibly aware of the physical dimensions and dynamic abilities of the Tesla it controls would know how to avoid hitting markers along freeway curves and keep itself centered in the lane. Not FSD 13.\n\nIn myriad ways, FSD 13 lacks the situational awareness and intuition to get through urban environments effectively. It can't comprehend the limitless variables human drivers naturally learn over time. Rules of the road and FSD\u2019s approach to them might not change throughout any given day, but the reality on the ground does, as traffic and environmental factors evolve. The limitations of FSD\u2019s ability to perceive its surroundings or imagine them as they approach make it unable to be proactive and anticipatory like a good human driver.\n\nBetter Isn\u2019t Good\n\nMaybe \u201cgood human driver\u201d is too high a standard to hold FSD to. Perhaps I\u2019m misinterpreting the true meaning of \u201cFull Self-Driving.\" It's just software, after all, and Tesla\u2019s improvements to FSD have been significant. Since downloading version 13, additions to my phone notes have become less frequent. Typically, FSD navigates complex road situations safely and skillfully. It makes Teslas the closest things there are to commercially available autonomous cars. Don't discount how the software continues to improve\u2014to envision what it could be in a year or decade is exciting.\n\nUnfortunately for FSD right now, I am a good human driver. I\u2019m the standard I hold it against. It is not better than me\u2014nor any driver I know, for that matter. FSD makes far too many dimwitted, boneheaded maneuvers to be forgiven for driving so badly or constantly wasting my time. I imagine the main reasons why anyone who bought FSD would want to keep using it is because they\u2019re curious from a technology development perspective or have an affinity for Tesla. Or perhaps they feel the need to justify what they spent on this unfinished software. If this were my own Model Y, I would\u2019ve quit using FSD long ago. But it isn\u2019t, so I endure.\n\nMore on Our Long-Term 2023 Tesla Model Y Long Range:",

            "content": "I have been reading and watching YouTube reviews of electric vehicles for about the last year. It is 5 years since I bought my Hybrid Camry HL.\n\nI upgrade every 5 years, and my kids get the hand me down. I had decided a year ago to get an electric car this time. I have been disappointed by the attitude of Toyota basically forcing their loyal customers to hybrids to protect their service income.\n\nIn my research it came down to a choice between the BYD Sealion 7, Tesla Y, and the Xpeng G6. I needed a vehicle that was easy to get in and out of. I have an elderly mother who has difficulty bending her neck, so a low car like the BYD Seal was out of the question.\n\nI test drove a Tesla Y and the BYD Atto 3 as hire vehicles. I was not impressed with the harsh ride of the Tesla and the lack of comforts. The BYD Atto3 was a better drive than the Tesla but again has not been upgraded in a while.\n\nIn the reviews I watched it seemed the Xpeng G6 had more tech than the Sealion, which had slower charging, and less driver assist features. I paid a $1,000 deposit online in November and then waited.\n\nI initially put a deposit on the Long-Range model (larger NMC battery and faster charging). I wrote in to the Driven as I was unsure about the difference between the NMC and LFP batteries and Bryce Gaton was very helpful in his detailed answer.\n\nI changed my booking to the standard model. I finally got a call on 4 December while I was in Tasmania on holiday to say my vehicle had arrived.\n\nI did a test drive on 17 December and was very impressed. I drove it home to see how mum could get in and out. She had no trouble. The high roof made it very easy, and the seat height made getting in and out easy also.\n\nShe found it much easier to stand from the raised seat with her weak quadriceps. The tech is very intuitive and well designed. The seats are very comfortable and the whole interior fit out is premium. I arranged to pick up my car which I got on 31 December.\n\nThings I have really enjoyed.\n\nThe Lane Centring Control (LCC) and radar cruise control works very well on the freeway and at speed. The automatic lane changing also works well. The Auto Park function is easy to use though a bot nerve racking as it seems to overcorrect but still get it right. I have enjoyed using the straight line summon feature in tight car parks.\n\nThe sound system (18 speakers including some in driver\u2019s headrest for phone calls and music) is excellent with a full range and wonderful clarity. There is so much space inside. My son-in-law is over 7 foot tall (215 cm), and he had a spare 8 cm above his head with the seat at normal height. He has never experienced that much space in any vehicle. Even with the seat back for his long legs there was plenty of space in the back. The reclining rear seats is a clever addition.\n\nI used the standard power point charger which only provided 1.8 to 2 kw per hour for the first week. That worked fine by charging at night while the car was parked. I have now had a Tesla wall connector fitted which gives me 7Kw per hour which is plenty for my needs.\n\nThe Xpeng G6 is capable of charging at up to 280 kW so on any long trips should charge in 20 minutes at the right supercharger. I have not yet tested this out. So far on average it is using 14kW per 100km in everyday driving which I am delighted by.\n\nI expected it to use more Kw for a 2-tonne car. The acceleration is smooth and has plenty of grunt. I can easily believe the 6.2 secs claimed for 0-100km/h which is more than enough to lose plenty of points of you choose.\n\nIt handles well and I was very impressed by the wet weather handling (we have had very heavy rain here in Queensland). The LCC even worked in heavy rain though I did hold the steering more tightly.\n\nIf I ever yawn the camera watching warns me with a drowsiness alert. Sometimes it alerts unnecessarily but mostly it is vastly better than many of the other vehicles with lane departure warnings (like the ATTO3, Tesla Y and MG which drive me to distraction when I rented them).\n\nThere is one pedestrian island I have to swerve around where it reliably beeps at me but otherwise it has been good.\n\nThe 20-inch Michelin tyres do a great job. It would be nice to have some customisation possible for the suspension but that is for another day. Driving on X-pedal (one pedal) is easy and efficient.\n\nOne downside has been the complete lack of any contact from Xpeng or their representatives. I picked up my car from the local VW dealer acting as their agent. The guys at VW had no idea about the Xpeng G6 and so I had to figure it out myself.\n\nBut it is very intuitive so that was not too hard. I am concerned however should there be a problem who I would make contact with. As far as I am aware there is not yet a Brisbane dealer. I understand the showroom in Sydney is open. It will be interesting to see how Xpeng does with the plethora of Chinese and other Ev models arriving.\n\nI am delighted with my decision so far.",

            "content": "The case of mistaken identity was quickly resolved, but scientists say it shows the need for transparency around spaceflight traffic in deep space.\n\nThat\u2019s no asteroid. That\u2019s \u2026 a car? Credit: SpaceX\n\nOn Jan. 2, the Minor Planet Center at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced the discovery of an unusual asteroid, designated 2018 CN41. First identified and submitted by a citizen scientist, the object\u2019s orbit was notable: It came less than 150,000 miles (240,000 km) from Earth, closer than the orbit of the Moon. That qualified it as a near-Earth object (NEO) \u2014 one worth monitoring for its potential to someday slam into Earth.\n\nBut less than 17 hours later, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) issued an editorial notice: It was deleting 2018 CN41 from its records because, it turned out, the object was not an asteroid.\n\nIt was a car.\n\nTo be precise, it was Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Roadster mounted to a Falcon Heavy upper stage, which boosted into orbit around the Sun on Feb. 6, 2018. The car \u2014 which had been owned and driven by Musk \u2014 was a test payload for the Falcon Heavy\u2019s first flight. At the time, it received a great deal of notoriety as the first production car to be flung into space, complete with a suited-up mannequin in the driver\u2019s seat named Starman.\n\nThe case of mistaken identity was resolved swiftly in a collaboration between professional and amateur astronomers. But some astronomers say it is also emblematic of a growing issue: the lack of transparency from nations and companies operating craft in deep space, beyond the orbits used by most satellites. While objects in lower Earth orbits are tracked by the U.S. Space Force, deeper space remains an unregulated frontier.\n\nIf left unchecked, astronomers say the growing number of untracked objects could hinder efforts to protect Earth from potentially hazardous asteroids. They could lead to wasted observing effort and \u2014 if sufficiently numerous \u2014 even throw off statistical analyses of the threat posted by near-Earth asteroids, said Center for Astrophysics (CfA) astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell in an email to Astronomy. \u201cWorst case, you spend a billion launching a space probe to study an asteroid and only realize it\u2019s not an asteroid when you get there,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it is a problem that is set to worsen as more nations and companies venture to the Moon and beyond.\n\nA \u2019deplorable\u2019 problem\n\nThe Minor Planet Center \u2014 which operates under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union \u2014 is the globally accepted authority on handling observations and reports of new asteroids, comets, and other small bodies in the solar system. Its responsibilities include identifying, designating, and computing their orbits.\n\nIt is also no stranger to spacecraft and discarded rocket stages masquerading as asteroids. In the 2000s, NASA\u2019s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), stationed in deep space around a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, made it multiple times onto the MPC\u2019s Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP), a list of NEOs pending confirmation. And in 2007, the MPC had to retire the asteroid designation 2007 VN84 when the object was discovered to be the Rosetta spacecraft \u2014 a high-profile European mission then performing a flyby of Earth en route to make the first ever landing on a comet.\n\n\u201cThis incident, along with previous NEOCP postings of the WMAP spacecraft, highlights the deplorable state of availability of positional information on distant artificial objects,\u201d the MPC fumed when it retracted 2007 VN84. \u201cA single source for information on all distant artificial objects would be very desirable.\u201d\n\nThat central repository has yet to manifest itself. And the rise in space launches coupled with advances in telescope surveys means the MPC is seeing an uptick in reports of artificial objects, said the center\u2019s director, Matthew Payne, in an email.\n\nThese include defunct craft and rocket boosters as well as operational space missions. Spacecraft that are swinging by Earth for a gravity assist (like Rosetta) to more distant locales are particularly prone to being misidentified as near-Earth asteroids. So are spacecraft stationed at the L2 Lagrange point of gravitational stability beyond the Moon, like WMAP.\n\nOver the course of 2020 through 2022, at least four spacecraft were added to the MPC\u2019s asteroid record books \u2014 and quickly deleted. They include the European-Japanese BepiColombo mission (in transit to Mercury), NASA\u2019s Lucy mission (headed to the Trojan asteroids in Jupiter\u2019s orbit), the Spektr-RG X-ray observatory at L2, and what is thought to be the Centaur upper rocket stage for the 1966 Surveyor 2 lunar probe.\n\nFor the Falcon Heavy\u2019s first test flight, the upper stage launched Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Roadster onto a Sun-orbiting trajectory that takes it past Mars. Credit: SpaceX\n\nUncontrolled space\n\nCloser to Earth, spacecraft are monitored and tracked with much more more scrutiny. Satellites in Earth orbit are regulated by national and international agencies, like the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Companies also routinely publish orbit information for their own satellites, traditionally in a format known as two-line elements (TLEs). These data are collated by the U.S. Space Force, which also performs its own radar tracking observations and issues alerts to operators when two satellites are at risk of colliding so that they can take avoiding actions. Sharing positions and trajectories is generally in companies\u2019 best interest as it protects their own assets from collisions and helps prevents destructive clouds of debris that could, in a worst-case scenario, render near-Earth space unusable.\n\nBut the situation is different in deep space, which is filled with a growing fleet of spacecraft at the Moon, in orbit around the Sun, and at associated Lagrange points of gravitational stability. Because of the Tesla Roadster\u2019s fame, it happens to be included in a database maintained by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab called Horizons, which computes orbits for natural bodies in the solar system. But disclosing artificial bodies\u2019 trajectories in deep space is not a standard industry practice.\n\nDeep space is \u201clargely unregulated,\u201d McDowell told a special-session audience Jan. 14 at the American Astronomical Society\u2019s (AAS) winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. \u201cThere\u2019s no requirement to file some kind of public flight plan, no equivalent of the TLEs or the corporate data that we get for low-orbit satellites.\u201d\n\nMcDowell has also been critical of the asteroid mining startup AstroForge, which plans to launch two probes this year, ridesharing on the Intuitive Machines IM-2 and IM-3 missions. The craft will visit a target asteroid, prospecting for valuable platinum group metals that the company hopes to one day mine. But in order to avoid giving competitors a chance to get there first, the company did not originally intend to disclose which asteroid it is going to. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of not OK,\u201d said McDowell dryly at the AAS meeting.\n\nOn Jan. 21, the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO Matt Gialich told Astronomy that Astroforge had not yet settled on a target asteroid because \u201cas a ride share customer, we don\u2019t control our launch date.\u201d He added, \u201cJonathan McDowell is someone I respect, and I love the pushback. It\u2019s what science is built on. I hope that images and information we deliver outweigh the perceived negatives in this case.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese Hayabusa2 mission landed on the asteroid Ryugu in 2019 and returned samples back to Earth the next year. Credit: JAXA Hayabusa 2\n\nLast September, the AAS raised the issue of deep-space transparency in a statement led by its Committee for the Protection of Astronomy and the Space Environment (of which McDowell is a member). It called on U.S. space operators \u2014 government agencies and non-governmental alike \u2014 to publicly report and update trajectories of deep-space objects. It also urged operators to place those data in a public repository like JPL\u2019s Horizons, echoing the call from the MPC 17 years earlier.\n\nOn Jan. 29, in a reversal, Astroforge did disclose its target asteroid: 2022 OB5, a small near-Earth asteroid. In an interview with SpaceNews, Gialich cited the pushback from the scientific community as a factor, as well as a desire to learn more about the asteroids from observations from amateur astronomers.\n\nAt the time of publication, SpaceX had not responded to a query from Astronomy.\n\n\u2018A rare confluence of factors\u2019\n\nThe Tesla Roadster mix-up came as something of a disappointment to the Turkish amateur astronomer, who asked to be identified as \u201cG.\u201d He hoped he had discovered a near-Earth asteroid, not a used car from 2010 with a few billion miles on it.\n\nHe identified (the object briefly known as) 2018 CN41 with software he wrote in his spare time to parse through the MPC\u2019s public archive of observations of objects, which anyone can peruse in search of asteroids and other small solar system bodies. His code identified several candidate objects that could be traced through multiple observations from various telescopes around the world. 2018 CN41 was one of them. It had shown up in images taken by the Catalina Sky Survey at Steward Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, and the Pan-STARRS and ATLAS surveys in Hawaii, among others.\n\nAfter G. calculated an orbit to fit the observations, he saw that the object had a very small minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) from Earth. In other words, its orbit came very close to Earth\u2019s, making it a potential near-Earth object. \u201cI was ecstatic and submitted the identification\u201d to the MPC, he told Astronomy in an email. The MPC accepted the submission and notified the astronomical community in what it calls an \u201celectronic circular,\u201d a term of art that reflects the long legacy of observational tradition.\n\nBut after seeing the object\u2019s trajectory plotted in 3D on the MPC\u2019s website, he began to harbor doubts about its origins. He realized the orbit resembled that of a spacecraft traveling to Mars, using a Hohmanm transfer orbit, with the exception that it slightly overshoots Mars\u2019 orbit. (He credits, only half-jokingly, his time playing the spaceflight simulation video game Kerbal Space Program.)\n\nHe told Astronomy:\n\nI first went to JPL\u2019s Small Body Database to quickly take a look at the Earth close approach dates and potential Mars close approach dates, to see if I could correlate those to a known interplanetary mission. I failed \u2014 the Falcon launch had never crossed my mind. I almost concluded it was an actual NEO and stopped looking, but I asked around on the Minor Planet Mailing List just to erase my final doubts. To my surprise, Jonathan McDowell quickly figured out it was the Falcon upper stage. Being slightly embarrassed that I might have caused unnecessary excitement (it WAS quite a low MOID), I quickly went to MPC\u2019s help desk and let them know the NEO I just submitted was a rocket stage.\n\nThe MPC has multiple checks to flag artificial objects, said Payne, the center director, all of which broke down on the Tesla Roadster. \u201cThis case highlights a rare confluence of factors,\u201d he said.\n\nFirst, the MPC uses a routine called sat_id, written by Bill Gray and commonly used by the minor-planet community, to see if an observation of an object matches the position of a known satellite on the sky. The database of satellites it checks against is maintained by the research community of both professional and amateur astronomers.\n\nPayne noted that when the Tesla Roadster was originally launched in 2018, the community caught it and flagged it as an artificial object, and the MPC \u201ccorrectly labeled it as such without assigning a minor planet designation.\u201d\n\nBut when subsequent observations were archived by the MPC and later identified by G., sat_id failed to locate the Roadster, said Payne. And the object was not caught upon further review because unlike most satellites, it orbits the Sun and not Earth. In addition, it is an unusual Sun-centric orbit for a spacecraft. Because it was a test flight for the Falcon Heavy, there was no destination in particular; that is why its trajectory originates near Earth but overshoots Mars\u2019 orbit, as G. noted.\n\nPayne agreed that a central repository, \u201cregularly updated by national and private space agencies, would significantly enhance the identification process.\u201d Currently, he said, the MPC is collaborating with JPL on a system to better detect artificial objects that aren\u2019t in Earth orbit and filter them out of the MPC\u2019s observational database.\n\nCitizen science remains key\n\nIn one sense, this case shows the scientific process at work. Mistakes are inevitable, but quick corrections mean science is working as it should.\n\nIt also highlights the crucial role that amateur astronomers play in making discoveries \u2014 a role they have played for centuries, well before the term \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d came into vogue. \u201cTheir involvement significantly improves the overall efficiency of object identification and contributes to the broader mission of the MPC,\u201d said Payne.\n\nImages from the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope \u2014 pictured here shining an adaptive optics laser guide star into the night sky from atop Maunakea \u2014 have been used by citizen scientists to discover several asteroids. Credit: NAOJ\n\nG. is able to see the bright side of what he calls \u201cthe Tesla incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still sort of disappointed it wasn\u2019t a NEO, but it was an interesting experience to say the least,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the very least we managed to filter out some non-minor-planet observations from [the] MPC database.\u201d\n\nG. continues to hunt for small bodies in the solar system on his own and in citizen science projects like Come On! Impacting ASteroids (COIAS). Developed by a team of Japanese astronomers, COIAS allows anyone to scour observations taken by the Subaru Telescope on Maunakea in Hawaii for asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects and report their measurements to the MPC.\n\nThrough COIAS, G. has been a co-discoverer of two named asteroids: 697402 Ao and 718492 Quro. The asteroids are named for one of the main characters and the author, respectively, of a slice-of-life manga named Asteroid in Love (also adapted as an anime), about two high school friends who join their school\u2019s Earth sciences club and dream of discovering an asteroid. G. said that while he didn\u2019t know much about it before, he \u201cloved people who were fans of the manga get crazy about it on social media.\u201d\n\nRecently on COIAS, G. came across a small, \u201cbarely noticeable\u201d speck of light moving slowly across the sky. According to his measurements, it appears to be a small body in the outer solar system that crosses Neptune\u2019s orbit. He identified the measurements and submitted them to the MPC. On Jan. 18, he posted about it on X, the social media platform now owned by Musk, noting that the object\u2019s orbit takes it within half an astronomical unit \u2014 the average Earth-Sun distance \u2014 from Neptune. If confirmed, the object would be a member of a dynamically intriguing subset of trans-Neptunian objects, one that has recently been studied for clues to the whereabouts of the theorized Planet Nine.\n\nOf course, G. has his sights set on even rarer observational feats. In an email, he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m thinking the holy grail could be a beautiful comet, an interstellar visitor, or an alien spacecraft like in [Arthur C.] Clarke\u2019s book Rendezvous with Rama, heh \ud83d\ude42 None of that might happen, but that won\u2019t stop me from dreaming about it.\n\n\u201cRealistically, at this point in time I will settle for anything that\u2019s not a car.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note (Jan. 25, 2025): At the request of the amateur astronomer who identified the object, the story has been updated to remove his first initials and last name.\n\nEditor\u2019s note (Jan. 29, 2025): The story was updated to reflect Astroforge\u2019s announcement of its target asteroid.",

            "content": "One in three Tesla owners surveyed in the Netherlands are considering selling their car.\n\nThe reason? CEO Elon Musk.\n\nWith more brand diversity than ever, this could spell uncertainty for Tesla in years to come.\n\nIn a development that surprises absolutely nobody paying attention to Elon Musk's recent political escapades, Tesla owners are now seriously considering selling their EVs over the CEO's antics.\n\nAccording to a new study by Dutch news outlet, EenVandaag, one in three Tesla owners in the Netherlands are considering selling their Teslas. The survey, which included 26,000 panel members (432 of which are Tesla owners or lessees), found that the owners looking to offload their cars were doing so because of the brand's face: Elon Musk.\n\nHere's a brief translated snippet of the study's findings:\n\n3-in-10 Tesla drivers in the survey are considering selling their Tesla, or have recently done so. One of them explains: \"Musk abuses his power. If I had known what he is like now, I would never have bought a Tesla.\" Some of these drivers also plan to put an 'anti-Musk sticker' on their Tesla, in order to distance themselves from the tech billionaire. For half (51%), Musk's behavior has little effect on how they feel about their Tesla. A slightly smaller group (40%) is proud to drive a Tesla. Although they do not always approve of his behavior, they also see Musk as a 'visionary', and according to them, you can easily separate the product from the owner. \"There are also composers who make beautiful music and did bad things, that does not make their music less beautiful,\" writes a Tesla driver.\n\nFrom Brand Asset To Liability\n\nWhether or not it's formally recognized, Musk is a huge asset for Tesla. In fact, despite the CEO not actually being a founding member of the brand, his popularity has not only made him the face of Tesla but also the richest person on the face of the Earth.\n\nLet's face it\u2014Telsa and Musk have always been inseparable. Some analysts have even claimed that it is \u201cimpossible to quantify the value of Musk\u2019s persistence as CEO [...] of Tesla in its stock price.\" The man single-handedly made it cool to own an EV as he simultaneously launched rockets into space. However, as the threads unwound and Musk became increasingly political, the CEO's fanbase shifted.\n\nNow his controversial takes on world leaders, his meddling with the government and persistent fraternizing with the president have left many of Tesla's original adopters buying anti-Musk bumper stickers to separate themselves from the CEO.\n\nSurvey respondents from the Netherlands admitted that Musk's actions and statements were actively making them rethink their loyalty to the brand. And that could have a rippling effect not just on new car sales, but also on the value of used Teslas in the region (and possibly worldwide).\n\nWhile the survey was aimed specifically at respondents from the Netherlands, Musk doesn't exactly inspire a warm and fuzzy feeling back in the States, either. Posts have popped up on Reddit following Musk's so-called \"odd-looking\" salute at the Presidential inauguration which has sparked owner outcrys, promising to never buy another Tesla as long as Musk is at the helm. Others have called for the Tesla board to fire Musk.\n\n\"Elon went from the Henry Ford of our generation to the Henry Ford of our generation,\" said one Redditor.\n\nYou Can Buy Other EVs Now\n\nTesla's potential slip in market share isn't just the result of a PR nightmare caused by its CEO. The skinny of it all is simply that Tesla isn't the only player in the EV game anymore. Every brand worth its weight is getting into the electric car space, and that means that buyers now have options\n\nSo if a buyer's loyalty isn't tied to a particular brand, or rather if they're dissuaded from purchasing a particular marque for whatever reason, they have a growing number of electrified alternatives to choose from. That alone gives competitors a place to capitalize by the public simply not knowing the name of their CEO.\n\nFor many early Tesla owners, buying a Tesla was a statement in itself. One about the environment, about saving money, about status, or even a political statement on its own. Those original owners could be feeling a bit alienated since Tesla may no longer be aligned with their personal beliefs\u2014a calculated danger when a celebrity is the figurehead of the brand.\n\nWill They Stay Or Will They Go?\n\nDespite the outcry, Tesla is still the EV juggernaut in the Netherlands (and beyond). Hell, Tesla holds three of the top 10 best-selling EVs in the U.S., and the Model Y even became the best-selling car in the entire world for 2023.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nThose figures alone should tell the world that, despite Musk's image, Tesla is still selling tons of cars. So are folks voting with their wallet, or are they just indifferent to the face behind the brand? A 30% potential defection rate from a survey is a big deal, but if ownership numbers remain unchanged it won't really matter. On the flip side, if owners do abscond because of Musk, the CEO could prove to be Tesla's biggest liability.\n\nThe Tesla of today is the product of a vision drawn up by yesterday's Musk. That's a double-edged sword. As Musk's visions change and his antics become more public, buyers could start thinking twice. And as torquey as EVs are, even the quickest of cars can't outrun bad PR.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Okay, the story has been repeated enough: Tesla was supposed to be achieving 50% growth per year through 2030, yet sales actually declined year over year in 2024. Some Tesla fans want us to be positive about that, but even beyond the fact that sales didn\u2019t match the longer-term forecast of 50% growth a year, they also didn\u2019t match Elon Musk\u2019s forecast from early 2024 that the company would achieve sales growth across the full year (something he said while discussing the company\u2019s steep Q1 sales decline). If someone told these Tesla fans in 2023 that the company\u2019s sales would decline in 2024, that person would be attacked and criticized, with all kinds of reasons why that wasn\u2019t true and the person was just a hater. So, no one should be spinning 2024\u2019s sales results as good or as expected. Also, if we\u2019re being frank, we have to admit that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how many vehicles will be sold in the coming year, or years. Elon Musk said as much last year when he was asked about more details on the company\u2019s long-term projections.\n\nAll of that said, I was quite bearish on Tesla 2024 sales because the company was showing strong signs of consumer demand challenges starting in mid-2023. Again, Tesla fans hated these articles and claimed I was wrong, but when Tesla is offering more and more incentives and discounts, and getting a bit extreme with them, to stimulate consumer demand, it\u2019s obvious that sales are not at the desired level. I was quite good at forecasting Tesla sales for several years, and I wasn\u2019t blinded by fanaticism to see a changing trend. I bring this up because I think people \u2014 across the board \u2014 need to be a little more (or in some cases a lot more) open to looking at the reality of the situation rather than assuming what they\u2019d like to see or assuming the narrative of this year is going to be the same as the narrative of previous years.\n\nWith all of that out of the way, what can we expect from 2025 when it comes to Tesla?\n\nThis is one year in which I really don\u2019t know what to expect. There are four wildcards, and they are each extremely hard to have solid feelings about. Here are those wildcards and my take on them:\n\nModel Y (and Model 3) sales following refresh: The Tesla Model Y is just undergoing its big refresh, while the Model 3 is getting pretty deep into its \u2014 to the point that it\u2019s hard to still call it a refresh. The big question is how much this will do for sales. Will the Model Y \u201cJuniper\u201d stimulate a lot more sales, or is it not big enough of a change to make consumers care \u2014 to make existing owners upgrade or to stimulate more new buyers than would come in anyway? Regarding the Model 3, which hasn\u2019t seen a big boost from the refresh, will its sales stagnate or even drop now? There seems like a high likelihood of that. Also, while the Model Y Juniper is new, there are dozens of exciting new EV models in China, and several of them look even more exciting to me. Tesla relies on China for nearly half of its sales, so what happens if more of the market there starts to see the Model Y and Model 3 as less compelling than models from BYD, XPENG, NIO, Zeekr, Li Auto, and others? And what about Europe and the US, where Elon Musk\u2019s high political engagement is turning off a lot of people who would normally be Tesla fans? In case you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m waffling here and struggling to see which way the wind is blowing. Pushing myself to make a call, I\u2019m going to go bold and say that the Model Y and Model 3 will see their annual sales decline a little in 2025. That may be a crazy call considering the Model Y is getting updated, and that key factor does make me think I could very well be eating my words, but with sales already at a very high level going into an increasingly competitive market and the challenges noted above, I feel like this may be more likely than most of us have been willing to think. Okay, I\u2019ll just go with 1.7 million sales in 2025. Cybertruck sales: Tesla should continue to ramp up production, make production more efficient, and drive down Cybertruck costs. It seems like the reservation backlog is gone, though, and that seems premature even to those of us who were skeptical about the supposedly enormous reservation list. I was initially inclined to say sales would increase a bit, perhaps to 50,000, but I\u2019m now thinking they could just be stagnant (especially thinking about that reservation list dissipating and the Model Y refresh arriving). I\u2019m going to go ahead with a forecast of 35,000 sales. Model Q? We don\u2019t even know what some supposedly new model will be named or what car class it will be, so this is an especially hard one to forecast for. David and I talk about this for a while in the video below, but we have no clear answers. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and expect very little from this model in 2025. Put me down for 10,000 initial sales even though I\u2019m more inclined to think production doesn\u2019t even begin in 2025. Full Self Driving/robotaxis: The giant wildcard year after year, will Tesla crack the robotaxi nut this year and see a huge surge in demand for its vehicles? Well, if you haven\u2019t yet deduced my answer from the numbers above, let\u2019s just say I expect 2025 will be similar to previous years \u2014 a lot of hype, a lot of promises, and no mass-scale robotaxi deployment from Tesla. I think the company will launch \u201ctrials\u201d and pilot programs in California and Texas, enough to keep the hype going and the stock price up (maybe), but not enough to significantly change consumer demand. Will this be the year skeptics are proven wrong and Tesla gets back to its 50% growth target? I think not, but we\u2019ll see \u2014 it\u2019s possible.\n\nI also talked about these matters with David Havasi in the following video:\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these matters, and what do you expect from Tesla in 2025?\n\nFor more on recent Tesla sales, see:",

            "content": "As the energy transition continues to unfold, US electric vehicle (EV) pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been making moves to secure supply of the raw materials it needs to meet its production targets.\n\nLithium in particular has been top of mind for CEO Elon Musk. Back in 2020, the battery metal had a spotlight moment at Tesla\u2019s Battery Day, when Musk shared that the company had bought tenements in the US state of Nevada, and was looking for a new way to produce lithium from clay \u2014 a process yet to be proven at commercial scale.\n\nLithium prices went on to hit all-time highs, but swiftly declined in 2023 and continued on a downward trend in 2024. Prices for other key battery metals have also decreased as EV sales growth has fallen across most global markets in the face of economic uncertainty and higher interest rates. According to Goldman Sachs research, EV battery costs are at record lows and are forecasted to fall by 40 percent between 2023 and 2025.\n\nIn a mid-2023 Teslaearnings call Musk seemed relieved to see prices for the battery metal had declined. \u201cLithium prices went absolutely insane there for a while,\u201d he said. Lower battery prices will bring EVs closer to cost parity with internal combustion engines vehicles, leading to wider adoption and increased demand.\n\nDuring the 2024 US presidential election, Musk threw his support behind Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump, who has been historically critical on electric vehicles and subsidies. Following Trump's election win on November 5, AP News reported that these stances could support Tesla as they would be more likely to harm smaller competitors who were less established than the EV giant. Tesla's share price shot upwards in response to the election outcome.\n\nIn the spring of 2024, Musk invited Argentine President Javier Milei to the Tesla factory in Austin, Texas, where the two reportedly discussed the investment opportunities in Argentina's lithium sector. As a prominent member of the prolific Lithium Triangle, the South American nation is the fourth leading lithium producer by country.\n\nAustralia's hard-rock deposits and Chile's brines are also top sources for the world's lithium supply. But lithium refining is dominated by China, which accounted for 72 percent of global lithium processing capacity in 2022.\n\nWith the limelight on Musk and Tesla, investors should know where the electric car company sources its lithium.\n\nRead on to learn more about where Tesla gets its lithium, how much lithium is in a Tesla battery and what the EV maker is doing to better secure its lithium supply chain.\n\n\u200bIn this article\n\n\u200bWhich lithium companies supply Tesla?\n\nTesla has deals with multiple lithium suppliers, some that are already producers and some that are juniors developing lithium projects.\n\nAt the end of 2021, Tesla inked a three-year lithium supply deal with top lithium producer Ganfeng Lithium (OTC Pink:GNENF,SZSE:002460), and the Chinese company began providing products to Tesla starting in 2022. Major miner Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM,ASX:LTM), which is set to be acquired by Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO), also has supply contracts in place with the EV maker.\n\nChina\u2019s Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group (SZSE:002497) agreed to supply battery-grade lithium hydroxide to Tesla through 2030. Under a new, separate agreement finalized in June 2024, Yahua is set to supply Tesla with an unspecified amount of lithium carbonate between 2025 and 2027, with the option to extend the contract by another year.\n\nLiontown Resources (ASX:LTR,OTC Pink:LINRF) is set to supply Tesla with lithium spodumene concentrate from its AU$473 million Kathleen Valley project. The deal is for an initial five year period set to begin this year, and production began in July 2024.\n\nIn January 2023, Tesla amended its agreement with Piedmont Lithium (ASX:PLL,NASDAQ:PLL), which now supplies the US automaker with spodumene concentrate from its North American Lithium operation, a joint venture with Sayona Mining (ASX:SYA,OTCQB:SYAXF). The deal is in place through the end of 2025.\n\nEven though Tesla has secured lithium from all these companies, the EV supply chain is a bit more complex than just buying lithium directly from miners. Tesla also works with battery makers, such as Panasonic (OTC Pink:PCRFF,TSE:6752) and CATL (SZSE:300750), which themselves work with other chemical companies that secure their own lithium deals.\n\n\n\nWhat are Tesla batteries made of?\n\nTesla vehicles use several different battery cathodes, including nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathodes and lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cathodes.\n\nTesla is known for using NCA cathodes developed by Japanese company Panasonic. This type of cathode has higher energy density and is a low-cobalt option, but has been less adopted by the industry compared to the widely used nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) cathodes. Aside from that, South Korea's LG Energy Solutions (KRX:373220) supplies Tesla with batteries using nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum (NCMA) cathodes.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, it wasn\u2019t just lithium that saw prices climb in 2021 \u2014 cobalt doubled in price that same year, and although it has declined since then, the battery metal remains essential for many EV batteries. Most cobalt mining takes place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is often associated with child labor and human rights abuses, fueling concerns over long-term supply.\n\nThat said, not all Tesla\u2019s batteries contain cobalt. In 2021, Tesla said that for its standard-range vehicles it would be changing to lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cathodes, which are cobalt- and nickel-free. At the time, the company was already making vehicles with LFP chemistry at its factory in Shanghai, which supplies markets in China, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe.\n\nIn April 2023, Tesla announced that it planned to use this type of cathode chemistry for its short-range heavy electric trucks, which it calls \"semi light.\" The company is also looking to use LFP batteries in its mid-sized vehicles.\n\nAt the top of 2024, Tesla made moves to produce LFP batteries at its Sparks, Nevada, battery facility in reaction to the Biden Administration's new regulations on battery materials sourcing, especially on those sourced from China. Reuters reports Tesla battery supplier CATL will sell idle equipment to the car maker for use at the plant, which will have an initial capacity of about 10 gigawatt hours.\n\n\u200bWhat company makes Tesla\u2019s batteries?\n\nTesla works with multiple battery suppliers, including Panasonic, its longtime partner, as well as LG Energy Solutions, the second largest battery supplier in the world. They supply the EV maker with cells containing nickel and cobalt.\n\nChina's CATL has been supplying LFP batteries to Tesla for cars made at its Shanghai plant since 2020. It\u2019s also been reported that BYD Company (OTC Pink:BYDDF,SZSE:002594) is supplying Tesla with the Blade battery \u2014 a less bulky LFP battery \u2014 which the car manufacturer has used in some of its models in Europe.\n\nAdditionally, BYD is set to work with Tesla on its battery energy storage systems (BESS) in China, with a plan to supply 20 percent of Tesla's anticipated BESS manufacturing capacity, with CATL expected to cover 80 percent. The factory, which began production at the close of 2024, uses the companies' LFP batteries.\n\n\u200bHow much lithium is in a Tesla battery?\n\nHow much lithium do Tesla batteries actually contain? That question is tricky because many factors are at play. Typically, it depends on battery chemistry, as demonstrated by the chart below, as well as battery size.\n\nFor example, the standard Tesla Model S contains about 138 pounds, or 62.6 kilograms, of lithium. It is powered by a NCA battery, which has a weight of 1,200 pounds or 544 kilograms.\n\nThe amount of lithium in a Tesla battery can also vary based on model and year as the battery chemistries and weights are often changing with each new iteration.\n\nBack in 2016, Musk said batteries don't require as much lithium as they do nickel or graphite \u2014 he described lithium as \"the salt in your salad.\" As the chart below shows, the metal only makes up about a 10th of the materials in each battery.\n\nChart via BloombergNEF.\n\nMetal content of battery chemistries by weight.\n\nBut a key factor to remember is volume \u2014 given the amount of batteries Tesla needs to meet its ambitious goals, it could hit a bottleneck if it can\u2019t secure a steady supply of raw materials. Of course, this is true not just for Tesla, but for every carmaker producing EVs today and setting targets for decades to come.\n\nFor that reason, demand for lithium-ion batteries is expected to soar in the coming years. By 2030, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts that demand will grow by 400 percent to reach 3.9 terawatt-hours. Over the same forecast period, the firm sees the current surplus in the lithium supply coming to end.\n\n\u200bWill Tesla buy a lithium mine?\n\nFor carmakers, securing lithium supply to meet their electrification goals is becoming a challenge, which is why the question of whether they will become miners in the future continues to come up.\n\n\n\nBut mining lithium is not easy, and despite speculation, it's hard to imagine an automaker being involved in it, SQM\u2019s (NYSE:SQM) Felipe Smith said. \u201cYou have to build a learning curve \u2014 the resources are all different, there are many challenges in terms of technology \u2014 to reach a consistent quality at a reasonable cost,\u201d he noted. \u201cSo it's difficult to see that an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), which has a completely different focus, will really engage into these challenges of producing.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven so, OEMs are coming to the realization that they might need to build up EV supply chains from scratch after the capital markets' failure to step up, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence\u2019s Simon Moores believes. Furthermore, automotive OEMs that are making EVs will in effect have to become miners.\n\n\u201cI don't mean actual miners, but they are going to have to start buying 25 percent of these mines if they want to guarantee supply \u2014 paper contracts won't be enough,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Musk has made it clear to investors that Tesla is more focused on developing its lithium refining capabilities, rather than getting into the mining game.\n\nWhere is Tesla's lithium refinery?\n\nTesla broke ground on its in-house Texas lithium refinery in the greater Corpos Christi area of the state in 2023. Tesla's lithium refinery capacity is expected to produce 50 GWh of battery-grade lithium per year. Construction of the lithium refinery is nearly completed with full production anticipated in 2025.\n\nTesla's Texas lithium refinery was facing an obstacle in obtaining a contract for the 8 million gallons of water per day needed to run the plant, as the region of South Texas is in the middle of a serious drought and water supplies are tight.\n\n\"In December, South Texas Water Authority passed an infrastructure deal that will allow Nueces Water Supply to sell rights to the pipe Tesla will need to obtain water, which was one of the hold-ups for a water deal,\" Bloomberg BNN reported in early January.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article first published by the Investing News Network in 2022.\n\nDon't forget to follow us @INN_Resource for real-time updates!\n\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Melissa Pistilli, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.\n\nEditorial Disclosure: The Investing News Network does not guarantee the accuracy or thoroughness of the information reported in the interviews it conducts.

According to the notice, the Office of Defects Investigation has received 12 complaints related to the Smart Summon feature.\n\nThe four crashes, according to the notice about the investigation, relate to the Tesla vehicles failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in crashes when the Actually Smart Summon feature is on.\n\nThe notice read that the office knows of several crash allegations \u2014 though Tesla has not reported any crashes through the Standing General Order requiring reporting of crashes on publicly accessible roads \u2014 involving Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon in which drivers had little to no reaction time to avoid a crash with the available line of site or releasing the button to stop the vehicle\u2019s movement.\n\nWhat is the NHTSA investigating?\n\nNHTSA is opening a preliminary evaluation into the Actually Smart Summon feature and will then decide whether to update the probe to an engineering analysis before seeking to require a recall. NHTSA will look into the vehicles\u2019 operations and field performance, top speed attained with the Actually Smart Summon feature engaged and line of site requirements as well as stopping distance requirements.\n\nThis probe covers 2016-2025 Model S and X vehicles, 2017-2025 Model 3 and 2020-2025 Model Y with the Full Self-Driving driver assistance system.\n\nTesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMore: Tesla just posted its worst numbers in over a decade; here's why investors aren't worried\n\nMichael Brooks, executive director at the Center for Auto Safety, told the American-Statesman that Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving system is a \u201cvision-only system,\u201d meaning it is camera-based and doesn\u2019t use other sensors like other automakers are using to sense hazards.\n\n\u201cAlmost invariably, you see cameras unable to cope with nighttime conditions in really lit areas and also, there's some problems in weather. Being able to cope with nighttime problems is critical to safe driving,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe camera-only approach without some other sensor to check what inputs the camera is getting to make sure that at nighttime or in bad weather that the cameras are getting it right, there needs to be some sort of redundancy there.\u201d\n\nBrooks said all the current autonomous driving features on Tesla vehicles \u2014 summoning, autopilot and more \u2014 require human intervention and active participation, something he is concerned many drivers are not doing when using these features.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be aware that they are fully responsible for anything that occurs while they\u2019re using (the summon feature),\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf you\u2019re holding a button down on your phone to make your vehicle move and that vehicle then runs over a child in a grocery store parking lot, you are ultimately going to be held responsible. That\u2019s not an autonomous vehicle. Tesla is not going to step in and save you from liability.\u201d\n\nHow many NHTSA investigations into Tesla vehicles are there?\n\nThis is not the first time NHTSA has opened investigations into Tesla vehicles.\n\nTesla recalled more than two million U.S. vehicles in December 2023 to install safeguards for its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system. NHTSA opened a probe in April to see if the recall was adequate to address the concerns that drivers are not paying attention.\n\nIn October, NHTSA opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving software following four reported crashes. One of these incidents involved a pedestrian who was struck and killed by a 2021 Tesla Model Y in Rimrock, Arizona, in November 2023. The investigation is still ongoing.\n\nMore: Elon Musk unveils Tesla's new Cybercab robotaxi. See expected rollout, how much it'll cost\n\nA week prior to that probe announcement, Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled Tesla\u2019s two-seater, two-door \"Cybercab\" robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals, using solely cameras and artificial intelligence to navigate roads. Musk at the time said he hoped to get approval for the vehicles in Texas, possibly in California, this year with hopes to reach volume production for the robotaxis in 2026. NHTSA would need to approve the vehicles for use on publicly accessible roads.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the Summon, the autopilot, full self-driving, all of those bells and whistles that Tesla has sold as somewhat all promise \u2014 all of them have to be supervised by humans which is a completely different animal than a true Robotaxi where there's no human supervision whatsoever,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nBrooks said the Center for Auto Safety does not anticipate Musk being able to launch his robotaxi this year, saying other self-driving robotaxi makers like Waymo are way ahead of Tesla\u2019s technology and have additional sensors to support the vehicles.\n\nWhat has Elon Musk said?\n\nMusk has complained on various occasions that U.S. regulations impede the development of self-driving and fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nMusk played an active role in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, donating an estimated $250 million to his campaign. Since then, the tech billionaire and sometime-Austin resident has frequently stayed at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago, met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, sat-in on meetings with foreign heads of state and vetted cabinet nominees.\n\nMore: Trump appoints Texas billionaire Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy to lead new 'DOGE' commission\n\nTrump announced following his election that he would create a new Department of Government Efficiency, placing Musk at the helm alongside Vivek Ramaswamy to oversee government spending and regulations.\n\nIn 2024, Tesla sales declined 1.1%, the first dip in over a decade for the automaker headquartered in Austin.\n\nBrooks said NHTSA investigations decrease during some Republican administrations, and he expects the same under Trump. He said there\u2019s an ongoing question whether or not federal regulators will continue pursuing the Tesla investigations \u201cwith the same fervor\u201d as under the current Biden Administration.\n\n\u201cOnce the administration change happens later this month, is NHTSA going to really pursue these investigations to an appropriate conclusion or whether there's going to be political influence to prevent the investigations from digging too much into that,\u201d Brooks said.",

Just this week alone, Musk ignited a wave of controversy with a hand gesture he made, which some interpreted as a Nazi salute during President Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cThere are people who think he\u2019s wonderful, but many that don\u2019t,\u201d Brand Finance CEO David Haigh told CNBC. \u201cIf you are buying electric vehicles, his persona is highly likely to impact your view of whether or not you want to buy one of his company\u2019s cars, but that\u2019s only one of many factors.\u201d\n\nRevamped Model Y could improve Tesla\u2019s ranking in the next study\n\nBut Tesla\u2019s appeal didn\u2019t slump everywhere. The brand\u2019s \u2018consideration score,\u2019 which represents the likelihood of someone buying its cars, fell from 21 to 16 percent in Europe, where it was outperformed by Mercedes and its big Chinese threat, BYD.

On January 20, Trump revoked Biden's 2021 goal to make half of all new vehicles sold by 2030 electric, freezing $5 billion in funds for charging stations. He's also gunning for the end of California's emissions waiver, which would impact states that have adopted tougher EV rules. This is a clear signal that Trump plans to prioritize gas-powered cars and hit the brakes on Biden's green agenda.\n\nIn typical Trump fashion, this is more than just a policy changeit's a stance on energy independence. He's pushing for tax credits for EV buyers to be reconsidered and potentially eliminated, while also targeting subsidies for electric vehicles. The message is simple: the U.S. shouldn't be pushing for EVs when countries like China dominate the EV market. Environmentalists and climate advocates are quick to slam the move, warning it could undo climate progress and hurt the long-term competitiveness of U.S. automakers.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the crosshairs of these changes. As the leader in the electric vehicle space, the company stands to be directly affected by any reduction in EV incentives or charging infrastructure funding. If Trump's policies gain traction, Tesla will need to adapt to a market that could become less EV-friendly, despite its strong brand and innovation in the space. Investors will be keeping a close eye on how Tesla navigates this new landscapewhether it accelerates its own strategic pivot or doubles down on pushing through the green energy roadblocks ahead.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Investors are looking ahead to its potential as a technology company, and not just as an automaker.\n\nTesla (TSLA 3.86%) has been on an absolute tear, with shares nearly doubling over the past few months. Investors expect big things from the electric vehicle (EV) company over the coming years. It has continually innovated, pushing into new markets like autonomous vehicles and humanoid robotics.\n\nStock price momentum can be powerful. How high shares ultimately go is anyone's guess. Ultimately, the business's fundamentals will either support its rising share price or act like gravity and pull it down to earth.\n\nShould you buy Tesla stock while it's trading under $450 per share? Here is what you need to know.\n\nIt's clear what's driving Tesla's stock higher, and it's not the EV business\n\nOne of the most common arguments supporting the stock is that the company isn't like other automotive manufacturers. Due to its other segments, some investors consider it a technology company. The idea is that the planned Cybercab (and an autonomous vehicle fleet) and Optimus (humanoid robotics) could each represent vast opportunities over the next decade.\n\nI would guess that is what has driven the stock's strong performance. CEO Elon Musk has aligned himself well with the Trump administration, which could theoretically help Tesla navigate the legal and regulatory landscape to launch its autonomous ride-hailing business. Since the Nov. 5 election, the stock price is up nearly 70%.\n\nMusk estimates ride-sharing will begin in Texas and California this year, with the Cybercab entering volume production in 2026.\n\nHe also hopes to begin selling Optimus robots in 2026. The company is still developing the robot's localized artificial intelligence (AI), which allows it to read and process its surroundings. This technology is similar to its full self-driving (FSD), and Musk recently said that Tesla now has the appropriate computing capacity to continue developing it.\n\nThese are exciting opportunities but come with questions\n\nMusk believes that Tesla's long-term value is far more dependent on these emerging segments than on its existing automotive business. However, investors should be careful about how disconnected they let the future get from the present. The financial reality is that its vehicle business, which just saw its annual production volume drop for the first time in 2024, still generates virtually all of the company's revenue and profits.\n\nThere is also a clear motivation to label it as a technology company rather than an automotive business. Its valuation far exceeds that of any of its peers. For example, the stock currently trades at over 15 times sales. Toyota presently generates higher gross profit margins than Tesla, but trades at a price-to-sales multiple (P/S) of less than 1. Yes, Tesla is growing faster, but does that justify such an extreme valuation gap?\n\nWhat's the takeaway? Tesla has an exciting technology upside, but it's already baked into the share price. Investors also don't (and can't) yet know:\n\nWhether Tesla will deliver on these products.\n\nWhen they might meaningfully affect the company's financials.\n\nHow profitable they will be.\n\nThere's a realistic scenario in which Tesla executes masterfully over the next two or three years, brings these products to market, and the stock goes nowhere while the company's financials catch up to the valuation. There's also a scenario in which this rollout takes longer than expected or fails altogether, and the market stops supporting such a lofty valuation.\n\nShould you buy Tesla stock right now?\n\nFor all anyone knows, Tesla's Cybercab and Optimus will be highly profitable from the start, and the stock will only go higher from here.\n\nSometimes, investing is about making an educated guess based on various outcomes. Given the facts known today, I think there are more potential outcomes where the stock generates poor returns from the current prices than vice versa. I believe Tesla is more than a vehicle manufacturer, but it doesn't warrant buying shares at any cost.\n\nThe stock is not a buy at anywhere near $450 per share -- at least not until the financial fundamentals justify it.\n\nInvestors who want to own Tesla might see better opportunities if the broader market cools off. Therefore, patience is warranted in order to allow the company's current momentum to play out. If you're afraid of missing the boat, you can buy a little at a time, slowly, leaving some cash handy for any potential decline.",

            "content": "Electric vehicle registrations were down last year in Europe.\n\nTesla, the largest solo player in the EV game, took a hard hit.\n\nThe American automaker's registration numbers fell by over 10%.\n\nThere\u2019s no getting around the fact that electric vehicle registrations went down last year in Europe. Depending on how many countries you take into consideration, EV registrations dipped between 1.3% and 5.9% in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nThat\u2019s a stark difference to the United States and China, where EV sales were on the rise last year, so what\u2019s going on in Europe? Let\u2019s look at the numbers and try to figure out what happened.\n\nAccording to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA), customers in the European Union registered 1,447,934 EVs last year, down 5.9% compared to 2023\u2019s 1,538,106 cars. After adding the United Kingdom and the member states of the European Free Trade Association (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) into the mix, the number of EVs registered in 2024 was 1,993,102, down 1.3% from the 2,018,885 units in 2023.\n\nIn part, this can be ascribed to the decline in electrified vehicle subsidies across Europe that helped incentivize people to buy cleaner cars. Germany ended its EV subsidy program in December 2023 and that had a profound effect on electric sales there. Denmark, Sweden, France and other countries have also cut their \"environmental bonus\" and other aid programs over the past year, and the effects of that can be seen in the sales data.\n\nIn the EU, battery-powered cars now account for 13.6% of the market, down from 14.6% in 2023. That said, EVs were hardly the biggest loser here. Gas- and diesel-powered cars had similar or even more severe drops in registrations, depending on which countries are taken into account. Gas cars went down 4.8% in the EU, with a more significant 6.8% drop when looking at the EU, UK and EFTA numbers.\n\nDiesel passenger vehicles took a beating, recording the largest dip in registrations of all the power sources. In the EU, diesel cars went down 11.4%, while in the EU, UK and EFTA, registrations dropped by 11.8%.\n\nPlug-in hybrids were also in the red, with a 6.8% drop in registrations in the EU in 2024. A healthy market in the United Kingdom helped PHEVs slightly, but overall, registrations in the EU, UK and EFTA went down 3.9%.\n\nThe European car market in 2024 Photo by: ACEA\n\nThe only power source to see significant growth last year in Europe was hybrid. Regular hybrid cars (those that don't have a plug) went up 20.9% in the EU and 19.6% in the EU, UK and EFTA combined. In total, there were 10.6 million cars registered in the EU, a 0.8% increase from the previous year. In the EU, UK and EFTA combined, new car registrations reached 12.9 million units, up 0.9% from 2023.\n\nBut what about EVs and Tesla in particular? It is in the title, after all. In short, people are slowly shifting away from the maker of the Model 3, and it\u2019s taking down the entire market. Last year, Tesla had 327,034 cars registered in the EU, UK and EFTA, down 10.8% from 2023. That\u2019s 16% of the entire EV market in this part of the world. In 2023, Tesla sold more cars here, and its share of the EV segment was even higher\u201318%.\n\nIf we were to take Tesla out of the equation magically, EV registrations in the EU, UK and EFTA would actually be up 0.8%. That\u2019s unrealistic for many reasons\u2014the biggest being that Tesla is still the largest solo player in the EV game in Europe\u2014but it goes to show that other automakers can theoretically hold their own and can even convince Tesla shoppers to look elsewhere.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal. And with more affordable EVs making their way into Europe this year, Tesla might have a problem on its hands. Sure, the updated Model Y is on its way, but much cheaper cars from rival automakers will reach dealerships, opening the gates for people who would not otherwise consider an EV because of the $30,000+ price tags.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "This article explains the unique financial, safety, and self-driving advantages of EVs in general and the Tesla Model Y in particular.\n\nI\u2019ve long been a fan of Tesla\u2019s Model Y. I wrote 3 articles the day of the unveiling (almost 6 years ago), including this one claiming the 3rd row was the key to its future success. That 3rd row has turned out to be pretty cramped and disappointing, but the broader point of the article is that Tesla wanted to make one model that could compete with 8 models from Toyota Group (4 from Toyota and 4 from Lexus). I think that is what they have accomplished.\n\nNow I think they will release a smaller hatchback (Model Q), which will help sell more units (maybe 500,000 units a year or more if it is good) by expanding the addressable market. I also wrote an article on Crossovers for Dummies. I had never owned a crossover before. I would buy a minivan when my family needed space and a sedan when we didn\u2019t. Now that my family has purchased three Model Ys, I understand how the crossover is a nice compromise with much of the advantages of both a minivan and a sedan. Now that I\u2019m older and share a car with my wife, I can\u2019t imagine going back to a sedan. It would be too low for our weakening legs and not have enough cargo space. When I had a minivan, a sedan had plenty of room, since I could just take the minivan if I needed more room. If the Model Q sits high, I could go to that if I like it.\n\nFinancial Reasons Why A Tesla Model Y Makes Sense For Someone Retiring Soon\n\nBefore I list the reasons, I have to explain what retirement is all about. There are many ideas on this, but I\u2019ll express my ideas after listening to a bunch of YouTube videos on the subject. An idea first attributed to Michael Stein from his book The Prosperous Retirement is that retirement can be split into 3 phases:\n\nThe Go-Go years (which are typically the first 10 years, but obviously people would like to extend this if possible) are when you are healthy enough to be very active. The Slow-Go years come when you have either finished your bucket list or you have run low on money or health to be as aggressive. The No-Go years are when your health and energy is on the final decline.\n\nBefore you enter your retirement, you might be lucky enough to be in your peak earnings years (or you might have had a setback).\n\nMany people nearing retirement might want to buy a car that can last them the rest of their life. With the Juniper release coming any day to the US, this offers customers a unique opportunity. Depending on what you can afford, you could buy a new Model Y and have a car that will likely look modern for 5 to 10 years, and after that you may not even care any more. If that is a little steep for you, can can get a big discount on the old Model Y as Tesla clears out the old to make room for the new. If that is still too much, you can get a 3- or 4-year-old Model Y for under $25,000 (less than $21,000 if you can get the $4,000 used EV tax credit).\n\nGet a 10-year extended warranty so you won\u2019t have any bad surprises that force you to sell your car before you want to because it has an expensive repair you can\u2019t afford. Most of the gas cars I have sold in the past are because they were getting old and it was getting expensive to maintain them in terms of time and money. I think there is certainly a risk that the same thing can happen to an electric car.\n\nDo the minimal maintenance needed for a Tesla. Your out of pocket expenses for maintenance and fuel should be very low. It is not guaranteed, but it is likely the Tesla Model Y will last you through the 100,000 miles you need in your Go-Go years, and if it is still in good shape, you don\u2019t need many miles to make it through your Slow-Go and No-Go years. Your costs should be very low for those later years, which is good, since your health care costs will likely be higher and you will likely need some sort of help with your activities of daily living.\n\nNon-Financial Reasons Why A Model Y Makes Sense\n\nThe outstanding crash safety of the Model Y has been well documented. There have been some recent reports that they have a high fatality rate, but I think that is likely because of reckless driving (which is more fun in a high performance car like many Tesla vehicles). I think seniors are less likely to be aggressive drivers. Autopilot and Full Self Driving (Supervised) can make the cars much safer as long as you don\u2019t get complacent and properly supervise them. Full Self Driving (Unsupervised), if it becomes available before the senior\u2019s skills degrade too much, should allow you to go places even after you are no longer a safe driver.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe low costs of running an electric car in general and the Tesla Model Y specifically seems to fit the needs of many seniors. The prospect of a long expected battery life and a replacement battery only costing $5,000 by 2030 means that electric vehicles and the Tesla Model Y should have a long life, even if you aren\u2019t under warranty. The extremely high crash safety and reduced chance of being in an accident if you use the driver\u2019s assistance features should keep you and your family safe until the time you can use unsupervised FSD to transport yourself when you can no longer safely drive yourself.\n\nNone of us know all the challenges we will face as we approach retirement and then the end of our lives, but I think the Tesla Model Y has some unique features that will help us with that journey.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of my Tesla referral link to get up to $1000 off a new Tesla vehicle, here\u2019s the link: https://ts.la/paul92237 \u2014 but as I have said before, if another owner helped you more, please use their link instead of mine.

            "content": "The redesigned Tesla Model Y crossover that dropped earlier this month has got some heavy lifting to do.\n\nWhile Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been extremely online when he's not wheeling and dealing at Mar-a-Lago with President Donald Trump, his automaker\u2019s core business has faltered. After years of epic growth, Tesla\u2019s global deliveries slipped in 2024 thanks to fiercer competition in the EV space and a lineup that hasn\u2019t quite kept up with the times.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\nEnter the new Model Y. After five years on the market, Tesla\u2019s most popular EV just got its first, long-awaited update. Industry experts tell InsideEVs the new model is a much-needed addition that could help reignite sales. But Tesla is also facing stiffer competition than ever\u2014particularly in China\u2014and it\u2019s not clear the lightly updated model will be enough to keep up.\n\n\u201cNew blood is needed,\u201d said Ivan Drury, director of insights at car-buying website Edmunds. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot in this next coming year that they\u2019re up against, and a lot of questions.\u201d EV sales growth in the U.S. slowed considerably last year, and the incoming Trump administration could spell the end of key policies propping up EV sales. So Tesla could use a win.\n\nThe new Model Y popped up on Tesla\u2019s Asian-Pacific websites in early January, sporting a new nose, an angular light strip similar to the Cybercab robotaxi and a chunky light bar running across the rear. From the side, the Model Y looks the same as the outgoing version.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla The new Tesla Model Y has an updated interior.\n\nTesla has spruced up the cabin with changes like ambient lighting, a touchscreen in the second row and power-folding back seats. Updates under the skin should aid ride quality, efficiency and range, Tesla says. The revamped crossover goes on sale in China in March. There\u2019s no official word as to when it\u2019ll hit Europe or the U.S.\n\nThe updates may be minor, but analysts told InsideEVs they could still be enough to drive new interest in the Model Y.\n\nAt the very least, the facelift will help Tesla recapture existing customers, a powerful driver of sales for any brand, Drury said. Tesla has as loyal a fanbase as they come, but owners aren\u2019t motivated to upgrade if every new model year looks exactly the same as the previous one.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla The new Tesla Model Y.\n\n\u201cAny change for them is good change and enough rationale to write a check,\u201d Drury said.\n\nAnd besides, it may be a smart move not to mess too much with a popular design. \u201cThey\u2019ve done what a lot of automakers do when they find success, which is they don\u2019t stray too far away,\u201d he said.\n\nGet InsideEVs' can't-miss EV news, reviews and analysis delivered right to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nThat\u2019s risky business for a number of reasons, though, he said. It leaves an opening for rivals to get ahead. And while sticking to a time-tested look can be a great way to print money, it mainly works in segments with limited competition. Consider the Dodge Challenger, he said. You don\u2019t exactly see a new muscle car hitting the market every day\u2014or every decade, for that matter.\n\nEVs are a completely different story. Virtually every car company on the planet is swarming this space and taking direct aim at the gold standard, the Model Y. Maybe Tesla didn\u2019t need to change the Model Y for years because it was so far ahead on EVs, but that\u2019s not true anymore. Today there are dozens of alternatives and counting, many of which beat Tesla on build quality, prestige or reputation. Only time will tell whether a Model Y with a nose job will manage to withstand the incoming heat from Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Honda, Acura, Hyundai and more.\n\nPhoto by: MIIT The YU7 from smartphone maker Xiaomi.\n\nBut that\u2019s all child\u2019s play compared to what Tesla faces in China, the world\u2019s largest and most competitive EV market. All those brands I just mentioned have been getting their asses handed to them by homegrown Chinese automakers in recent years. Tesla could be next in line if the new Model Y and whatever else it has in the pipeline can\u2019t hang.\n\n\u201cThere are some notable updates for sure,\u201d said Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a firm that researches the Chinese car market. \u201cBut again when you are competing with cars that have small refrigerators in the back seat, your refresh may be left wanting.\u201d\n\nChinese EV makers have gained a reputation for pushing out new models at a dizzying pace and loading their cars with impressive tech and features. Big screens, snazzy software, advanced driving capabilities and, yes, refrigerators. Le says he expects the new Model Y will give Tesla a temporary bump in China, simply because it\u2019s something different. But to compete in that market long-term, he says, what Tesla really needs are new, reasonably priced products and more frequent refreshes.\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs The Nio ES6 allows for battery swapping at thousands of stations.\n\nHe thinks the new Model Y will see more success in Europe and the U.S., where the competition isn\u2019t as fierce or affordably priced.\n\nPhate Zhang, founder of the Shanghai-based EV news site CnEVPost, told InsideEVs the new Model Y\u2019s \u201ctech-savvy\u201d design may help it defend against the ever-intensifying competition in China. But the automaker still lags behind rivals there when it comes to vehicle software, said Zhang, who drives a Tesla Model 3. That just goes to show the level of competition in China; here in the U.S., Tesla's user interface and app are lightyears ahead of what most automakers will sell you.\n\n\u201cWhile the facelifted Model Y remains competitive, we also need to be aware that local models are becoming more capable and some strong competitors like the Xiaomi YU7, Nio's Onvo L60, and the Xpeng G7 could pose a threat,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla The Tesla Model Y.\n\nTesla has let the Model Y chug along unchanged since its launch in 2020, and that\u2019s worked out remarkably well. The Model Y is a cash cow for Tesla, remains a top-tier electric option and ranks among the most popular cars in the world. The automaker sold over 480,000 Model Ys in China in 2024, around 5% more than it did the previous year. And it shipped a staggering 1.2 million of them worldwide, according to analyst estimates.\n\nBut there comes a point when a car becomes a victim of its own success and starts to fade into the background. It\u2019s why car companies give their vehicles mid-cycle refreshes every few years and full-blown overhauls periodically\u2014something Tesla hasn\u2019t done as frequently as other manufacturers.\n\nModel Y sales fell in the U.S. last year, to an estimated 373,000 units from 400,000 the year prior. That suggests the existing model may have lost some of its luster. While Tesla\u2019s sales were up in China last year, it lost market share in the EV segment, CNBC reports.\n\nIf the new Model Y doesn\u2019t maintain the model\u2019s current sales volume, that could indicate that it needs a more comprehensive redesign, said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions.\n\n\u201cAs game-changing as Tesla has been to the automotive industry, there\u2019s always a time when even the core product needs a radical update,\u201d he said.\n\nGot a tip about the EV world?

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nI just had a long chat with a good friend who was basically an OG in Tesla world. We talked about all kinds of Tesla topics trying to understand where Tesla would be going in 2025 and beyond. We covered a variety of topics, pros and cons, opportunities and risks. It was an interesting conversation. One thing that came up was \u201cbetting on the jockey\u201d versus \u201cbetting on the horse.\u201d Without a doubt, a lot of people believe in Tesla almost entirely because they believe in Elon Musk, in part because of previous successes and in part because of how things have gone at Tesla. Incidentally, I was also on the verge of writing this story, because of how odd \u2014 and interesting \u2014 Elon Musk has been lately. So, let\u2019s get into a little look at the jockey.\n\nI\u2019m going to bring it around to Tesla matters in a little while, but we have to start with other matters. To get rolling, we\u2019ve got the video game story, which actually goes from weird to weirder.\n\nAn Extremely Odd Video Game Saga\n\nIt was revealed a few weeks ago that Elon Musk was a top-level player globally of the video game Path of Exile 2 (PoE 2), a free-to-play action role-playing game (RPG) that was recently released. It was shocking and confusing. With everything else Musk has going on, how does he have time to log hundreds of hours playing a new video game? Or if he is spending hundreds of hours playing videos games, how much time is he putting into multiple companies he runs (not to mention political campaigns)?\n\nI didn\u2019t spend much time learning about this game or Musk\u2019s connection to it, but then I saw a headline pop onto Google News, \u201cElon Musk Throws Tantrum After Being Exposed by Gamers, Leaks YouTuber\u2019s DMs and Seemingly Takes Away His Checkmark,\u201d and it got me to click. What the heck was going on? My goodness \u2014 things got weird. The article got me to click a video from a YouTuber who I\u2019ve never heard of but who has 3.29 million subscribers on YouTube. I thought I\u2019d watch a few moments of the video, but I learned one reason this guy has so many subscribers, he pulls you in a bit and the editing is great (I\u2019ll come back to that). Here\u2019s the video if you want to check it out:\n\nIn the video, he discusses some oddities in Musk\u2019s livestreaming of himself playing the game, including clipping snippets of other top gamers commenting on these oddities. Let\u2019s just say it up front: it\u2019s all weird. I don\u2019t want to spend too much time on the video game part of this itself, even thought that\u2019s what the story is about, but here are a few key notes:\n\nMusk would have had to put in an enormous number of hours playing this new game to get to the level he\u2019s at.\n\nLivestreams of him playing the game show him doing some things in weird and sometimes super basic ways, or not really understanding sometimes the values of things he has or could pick up while playing.\n\nNonetheless, he is adamant that he\u2019s a master of the game, he indicates that he plays it a lot, and he\u2019s apparently not been willing to say he pays other people to play it for him in order to jack up his ranking.\n\nIt seems apparent that, even if he does play the game a lot, he has been paying others to master the game for him. This is one of the most baffling things of the whole story for me. Why is he so concerned with mastering the game that he pays others to do it for him? And even if he has a reason for that, why doesn\u2019t he just admit he\u2019s done that? Lastly on this story, why is Musk so eager for people to believe that he spends hours upon hours playing video games? I don\u2019t have many good ideas for the answer this last question, but I will propose some answers at the end of the article. I\u2019m marking this down as Q1 and will return to it at the end.\n\nOh, wait, before we move onto another story, note that this story did get even weird. Musk got into a DM chat with this video game streamer, Asmongold, at some point. After Asmongold made the video above, Musk was not happy about how things had gone, and he tweeted out a screenshot of the chat:\n\nThere are a few interesting \u2014 and, again, odd \u2014 things to add here:\n\nMusk violated X terms of service by tweeting this out.\n\nMusk somehow took this to mean Asmongold was under the editors in rank \u2026 apparently so locked into a mindset based on traditional media systems that he doesn\u2019t understand the editors work for Asmongold. Don\u2019t believe me? Musk said, \u201cAsmon behaves like a maverick \u2018independent\u2019, but in reality has to ask his boss for permission before he can do anything. He is not his own man.\u201d Seriously.\n\nGoing further, Musk apparently removed his verification badge on X.\n\nTo Asmongold, the whole saga reminded him of the behavior of \u201can angry ex-girlfriend.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, a lot of people in the gaming world see Musk as nuts, ignorant, and a special kind of weird after all of this. There are many more videos about it, but I\u2019m doing my best to not get sucked in and read another one.\n\nOh, also, this apparently isn\u2019t the first game that Musk has pretended to master despite obviously not having mastered it:\n\nThere are just really odd things in there.\n\nAn Odd & Embarrassing COVID-19 Saga with a Friend\n\nI had actually totally forgotten about one of the most infamous public claims about COVID-19 from the early days of the pandemic. It was one of the first really baffling things I saw Musk tweet or say. But there\u2019s even much more along the same lines that happened behind the scenes.\n\nRegarding that first reference, as a refresher, in March of 2020, Musk tweeted, \u201cBased on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April.\u201d As we all know, there were far more new cases at the end of April than on March 19, and definitely not \u201cclose to zero.\u201d\n\nOne could say that, well, no one really knew in March what would happen with the virus. Except that\u2019s not true. It was obvious what was happening and what was going to happen. It was Spring Break here in Florida, and it was obvious COVID-19 was spreading rapidly and we were in for a long, challenging pandemic. I did not understand at the time how Elon Musk could not understand that. I did not understand how someone with so much wealth didn\u2019t have an expert team of advisors making sure he understood what was going on. I didn\u2019t understand how he didn\u2019t register the math and the science of this all.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just one random public tweet.\n\nApparently, longtime friend Sam Harris, a neuroscientist, philosopher, author, and podcast host, had a disagreement with him on COVID-19 predictions. You may recall that Musk tweeted \u201cThe coronavirus panic is dumb.\u201d At the time, the question was, was his point that panic is dumb? Or was his point that the coronavirus was nothing? Well, Harris reached out in private and said, \u201cYou have an enormous platform, and much of the world looks to you as an authority on all things technical,\u201d and noted that he thought the tweet was irresponsible and risked damaging his reputation.\n\n\u201cElon\u2019s response was jarring: \u2018Sam, you of all people should not be concerned with this.\u2019 The billionaire linked to a page on the CDC website indicating that COVID was not among the top 100 causes of death in the US,\u201d Futurism reports\n\n\u201c\u2018This was a patently silly point to make in the first days of a pandemic,\u2019 Harris wrote on his Substack.\n\n\u201cAfter hours of texting, neither saw eye to eye. But they did agree on a bet. Musk bet donating $1 million to charity against a $1,000 bottle of tequila that COVID cases in the US would not exceed 35,000.\n\n\u201c\u2018The terms of the bet reflected what was, in his estimation, the near certainty (1000 to 1) that he was right,\u2019 Harris said.\u201d\n\nSo, yeah, Musk had no understanding of the coronavirus trend, scientifically or medically, and genuinely thought it was going nowhere.\n\nThe summary point from Sam Harris on his Substack was that \u201chis engagement with Twitter/X transformed him.\u201d There\u2019s \u201csomething seriously wrong with his moral compass, if not his perception of reality,\u201d and Harris thinks much of that stems from being obsessively online and essentially getting tricked by the massive misinformation tsunamis that swirl around on social media constantly.\n\nIn the end, Harris texted Musk \u201cIs (35,000 deaths + 600,000 cases) > 35,000 cases?\u201d a few weeks later when the CDC reported 35,000 COVID-19 related deaths and 600,000 cases.\n\nBig question #2 (Q2) that I\u2019ll come back to: what does this story have in similar with the gaming story above?\n\nAn Axe Murderer Terrorizing Twitter HQ?\n\nWhile reading one of those stories on Futurism, I saw a recommended related story: \u201cElon Musk Claims Axe Murderer Targeted His Employees, Cops Say They Have No Idea What He\u2019s Talking About.\u201d\n\nWHAT?!\n\nNothing should surprise me at this point, but this one did again nonetheless.\n\n\u201cTough-on-crime crusader Elon Musk claims that there was an axe murderer on the loose in the city of San Francisco who tried to kill several of his employees, with the authorities doing nothing to catch the assailant. The key word in all of this being \u2018claims.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018About a year ago, a guy tried to kill three X employees with an axe outside the former Twitter HQ in SF. They reported it to the police, but nothing was done,\u2019 Musk tweeted, responding to the account End Wokeness (a favorite of his). \u2018He later killed someone with that axe.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf this is true, the city has become so utterly lawless that the cops never got wind of the grisly murder. On Monday, local police said they could find no records supporting Musk\u2019s story, the San Francisco Chronicle reports \u2014 evidence that, once again, Musk may be simply be fibbing or falling victim to preposterous rumors.\n\n\u201c\u2018Based on the information provided, we cannot find any incident that matches this description in that location in 2023 or 2024,\u2019 Evan Sernoffsky, a San Francisco police spokesperson, told the Chronicle.\u201d\n\nEven further, Musk has apparently told this story a few times now with different details \u2014 different weapons (a machete in at least one case), differences on whether Twitter employees reported it, differences on how many people this murderer reportedly went on to kill.\n\nIt\u2019s all just \u2026 weird. The cops don\u2019t know what he\u2019s referring to.\n\nWhat is going on here?\n\nTesla Stuff\n\nOkay, now let\u2019s get to something that actually matters in the cleantech scene. What does all of this mean when it comes to Tesla?\n\nMusk has made numerous claims regarding Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) and robotaxis that have proven wrong over the past decade. He has also made a number of projections based on simple math and trend lines, some of which have proven wrong, and some of which are about the future and thus can\u2019t be determined right or wrong yet. For example, the company\u2019s sales were supposed to be growing 50% a year through 2030, reaching 20 million sales in the year 2030. That\u2019s now five years away and the company\u2019s sales would need to increase more than 10 times over.\n\nFrankly, if Musk has a habit of making big uninformed decisions in other fields and doubling down on them, why should we assume he doesn\u2019t also do this at Tesla on important Tesla matters? Why should we assume this isn\u2019t what he\u2019s been doing with regarding to Autopilot and Full Self Driving for 10 years? Yes, the technology has improved, but if you spend billions of dollars on improving it and have thousands of people working on improving it, you can be sure it\u2019ll improve. The question is whether the base assumption and long-term forecast is really a smart thing to bet on.\n\nIs the jockey as great as he\u2019s been made out to be? On a side note, has Musk always really been the jockey, or was JB Straubel the real jockey in the company\u2019s critical years?\n\nReturning to the video game story, it seems obvious that Musk is eager to be the jockey publicly even when he\u2019s not the one doing the work. I don\u2019t see any other way to explain that story. He is happy to take the credit and reputation boost from someone else doing a ton of work (or, well, gaming), and will even double down on the idea that he was the one doing it all along. Regarding Q1, \u201cwhy is Musk so eager for people to believe that he spends hours upon hours playing video games?,\u201d the only thing I can come up with is that he wants people in the gaming world to respect him and think he\u2019s a great gamer. I can\u2019t find any other reason for this. And if he\u2019s so desperate to claim the credit of mastering this game, how desperate has he been to claim the credit for other successes adjacent to him or accomplished underneath him that really aren\u2019t about the work he\u2019s done or how smart he is? Again, was he the super-jockey he brought Tesla\u2019s big successes, or was that someone else \u2014 or multiple other people \u2014 no longer engaged in critical operations at the company?\n\nRegarding Q2, what that gaming story has to do with the COVID-19 story, the point is that he wants people to think highly of him. He wants people to think he\u2019s right even when he\u2019s not. He has apparently never acknowledged to Harris or others that he got this story wrong. Instead, he has gone into some pretty extreme directions on COVID-19. He\u2019s been more focused on getting people to think he\u2019s right than on being right. From my perspective, that\u2019s a concern. When it comes to Tesla leadership, it worries me. Others disagree, obviously, but each passing week brings another shocking story that makes it very hard to trust this jockey.\n\nWhat do you think?",

            "content": "From an operational standpoint, both Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) and Rivian (RIVN 1.32%) had choppy years in 2024. However, Tesla's stock skyrocketed higher, while Rivian saw its shares finish the year much lower, down about 43%. Part of Tesla's stock success last year can be attributed to its late run following the election win from Donald Trump, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a big supporter of his and has become an advisor.\n\nWith the new year upon us, however, let's look at which stock could be set to outperform in 2025.\n\nDeliveries and more\n\nJust like their stocks headed in different directions in 2024, so did their vehicle deliveries. Rivian delivered 51,579 vehicles in 2024, up from 3% in 2023, while Tesla delivered nearly 1.79 million vehicles, down from 1.81 million deliveries a year ago.\n\nRivian's delivery growth came despite a number of issues during the year that constrained production. Earlier in the year, it shut down its manufacturing plant to implement a retooling upgrade, while late in the year it ran into component shortage issues. Tesla, meanwhile, saw its first-ever yearly decline in deliveries as the company faced stiffer competition and sales pressures in China and Europe.\n\nInvestors, however, brushed off Tesla's tough 2024 with an eye to the future. Many see the company's biggest opportunity not in selling electric vehicles (EVs) but in its autonomous driving robotaxi ambitions. The company had a big cybercab event last year, where it introduced a two-seat vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals. It said the vehicle would cost under $30,000 and that it plans to start producing the vehicles before 2027. However, the company has not gone into detail on the technology being used, driving range, or safety features of the vehicles.\n\nTesla has not successfully been able to develop a fully autonomous driving car, and its vehicles using its Supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology have been the subject of a number of high-profile accidents and investigations. However, Musk has lobbied for the government to eliminate National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) car crash reporting requirements, which the Trump administration appears to support. Such a move could make it easier to get its fully autonomous driving technology approved, which could then smooth the way for its robotaxis.\n\nCurrently, only Waymo, owned by Alphabet, offers paid robotaxi rides in the U.S., but its technology is more expensive than Tesla's due to its use of lidar. However, Tesla bought lidar sensors last year, so whether or not it incorporates the technology to improve performance is still to be seen. However, if the company can develop a cheap autonomous robotaxi, it would have a big opportunity in front of it.\n\nRivian's ambitions are much simpler than Tesla's. First, the company is looking to become gross margin-positive, as it has been selling its vehicles for less than the cost to make them. The company upgraded the tooling in its factory to improve line rates, as well as reduced the material costs going into its vehicles. Its biggest achievement was switching to a new zonal architecture, which significantly reduces the number of electronic control units (ECUs) and wiring in its vehicles and thus lowers costs.\n\nIts zonal architecture was also a big reason behind the big investment and partnership the company formed with Volkswagen, which will get access to the technology for its own EVs. In return, Rivian is getting significant cash payments, assuming certain milestones are met, which will help it ramp up the production of its new R2 SUV. Rivian will look toward the less expensive R2, expected to cost around $45,000, to give it an SUV that will have more mass appeal. The new SUV is expected to start production in the first half of 2026.\n\nBetter investment in 2025?\n\nBoth Tesla and Rivian have potential catalysts in 2025. Any moves and announcements toward autonomous driving and robotaxis should be good news for Tesla stock. While its sales could continue to languish overseas, I think this could be the biggest driver of the stock.\n\nRivian's stock, meanwhile, should get a boost if it can get to positive gross margins and slowly improve them throughout the year. As it cycles through its models built with its older technology and increases production now that its component shortage has been alleviated, this looks like a realistic goal.\n\nIn picking an investment between the two, I'd go with Rivian as the more speculative play. The stock was beaten down in 2024, and it should be able to make progress on its gross margin goals while increasing deliveries as well. Tesla's stock, meanwhile, already had a big run at the end of 2024, so it may not have as much upside on any positive news.",

That\u2019s a lot of performance for not a lot of money.\n\nNow, if you have around $50,000 to play with and are looking at a BMW, the 330i xDrive is the best option. It has a starting MSRP of $47,950, almost identical to the Model 3 Performance\u2019s post-credit price. However, unlike the EV, this is not a performance car. In fact, the 330i makes do with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with a measly (by comparison) 255 hp and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque. That\u2019s enough for most people, but its 0-60 mph time of 5.4 seconds, according to BMW, is a far cry from Tesla\u2019s rocket-ship acceleration.\n\nTesla\u2019s Claims vs. BMW\u2019s Numbers: A Closer Look\n\nPerformance stats aren\u2019t always straightforward, and Tesla, in particular, has a reputation for massaging its numbers. From showcasing prices on its website that include \u201cgas savings\u201d (seriously?) to quoting acceleration figures with rollouts, Tesla has mastered the art of creative marketing. BMW, on the other hand, tends to do the opposite\u2014downplaying its numbers, from horsepower to acceleration times, often to the point of underselling its cars.\n\nTake real-world testing as an example. Car&Driver clocked the 330i xDrive\u2019s 0-60 mph at 5.2 seconds (see here) and its quarter-mile at 13.9 seconds at 100 mph (160 km/h). In contrast, the Tesla Model 3 Performance managed 3.0 seconds to 60 mph without rollout (2.8 seconds with rollout) and an 11.0-second quarter-mile without rollout (11.2 seconds with) at 125 mp (see here).\n\nBMW\u2019s Interior Comfort vs. Tesla\u2019s Minimalism\n\nWhile the Tesla has an obvious edge in performance, the interior of the 330i is arguably nicer. It\u2019s not ultra-minimalist like the Model 3 and features a huge curved display housing the infotainment system and a digital instrument cluster.\n\nFor $2,450, customers can opt for the Premium package, which includes a head-up display, power tailgate, remote engine start, and active driving assistant. Another popular choice is the $2,550 M Sport package, adding an aerodynamic kit, 19-inch bi-color wheels, a variable sport steering system, and more.\n\nWhat About the M3 Competition?\n\nIf you\u2019re a BMW die-hard and want something that can truly hang with a Tesla Model 3 Performance, the M3 Competition xDrive is the car for you. Not only can it hold its own more reliably at higher speeds and during prolonged use, but it pumps out 523 hp and 479 lb-ft (649 Nm), has all-wheel drive, and, according to BMW, can hit 60 mph in 3.4 seconds.\n\nHowever, independent tests have shown it can do that in less than 3 seconds in perfect conditions and match the Tesla\u2019s 11-second quarter-mile. According to Car and Driver, the M3 CompetitionxDrive matched Tesla\u2019s numbers, hitting 60 mph in 3.0 seconds (2.8 seconds with rollout) and running the quarter-mile in 11.0 seconds flat (11.2 seconds with rollout) at 124 mph. Unfortunately, the M3 Competition starts at $86,000, putting it into an entirely different class than the Tesla.\n\nSo, What\u2019s Your Pick at $47K?\n\nAt the end of the day, it comes down to priorities. Do you value raw, electrified speed and the simplicity of Tesla\u2019s minimalist design? Or are you drawn to the traditional luxury, refinement, and subtle charm of a base BMW sedan? Let us know which you\u2019d choose\u2014the 330i xDrive or the Model 3 Performance\u2014in the poll below, and drop your reasoning in the comments.",

The move prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation into whether the company\u2019s autopilot safeguards were \u201cadequate following a series of crashes,\u201d Reuters reported at the time.\n\nMore than 100 Tesla accidents in the Bay Area have drawn attention from federal investigators looking into whether the autopilot feature played a role.\n\nHigh-profile Tesla accidents in Northern California that may have involved autopilot include one in which a Tesla Model S suddenly braked on the Bay Bridge and caused an eight-car pileup that injured nine people. In another, a Pittsburg man died after his Tesla Model S barreled into a Contra Costa County fire truck.

What was going on? That's what he was trying to figure out.\n\nEveryone has taken their car through an automatic car wash with the enormous brushes that clean their car or truck. You pull up, and the attendant sprays your car down first to get the worst road grime off your vehicle.\n\nYou put your car's transmission in neutral, wait for the car ahead of you to move, and then begin to feel the car wash pull your car forward into the tunnel and watch as the large brushes run over the top, windshield, and sides of your car. You sit and look at your phone, checking for any new messages or sending a text.\n\nImagine Tyler, a Realtor, getting his car ready to pick up a client for a house showing. He wants his new Tesla Model X to look its best. Everything is going well; he has plenty of time to get the car washed and vacuumed at the full-service car wash center, and then disaster strikes.\n\nHe hears a loud POW, POW, POW over and over, and he's terrified. Something is striking his white Tesla X's windows over and over. It looks like someone is shooting his windows with a gun. His car is being assaulted.\n\nHere is Tyler's terrifying car wash story.\n\nTyler says, \"Dude, so I cannot catch a freaking break. So look at this. So, I'm going through this car wash at White Water. And this (in his TikTok video, he shows a yellow tow strap) was wrapped up in one of the brushes that spins to wash your car.\"\n\nWhile I'm sitting in the car, and it's pulling me through the car wash, I hear POW, POW, POW, and I'm wondering what the (expletive) is going on?\n\nSo, I'm screaming because someone is breaking my windows, so I'm banging on the window, and I'm screaming, and I'm honking the horn for them to stop.\n\nThey finally stopped the car, and I could not believe what had happened. I cannot catch a break. First, I was rear-ended last week, and now this. I am Livid.\n\nStepping out of his car, Tyler is met with a sight that leaves him in shock. His new Tesla Model X is marred with damage.\n\nIn a follow-up video, he says, \"This is the first spot it hit.\" The glass looks like someone hit it with a hammer, and then he says, \"And then POW, there it hit again.\"\n\nHe shows the second and third spots and then the fourth time. \"Look at how deep the glass shattered.\"\n\nThen again, POW, right here, the sixth time, hit the glass strip where you put the key to unlock it, and there's a camera in there that's completely blocked. It missed the back window, thanks for that, and then it hit this triangular window, POW, and you can actually see the frame of the car that's how hard the impact was.\n\nTyler says, \"The last two places it hit are on the rear fender right next to the taillight, POW, POW.\"\n\nFirst, Tyler's Tesla Model X is assaulted by a wheel going through the White Water car wash, and then he has to deal with the company's insurance to get it fixed. His ordeal isn't over yet.\n\n\"And just in case this happens to anyone, the car wash is replacing the damaged windows and fixing my rear fender. I had to go into the office and fill out an accident report, and they have 72 hours to get back, and they did call on the third day,\" he says.\n\nThey said they would fix it, and then two days later, they called and said their insurance company would fix it, and I could deal with them.\n\nSo, I called their insurance, and it's a big mess because only one place is certified to work on a Tesla. Finally, I called my own insurance company so they could fix my car and then go after their insurance company to get reimbursed. That's what we are doing now.\n\nTyler concludes, \"The car wash was apologetic about it, but I am still livid.\"\n\nHis resentment towards the car wash is still fresh, a testament to the lasting impact of the incident.\n\nWhat happened at the car wash that nearly destroyed Tyler's Tesla Model X?\n\nThe tow strap in the automatic car wash on the passenger side was likely from a truck that went through the car right ahead of his car. It could have been left in the pickup bed and then picked up by the car wash mechanism and lodged in its large brush.\n\nThe carwash attendant is supposed to check for anything loose in a truck bed and have the owner remove it and put it on the vehicle. The attendant missed seeing the tow strap, which was a big mistake.\n\nWhat should you do if a car wash damages your vehicle?\n\nA report from Progressive Insurance says, \"Before leaving the car wash, check the interior and exterior of your vehicle for damage so that you can report it immediately. If you wait until you get home, it will be difficult to prove where or when the damage occurred.\"\n\n\"If you notice a problem, let the car wash owner know so you can complete an incident report. Include as many details as possible and take photos of the damage in case you need them in the future.\"\n\nShould car owners avoid the automatic car wash?\n\nOne Reddit user, RollingCoal115, says, \"When I worked at a carwash when I was a teen, we had about 25 vehicles go through before a customer noticed a huge scratch on his passenger side that wasn't there before he came in.\"\n\n\"It turned out to be from a truck that came through, and in the bed of the truck was fishing line\u2026 It got stuck in one of the spinning raps.\"\n\nSo, dirt and pebbles are the least of your worries. I would only ever go through a touchless wash if I had a quality true ceramic coating, and it was necessary to get a wash when I was away from home.\"\n\nAnother Reddit user, wellpaidscientist says, \"I only use a touchless car wash. But they rely on harsher soaps and greater water pressure. Nowhere near as bad, but not perfect. I just dry with turtle wax \"wax and dry.\"\n\nConclusion.\n\nIf you have an expensive car and want to keep it looking its best, protect the paint, and not have damage done, wash it yourself. The automatic car wash is convenient, but the car owner should beware.\n\nHave you sustained damage to your car or truck when going through an automatic car wash?

The redesign is expected by some to launch in Tesla\u2019s home market in the coming weeks, and recent discounts on inventory units of the legacy Model Y in both the U.S. and Canada suggest that this may be right.\n\nThis week, Tesla launched price cuts of up to $4,120 on inventory Model Y units in the U.S. and Canada, as seen on the company\u2019s website. At the time of writing, the company is offering a variety of discounts in areas across both countries, a move that is commonly used to clear out inventory to make way for upcoming refresh versions.\n\nAt the time of writing, we were able to find Model Y units with discounts ranging from $960 to $2,500, with multiple Long Range AWD trim options getting the max price reduction. Prior to the inclusion of local tax credits and the $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, the latter of which is widely expected to go away under the incoming Trump administration, some LR AWD units are selling for a starting price of $47,490, despite also including add-ons such as Quicksilver or Ultra Red paint or induction wheels.\n\nFor the Performance trim, we were able to find a few upgraded units with discounts of $4,120, with prices dropping as low as $47,370 before credits. As such, this could be a good time to pick up the legacy Model Y ahead of the refresh launch, especially if you\u2019re looking for something full spec at the base price. When considering the tax credit, some of these AWD LR units saw their prices drop to as low as $39,990 with upgrades, or as low as $37,490 for the RWD configuration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, Tesla has been offering inventory discounts on its legacy Model Y in China in recent weeks, even still offering many since the vehicle\u2019s launch, and prior to its debut, the company was also offering a wide range of promotions on the vehicle. During the company\u2019s launch of the refreshed Model 3 in 2023 and 2024, Tesla also launched significant legacy Model 3 discounts in the U.S. in the months leading up to the North America debut, when it had already launched in the Asia-Pacific, Europe and Middle East markets.\n\nREAD MORE ON TESLA MODEL Y REFRESH: Tesla\u2019s refreshed Model Y design should make repairing this part easier\n\nTesla\u2019s new Model Y: lightbars, front-facing camera and more\n\nSightings of Tesla\u2019s new Model Y have been spotted since as early as mid-2024, and sightings have been increasing significantly over the past several weeks leading up to the launch in other markets. Before the official launch, many correctly speculated that covered versions of the model appeared to include lightbars on both the front and rear bumpers, as opposed to the more traditional headlights and taillights that can be found on the legacy models.\n\nTesla also added a front-facing camera to the new Model Y, which offers a wider field of view for its semi-automated features such as Autopilot, Actually Smart Summon and Supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD), which is expected to launch in China sometime this year. It\u2019s not exactly clear just yet when Tesla plans to launch the new Model Y in the U.S. or Canada, though we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it launch as soon as this month\u2014especially with some of these massive discounts going live.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

            "content": "For about a decade, Tesla has been the world\u2019s biggest EV producer, making its luxury vehicles the most ubiquitous electric cars on the road. But now a very different type of car, made in China and selling for as little as $10,000, is vying for the top spot. China\u2019s BYD, which makes more than a dozen models of all-electric sedans, SUVs and minivans, built more electric cars than Tesla last year, the first time it has done so.\n\nBYD\u2019s rise is a sign of the growing dominance of Chinese electric car companies, which have benefited from generous government subsidies, China\u2019s focus on battery manufacturing and mining, and a state-backed push to build the world\u2019s biggest network of charging stations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat has implications for the climate. Lower prices make EVs accessible to more people, accelerating the global transition from gas to electric vehicles. BYD sells its cars mostly in China, the world\u2019s biggest car market, but it\u2019s also trying to expand abroad.\n\nIt may also have human rights implications. The U.S. Labor Department, Human Rights Watch and news outlets, including The Washington Post, have reported links between forced labor and Chinese materials and parts used to make EVs, including by U.S. companies.\n\nJust don\u2019t expect to find a BYD car in the United States anytime soon: The Biden administration imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs last year to lock out competitors.\n\nFrom luxury to everyday car\n\nTesla and BYD build EVs for two opposite ends of the car market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla started out as a luxury brand. Even today, its cheapest car \u2014 the base version of the Model 3 sedan \u2014 sells for $44,130. BYD is geared toward the cheap end of the market. Its Seagull sedan, one of the best-selling cars in China, costs about $10,000.\n\nThese affordable, widespread EVs are expected to outsell gas cars in China for the first time this year. As combustion engine cars and trucks dwindle, China\u2019s state-backed oil company Sinopec predicts the country\u2019s oil demand will peak within two years and then start to fall, dragging planet-warming greenhouse emissions down with it.\n\n\u201cTesla competes for the market with BMW, Mercedes, etc.,\u201d said John Helveston, an engineering professor at George Washington University who studies the Chinese EV industry. \u201cBYD, on the other hand, is the Toyota of EVs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh, my God, that\u2019s a cheap Chinese car. I would never want to ride it if I could afford an expensive German car,\u2019\u201d said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School. \u201cNo, not at all. It\u2019s just a much better vehicle\u201d than Western EVs.\n\nThe companies also target different parts of the world. Tesla is the top EV seller in the United States and Europe, but it has slipped down the rankings in China. BYD sells three-quarters of its cars within China, according to company disclosures. But it is starting to expand into regions such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East and South America, and Helveston said BYD is better suited than Tesla to go after these markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is not a single attractive, affordable [all-electric car] made in the U.S. that would stand a chance against a Chinese-made one in a developing market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018An automotive backwater\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the United States and the European Union have created tariff barriers to keep out Chinese competitors. These policies have restricted car buyers in the Western world to more-expensive EV options.",

The new 2025 electric SUV, which is currently only available in China but will soon be available in other markets, has several new features.\n\nCodenamed 'Juniper', the update affects the exterior styling, interior comfort and functionality, and to a lesser extent the mechanical parts, to consolidate and reinforce the qualities that have made this model the preferred choice of more than 1 million motorists over the last few years.\n\nTesla Model Y 2025: platform and dimensions\n\nThe Tesla Model Y 2025 confirms the shared platform with the Model 3, launched a year ago, and shows some of the innovations now found on the Model Y. The reference segment remains the D segment, that of mid-size SUVs, where new competitors such as the Porsche Macan and Audi Q6 e-tron have emerged.\n\nPhoto : Tesla The Tesla Model Y retains its shape and proportions, but changes its look and introduces the new Glacier Blue colour.\n\nThe car is 4.8 metres long, around 4.5 cm longer than before due to the new bumper design, but remains 1.92 metres wide and 1.62 metres high, with an unchanged wheelbase of 2.89 metres.\n\nIn terms of styling, the main changes are at the front, with slimmer headlamps, a light bar linking the two main elements, and a new bonnet. At the rear, the new full-width light strip, stretched between the two angular light clusters, is also noticeable. These solutions are similar to those seen on the Cybertruck and Cybercab.\n\nThe company has not released much information, so it is not known whether this new design will also bring improvements in aerodynamic efficiency, which was already remarkable on the first Model Y, with a CX of just 0.23, and therefore in fuel consumption and range, which have increased in any case.\n\nLength: 4.8 metres\n\nWidth: 1.92 metres\n\nHeight: 1.62 metres\n\nWheelbase: 2.89 metres\n\nWeight: 1,884-1,998 kg\n\nTesla Model Y 2025: space on board\n\nAlways minimalist, yet comfortable and spacious, the interior of the new Tesla Model Y incorporates the updates already seen in the redesigned Model 3. The interior has been updated to include customisable ambient lighting, ventilated front seats and power-folding rear seats, as well as new fabric upholstery for the dashboard. Windows are also new and thicker for improved soundproofing.\n\nOn the driver's side, there are new features in the 15.4-inch central display, which has been upgraded, as well as the 8-inch rear passenger display. Also new is the steering wheel, which takes its cue from the Model 3. Next to it, in the first photos of the standard version available in China, is a new lever, perhaps a light switch for the direction indicators, which were previously controlled from the steering wheel.\n\nPhoto : Tesla Tesla Model Y, the new interior with dashboard trim\n\nThe dimensions have been retained, but the load capacity has not changed from that of the first version, which ranged from 600 to 2,158 litres, plus a 117-litre front 'frunk'. The new seat, however, should improve practicality.\n\nLuggage compartment: 600 to 2,158 litres\n\nFront luggage compartment: 117 litres\n\nTesla Model Y 2025: battery and range\n\nThe Tesla Model Y range, at least as far as the Chinese market is concerned, starts with two versions while we wait for the Performance, which will arrive at a later date. For now, you can choose between the RWD model with a single rear motor and the Long Range AWD with two motors, four-wheel drive and a larger battery.\n\nCapacity is not specified, but the outgoing model had 55 and 75 kWh respectively, with WLTP ranges of around 283 and 331 miles. In addition, a rear-wheel drive Long Range with a range of 373 miles was available, but this does not appear to have been confirmed. The new one is expected to improve on these figures, although at the moment we only know the figures approved in China, where the cycle is less strict and where the new Model Y has claimed ranges of 368 and 447 miles.\n\nPhoto : Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\nTesla Model Y 2025: recharging\n\nThe batteries are of the LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) type and have a high charging power of up to 170 kW for the base model and 250 kW for the AWD Long Range version, respectively. Here too, however, we'll have to check that the specifications for markets other than China are the same.\n\nPhoto : Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\nTesla Model Y 2025 pricing\n\nThe Chinese price list starts at 263,500 yuan, equivalent to just under \u00a330,000, but it's higher than the outgoing model by around 5%, so we expect prices to rise slightly in other markets too. However, European production, which will take place at the Gigafactory in Berlin, will protect Tesla from the danger of higher prices due to tariffs that the EU has set for electric cars made in China.\n\nGallery: Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\n50\n\nSource: Tesla\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "A Tesla Model 3 owner wanted to see how much the EV's battery would last while \"idling\" in the freezing cold.\n\nThe test was meant to simulate a situation where the driver is stranded and needs to keep warm.\n\nA gas-powered car would have used about 2 gallons of fuel to do the same, but EVs use energy much more efficiently.\n\nElectric vehicles are known for their efficiency, especially when driving at low speeds around town. Here, EVs have a huge advantage over internal combustion vehicles because the slower the driving speed, the lower the energy consumption.\n\nBut have you ever wondered how much energy an EV uses while switched on and standing still? In a gas car, the engine sips fuel every second it\u2019s running, including when idling. So how does an EV compare?\n\nCanadian YouTuber FrozenTesla wanted to find out by using his own 2024 Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive by keeping it on through the freezing night when temperatures feel as low as -28 C (-18 F) degrees.\n\nRemember, this is not about parking the car and leaving it on standby\u2014it\u2019s meant to simulate a situation where a person might be stranded and needs to keep warm. So things like the climate control were kept on, as were the heated seats and heated steering wheel.\n\nThe experiment started at 9.30 pm with the car\u2019s battery state of charge at 66%. The climate system was set to 68 degrees F, the front heated seats were set on auto and the heated steering wheel was also left activated.\n\nAfter about an hour, the SoC went down by roughly 4%. One more hour later, the battery level went down by another 3%. The next morning, after 12 hours of letting the car \u201cidle\u201d through the night, it had 29% charge left in the battery, which comes out to an average loss of 3% per hour.\n\nIn total, 34.4 kWh of energy was used during the 12 hours of idling, which comes out to a price of $6.05, considering the average electricity price of $0.176 in the U.S.\n\nBy comparison, a four-cylinder 1.5-liter gas engine uses roughly 0.16 gallons of fuel per hour to idle, according to an Engineering Explained video. Multiply that by 12 hours and you get 1.92 gallons used in 12 hours of idling. With the average gas cost of $3 in the U.S., it comes out to $5.76. Cost-wise, the EV isn't more efficient, but to be fair, 1.5-liter engines are quite rare stateside (they're usually bigger and thirstier).\n\nHowever, that\u2019s just part of the story because leaving a gas engine idling for long periods can cause premature engine wear. On older engines, it may even lead to fuel mixing with oil, reducing lubrication over time. Then, there\u2019s the issue of emissions. Leaving an EV to \u201cidle\u201d has zero emissions associated with it as long as the energy put in the batteries comes from green sources, whereas idling a gas engine will spit out nasty gasses.\n\nSo if you're stuck in an electric car\u2014a rare occurrence, thankfully\u2014but have a battery with a decent charge, you can at least bank on using less energy and doing vastly less environmental damage than a gas-powered car would.\n\nCorrection 1/18/24 at 2 p.m. EST: This story originally had incorrect math regarding the estimated costs for idling an EV and gas car.

The serial entrepreneur is also involved with SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, xAI, and X.\n\nWith DOGE, Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 who helped create the commission but recently announced he is departing ahead of an expected run for governor of Ohio \u2014 vowed to slash the federal budget and cut wasteful spending.\n\nMusk, now the sole leader of the commission, has pledged to restructure federal agencies, or in some cases eliminate them, with the goal of improving efficiency.\n\nIt's no small job.\n\nMusk's work with Trump could benefit Tesla\n\nSome of the shareholders BI spoke to said they believe Musk's involvement in the Trump administration could help reduce the regulations that Tesla must navigate, paving the way for technological advancements and generally making life easier for the company.\n\nAnthony L. Gurino, a Tesla shareholder from Long Island, said he sees Musk's position easing the \"red tape around autonomous driving.\" The technology is currently approved on a state-by-state basis and Musk has said he'd push to create a national approval process for fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nPatrick O'Connell, a Tesla shareholder who started investing in 2013, said he went \"all in\" on the stock in 2019. He told BI he hopes Musk's new role will ease regulations and could help with brand awareness.\n\nPhilip Engberg, a Tesla shareholder in Denmark, said that under the Biden administration, it seemed like there was a \"lot of political will against\" Musk's companies and the technology they were trying to develop.\n\nDespite being the top EV seller in the US, Tesla was famously not invited to President Joe Biden's EV summit in 2021. When asked at a press conference if Tesla's exclusion was due to not having a unionized workforce, then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she would let people come to their \"own conclusion.\"\n\n\"Now the outlook is that is completely gone,\" Engberg said.\n\nFaced with increased competition and slowing growth across the EV market, Tesla reported its first year-over-year car sales decline in January. However, Telsa isn't the only car company to face declining sales, and the EV giant recently reached a new milestone, outselling Audi globally for the first time in 2024.\n\nWall Street appears optimistic about Tesla's fortune during the Trump administration. Tesla shares are up nearly 70% since the election, and some on Wall Street expect them to rise higher still. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas recently raised his price target from $400 to $430 and revised his bull case to $800.\n\nCraig Irwin, a managing director and senior research analyst at Roth Capital Partners who recently changed his Tesla buy status from neutral to \"buy,\" told BI that he estimates that \"the pool of Tesla enthusiasts\" has doubled since Trump's reelection.\n\n\"Right now, you have technology-oriented conservative fighters that are going to say, 'You know, I think Elon Musk is a cool guy \u2014 let's go see what this Tesla car is about,'\" Irwin said.\n\nNot all shareholders are convinced that Musk's affiliation with Trump will have a positive impact on Tesla. John VonBokel, a shareholder who voted against Musk's pay package the second time, said he \"can't make sense\" of why Tesla's share price has gone up so much.\n\n\"Certainly Trump is not going to go in there and write code to make FSD better,\" VonBokel said, referencing Tesla's Full-Self-Driving beta software, which requires drivers to be ready to take control of the vehicle at any moment. VonBokel said he sees it as a \"classic situation of the market seems to think this is worth more than I think it's worth.\"\n\nCharlie Redmond, a Tesla shareholder since 2017, told BI that he doesn't see the relationship with Trump lasting more than six months. He said the main benefit he sees from Musk's involvement would be convincing Trump to keep the EV tax break, which Trump has talked about getting rid of. Musk has also said he supports ending the credits.\n\nTesla shareholder and investing author Kiana Danial also said she sees the relationship likely falling apart at some point. If that were to happen, Danial said Musk has \"always been unpredictable\" and she believes any stock dip in the short term could be regained.\n\n'Musk has shown that he can multitask brilliantly'\n\nSome of the Tesla shareholders told BI they believe the second shareholder vote approving Musk's pay package galvanized support for him as the company's leader. Engberg told BI he thinks retail shareholder support \"is the greatest it has ever been.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Musk is Tesla, and Tesla is Musk,\" Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives told BI, adding that the court battle has \"become a soap opera\" and he expects Tesla to win its appeal at the Supreme Court level given \"overwhelming\" shareholder approval of the pay package.\n\nIn addition to some shareholders being invigorated by the Tesla shareholder vote and Trump's victory following Musk's endorsement and fundraising, a majority of the investors and analysts BI spoke to said Musk has proven his ability to take on multiple projects at once.\n\n\"Musk has shown that he can multitask brilliantly,\" said Irwin of Roth Capital Partners.\n\nDavid Abrams, a Tesla shareholder who started investing in the company about three years ago, told BI he thinks Musk's involvement in politics could have some level of impact on his focus on the company. However, he said Musk has \"proven over the years that multitasking is one thing that he is undeniably good at.\"\n\n\"He keeps throwing stuff under his plate and you would think at some point the focus would go away,\" Redmond said.\n\nAbrams said that while Musk may be spread thin, his companies likely have enough people in place that they can \"largely run on their own.\" Other shareholders also said that at this stage of the company, Musk doesn't need to be involved in every step.\n\n\"Elon's an important leader, but it's about delegating and he's really good at that,\" Tesla shareholder Larry Winer told BI.\n\nTesla and Musk did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAlexandra Merz, a staunch Tesla advocate and shareholder who goes by the username \"TeslaBoomerMama\" on X, said the company hasn't relied on his constant attention to run the business \"for a long time.\"'\n\n\"He doesn't need to be the one opening factory doors in the morning,\" Merz told BI, adding that he doesn't turn \"every bolt in every rocket\" at SpaceX either.\n\nOthers pointed to DOGE's seemingly limited timeframe. Merz told BI that she is \"in no way concerned\" that Musk will be involved with the government for decades.\n\n\"Keep in mind that DOGE is set to expire on July 4, 2026,\" Tesla shareholder Cianna Swartz told BI.\n\nAre you a Tesla shareholder?

The gains took place in conjunction with a 1% gain for the S&P 500 index and a 1.5% gain for the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nTesla's valuation climbed today alongside reports that CEO Elon Musk could be involved in a deal to purchase TikTok from ByteDance -- its Chinese parent company. The electric vehicle (EV) leader's stock also appears to be getting a boost related to the inauguration of President-elect Trump this coming Monday.\n\nTesla stock jumps on TikTok stories\n\nDue to data-security concerns and other issues connected to relations with China, U.S. regulators are moving to stop TikTok's operations within the country unless ByteDance cuts its connections to the social-media platform. Speculation is emerging about who might end up purchasing the leading short-form video service, and Elon Musk has reportedly emerged as a leading candidate.\n\nIn a recently published note, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the firm believes that China and ByteDance are potentially open to selling TikTok to Musk or the X social media company he owns and leads. While TikTok being purchased by Musk or X wouldn't create any immediate catalysts for Tesla's core business operations, investors appear to be excited by the move -- and it's possible that expanding influence for the CEO could create some less tangible valuation benefits down the lines.\n\nWhat comes next for Tesla under the new Trump administration?\n\nIn addition to the TikTok-related news, Tesla stock also got a boost today in conjunction with \"Trump trade\" momentum. Some investors have been building positions in companies that could see benefits related to the change in presidential administration. Elon Musk's relationship with Trump and leadership position in the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" advisory panel has helped make Tesla one of the high-profile valuation beneficiaries of this dynamic.\n\nBut while it's possible that Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and new presidential term could spur some short-term and long-term catalysts for Tesla stock, investors should continue to make business fundamentals central to any investment in the company. Tesla's share price is up 94% over the last year. On the other hand, the company's vehicle deliveries report at the beginning of this month showed that annual sales had dropped for the first time in the EV specialist's history.\n\nTesla's business has multiple growth avenues outside of traditional vehicle sales, but the stock's impressive run over the last year means some strong future growth is already priced into the company's valuation.",

            "content": "Safety standards for battery-equipped stoves don\u2019t yet exist. Batteries in stoves are so new, the safety-certification group UL Solutions, which develops testing certifications for cooking appliances for the US, has not yet updated its existing electric-range standards for testing them. (UL Solutions said that it is leading a task group that is working on that process now. The group includes representatives from new manufacturers like Copper, as well as other industry groups such as the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers.) These certifications are not legally required for appliances, and plenty of ranges sold do not have them, but the majority of electrical appliances we recommend do.\n\nCalisch told me that even though the Charlie was not eligible for UL electric-range certification, the range was tested to the same standards to make sure that the cooktop and oven would operate safely. And the battery itself has been certified to two UL Solutions standards: UL 1973, which covers batteries used for auxiliary power, and UL 9540A, which evaluates for \u201cthermal runaway,\u201d or when a chain reaction quickly creates high heat and can lead to flames or explosions. (This is most often what happens in fires caused by e-bikes, which use a kind of lithium-ion battery. In many of those fires, the New York City Fire Department has said, the batteries were likely being charged incorrectly or were cheaper batteries without UL certification.)\n\nCopper said that it also consulted with the New York City Fire Department to ensure that the Charlie\u2019s battery compartment and the range itself were safely designed. (This consultation was required by the New York City Housing Authority and the New York Power Authority, which will award Copper a contract to manufacture 10,000 stoves similar to the Charlie for public housing once Copper completes its testing and pilot phases.) The battery compartment is designed to reduce the risk of thermal runaway fires, said Calisch. The components are physically separated and built with both a steel barrier and an air gap between the oven compartment and the battery components. The compartment also uses the same types of insulation, he said, that prevent oven heat from breaching the walls and setting your kitchen cabinets on fire.\n\nAround 300 Charlie models have been in use in homes for nearly a year, and many have been in beta testing for far longer. The company expects 1,000 units to be in homes by the spring of 2025. Copper connected me with one owner who had used both the beta and Charlie models, and he had no issues.\n\nIt\u2019s expensive. The stainless steel base model of this stove costs $6,000, which is a significant investment for a range. (The white and blue finish options cost more.) For now, anyone who buys a battery-equipped appliance like the Charlie is eligible for a 30% battery-storage technology tax credit on the cost of the range, which can lower the final price to about $4,200. (The credit is deducted from your tax bill once you file your federal taxes.) For comparison, the most affordable induction ranges in a style similar to the Charlie can occasionally be found on sale for around $800.\n\nBut the Charlie could potentially cost less than even the cheapest range if you also need to upgrade your kitchen\u2019s electrical panel and wiring\u2014a project that can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $9,000, according to the federal government\u2019s estimates. (There are federal rebates and some tax credits available to cover the costs, but those primarily apply to people with lower incomes.)\n\nConsidering its high-quality design, the Charlie is also on a par price-wise with other midtier premium ranges we have evaluated, which often cost about the same as (or more than) induction models, all of which still require a 240-volt outlet.\n\nIt lacks some basic features. The Charlie has a true convection oven but lacks the oven features that come standard on much cheaper ranges, such as air-fry or pizza mode, a self-clean setting, or even a basic timer. (These omissions may not be dealbreakers for everyone; most people don\u2019t take full advantage of such modes.) Calisch said that some of these features could be added and downloaded to ovens later, because the Charlie is Wi-Fi\u2013enabled.\n\nSmall, new manufacturers pose a risk, and getting service could be a pain. This is a new product from a small, recently debuted, and largely untested company. For now, the Charlie is available only directly from the Copper website, and you don\u2019t have as many service techs or sales and distribution points at your disposal as you would with a bigger brand. Copper\u2019s service and support operates like that of most smaller appliance manufacturers in that the company works with national and local third-party service providers. Copper also has a phone number, email address, and web form for reaching support, but it does not offer assistance outside of working hours. The Charlie has a two-year warranty (one year longer than most), but there is no guarantee that the company will still exist in a decade.\n\nIt is harder to get. You\u2019re likely to wait several months at a minimum before you can get a Charlie range because of high demand for a relatively small amount of stock. For now, Copper estimates that most stainless steel Charlie ranges purchased in late 2024 in the contiguous United States will be delivered in March 2025, and that blue and white models will be delivered in May 2025. (Residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, where the ranges are assembled, will receive them more quickly, and for now, shipping is not available to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico.)\n\nIt is not certified by Energy Star. The Charlie range does not currently have Energy Star certification, which means that it is not eligible for federal electric-appliance rebate programs.",

            "content": "It\u2019s a replay of the VHS versus Betamax war, but with higher stakes for a warming planet: A battle over EV charging standards finds Tesla winning decisively, as major automakers abandon their Combined Charging System (CCS) plugs in favor of Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard (NACS).\n\nIt\u2019s another black eye for a CCS infrastructure that\u2019s become infamous for faulty or sparsely located chargers. But it\u2019s by no means a knockout, at least for now: The switch to NACS is bringing its own teething pains and workarounds.\n\nFor EV owners, or potential buyers on the fence due to worries over charging access, a mass migration to Tesla\u2019s largely trouble-free network does offer cause for celebration. Tesla is opening roughly 20,000 of its roughly 30,000 Superchargers in the U.S. and Canada to owners of brands such as Ford, General Motors, Genesis, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes, Polestar, Rivian, and Volvo.\n\nBut connecting a non-Tesla model to a V3 Supercharger requires compatible vehicle hardware and software, and typically a NACS adapter. Software delays and hardware shortages have been the rule, even as Tesla cranks out 8,000 adapters a week from a Buffalo facility to meet booming demand. Kia planned to open up Supercharger access for owners on 15 January, but last week announced a delay until spring due to unspecified \u201ctechnical issues.\u201d BMW and its Mini and Rolls-Royce brands have also pushed back access to later in 2025.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a bit of a bumpy road, but things will settle down,\u201d says Jim Burness, the founder and CEO of National Car Charging, which is one of the largest resellers and installers of commercial charging equipment in the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the era of \u2018Adapt-o-rama,\u2019 which would not be a bad business space to be in for the next few years.\u201d Burness himself drives a Tesla with a CCS adapter, as well as a Rivian with an adapter for the NACS plug.\n\nMore Manufacturers Are Adopting Tesla\u2019s Adapters\n\nEV drivers can finally experience what they\u2019ve been missing, as I did last week when I used a NACS adapter to charge a 2025 Rivian R1S Tri Motor SUV\u2014a versatile 850-horsepower marvel, with its optional \u201cMax\u201d 140-kilowatt-hour pack\u2014at a Tesla station in Rhode Island. That went off without a hitch, despite some side-eye from a Tesla Model Y owner who had to wait for this Rivian interloper to charge up at one of eight Superchargers.\n\nWithout an adapter, non-Tesla drivers must find a rare Tesla Magic Dock station that can handle cars with CCS connectors. But there are currently only about 100 total Magic Dock stalls, many of which are concentrated in Canada and the northeastern United States. Backlogs of owners are waiting for adapters from manufacturers, and some aftermarket adapters have proven wonky. Ford cautioned owners to stop using free adapters that it provided, which could potentially slow down a charge or damage the car\u2019s charging port. (Ford has promised to send replacement units.) Meanwhile, General Motors has released its own adapter , priced at US $225: Expensive, but if it works, likely worth every penny to a Chevrolet Blazer or Cadillac Lyriq owner in need of an emergency charge.\n\nThe first non-Tesla models with NACS connectors are coming to showrooms this year. The avatar is the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5, already emerging from its new Georgia factory with a native NACS plug, replacing the model\u2019s previous CCS port. Hyundai and its sister brand Kia have announced five EVs that will come from the factory with NACs ports, including the popular Kia EV6, the three-row Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUVs, and the luxury Genesis Electrified GV70. With the Ioniq 6 sedan also expected to adopt a NACS port, Hyundai Motors alone would have six NACS models, or one more than Tesla offers in its entire global lineup. The Georgia-built Ioniq 5 will come from the factory or showroom with an included CCS adapter to hook back into the charging network used by earlier versions of the car. The company is offering complimentary adapters to existing owners who purchased or leased an EV before 31 January.\n\nMany auto executives have expressed frustration with the existing CCS network, and how it might be throwing a wrench into EV adoption. When owners encounter charging snafus, executives say, they tend to blame their car and its maker as much as a charging provider, a case of guilt by association. Miles Johnson, a spokesman for Hyundai, summed up what\u2019s at stake for owners and the company\u2019s currently booming EV sales.\n\n\u201cAn entire team in HATCI has been working on this, and it\u2019s got to work,\u201d Johnson says, referring to the Hyundai America Technical Center Inc., near Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell the car if someone can\u2019t roll up to a Tesla charger, use the app and make it work, every time.\u201d\n\nNew Charging Architectures Bring Woes\n\nWhile Hyundai Motors models will work on existing Superchargers, they\u2019ll do it with one hand tied behind their back. Like other cars with robust 800-volt architectures\u2014including models from Audi, Lucid, and Porsche\u2014the Hyundai delivers some of the fastest DC charging in the business: A blazing 257-kilowatt maximum for the redesigned 2025 model, up from 233 kW. But Tesla\u2019s V3 Superchargers are optimized for its own 400-V cars, which limits how fast 800-V competitors can fill them up. Karl Holodnick, an engineer at HATCI, says Tesla\u2019s current V3 Superchargers cap Hyundai models at 135 kW. For the Ioniq 5\u2019s new, enlarged 77-kWh battery pack, a 20-minute charge from 10 to 80 percent on the speediest CCS charger will take 29 minutes on a V3 Supercharger.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve optimized the software in our charging systems to charge as fast as possible at Tesla Superchargers,\u201d Holodnick says. \u201cWe will be able to charge at a higher power when Tesla releases their new V4 Superchargers .\u201d\n\nAutomakers must also work to integrate Tesla\u2019s \u201cPlug and Charge\u201d capability, which lets users initiate and automatically pay for a charge the instant they plug in, rather than using the Tesla app.\n\nThe 2025 Kia EV6 SUV is among the cars that highlight unintended consequences wrought by a lack of standardization, including seemingly basic matters such as outlet locations and cord lengths.\n\nKia\u2019s redesigned crossover EV will adopt a NACS port later this year, but will also move the outlet to the driver\u2019s-side rear, matching its location on Teslas. Some Tesla owners, already resentful over giving up exclusive Supercharger access, are finding one or more stalls blocked by cars whose plug ports aren\u2019t situated the same way. That\u2019s exactly what happened at the Tesla station where I replenished the Rivian: A Ford F-150 Lightning pickup was forced to park sideways to connect the Supercharger\u2019s too-short cord to an outlet on the front fender, blocking an adjacent Supercharger.\n\nMercedes has come up with a novel workaround for its next-generation, 2026 CLA-Class sedan, which it recently previewed in a camouflaged prototype form. The sedan will introduce the new 800-V Mercedes Modular Architecture that will underpin a range of new models.\n\nAs part of that, the sedan will offer both an SAE J1772 port for slower Level 2 AC charging, and a NACS port for fast DC charging. There\u2019s only one catch: The Mercedes will be limited to fast charging through its NACS port, with Level 2 charging exclusively through the J1772. (That J1772 is one-half of a CCS \u201ccombo plug\u201d that allows both Level 2 and DC charging.) To switch those functions, owners will need to lug a pair of adapters around, one for Level 2 charging on slower Tesla Destination chargers, and another to fast charge at CCS stations. Not the most elegant solution, but one that opens the entire universe of charging options.\n\n\u201cThis combination is designed to provide maximum flexibility for our customers and ensure an optimal charging experience across various charging infrastructures,\u201d Mercedes said in a statement. \u201cAs more and more charging stations convert to NACS, the CLA-Class EV will be perfectly positioned to take advantage of this growing network for faster, more convenient charging.\u201d\n\nIs CCS Charging an Imperiled Ecosystem?\n\nAt the same time, public CCS providers such as ChargePoint and Electrify America must race to add NACS outlets to their networks, or retrofit some current machines\u2014all while maintaining a CCS network that\u2019s suddenly feeling as endangered as a Betamax copy of Jurassic Park.\n\nFor any provider, \u201csite design and cord length are the biggest changes we\u2019re going to see,\u201d Burness says. \u201cIf I can back in my Rivian and get charger to port, I\u2019m not taking up two stalls.\u201d\n\nFor Tesla\u2019s part, the automaker has begun building new stations with longer stalls that can be approached in two directions, or with repositioned chargers to better reach cars on either side. Burness cites Kempower , a company whose chargers offer cords up to 10 meters long, enough to reach the longest cars and SUVs, or even commercial trucks. ChargePoint is rolling out its new Omni Port chargers, that dispense either a CCS/JC1772 or NACS connector to serve both types of EV.\n\nBurness says that ultimately, Tesla\u2019s network has proven its superiority, not just in sheer ubiquity but for its more-elegant plug and cord design, which is much easier for users to handle, including for elderly drivers or people with physical limitations.\n\nThe NACS plug also features fewer electrical pins and has proven more robust in the field, with less breakage and fewer problems connecting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lighter, less-bulky design, with fewer pins to lock in, and I think we\u2019ll see a decrease in user and charger error,\u201d Burness says. \u201cAs more cars convert over, you\u2019re going to see a better connection rate. All told, this switch is not going to be as difficult as some might have you believe.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated on 17 January to correct what type of adapter will come with the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5.\n\n",

Once they pulled the Tesla-branded truck over at a nearby convenience store, they informed the owner that the vehicle isn't approved for road use in the U.K. The GMP Transport Unit then posted the news on their social media, stating \u201cThe Tesla Cybertruck is not road legal in the UK and does not hold a certificate of conformity.\u201d The truck was then turned over to their specialized task force on vehicle seizures, Operation Wolverine.\n\nA certificate of authority is \"a paper document issued by the manufacturer of a vehicle.

However, the production of the Cybertruck has faced delays, leading to a range of challenges since its delivery debut in 2023.\n\nUnveiled by CEO Elon Musk in 2019, the Cybertruck originally promised a $40,000 starting price. By 2024, its base price nearly doubled to $80,000, tempering expectations for affordability. Despite initial fanfare, the Cybertruck\u2019s rollout has been plagued by production hiccups, multiple recalls, and pricing concerns.\n\nIn 2024, the Cybertruck became the fifth best-selling EV in the U.S., outselling the Ford Lightning F-150 with 38,965 units sold.

However, the production of the Cybertruck has faced delays, leading to a range of challenges since its delivery debut in 2023.\n\nUnveiled by CEO Elon Musk in 2019, the Cybertruck originally promised a $40,000 starting price. By 2024, its base price nearly doubled to $80,000, tempering expectations for affordability. Despite initial fanfare, the Cybertruck\u2019s rollout has been plagued by production hiccups, multiple recalls, and pricing concerns.\n\nIn 2024, the Cybertruck became the fifth best-selling EV in the U.S., outselling the Ford Lightning F-150 with 38,965 units sold.

            "content": "Tesla has launched a new update in China, which includes a large number of new features, including a major focus on navigation improvements.\n\nThis is still a 2024 build, but it seems like it may be the last one we\u2019ll see - especially since we\u2019ve already heard 2025.2 is on its way.\n\nLet\u2019s take a peek at the new update and all the new features.\n\nNavigation Improvements\n\nOne of the new features is the ability to choose how your vehicle chooses a route. If you have \u201conline routing\u201d enabled, then your vehicle\u2019s routing is determined remotely, which lets it take more things into account. However, we now have alternate routes; the driver has limited control over how the route is chosen.\n\nThis update introduces new options on how the route is determined, giving the user more control.\n\nFastest Time - This option appears to be the current default, likely similar to how the vehicle picks a route today.\n\nLeast Congestion - This option appears to select routes that have minimal traffic congestion, thereby making your drive that much easier and safer - even if it's a longer route. It's a good use of Tesla\u2019s integration with live traffic data.\n\nPrefer Highways - We saw this option coming as it was initially discovered alongside the new Trailer Profiles feature. It prefers highways over other routes, and while that can be useful, we\u2019d prefer the opposite too - an Avoid Highways option.\n\nLowest Tolls - This is an interesting option. It doesn\u2019t avoid tolls like the pre-existing option but finds the route that\u2019s the fastest and has the lowest tolls. That\u2019ll be an interesting option for people where toll routes have a big impact on travel times.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t appear that this brings the long-awaited avoid highways feature, it does give users a lot more control over the route the vehicle takes. While Teslas in China use Baidu maps with exciting features, these changes are to Tesla\u2019s backend, so we expect these features to arrive in other regions as well.\n\nService Area Functions\n\nAs part of navigation improvements, approaching a highway service area in China will now automatically open an on-screen prompt, directing you to restaurants, convenience stores, and charging facilities within the service area. It\u2019ll even point out big-name restaurants.\n\nWe\u2019d love to see something similar to this in Europe and North America, especially as you pull up to a Supercharger at a rest area.\n\nFor those who prefer a little less in-your-face advertising of local businesses, this option can be disabled in Vehicle Options > Navigation > Service Areas.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether this option will be available outside of China in the future.\n\nOther Features\n\nThis is the big holiday update for China to celebrate the Chinese New Year. While the update includes some additional new features that we haven\u2019t seen, the rest of it looks to be China-exclusive games, apps and other holiday update features we\u2019ve already received.\n\nThe three exclusive games are from Tencent - Happy Landlord, Happy Mahjong, and Throw Eggs, and will be region-restricted to Chinese vehicles.\n\nThis update also adds Actually Smart Summon for vehicles equipped with EAP or FSD.\n\nThe final one is a bit interesting - Supercharger Bollards. Certain Superchargers in China have ground posts or bollards that automatically raise or lower. These locks prevent non-charging vehicles from parking in the Supercharger spots. Unfortunately for users, it meant you had to open the Tesla app to lower a specific bollard before being able to park to charge your vehicle. However, with this update you can now unlock the bollard from inside the vehicle - the button to unlock the bollard will pop up automatically as you\u2019re navigating to the Supercharger.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping the Service Area functions and Navigation improvements make their way to other markets in some capacity, so keep your fingers crossed for a North American or European version of this update soon.",

As with everything Tesla does, predicting a timeline for its arrival isn't a good idea as it's nearly impossible to get right.\n\nWe added a Cybertruck Foundation Series to our fleet for a One-Year Road Test last year, and it has predictably divided opinion thanks to, well, everything about it.\n\nTesla sold nearly 40,000 Cybertrucks in 2024, a mere fraction of the sales of older models like the Model Y and Model 3.

I got a quick response, in which one of the advisors offered to schedule me for an extended demo drive, effectively giving me a three-hour window to try out FSD Supervised.\n\nOn Monday, I headed out from my house in Fort Collins, Colorado, to the next town over, Loveland, to try Tesla\u2019s latest FSD Supervised version available. While I initially scheduled a demo drive for a Model Y with FSD Supervised v13.2.2, one of the Tesla advisors informed me that there was also a Model S on-site with version v13.2.2.1, so I elected to test that one instead.\n\nAfter getting a quick rundown from the advisor on the Model S, my demo drive officially began. I typed my first destination into the navigation system, pressed and held the blue \u201cStart FSD (Supervised)\u201d button, and off I went.\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD Supervised: autonomy is definitely on the way\n\nPerhaps many people have this experience when trying FSD out for the first time, but right off the bat, I found myself laughing at how it worked and a little scared that it would make a mistake. This Model S was now driving me out of the Loveland Tesla parking lot to a nearby Target, through busy parking lots, turns and lane changes, and it was pretty uncomfortable at first not to be the one making the maneuvers\u2014let alone the fact that no person was making these maneuvers, but rather it was the vehicle doing it on its own.\n\nI felt like an anxious passenger\u2014my feet pressed firmly on the floor in distrust and disbelief\u2014only I was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. I really couldn\u2019t do much but laugh at how strange the experience had felt so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, not long after my first trip, something interesting happened.\n\nMy mindset slowly shifted from fear to trust with each correct maneuver, and I managed my first few drives without disengaging at all, offering a true testament to how well FSD Supervised performed on this test. Granted, I went in without too much of a plan and wasn\u2019t targeting fringe cases or particularly tough maneuvers; I just wanted to see if this car could drive me around for a few hours, and to feel what it was like to demo FSD Supervised as a newcomer.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that I did most of my driving in FSD\u2019s Chill mode, though I also tested a few drives in both Standard and Hurry. Personally, I think I would probably keep it in Chill mode most of the time, as it\u2019s the most similar to how I drive of the three.\n\nBelow are a few moments from the drive that show some of the system\u2019s capabilities, even turning onto busy roads that would be difficult for a human driver.\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD Supervised reverses out of a parking spot\u2026 and we\u2019re off\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA simple reverse out of a parking spot, a good start! pic.twitter.com/TIx2yDmSxT \u2014 TESLARATI (@Teslarati) January 15, 2025\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD Supervised takes a few left turns onto busy roads\n\nAnother busy left turn \u2013 \u201cFSD handled this busy turn with ease.\u201d pic.twitter.com/SncR0Kh7ar \u2014 TESLARATI (@Teslarati) January 15, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother left turn during a somewhat busy time of day \u2013 \u201cI was a little scared, not going to lie, but FSD handled it well.\u201d pic.twitter.com/WNunR05C3h \u2014 TESLARATI (@Teslarati) January 15, 2025\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD Supervised tackles a two-lane roundabout and parking lot\n\nRoundabout?

While it does feel closer than ever after years of reporting on small tweaks, improvements and developments, I think it\u2019s also worth emphasizing again that the system still requires the driver to pay attention, even though it\u2019s tempting to believe that it can handle all the driving by itself.\n\nAs I drove more and more, or rather as the car drove me, I became more comfortable trusting that FSD Supervised was going to make the right decisions, which it did about 99 percent of the time. I was lulled into somewhat of a false sense of safety that almost had me believing the vehicle didn\u2019t need to be supervised, but that 1 percent of the time (maybe even less) that it did get confused still required my input.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI only had a few interventions for the whole experience, but one in particular had me a little scared after having become a little complacent and too trusting. As you can see in the video below, FSD Supervised was looking to merge into the right lane, when two vehicles slowed down. The Model S attempted to change lanes anyway, requiring me to overtake the wheel and keep driving straight.\n\nOur first bit of adversity \u2013 \u201cThis was the most dangerous intervention I faced (I only had about three the whole time). FSD was trying to merge right, but the vehicles in that lane slowed down, and the car didn\u2019t seem to understand what was going on. It started merging into the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/hJUBnCAjd2 \u2014 TESLARATI (@Teslarati) January 15, 2025\n\nBesides the quick moment of fear in deciding I needed to take the wheel, it really was not a big deal once I regained control. It was actually a good wake-up call: this system still needs to be supervised, even if it makes fewer and fewer mistakes with each new version and feels like a solid human driver for the vast majority of the time.\n\nI had a few other disengagements on my drive, mostly when the vehicle seemed to get confused about uncommon traffic circumstances or in confusing parking lot scenarios without clear signage. However, these moments made up a very small portion of my experience, and I can only imagine what another couple of years of development will do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD Supervised: still needs supervision, but I got a good glimpse into a future of autonomy\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed trying out FSD Supervised and I hope to do it again sometime. Additionally, I\u2019d recommend trying it out to anyone, especially if you\u2019re interested in seeing where driving tech is headed.\n\nWhile I definitely got a glimpse into the future potential for fully autonomous driving, I also think it still requires supervision, even if just for those very seldom moments where the system gets confused. The margin for error with driving safety is obviously extremely low, though I do believe Tesla will eventually make good on its aim to make this system better than human drivers in time\u2014and it already feels pretty close the majority of the time.\n\nI hope to do this again sometime soon, and a major shout out to the Tesla Loveland team for making the experience smooth and for answering all my questions along the way.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

            "content": "Elon Musk has said America is being \u201cstrangled to death\u201d by regulations. But the billionaire\u2019s car company, Tesla, might not have survived without them.\n\nThe electric automaker earned $10.7 billion from selling credits created by government climate programs \u2014 a total that accounted for a third of Tesla\u2019s profits over the last decade, according to an analysis of securities filings by POLITICO\u2019s E&E News. In the first nine months of 2024, some 43 percent of its net income came from those credits, which Tesla sold to rival carmakers after exceeding climate mandates in California and elsewhere.\n\nNow President-elect Donald Trump, whose campaign was bankrolled with the help of Musk, is threatening to pull the plug on some of the environmental programs that have powered Tesla\u2019s rise. That is prompting questions about whether Musk will seek to protect rules that have helped make him the world\u2019s wealthiest person, or if he\u2019ll support Trump\u2019s promise to put the brakes on federal initiatives for electric vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe situation highlights the potential conflicts of interest that Musk, the CEO of Tesla and its largest shareholder, could grapple with as co-leader of Trump\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. In addition to heading Tesla, Musk owns or runs other companies that could be boosted or battered by the red-tape-cutting initiative, including the giant aerospace contractor SpaceX and the artificial intelligence startup xAI.\n\nTesla earns credits by selling EVs. The corporate subsidy was created by government programs to encourage carmakers to manufacture vehicles with lower, or zero, carbon emissions. Tesla can then sell those credits to other automakers who need to comply with climate-related regulations established in Washington, Sacramento and Brussels.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pure profit\u201d for Musk, said Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican political strategist who now leads the advocacy group American EV Jobs Alliance. \u201cCredits are the best business he\u2019s got, so I think he might want to protect them.\u201d\n\nCompliance credits make up less than 3 percent of Tesla\u2019s revenue since 2014, but represent more than 32 percent of the company\u2019s profits in the past decade, E&E News found. That\u2019s because Tesla doesn\u2019t have to spend additional money to cash in on compliance credits, which are linked to the sale of EVs it\u2019s already built and sold.\n\nWhile auto sales, car leases and energy products make up a larger share of Tesla\u2019s income, they result in less profit due to the expenses involved in making cars, batteries and solar panels. Generating credits from the sale of EVs, by comparison, doesn\u2019t require additional materials, labor or energy.\n\nFor Tesla, compliance credits are \"a very lucrative slice of the pie,\" said Pavel Molchanov, a research analyst at the investment bank Raymond James.\n\nThat's unlikely to change anytime soon. Even if the Musk-led deregulatory task force or the Trump administration target the EPA or California programs that analysts believe are responsible for most of Tesla's compliance credit revenues, it would likely take years for those policy reversals to fully take effect.\n\n\"Until the federal regulatory changes \u2014 and then the legal fights run their course \u2014 it's going to be status quo,\" Molchanov said. \"Tesla will continue to make [credit] money, whether we like it or not.\"\n\nSaved by compliance credits\n\nTesla's rise from a quixotic EV startup to the world's most valuable automaker is intrinsically linked to California's Zero-Emission Vehicle program.\n\nTesla has strongly supported the ZEV program, while Trump sought to end it during his first term. On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to take another run at the California initiative by revoking an EPA waiver that allows the state to set stronger car pollution standards than the federal government.\n\nThe state initiative seeks to phase out the sale of gasoline-powered cars in California by 2035. Eleven other Democratic-led states have adopted the program's EV requirements.\n\nThe ZEV program was created in 1990 by the California Air Resources Board to force automakers to invest in cars that don't burn gasoline. Over the years, traditional car companies have tried to comply with the initiative by building vehicles that are powered by hydrogen fuel cells or electricity, with most now focused on developing EVs.\n\nAutomakers that fail to comply with the ZEV program are required to buy credits from companies that have exceeded the program\u2019s mandates, like Tesla. (The initiative is separate from other carbon credit markets.)\n\nThe ZEV program has propped up Tesla at key moments in its history.\n\nThe initiative helped Tesla record its first monthly profit in 2009, a key requirement of the $465 million loan it received from the Energy Department to build its first mass-market manufacturing facility. When Tesla announced plans the following year to become a publicly traded company, it disclosed to investors that its revenues were \"principally from sales of the Tesla Roadster and related sales of zero emission vehicle credits.\" Later, ZEV credits helped Tesla pay off its government loan early \u2014 a move that sent its share price soaring.\n\nThe legal basis for the ZEV program is rooted in provisions of the Clean Air Act that allow California to set stricter pollution limits than the federal government. Under Democratic presidents, EPA has generally granted California the waivers it needs to impose those limits, to address the state's stubbornly poor air quality. The Biden administration last month approved a waiver for the ZEV program.\n\nAt the end of his first term, Trump's EPA withdrew California's authority to regulate auto emissions, and during his campaign last year, Trump promised to yank the approval once more.\n\n\"I would not allow California politicians to get away with their plan to impose a 100 percent ban on the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks,\" Trump said during a September rally in the state.\n\nThe ZEV program is already under legal scrutiny, even before Trump takes office. In December, the Supreme Court rejected a red-state effort to invalidate the California waiver, but agreed to review a narrow question about whether business groups are legally able to challenge the state's air pollution rules.\n\nThreats from Trump\n\nTesla had previously lobbied to protect the ZEV program and other state initiatives that boost EVs, according to Daniel Sperling, a former member of the CARB.\n\n\"They were always very aggressive\" in pushing for tighter ZEV program requirements, said Sperling, who is now a civil engineering professor at the University of California, Davis. The stronger the rules were, he explained, the more compliance credit revenue they could generate for Tesla.\n\nSperling doubts that the Trump administration would undercut a program that continues to benefit one of the president-elect's closest advisers.\n\n\"It seems like a reasonable possibility they'll just slow walk it, and it'll never happen,\" he said. \"If California is not allowed to implement their zero-emission vehicle program \u2026 it's going to be a huge loss of revenue for Tesla.\"\n\nTrump poses other threats to Tesla, Musk's biggest moneymaker. Trump could roll back federal fuel economy standards and automotive greenhouse gas emission limits that also generate compliance credits for Tesla. (The company's securities filings don't detail how much credit revenue is generated by the ZEV program compared to other regulatory schemes.)\n\nWith the help of the Republican-controlled Congress, Trump could repeal the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers. Musk supports killing the tax credit, which he told financial analysts in July \"would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly.\"\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump transition team, said the president-elect has a \"mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, including stopping attacks on gas-powered cars.\" She didn't detail how he intends to do that.\n\nIn December, Reuters reported that the Trump transition team had called for reversing the California waiver, watering down fuel efficiency requirements and clawing back federal subsidies for EV charging infrastructure.\n\nMusk is focused on 'autonomy'\n\nEven if Trump blocks California's ZEV program, Stellantis, Ford, Volkswagen and several other top automakers have agreed to continue complying with the program, in the expectation that a future Democratic administration would revive it. The companies could face retroactive fines and struggle to produce enough EVs to comply with the program's escalating demands if they abandoned it under Trump.\n\nIf the ZEV program goes into legal limbo, the state could tweak the initiative so it no longer benefits Tesla, according to Margo Oge, the former director of EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality.\n\n\"This is going to be something that the governor of California has to decide,\" said Oge, who is now a distinguished fellow at the San Francisco-based environmental advocacy group ClimateWorks Foundation.\n\nState regulators \"can write whatever they want to do, however they want to enforce them,\" she said of the side agreements with automakers. \"These are not legal agreements under the Clean Air Act.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has already taken steps to insulate the state's EV market from Trump and Tesla, which was founded in Silicon Valley but moved its headquarters to Texas in 2021.\n\nIn November, the Democratic governor announced plans to offer a $7,500 EV buyer subsidy if congressional Republicans end a federal tax incentive of the same size that was created by the Inflation Reduction Act. But state credits might not be available for vehicles from dominant automakers like Tesla, a Newsom administration official told POLITICO.\n\nTesla didn't respond to questions about its reliance on compliance credits.\n\nEarlier this month, the company reported that its annual EV sales had dropped for the first time in a decade. On Jan. 29, it plans to report its fourth-quarter results, including how much it earned through compliance credits.\n\nTesla has downplayed the significance of credits and tax subsidies to its business in recent earnings calls. Instead, company leaders have touted their plans to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, neither of which are currently generating revenue for the company.\n\n\"The value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy,\" Musk told analysts in July. \"If you believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock. And all these other questions are noise.\"\n\nMany investors are willing to give Musk the benefit of the doubt. After Trump's win, Tesla's share price hit a record high and the investment bank Morgan Stanley increased its internal price target for the company's shares to $400, just above the stock's close at the end of trading Tuesday.\n\nSetting the United States on a course for autonomous vehicles and robots \"is going to involve government and industrial partnership on a scale perhaps not seen in many decades,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a December research report. \"Elon Musk's emergence from a political 'outsider' to having a voice in potential policies may, at some level, accelerate Tesla's journey beyond autos.\"\n\nMike Lee, Lesley Clark and Kelsey Brugger contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Safety advocates fear Tesla will face less accountability for car crashes under Trump\n\ntoggle caption Washington State Patrol\n\nIn April of last year, a distraught driver called 911 to report a crash in Snohomish County, Wash., outside Seattle.\n\n\"I hit a person on a motorcycle in my car, on the freeway, on the way home,\" said the driver, who identified himself to the dispatcher as Scott Hunter.\n\nHunter was behind the wheel of his Tesla Model S, following a motorcycle in stop-and-go traffic, when the car ran over the motorcycle and its rider, pinning both underneath.\n\n\"I'm the driver. I'm not sure how it happened, but I am freaking out. So please get here,\" Hunter told the dispatcher as he tried to summon help.\n\nThe motorcyclist, 28-year-old Jeffrey Nissen, was pronounced dead at the scene. Hunter, 56, was arrested for vehicular homicide. He told police he had been \"distracted\" by his phone moments before the low-speed crash.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPolice eventually extracted more data and video of the crash from the car, with Tesla's help. NPR obtained some of those materials through a public records request to the Washington State Patrol.\n\nThe documents reveal that about two minutes before the crash, Hunter put his car into what Tesla calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised) mode \u2014 its most advanced driver-assistance system, for which drivers typically pay extra. The car did not detect Hunter's hands on the steering wheel for more than a minute before the crash, according to a report by the detective investigating the incident.\n\nThat and other details from the police investigation have not been publicly reported before. But the broader narrative they suggest \u2014 a driver not paying attention to the road \u2014 is something Tesla's critics say they've seen many times.\n\n\"This is yet another case where the lack of driver engagement is directly responsible for the crash,\" said Missy Cummings, a professor of robotics and engineering at George Mason University, who reviewed documents from the crash investigation at NPR's request.\n\n\n\nCrash reporting requirements aided push for improved safety measures\n\nCar companies including Tesla are required to report the details of crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems, like the one Hunter was using. Regulators and safety advocates insist the reporting requirement is crucial to understanding how well the technology is working \u2014 and is necessary to hold carmakers accountable for deaths and injuries when the technology fails.\n\nBut safety advocates fear that this requirement will be scrapped by the incoming Trump administration, along with other federal investigations into Tesla and its advanced driving systems.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest person, spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help President-elect Donald Trump return to the White House. Now Musk may be poised to influence federal policy at the agencies that regulate his businesses, including Tesla.\n\nThe carmaker is at odds with regulators over the crash reporting requirement, which Tesla executives argue is unfair because it makes the company's safety record look worse than it is.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat reporting requirement helped federal regulators build the case for a recall of Tesla's Autopilot system, the predecessor to its Full Self-Driving mode.\n\n\"I saw crash after crash after crash, predominantly Teslas,\" said Cummings, who previously worked as an adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Part of her job was to study data from crashes that involved advanced driver-assistance systems.\n\n\"The drivers would see a car that's doing pretty good,\" Cummings said in an interview. \"They get a false sense of security, and they don't understand that they should be paying attention.\"\n\nUnder the voluntary recall announced in late 2023, Tesla agreed to update its software, adding new safeguards to try to keep drivers more engaged.\n\ntoggle caption Washington State Patrol\n\nSince 2021, Tesla and other carmakers have been required to report all serious incidents involving autonomous vehicles or advanced driver-assistance technology to regulators at NHTSA under what's known as the Standing General Order on Crash Reporting.\n\n\"That information has really given NHTSA an important window into what is happening on the road,\" said Ann Carlson, the former acting administrator and chief counsel at NHTSA, who signed the standing general order.\n\n\"Without it, the agency simply doesn't have the window into what is going on on the roadways with what is really novel and interesting, important technology \u2014 but technology that we really need to make sure is safe,\" said Carlson, who is also a professor at the UCLA School of Law.\n\nBut the standing general order may not be standing much longer.\n\n\n\nTesla advocates say the reporting requirements give a misleading impression of the cars' safety\n\nCurrent and former Tesla officials take a very different view of the standing general order and its crash requirement. To them, it's unfair \u2014 even misleading \u2014 because it makes Tesla's overall safety record seem worse than it really is.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The public is being confused by erroneous data that lacks context and lacks analysis,\" said Rohan Patel, a former vice president of policy and business development at Tesla.\n\nTesla collects far more data on crashes than other carmakers and has many more cars on the road that are using advanced driver-assistance technology. That could help explain why Tesla has reported far more crashes than other carmakers under the standing general order: over 1,600 in total, more than 4 out of every 5 crashes that involved advanced driver-assistance systems.\n\n\"The truth is,\" Patel said, \"that the rate of those incidents is quite low.\"\n\nNow it appears the incoming administration may share the company's concerns. Reuters reported last month that the Trump transition team recommends getting rid of the crash reporting requirement.\n\nThe transition team did not respond to questions from NPR about the crash reporting requirement or whether Musk would weigh in on policies that affect his own businesses.\n\nTrump has tasked Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy with leading what he calls the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is expected to recommend drastic cuts to the federal workforce and regulations. But it's not clear how much influence, if any, Musk will wield over the federal agencies that regulate his companies.\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nMusk has publicly defended Tesla's safety record too.\n\n\"Inevitably when there are a lot of cars and you've got billions of miles, you do have the law of large numbers where, OK, there's a small chance of something bad happening,\" Musk said at a shareholder meeting last June.\n\nStill, some Tesla shareholders seem nervous about the company's approach. At that meeting last year, Musk was asked how he thinks about the \"unfortunate mishaps\" that have plagued other companies that are working on autonomous cars.\n\n\"Those are real consequences of developing this technology, and I'm just wondering where your mind is on that,\" asked one shareholder who did not give his name.\n\nMusk replied that Tesla is trying to be careful with the rollout of Full Self-Driving mode. \"Human driving is not perfect,\" he said, noting that roughly 40,000 people are killed every year on U.S. roadways. \"What matters is, like, are we making that number smaller? And as long as we're making that number smaller, we're doing the right thing,\" Musk said.\n\nAt the shareholder meeting last year, Musk touted the latest version of the company's Full Self-Driving technology. With each release, he said, the number of miles the system can drive without human intervention has increased.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It's headed towards unsupervised full self-driving very quickly, at an exponential pace,\" Musk said. \"When you look at the sort of safety per mile, because we've got a lot of miles, it's very clear that the safety per mile is better than human driving.\"\n\nThat's a claim Musk has made many times, though his critics note that he has never released the evidence to back it up.\n\n\"I have never seen one ounce of data that would suggest that Teslas are safer than human drivers,\" Cummings said. \"They're nowhere near ready to drive without a driver behind the wheel.\"\n\n\n\nAn uncertain future for regulation\n\nMusk has been promising the imminent arrival of autonomous cars since at least 2016. He has been telling customers and investors for years that the cars might become fully self-driving vehicles with a future software update. And last year, Tesla unveiled the prototype of its Cybercab, a taxi that Musk says will be fully autonomous.\n\nBut that's not what Tesla is telling regulators, or its customers, about its current fleet.\n\nTesla says drivers must remain attentive at all times, even in Full Self-Driving mode. That includes an internal camera that monitors the driver's head and eyes to make sure the driver is paying attention. If the driver isn't, the car issues a series of escalating warnings.\n\ntoggle caption Washington State Patrol\n\nAccording to police in Washington state, that is what happened in the moments before the fatal crash outside Seattle in April. Data recovered from Scott Hunter's Tesla shows the car tried to get the driver's attention as it approached the motorcycle, which was moving slowly in traffic.\n\nBut then, moments before impact, the report says Hunter pressed his foot down on the accelerator, overriding the car's automatic braking system \u2014 and kept it there for 10 seconds after the collision with motorcyclist Jeffrey Nissen, even though the car was no longer moving.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I wish this had never happened,\" Nissen's sister, Jenessa Fagerlie, told local TV station KING 5 last year. \"And I wish people would really stay off their phones more.\"\n\nHunter has not been charged with a crime by prosecutors, though the investigation is continuing, and his lawyer declined to comment for this story.\n\nTesla did not respond to requests for comment about the crash. But safety advocates say the carmaker bears some responsibility here, too.\n\n\"Tesla has been overselling the effectiveness of its technology for years,\" said Michael Brooks, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety. \"And a lot of people buy into that. They're kind of wrapped up in this belief that this is an autonomous vehicle, because it's tweeted about that way.\"\n\nA week after the crash in Snohomish County, investigators at NHTSA published the results of a three-year investigation into Tesla's Autopilot system. They found a \"critical safety gap\" between drivers' expectations of the driver-assistance system and its true capabilities. Investigators identified at least 13 fatal crashes, as well as many more involving serious injuries, in which \"foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.\"\n\nRegulators at NHTSA also announced an investigation into the effectiveness of Tesla's Autopilot recall and whether the company is doing enough to keep drivers engaged and off their phones. Regulators have since announced that they're also looking into a series of crashes involving cars using Full Self-Driving in low-visibility conditions.\n\nBut safety advocates worry that those investigations may be in jeopardy too, along with the crash reporting requirement. Without it, they say, regulators \u2014 and the public \u2014 will know less about who is keeping their eyes on the road and who isn't.",

That country came up several times during the hearing, as did Musk, the world\u2019s richest man with close ties to the president-elect who gave an estimated $250 million to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWithout clear rules, or a patchwork of rules state by state, we put ourselves behind those countries that allow innovators to expand and grow,\u201d said Duffy, adding \u201cWe are in direct competition with China.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a global race to out-innovate the rest of the world,\u201d Duffy told members of Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.\n\nThe massive transportation agency employs more than 55,000, spends tens of billions of dollars annually, oversees the nation\u2019s highways, railroads and airspace and sets safety standards for trains, cars and trucks.\n\nThe agency has opened probes into the safety of Tesla vehicles, especially what the company calls Full Self-Driving, a misnomer because the vehicles require human intervention at any moment. In October, NHTSA launched a probe Tesla\u2019s self-driving system covering 2.4 million vehicles after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian.\n\nDuffy\u2019s decisions at the transportation department will have a direct impact on profits not only at Tesla but Musk\u2019s rocket company, SpaceX, which has billions of dollars of contracts with federal agencies. The transportation department\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration has occasionally fined the company for violations, including $633,000 last year for alleged safety violations during two Florida launches.\n\nAt one point in the hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas brought up the fines, describing them as excessive and unnecessary and asking Duffy what he would do about them.\n\n\u201cI commit to doing a review and working with you and following up on the space launches,\u201d Duffy said.\n\nIf confirmed, Duffy would replace Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay Cabinet member.\n\nDuffy served as co-host of \u201cThe Bottom Line\u201d on Fox Business until leaving the network in November.\n\nHe won a House seat as part of wave of Tea Party victories in 2010 after a campaign where he could be seen in a red flannel shirt chopping trees and telling voters he came from a \u201clong line of lumberjacks \" and would bring his axe to Washington.\n\nHe resigned from Congress in 2019, citing a need to care for his nine children.\n\nA former lumberjack athlete, Duffy met his wife on the set of MTV\u2019s \u201cRoad Rules: All Stars\u201d in 1998. His wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, is co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend.",

            "content": "Audi has not had a good year, there is nothing to gloss over. There are many reasons for this. One of them is certainly the lack of new models. For what seemed like an eternity, the Ingolstadt-based company did not launch any new models. From the summer of 2024, they finally countered with the Q6 e-tron, and later with the new A5 and A6 e-tron. However, the new models came too late for a good result in 2024. Audi recorded an overall decline of 11.8 per cent.\n\nIn Germany, sales were even 21 per cent down on the previous year. Worldwide, 1,671,218 cars with the four rings were sold last year, exactly 118,008 fewer than Tesla. So you can see how the pecking order in the car industry is changing. And even though Audi didn't exactly put in an outstanding performance in 2024 - for the first time, the all-electric brand from Texas sold more cars than any of the three German premium brands.\n\nThe achievement is even more impressive when you consider the following: Tesla only has five models in its portfolio and all of them are electric: Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck. As you can imagine, Model 3 and Model Y have done most of the work. Elon Musk's company sold 1,704,093 units of these two models alone, which is exactly 32,875 units more than Audi sold in total. The fact that Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck only accounted for 85,133 sales is almost a gift.\n\nThis comparison is even more bitter for the Ingolstadt-based car manufacturer if you look at how many models its own line-up actually consists of. I hope I'm not forgetting anything, but with the A1 Sportback and Allstreet, A3 Sportback/Saloon/Allstreet, A5 Saloon and Avant, A6 Saloon and Avant, A7 Sportback, A8, Q2, Q3 and Q3 Sportback, Q5 and Q5 Sportback as well as Q7 and Q8, there are already 18 models on the combustion engine side alone. Many of which also have their own S and RS variants.\n\nPhoto by: Audi Audi A6 e-tron\n\nThen there are the all-electric Q4 e-tron plus Sportback, A6 e-tron plus Avant, Q6 e-tron plus Sportback, Q8 e-tron and the e-tron GT - some of which also have additional sports versions. And as if that wasn't enough, the company is also treating itself to a handful of cars that will be offered exclusively on the Chinese market. These include several saloons and SUVs with an extended wheelbase as well as the somewhat confusingly named Q6 with combustion engines. Incidentally, there was also a drop of 11 per cent in the Far East. However, China remains by far the largest market with 649,000 units.\n\nWhat becomes clear is that Audi has many times more models and drive variants (diesel, petrol, plug-in hybrids and electric drives) on offer than Tesla, but still sold fewer cars last year.\n\nTesla, on the other hand, was reasonably successful in countering the falling demand for electric cars worldwide, selling just under 19,500 fewer units than in 2023. In Germany, on the other hand, the American manufacturer experienced a debacle and recorded a drop of 41 per cent. The major facelift of the best-selling Model Y, which has just started production, could soon provide a remedy.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\nHowever, Tesla will probably need its eagerly awaited entry-level model to attack the two other German premium brands Mercedes and BMW. However, it is still unclear when a possible Model 2 will arrive. Mercedes-Benz sold 1,983,400 vehicles last year, a drop of three per cent. BMW remains the premium leader. 2,200,177 deliveries represent a drop of 2.3 per cent compared to the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile, Audi is looking to the future with relative confidence despite the recent tense economic situation. The long-neglected model initiative is in full swing. In addition to the new additions already mentioned, three absolute cornerstones of the portfolio will be renewed in 2025 with the third Q5 generation, the A7 and the Q3.\n\nA new brand is also being launched in China. It remains to be seen how AUDI (yes, it really will be called that) will fare in the currently extremely difficult Chinese market. From mid-2025, the new brand created together with SAIC will launch three vehicles on the market.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Updated on February 18th, 2025 by Bob Ciura\n\n\n\nThe appeal of growth stocks is that they have the potential for huge returns. Consider the massive rally by Tesla, Inc. (TSLA); in the past five years, the stock has generated total returns over 500%.\n\nThat\u2019s a lifetime of returns for some investors; Tesla has done this in a relatively short period of time.\n\nThe downside of growth stocks is that volatility can work both ways. Also, growth stocks can generate strong returns but also carry the burden of high expectations due to their sky-high valuations.\n\nRight now, Tesla does not pay a dividend to shareholders. As a result, we believe income investors looking for lower volatility should consider high-quality dividend growth stocks.\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrats are a group of 69 stocks in the S&P 500 Index with 25+ consecutive years of dividend growth.\n\nYou can download an Excel spreadsheet of all 69 Dividend Aristocrats (with metrics that matter, such as dividend yield and P/E ratios) by clicking the link below:\n\nOver time, any company \u2013 even Tesla \u2013 could make the decision to start paying dividends to shareholders if it becomes sufficiently profitable.\n\nIn the past decade, other technology companies, such as Apple, Inc. (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), have initiated quarterly dividends.\n\nThese were once rapidly growing stocks that matured, and Tesla could follow the same way one day.\n\nHowever, the ability of a company to pay a dividend depends on its business model, growth prospects, and financial position.\n\nEven with Tesla\u2019s huge run-up in share price, whether a company can pay a dividend depends on the underlying fundamentals.\n\nWhile many growth stocks have made the transition to dividend stocks in recent years, it is doubtful that Tesla will join the ranks of dividend-paying stocks any time soon.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nTesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The company started out as a fledgling electric car maker, but has grown at an extremely high rate in the past several years.\n\nTesla\u2019s current market capitalization is above $1.1 trillion, making it a mega-cap stock.\n\nAmazingly, Tesla\u2019s current market capitalization is more than 13 times the combined market caps of auto industry peers Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM).\n\nTesla has a growing lineup of different models and price points and is looking into expanding that lineup further to become a full-line automaker.\n\nSince going public in 2010 at a split-adjusted price of just $1.13 per share, Tesla has produced almost unbelievable returns for shareholders in hopes of massive future growth, as well as tremendous growth that has already been achieved.\n\nSince then, it has grown into the leader in electric vehicles and business operations in renewable energy. Tesla produced about $97.69 billion in revenue in 2024.\n\nIn January, the company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $25.71 billion, which missed analyst estimates by $1.42 billion. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $0.73 missed estimates by $0.04 per share.\n\nTotal revenue increased 2% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, while adjusted EPS rose 3% year-over-year. Gross margin of 16.3% contracted by 138 basis points from the same quarter the previous year.\n\nFor 2024, revenue increased 1% while adjusted EPS declined 22% from 2023 levels.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nTesla\u2019s primary growth catalyst is to expand sales of its core product line, and generate growth from new vehicles. The company\u2019s S/X platform, which gave it the first bout of solid growth, but Tesla is now focused on ramping up its 3/Y platform.\n\nIndeed, the 3/Y platform accounted for ~95% of all deliveries last quarter.\n\nIn addition, Tesla is continuing to develop new models, with a pickup truck, a semi-truck, and even a cheaper, more attainable model than the 3.\n\nThe company has begun delivering its semi-truck as production of that new vehicle begins to ramp up. It will be some time before that\u2019s a meaningful source of revenue, but it\u2019s a totally new product line that could boost revenue growth.\n\nTesla is also ramping up vehicle production. It now operates \u201cGigafactories\u201d in Nevada, New York, Texas, Germany, and China, with more to come to support rising demand.\n\nTesla\u2019s competitive advantage stems mainly from its best-in-class software and other technologies, including full self-driving mode.\n\nSource: Investor Update\n\nTesla\u2019s revenue growth has been very strong in the recent past. It grew revenue at an annual rate of 25% in the four-year period from 2020-2024.\n\nThat level of growth is difficult to find, which is why Tesla\u2019s shares have performed so well.\n\nWhether Tesla can continue to maintain its high growth rate is another question.\n\nSuch a strong growth rate bodes well for the company\u2019s future potential. Some investors may view the guidance of Tesla as too aggressive, but we note that electric vehicle sales are growing at a high rate.\n\nElectric vehicles are the clear path forward for automobiles, and Tesla is the leader in the space.\n\nIn addition, more than any other automaker, Tesla has delivered outstanding growth year after year. With an expanding product line, we believe the growth outlook for the company is bright.\n\nWill Tesla Pay A Dividend?\n\nTesla has experienced rapid growth of shipment volumes and revenue in the past several years. But ultimately, a company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to shareholders also requires sustained earnings growth.\n\nWhile Tesla has been the epitome of a growth stock through its top-line growth and huge share price gains, its profitability is still small in relation to its market cap. TSLA stock is currently trading at more than 130 times its expected 2025 EPS of $2.56.\n\nWithout reaching consistent profitability, a company cannot pay dividends to its shareholders.\n\nTesla lost money since it became publicly traded back in 2010, up until 2020. It goes without saying that a money-losing company needs to raise capital to continue to fund operations.\n\nTo that end, Tesla has sold shares and issued debt to cover losses and fund expansion in recent years, both of which make paying a dividend even more difficult.\n\nHowever, since 2020, Tesla has rapidly expanded its profitability and produced just over $7 billion in GAAP net income in 2024. The company also generates positive free cash flow, making it easier to service its debt obligations and avoid future dilutive share issuances.\n\nFurthermore, the company does not pay any net interest expense, as its interest income exceeds its interest expense.\n\nWe see the improvement in profitability and free cash flow, as well as the improved balance sheet, as supportive of the company\u2019s ability to eventually pay a dividend.\n\nHowever, Tesla is still very much in high-growth mode, and we expect any dividend that may be paid to be many years away. In other words, it is much more profitable for Tesla to reinvest its earnings in its business than to distribute it to shareholders.\n\nEven if Tesla decided to initiate a dividend, it would likely be very low.\n\nFor instance, if Tesla were to distribute 30% of its expected 2025 EPS in the form of dividends (a standard payout ratio for growth stocks that pay dividends), the stock would only yield ~0.2%.\n\nSuch a yield will be immaterial for the shareholders, but the dividend would deprive the company of cash that could be utilized for higher-return growth projects.\n\nTesla\u2019s Stock Dividend\n\nTesla\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, said in early 2022, that he wants Tesla to \u201cincrease in the number of authorized shares of common stock \u2026 in order to enable a stock split of the Company\u2019s common stock in the form of a stock dividend.\u201d\n\nEssentially, a stock dividend is where a company splits its stock, and the impact on shareholders is that the company\u2019s value doesn\u2019t change, but the share price is lower because there are more outstanding shares.\n\nIndeed, Tesla implemented a 3-for-1 split on its stock, which came into force on August 25th, 2022. As a result, its outstanding share count rose from 1.155 billion to 3.465 billion post-stock dividends, and the stock price adjusted from about $900 before the split to about $300.\n\nA stock dividend is not necessarily a material event for shareholders because their relative stake in the company remains the same; they have more shares at a lower price.\n\nHowever, investors tend to view stock dividends and splits as bullish events; thus, stock dividends can trigger rallies in the share price.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nTesla is one of the premier growth stocks in the stock market. Shareholders who had the foresight to buy Tesla in its early years have been rewarded with enormous returns through a soaring share price.\n\nHowever, investors looking for dividends and safety over the long run should probably continue to take a pass on Tesla stock. The company seems committed to using all the cash flow at its disposal to improve its operations\u2019 profitability and invest in growth initiatives.\n\nWhile there is always a possibility that Tesla\u2019s massive share price rally could regain steam, it is also possible that the stock could fall. Investors should remember that volatility can work both ways.\n\nMore defensive investors, such as retirees, who are primarily concerned with protecting principal and dividend income, should instead focus on high-quality dividend growth stocks, such as the Dividend Aristocrats.\n\nIt is unlikely that Tesla will ever pay a dividend, or at least not for many years.\n\nIf you are interested in finding more high-quality dividend growth stocks suitable for long-term investment, the following Sure Dividend databases will be useful:\n\nThe Dividend Kings List is even more exclusive than the Dividend Aristocrats. It is comprised of 54 stocks with 50+ years of consecutive dividend increases.\n\nThe Dividend Champions List: stocks that have increased their dividends for 25+ consecutive years.\n\nNote: Not all Dividend Champions are Dividend Aristocrats because Dividend Aristocrats have additional requirements like being in The S&P 500.\n\nNote: Not all Dividend Champions are Dividend Aristocrats because Dividend Aristocrats have additional requirements like being in The S&P 500.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nTesla is recalling over 239,000 vehicles for a condition where the computer circuit board may short, resulting in the loss of the rearview camera image when shifting into reverse, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe recalled vehicles include certain 2024-2025 Model 3 and Model S sedans, 2023-2025 Model X and 2023-2025 Model Y SUVs.\n\nTesla has released an over-the-air software update to address the problem, but the automaker is still working to identify any vehicles that may have experienced a circuit board failure or stresses that can lead to one. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed March 7.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTesla discovered the problem Nov. 21, 2024, after noticing rising numbers of vehicle computer replacements under warranty due to electrical shorts in the circuit board, according to the NHTSA. From Nov. 26 through Dec. 20, Tesla engineers investigated the issue, which included evaluations of the low-voltage battery supply, hardware vintage and firmware releases of the vehicles.\n\nThe investigators determined that a reverse current may cause a short in the circuit board of the vehicle\u2019s computer when it\u2019s powered on. An estimated 2% of the recalled Tesla models are suspected of having the defect.\n\nFrom Dec. 20 to 27, Tesla assessed prior software releases and vehicle fleet data. Its investigators traced the fault to vehicles equipped with older software versions and elected to issue the voluntary recall on Dec 27.\n\nTesla began rolling out software updates (versions 2024.44.25.3 and 2024.45.25.6), on or shortly after Dec. 18 and vehicles produced on or after Dec.16 have received the new software, according to the NHTSA.\n\nThe revised software makes changes to the power up sequence to prevent shorting of the vehicle circuit boards or related power components. In addition, Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles currently in production received a different computer after the end of production dates, which are listed in the vehicle\u2019s information section.\n\nHowever, if any Tesla vehicles experience a circuit board short prior to installing the new software or in a future release, Tesla will replace the vehicle\u2019s computer at no cost to customers under factory warranty.\n\nAs of Dec. 30, 2024, Tesla received 887 warranty claims and 68 field reports related to failing rearview camera displays. The company, however, is not aware of any collisions or injuries as a result of the display failures.\n\nTesla began notifying all of its retail stores and service centers about the recall on or after Jan. 8.",

Many of these cars have S and RS performance derivatives.\n\nOn the electric side, there's the Q4 E-Tron/Q4 E-Tron Sportback, A6 Sportback E-Tron/A6 Avant E-Tron, Q6 E-Tron/Q6 E-Tron Sportback, Q8 E-Tron/Q8 E-Tron Sportback, and the E-Tron GT. These have sporty flavors as well.\n\nMoreover, there are China-exclusive models, such as long-wheelbase sedans and SUVs, along with the confusingly named Q6 with combustion engines. I might have missed a few, but you get the idea\u2013Audi has far more models in its vast portfolio than Tesla, yet it sold fewer cars last year. That's despite a huge powertrain portfolio with gasoline, diesel, mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and purely electric drivetrains.\n\nAutomaker 2024 Sales Difference vs leader BMW 2,200,177 Mercedes-Benz 1,983,400 -216,777 Tesla 1,789,226 -410,951 Audi 1,671,218 -528,959\n\nTesla just launched the Model Y refresh, but it probably needs that long-awaited entry-level EV to catch Mercedes-Benz in the sales race. The three-pointed star shipped 1,983,400 cars in 2024, a drop of 3% compared to the year before. Despite falling 2.3%, BMW retained its luxury sales crown with 2,200,177 vehicles carrying the famous roundel.\n\nAudi hopes to turn things around with the launch of its uninspiringly named AUDI (written in capital letters) brand in China. Eschewing the iconic logo from the historic Auto Union era, the new car company co-created with SAIC will launch three production models from mid-2025.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Specific timing isn't listed, however.\n\nAfter Ford kicked things off in 2023, most major EV brands announced plans to adopt the NACS standard. The SAE also finalized NACS as a true standard later in the year, an effort that was backed by the Biden administration, ensuring that more NACS connectors will be installed outside the Supercharger network, putting American on the path to a single fast-charging standard for electric vehicles.\n\n2025 BMW i4\n\nFord, General Motors, Nissan, Polestar, Rivian, and Volvo have already rolled out Supercharger access and made arrangements for adapters that allow existing EVs with CCS ports to connect to Supercharger stations.\n\nThe 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 has been confirmed as the first EV from a major non-Tesla brand to be built with a NACS port, and Hyundai, which is the parent brand of Genesis, has said it will ship free adapters for its existing EVs later this quarter.

            "content": "In a surprising turn of events, Tesla, despite a slight dip in sales, managed to surpass premium rival Audi in 2024, marking a significant milestone for the American EV maker. Tesla\u2019s sales fell by just 1.1% to 1.79 million units, while Audi, facing a 12% decline, registered 1.67 million cars.\n\nWith only four model lines (five if the Cybertruck, currently limited to the U.S. and Canada, is included), Tesla outpaced Audi, which offers a diverse range of combustion, hybrid, and electric models. On the other hand, Audi has dozens of model combinations, and yet Tesla\u2019s all-electric vehicles\u2014Model 3, Model S, Model X, and Model Y\u2014managed to outpace the German automaker\u2019s entire lineup, which includes electric and combustion vehicles.\n\nAudi\u2019s setbacks\n\nAudi experienced a sales decline in 2024 after its impressive performance in 2023, selling 1.9 million units\u2014the best result since 2017. Consequently, this decline is particularly disappointing given the brand\u2019s recent recovery from three consecutive years of decreasing sales. While, on the one hand, Audi saw a significant drop in markets such as Germany, China, and North America, it is worth noting that, on the other hand, its EV sales only decreased by 8%. This suggests that factors beyond its EV offerings contributed to the overall 12% decline in sales.\n\nHowever, the German automaker remains hopeful for a turnaround in 2025, with the launch of new models, including the electric A4, A6 e-tron, and Q6 e-tron. The company is also betting on the success of its new brand in China, which is set to debut in mid-2025 with three new EVs in the mid- and full-size segments. These efforts could help Audi regain momentum, particularly in the Chinese market, where local competition has significantly increased.\n\nAudi vs. Tesla Sales Breakdown:\n\nWith Tesla\u2019s competitive edge continuing to grow and Audi\u2019s strategies in place for 2025, the automotive race between these two giants will be one to watch closely in the coming year.",

Meanwhile, he says China will make up just around 5 percent, while the rest of the world, including other parts of America, would also make up just 5 percent.\n\nHe also predicted that that number would go up even further to nearly 100 percent, once SpaceX\u2019s reusable rocket is being launched more frequently.\n\n\u201cWhen Starship is launching at high rate, SpaceX will probably carry >99 percent of Earth\u2019s payload mass to orbit. This is necessary to make Mars a self-sustaining civilization,\u201d Musk added.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT SPACEX\u2019S STARSHIP: Texas awards SpaceX $17.3M grant to expand Bastrop tech hub\n\nTo be sure, Musk has been known to make ambitious claims about when his companies\u2019 products would achieve certain milestones. For example, Musk predicted in 2018 that SpaceX could launch a rocket to Mars with humans aboard by 2024, though SpaceX only began testing the company\u2019s reusable Starship in 2023.\n\nStill, the company has been routinely testing Starship since then, and with increasing frequency, and in October, SpaceX performed the first catch of the Starship\u2019s Super Heavy booster after liftoff to demonstrate the concept that a reusable rocket could be possible. In a launch earlier this month, SpaceX again successfully caught the Super Heavy Booster, though it lost the upper stage to a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d effectively meaning that it had exploded in air and showered surrounding areas with rocket parts.\n\nThe explosion was the second consecutive launch in which debris from Starship reigned down, highlighting the continued importance of testing as SpaceX aims to make the rocket a viable product for reusable space travel.\n\nOn Friday, SpaceX also launched its Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) to rescue astronauts that have been stuck on the orbital craft, after a Boeing launch was originally intended to bring them back to Earth. While SpaceX attempted to rescue the two astronauts in September, issues with the Starliner craft\u2019s thrusters discovered upon arrival made NASA hold off on approving the return mission.",

            "content": "Hot on the heels of Kia being added to Tesla\u2019s \u201ccoming soon\u201d page for Supercharger access, we\u2019re now learning that Supercharger support won\u2019t actually come nearly as soon as expected for Kia \u2013 with a delay of weeks or months before Kia owners can plug in at North America\u2019s largest fast charging network.\n\nEarlier today, Kia and several other brands were added to Tesla\u2019s coming soon page, suggesting that access could be imminent.\n\nThis squared with a previous September announcement that access would come in January \u2013 with a planned date of January 15, just two days away from now.\n\nBut today, PC Magazine reported that Kia\u2019s access will be delayed to sometime in Spring.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nSpecifically, Kia has updated a press release on its website which previously stated a launch date of January 15. The press release now says \u201cAccess to the DC fast chargers is planned for the first quarter of 2025.\u201d\n\nThat means it could be any time in the next three months, assuming there are no further delays.\n\nPC Magazine quoted James Bell, Kia\u2019s head of PR, as stating that \u201ca delay has occurred and we are working with the appropriate teams to confirm new availability/date.\u201d We also reached out to Bell to see if we could get any more information, but hadn\u2019t heard back as of press time.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether this delay will affect other brands, like Hyundai and Genesis.\n\nKia and Hyundai (and Hyundai sub-brand Genesis) share a platform for their electric vehicles, and have been the first to offer vehicles with native NACS ports on 2025 models, as opposed to using adapters like all other brands have so far. Older Kia/Hyundai vehicles without a native NACS port will still be able to use an adapter once cars gain access to the network.\n\nWe reached out to Hyundai to find out whether they\u2019ve been hit by the same delay, but haven\u2019t heard back yet. We\u2019ll update if we do. We have heard that Hyundai owners are largely successfully able to charge on Tesla\u2019s network, despite it still being listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on Tesla\u2019s site.\n\nIn 2022, Tesla announced it would open its charging network, lured by big money promised in President Biden\u2019s federal EV charging grants.\n\nFor a while it seemed like a bit of a hail mary, as many thought that most of the industry was already committed to the SAE CCS standard for fast charging.\n\nBut then, in 2023, Ford announced it would adopt Tesla\u2019s \u201cNACS\u201d connector, and all the dominos started to fall. Soon enough, basically the entire industry had announced a shift to Tesla\u2019s charging standard.\n\nBut these things take time, and the industry had to work on redesigning vehicles, building adapters, organizing software handshakes, and building out an official standard. Now, several brands can already use Superchargers, with more to come.\n\nThe rollout seemed to be slowing down for a time, after Tesla CEO Elon Musk abruptly fired the entire Supercharging team which had been responsible for successfully executing this coup that could see Tesla gaining a lasting lead in EV charging, with those firings causing total chaos and jeopardizing the transition.\n\nEarlier today, when so many brands were added to the \u201ccoming soon\u201d page, it seemed like perhaps the dust had settled on the chaotic charging situation caused my Musk\u2019s instability. But perhaps this Kia news is indication that there\u2019s still some trouble that needs to be worked through.\n\nBut when you\u2019re charging at *home*, charge your electric vehicle using rooftop solar panels.

            "content": "Days after the US's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) began an investigation into the company's Actually Smart Summon technology, Tesla is is now recalling almost a quarter of a million vehicles over a separate issue \u2013 glitches with rearview cameras on some models.\n\n239,382 Teslas are affected from the 2023 \u2013 2024 Model 3 and S ranges and the 2023 \u2013 2025 Model X and Y ranges. The problem is that a computer circuit board might short, resulting in the vehicle losing access to the rearview camera image [PDF].\n\nFrom November 21, 2024, Tesla noted an increase in car computer replacements due to a power shorting malfunction. It traced the problem to software releases prior to 2024.44.25.3 or 2024.45.25.6 which, when combined with certain hardware configurations and colder temperatures, could increase reverse current and short the power components.\n\nUS watchdog sticks probe into 2.6M Teslas over so-called Smart Summon crash reports READ MORE\n\nThus, the view from the rear camera would cease to be displayed.\n\nTesla has already begun rolling out an Over The Air (OTA) update to fix the technical trouble and vehicles that have experienced the shorting condition prior to installing 2024.44.25.3, 2024.45.25.6, or a later software release will be able to get their car computer replaced free of charge.\n\nAs of December 30, 2024, Tesla had identified 887 warranty claims and 68 field reports related to the condition. It said it is also not aware of any collisions, injuries, or fatalities related to the problem.\n\nDan O'Dowd, Founder of The Dawn Project, said, \"This is the second time in just one week that NHTSA has taken action against Tesla over its faulty software, highlighting the myriad safety critical defects in Tesla systems.\n\n\"If Tesla cannot be trusted to develop reliable software to ensure that its rear-view cameras do not fail to display an image, how can it be trusted to develop an entirely autonomous driving system which does not require supervision?\"\n\nFor context, Tesla it is not the only car maker suffering from software-related rearview camera woes. 2025 also began with a recall [PDF] of vehicles from UK manufacturer Aston Martin over the view from its reversing camera. However, in Aston Martin's case, only 1,452 vehicles were potentially affected by the problem, which entails a home screen menu that occasionally obscures the display of the reversing camera. An OTA update can apparently fix the problem on some of Aston Martin's light vehicles, but for certain models, a trip to the dealer for a USB software update is required. \u00ae",

            "content": "While attending CES in the affront to nature that is Las Vegas last week, I got to ride its shiniest transit system: The Vegas Loop, a dumb tunnel full of non-autonomous Teslas and AliExpress LED strips. I knew it would be bad, but I didn't know quite how bad \u2014 or how short. See, the Vegas Loop serves a whopping two buildings that are across the street from one another, making it not much of a transit system at all. It's a glorified crosswalk.\n\nFor CES Honda put me up in the Conrad Hotel, a part of the Resorts World complex, which sits directly across South Las Vegas Boulevard from the Las Vegas Convention Center \u2014 the site of CES. I cannot stress enough how close together these two buildings are.\n\nApple Maps & Amber DaSilva / Jalopnik\n\nYet, for some reason, Resorts World and the LVCC are connected by the Vegas Loop, one of Elon Musk's dumber (though far from the most evil) ideas. Traveling from Resorts World to the convention center's West Station takes a full two minutes through the Loop, which I filmed for you in their entirety:\n\nRiveting stuff, I know, but the video doesn't show how sketchy the tunnel seemed. After purchasing the ticket, scanning a screenshot of the ticket a few feet away, and waiting for eight minutes in what was functionally a parking garage for a Tesla to actually show up and ferry me across the street, my personal Charon's arrival was heralded by a cacophony of squeaks, rattles, and groans from the approaching Model Y. Former Jalop Adam Ismail and I both broke out laughing.\n\nThe ride itself was shockingly bumpy, weirdly variable in tunnel depth, and passed through areas that looked more like the backstage of a black box theater than the uneven-LED-strips-on-concrete aesthetic of the Boring Company's tunnels. I did, however, find a single emergency exit within the tunnels \u2014 an unexpected but appreciated accommodation. All in all, from ticket purchase to arrival at the LVCC, I spent 10 minutes in Musk's tunnel network.\n\nDespite the incredible care and attention shown to my safety, I decided to make the day a comparison test. Rather than taking the Loop back to my hotel later on, I did something that many CES-goers found unconscionable: I walked back, even daring to cross the street.\n\nThe walk took me 11 whole minutes, just a single extra minute compared to the time I spent in the Vegas Loop rigamarole. My hair did end up a bit more windswept by the end of the return trip, but those were far from normal winds as my phone had been blasted by weather alerts about them all morning. I also should have worn a jacket, but that one is entirely on me. I keep forgetting that anywhere west of Colorado can be cold.\n\nAll in all, having compared the Vegas Loop side by side with its biggest competitor \u2014 a crosswalk \u2014 I've come to the conclusion that the Loop is even more pointless than I'd imagined. It's truly a monument to Elon Musk's personal wealth and deep loathing of anything that isn't His, and it's quite possibly the worst way to move people from one side of a street to the other. Even Las Vegas deserves better.",

            "content": "There can\u2019t be anyone who doesn\u2019t know what a Tesla is: it\u2019s incredible how the startup carmaker has managed to hype itself into a position of such prominence. What\u2019s even more impressive is to look at other carmakers like Volkswagen (an old hand) and see how Tesla is the one setting the tone for electric cars. The disruptor has quickly become the establishment benchmark. Anyway, this is the Model 3, Tesla\u2019s entry saloon that was refreshed with a new look in 2023. A facelift might be something of a surprise for a car that\u2019s been on sale since 2017, but Tesla doesn\u2019t play by the usual rules, even if rivals would have an all new version on the way by now. In fact, the 3 is the only car along with the Model Y (the MPV version of the 3) that Tesla sells in the UK these days.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nThere are four 3s to choose from: a 279bhp/310lb ft base car with a 57.5kWh battery and rear-wheel drive, Long Range models with RWD and AWD that come with 75kWh batteries and 315bhp/332lb ft single motor and 491bhp/364lb ft dual motor setups respectively, and 351bhp from an all-wheel drive, dual-motor setup. The range topper is the Performance All-Wheel Drive model with 510bhp/547lb ft from its two e-motors. It looks good, doesn\u2019t it? It certainly looks more sophisticated than the old one, with a subtle nose job up front and a bit of a tweak at the rear. Nothing drastic, but it makes for a much sleeker looking car. The headlights are much sharper and the whole effect makes it look like a more natural successor from the original Roadster back in 2008. The tweaks also make for improved aero, which has boosted the Model 3\u2019s range to 318 miles in the entry car and as high as 436 miles of WLTP in the Long Range RWD. The Long Range AWD and Performance cars offer 390 and 328 miles respectively. The 0-62mph performance drops from 6.1 seconds to 3.2 seconds as you climb the price list. Top speed has been pegged back to 125mph in all versions except the Performance, which tops out at 163mph. Is everything else as we remember? The Model 3 is as per inside... mostly. There\u2019s a noticeable uptick in material quality, but we\u2019re still not sure of the wisdom behind white seats in a family car. Still, our clothes didn\u2019t leave any marks on the latest ones, so that\u2019s positive.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nThe facelift changes are all about updating some of the hardware around the Model 3 \u2013 of course in these modern times if they want to update any of the software on your fancy electric car then they'll simply arrive over the air.\n\nThe recent price drops stick with the updated Model 3 too; \u00a339,990 for entry car, another \u00a35k for the Long Range RWD, \u00a35k more to add the extra motor and topping out at a sniff under \u00a360k for the Performance car. So what is the refreshed Model 3 like to live with? There\u2019s a considerable amount of unlearning that needs to be done when you get into a Model 3, because this isn\u2019t like other cars on the market. Most of the investment is up front, messing with the settings like a new mobile phone. It\u2019ll take you at least half an hour just to work out how to adjust the seats, but at least the car will remember everything when you've got it all to your liking. The latest company gimmick (presumably done for cost saving reasons rather than an earnest desire to innovate) is the indicators that have moved onto the steering wheel. In fact there are no stalks left around the Model 3\u2019s wheel, and it\u2019ll be a few thousand miles before your hand is cured of its Phantom Indicator Syndrome.\n\nMostly the new setup works fine, but as ever with Tesla it\u2019s soon obvious the car hasn\u2019t been tested in an international setting: it\u2019s a nightmare around roundabouts and the tight turns you\u2019ll find in most UK towns. Borderline dangerous, even. And all for something that should be abundantly simple. Likewise the automatic wipers can\u2019t cope with British mizzle at all, veering between ignoring fine rain completely or manic sweeping like you\u2019re Gwyndaf Evans on the RAC Rally in 1994. But I can still rely on Tesla's Superchargers, right? The soothing balm on your Tesla ownership experience is the masterstroke of the company having a ready made charging network available that\u2019s quick, convenient and simple to use. Some of the prime locations are getting very busy these days, but it helps that your car is able to tell you capacity levels. We'd love some of that action in other EVs. No messing around with apps or rubbing your contactless up and down a damp touchscreen, just reverse in, hitch up and you're away. What about rivals? The EV tech and infrastructure sets the Model 3 apart, but the likes of the Polestar 2 and BMW i4 are arguably better quality and more pleasant to drive. The Hyundai Ioniq 5, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Kia EV6 are also worth looking at, but the entry Model 3 is particularly well priced in this company.\n\nOur choice from the range TESLA RWD 4dr Auto \u00a339,935 See prices and specs\n\nWhat's the verdict? \u201c While not without flaws, it is quite simply one of the most interesting, compelling cars in the world right now \u201d\n\nPosed against po-faced competitors, Teslas are invariably the quick ones, the efficient ones, the fun ones with Fart Mode and the lucky ones least dependent on a haphazard charging ecosystem. While the styling won\u2019t be to all tastes and the driving dynamics aren\u2019t all that memorable, it\u2019s easy to see why the Model 3 has become a global standard setter for the EV experience. And at last the hardware seems to be catching up with the onboard tech. This is the future we were promised \u2013 a car with sentience, a sense of humour, and a fresh take on the old norms. After trying this, your old repmobile will just feel a bit dull. The Model 3 has been in production since mid-2017, but even heading into old age, nothing on the market has yet managed to beat it on all fronts. While not without flaws, it is quite simply one of the most interesting, compelling cars in the world right now. We might even look back on it as the car that changed the way we all drive.",

Nearly 200 countries agreed to reduce emissions and focus on renewable energy, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots were accused of underinflating footballs, and the Supreme Court affirmed same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nIt was also a year when Tesla (TSLA 3.86%), founded in 2003, was still called Tesla Motors. Tesla debuted its first freestanding charging stations in 2012 in California, and in 2013, it had reported its first profitable quarter. In 2015, the company launched solar energy products. You might wonder, then, how you'd have done had you invested in Tesla way back -- such as in 2015.\n\nHere's your answer: If you'd invested $1,000 in shares of Tesla at the beginning of 2015, you'd have a stake worth $27,615 a decade later. That's an average annual gain of around 39%, more than triple the S&P 500's average annual gain of 12%. (That S&P 500 gain is without dividends reinvested. Reinvesting them would bump up the return to 13%.) The S&P 500 has averaged annual gains of close to 10% over many decades, so this decade was an above-average one, turning $1,000 into almost $3,400 with dividends reinvested.\n\nTesla has grown so powerfully, recently valued at $1.3 trillion, that it's among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, along with Apple, Amazon.com, (Google parent) Alphabet, (Facebook parent) Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia.\n\nTesla shares are volatile, though.

You need to have an idea of how to answer those questions if you're thinking of investing in Tesla today.\n\nCheck out its valuation, too, which seems rich at recent levels, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 110, well above the five-year average of 77.

            "content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nIn 2025, there are two main ways you can expect to encounter self-driving technology. One is in your own new, or even relatively new, car: While Tesla has the most comprehensive and widely used driving-assistance features, lots of automakers \u2014 Ford, GM, Mercedes, and BMW to name a few \u2014 now offer features that will in some situations drive for you, with supervision and occasional intervention.\n\nThe other way is in the form of a fully driverless taxi appearing at your door \u2014 in other words, in a car you don\u2019t own. After years of testing in a few markets around the country, autonomous vehicles from companies like Alphabet\u2019s Waymo are going to start showing up in Uber and Lyft:\n\nThe ride-hailing leaders are preparing to bring driverless taxis to your door with new app features that allow customers to use their phones to open trunks and honk horns. They are building infrastructure to maintain the high-tech taxis and training human support staff to handle riders without drivers.\n\nBoth companies will have driverless cars \u2014 from Alphabet\u2019s Waymo and others \u2014 on their apps this year. In the coming months, riders in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta will be able to hail a Waymo through the Uber app. Lyft plans to offer May Mobility\u2019s driverless taxis in Atlanta.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has some reporting on how rideshare companies are preparing for this rollout, and their choices provide a sketch of one plausible path for autonomous vehicles. Uber and Lyft will effectively be maintaining fleets of self-driving cars, which means building, or outsourcing, new infrastructure to support vehicles with particular needs: electric charging, specialized technicians, and storage. This won\u2019t be a huge or particularly rapid rollout for a few reasons. One is that the types of vehicles Lyft and Uber will include in these programs are still in testing and only legal in a few markets. Another is that, while they cut out the cost of human labor, they\u2019re not yet cheap to build, own, or operate. Waymo and others are racing to develop lower-cost vehicles, but the hardware on the road today consists of costly conversion vehicles laden with expensive, specialized hardware. For now, autonomous taxi rides aren\u2019t necessarily cheaper than manned ones; in San Francisco, for example, Waymo rides are often the more expensive option.\n\nBut periods of self-driving acceleration have often been followed by stall-outs, and Uber and Lyft still face several challenges. They can reasonably expect capabilities to improve, although they don\u2019t know how fast. They can assume that hardware prices will come down, although they don\u2019t know for sure by how much and when. They can assume, broadly, that the regulatory environment will be more favorable in the future, but in ways that are hard to predict or control specifically. The basic bet here is that the next big thing for self-driving cars \u2014 and the first business case built around truly autonomous vehicles \u2014 involves acquiring and maintaining big fleets of specialized vehicles and renting out access to riders.\n\nThis is a more complicated proposition for ride-sharing companies than it might seem. Human contractors don\u2019t just drive for Uber and Lyft; they also often own their own cars, pay for gas and maintenance, and assume a degree of liability for what happens to those cars and the people inside them. Rideshare companies get a lot more from people than the simple work of driving, in other words, and replacing them means either shouldering new costs and responsibilities or finding ways to outsource them. It\u2019s easy to imagine a future rideshare company where self-driving cars support a simple, profitable business \u2014 indeed, Uber and Lyft spent billions of dollars trying to manifest that future for themselves, before pulling back and outsourcing self-driving tech to outside partners. But for Uber, which spent 15 years hemorrhaging money to become the dominant rideshare platform and just recently reported its first profit, autonomous vehicles represent both a long-term opportunity and a short-term challenge \u2014 a disruption to its business model as it exists today. If it goes all in on this, it would put it back in lose-money-to-make-money mode but presumably with an even bigger prize ahead of it.\n\nThat\u2019s one bet on where this is going: that expensive, specialized, managed, but actually-self-driving cars that already exist are the way forward. The other sounds more like this, from Elon Musk:\n\n\u2026 Think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as five times what it is today. Because average \u2014 vehicle is doing like maybe ten hours of driving a week. If sort of \u2014 if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that\u2019s ten hours a week-ish. If you\u2019ve got on autonomous \u2014 if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others. Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb \u2014 doing Airbnb with a room in your house. The value is just tremendous.\n\nNow, Musk has been saying stuff like this for a long time. He has framed such comments both as a prediction about how self-driving might go mainstream \u2014 as a feature in private cars that gets better until it\u2019s good enough to take over \u2014 and as a way to sell more cars now, by suggesting that Tesla owners might be able to turn their vehicles into moneymaking taxis when they\u2019re not using them (Teslas with autonomous features are now \u201cappreciating assets,\u201d Musk claimed all the way back in 2019). But this has not panned out for a wide range of reasons. And given the stated timeline for Tesla\u2019s recently unveiled Cybercab concept \u2014 a 2027 target from an admittedly \u201coptimistic\u201d Musk \u2014 brand-new Tesla owners shouldn\u2019t expect to be able to put their cars to work, either. Musk\u2019s affinity for this theory is inseparable from his role as the CEO of an automaker who makes money by selling cars. It\u2019s also intertwined with Tesla\u2019s fundamental approach to self-driving technology, which has seen it pivot away from reliance on expensive but effective sensor stacks like Waymo\u2019s toward cheaper but less reliable camera-centric systems, a capability gap Tesla claims it\u2019ll be able to close with advances in camera technology and, mostly, AI.\n\nThis, too, is based on assumptions that come with caveats. Driver-assistance-style features will get better, but it\u2019s not clear how quickly; hardware will become more capable and cheaper, at some rate; more car owners will live in places where self-driving cars are legal to use, somewhere by sometime; Tesla\u2019s ability to collect data from hundreds of thousands of cars on the road will give it an advantage, for some problems to some extent. Also like Uber\u2019s plan, this sort of speculation should be understood in the context of major setbacks and contractions in the broader autonomous-vehicle industry, which saw the abandonment of Apple\u2019s car project and the closure of GM\u2019s self-driving taxi project in the last year. Lots of companies still believe autonomous vehicles are coming, and are spending money on versions of the concept. But they\u2019ve also found progress toward real full-self-driving to be slower, less linear, and more expensive than they\u2019re willing to bear, at least for now. Self-driving cars are both more clearly inevitable than they\u2019ve ever been and turning out to be more complicated to deploy than they might have seemed when they were less obviously going to work at all. Not an unfamiliar technological predicament!\n\nStill, both of these visions remain broadly plausible, albeit on different unpredictable timelines: autonomous cars as fleet vehicles versus autonomy as a feature in cars that owners mostly keep for themselves. It\u2019s cars as a service versus cars as a strange, new, but semi-familiar, asset class. The two visions aren\u2019t entirely incompatible \u2014 Lyft is already talking about building features for users to deploy their own small \u201cfleets\u201d of cars at some point \u2014 but with millions of semi-autonomous cars hitting the road, and early generations of fully autonomous vehicles actually driving people around at scale, they\u2019re on course to eventually collide.",

Viewers can also see the company\u2019s recent progress on the walls and windows, as well as a roof that\u2019s now over halfway complete, after having been worked on significantly over the past few months.\n\nYou can also see a few angles of the site\u2019s main entrance, where Zanegler and others have speculated that Tesla may be building a Robovan-shaped easter egg, or one shaped like the Semi with a trailer attached. In any case, the shape on the Giga Nevada Semi expansion led to widespread discussion about whether or not Tesla could someday build the Robovan at this facility.\n\nThe video also includes a drone flight around the entire Giga Nevada facility, showing many of the walls and windows having been completed as the company gets closer to wrapping up exterior work.\n\nYou can see Zanegler\u2019s full drone video from the Giga Nevada Semi expansion below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTESLA SEMI FACTORY CONSTRUCTION IN OCTOBER: Tesla Semi factory expansion gets its first full corner\n\nTesla\u2019s Giga Nevada Semi expansion\n\nTesla first broke ground on the Semi factory expansion last January, and the company is aiming to eventually reach a volume production of 50,000 Semi units per year at the site. Production is expected to begin later this year, while some of the company\u2019s first external deliveries from the new Semi factory are targeting early 2026.\n\nAlthough Tesla is still constructing the Semi factory, it has already produced the electric Class 8 truck at low volumes and started to deploy units to a handful of companies. After being highly anticipated for years since its unveil, the Semi\u2019s first deliveries began in 2022 to PepsiCo, though the automaker has since expanded its reach to include other companies such as DHL, Walmart, Martin Brower, and, more recently, Saia Inc.\n\nEarly trials of the Semi have championed impressive range and comfort results, with Saia Executive VP of Operations Patrick Sugar sharing initial experiences at the company last month:\n\nWe were very impressed with the Tesla Semi as it demonstrated an ability to handle both local and longer haul applications while still delivering notable power and efficiency. During a demonstration earlier this year, we achieved 1.73 kWh per mile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur drivers were equally impressed, noting the smooth acceleration, comfortable design, and its ability to maintain speeds on steep inclines, even while hauling heavy payloads.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

This past year, Tesla and Stellantis both raced ahead of Ford in total vehicles recalled, with Stellantis also leading in the sheer number of individual recall actions. After years of holding the dubious title of \u201crecall leader,\u201d Ford\u2019s reign has officially come to an end. Or has it? Well\u2026 not entirely.\n\nWith the final data now in from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), including the last 11 days of 2024 that weren\u2019t available in our initial report, we\u2019ve had a chance to take a deeper dive into the numbers. This time, beyond just the updated final tallies, we also examined how many recalls required a dealership visit (let\u2019s call them \u201cphysical recalls\u201d) versus those resolved through over-the-air (OTA) updates. The results were both revealing and unexpected.\n\nMore: Tesla And Stellantis Overtake Ford As 2024\u2019s Most Recalled Brands\n\nBut before we get into the more nuanced breakdown, let\u2019s address a minor shake-up in the overall recall rankings. While some automakers added to their totals during the last two weeks of December, the only notable change in the top 10 was Kia overtaking Toyota for seventh place. It\u2019s a small, mostly irrelevant shuffle, but worth mentioning for the data nerds out there. Now, onto the bigger story: the stark difference between recalls that necessitate a trip to the dealership and those resolved remotely.\n\nFord Tops the \u201cPhysical Recall\u201d Charts (Again)\n\nFord, including its luxury Lincoln division, may have lost the overall recall crown, but don\u2019t break out the party hats just yet. When it comes to physical recalls \u2013 those requiring owners to visit a dealership \u2013 Ford remains unchallenged at the top. Last year, 4.8 million Ford vehicles needed in-person repairs. So while the automaker no longer leads in total recalls, it\u2019s still the undisputed champion of \u201cmost inconvenient recalls\u201d in the eyes of its customers.\n\nIn response to our report, Ford sent us a statement, saying: \u201cCompared with 2023, about 22% fewer recall notifications were sent in 2024, and the number is down by 45% compared to 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile Ford\u2019s progress in reducing overall recall notifications is notable, the sheer volume of physical recalls suggests there\u2019s still work to be done.\n\nUS Recalls 2024: Required A Dealer Visit\n\nBrand/Group Units Physical Recalls Ford 4,776,770 66 Honda / Acura 3,790,106 18 Stellantis 3,770,854 71 BMW 1,832,968 36 General Motors 1,401,427 32 Toyota / Lexus 1,221,666 16 Kia 1,220,498 19 Hyundai / Genesis 1,053,441 23 Volkswagen / Audi 1,003,975 17 Mercedes-Benz 409,752 28 Mazda 297,941 8 Nissan 141,748 17 Jaguar Land Rover 123,176 21 Subaru 118,723 1 Porsche 78,593 13 Tesla 39,605 8 Fisker 15,749 2 VinFast 5,113 2 Rivian 4,883 5 Aston Martin 4,727 4 Lucid 4,031 3 Maserati 3,384 4 Daimler Vans 3,040 5 Isuzu Motors 2,929 2 Lamborghini 2,651 5 McLaren 1,175 2 Waymo 1,116 2 Volvo 304 3 Karma 269 1 BYD Coach&Bus 227 1 Bugatti 156 1 Kalmar 98 2 Nikola 72 1 Morgan 62 1 Polestar 19 3 Rimac 9 1 Pagani S.p.A 8 1 Ferrari 4 1 Faraday Future 0 0 SWIPE\n\nMeanwhile, Stellantis, whose brands include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, and Fiat, slid into third place in the physical recall category. The company managed to spare over 1 million recalled vehicles from the shop thanks to a single OTA update, leaving 3.77 million Stellantis vehicles in need of dealership repairs.\n\nHonda, including its Acura brand, snuck into second place, with 3.79 million vehicles needing a trip to the shop, barely edging out Stellantis.\n\nTesla\u2019s OTA Advantage: From Worst to\u2026 Not Even Top 15?\n\nTesla\u2019s recall story paints a very different picture. While the EV giant recalled a staggering 5.1 million vehicles in 2024, more than any other automaker, only 39,605 of those required a dealership visit. That puts Tesla all the way down in 16th place on the \u201cphysical recall\u201d list, even behind Porsche. Most of its recalls stemmed from software-related issues that were resolved remotely, sparing customers the hassle of service appointments.\n\nTo put this into perspective, Tesla managed to keep 99.2% of its recalled vehicles out of dealerships. By comparison, Ford and Honda relied almost entirely on physical repairs, making their numbers far more painful for both owners and dealerships.\n\nUS Recalls 2024: OTA Repair Only\n\nBrand/Group Units OTA Recalls Tesla 5,098,363 8 Fisker 29,218 4 General Motors 471,140 2 Hyundai / Genesis 56,537 2 Lucid 12,496 2 Stellantis 1,033,433 1 Ford 391 1 Honda / Acura 4,174 1 Kia 14,163 1 Volkswagen / Audi 84,432 1 Nissan 37,236 1 Polestar 25,825 1 Volvo 17,409 1 Rivian 5,128 1 Faraday Future 11 1 SWIPE\n\nWhat the Recall Data Tells Us\n\nBy the end of 2024, the recall data painted a complex picture of the automotive industry\u2019s winners and stragglers. Tesla\u2019s use of OTA technology has allowed the company to manage massive recall totals while sparing its customers the headache of dealership visits.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s not forget the fundamental issue here: recalls, no matter how they\u2019re fixed, mean something went wrong in the first place. It\u2019s great that Tesla can remotely address its problems, but when you\u2019re recalling over 5 million cars in a year, there\u2019s a deeper quality issue lurking beneath the convenience. Wouldn\u2019t fewer problems be even better?\n\nMore: Some Cybertrucks Getting Bricked After Tesla\u2019s Latest Software Updates\n\nMeanwhile, Ford continues to grapple with hardware-related issues that require costly, time-consuming physical repairs. While it\u2019s no longer the overall recall leader, its numbers for dealership-dependent fixes remain frustratingly high, for both its customers and its service departments.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Stellantis, which may appear to be making progress by dabbling in OTA updates. But when you take a closer look, the numbers tell a less flattering story. Out of 72 total recalls, only one was resolved remotely. That\u2019s hardly a revolution.\n\nUS RECALLS 2024: OVERALL",

Photo by Rungroj Yongrit/EPA-EFE\n\nJan. 11 (UPI) -- Tesla has recalled more than 239,000 of its Model 3, S, X and Y electric vehicles due to software problems that might disable their rearview cameras. The safety recall affects Model 3 Tesla cars produced in 2024 and 2025, and Model S, X and Y Teslas built from 2023 to 2025. Advertisement\n\nA small percentage of recalled models have a short circuit failure in their onboard computers that cause the loss of their rearview cameras, which could affect drivers' visibility while backing up.\n\nAffected vehicles will show a blank rearview camera display while the vehicle is in reverse.\n\nThe loss of the rearview camera increases the potential for a collision but could be overcome by performing a shoulder check and using side and rearview mirrors.\n\nTesla initiated the recall after learning of the problem on Nov. 21 when it observed an increase in the number of car computer replacements due to short circuits in the primary or secondary power component.\n\nTesla engineers investigated the matter from Nov. 26 to Dec. 20, and learned the condition caused low voltage battery power and hardware vintage and firmware releases.\n\nSpecific software and hardware configurations in recalled vehicles combined with colder outdoor temperatures sometimes increased reverse electrical current, which caused a short circuit in the affected components.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla engineers traced the problem to prior software releases and specific models affected before voluntarily recalling the vehicles.\n\nThe problem so far has triggered 887 warranty claims and 68 filed reports, but Tesla engineers are unaware of any collisions, injuries or fatalities caused by the software problem.\n\nTesla on Dec. 18 implemented over-the-air software updates to correct the problem at no cost to vehicle owners.\n\nThe software update addresses the short circuit by altering each affected vehicle's power-up sequence to prevent the shorting failure with no further action required.\n\nTesla also addressed the matter in vehicles under production starting on Dec. 16.\n\nTesla began notifying owners and Tesla stores and service centers of the problem on Wednesday.\n\nThe recall affects more than 239,000 Tesla vehicles, but the over-the-air software update eliminates the need to take them in for servicing.",

According to conflicting sources, it could be launched between May and the end of the year, but without confirmation from the manufacturer. Why has China been given priority over the domestic market?\n\nUniform growth and better prospects\n\nPart of the answer lies in analysing the markets themselves. China is a very big market for Tesla, which sold more than 44,000 Model Ys in November alone and came second behind local giant BYD in the ranking of \"new energy\" vehicles, including electric and plug-in hybrids. But that's not all.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\nThe Chinese market is also experiencing rapid and steady growth in sales of electrified vehicles, which exceeded 50 per cent in the final months of 2024 (closing the year at 40.7 per cent) and is expected to complete the overtaking in 2025.\n\nHiccups in Europe\n\nOn the other continental markets, the situation is less favourable. While we await the final figures, Europe is building on last autumn's sales recovery, when numbers began to rise again after a period of sharply declining demand, only to fall again in November. This up-and-down trend is partly due to the still excessive reliance on incentives, which makes the market unstable, despite the fact that Tesla continues to dominate the electric car sales charts.\n\nTesla Model Y charging at a supercharging station\n\nAnd in the US?\n\nDespite the more than amicable relations between Elon Musk and newly elected President Donald Trump, who will take office in a few days, the incoming government in Washington DC has every intention of pushing hybrid rather than pure electric, for various reasons including the desire to make the transition more gradual and not to scuttle the oil market, which is crucial for the indebted US economy.\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that the Biden administration, as one of its last acts before leaving the scene, confirmed funding to encourage the development of electric vehicles at more affordable price points, a discourse that is certainly of interest to Tesla, which is developing the self-driving Cybercab, which in recent months has taken the place of the Model 2 as an affordable proposition.\n\nHowever, in light of the facts, here too it has suddenly become less urgent to push for the renewal of the Model Y, which is still the king of the market, closely followed by its sister Model 3, but with a contraction in sales that in October 2024 closed at -13% compared to the previous year.\n\nGallery: Tesla Model Y (2025)\n\n50\n\nSource: Tesla\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Circuit boards in these vehicles could short out, causing a loss of the rearview camera image, according to the NHTSA. A functioning rearview camera is required under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 111.\n\nThe short-circuit condition occurs due to reverse current on startup, according to the NHTSA. If this happens, drivers will see a blank screen after shifting into reverse, and will have to rely on shoulder checks and mirrors when backing up, the safety agency said.\n\n2024 Tesla Model Y. - Courtesy of Tesla, Inc.\n\nTesla estimates that just 2% of the recalled vehicles actually have this defect. The automaker has identified 887 warranty claims and 68 field reports related to this issue, but it told the NHTSA that it's unaware of any related collisions, injuries, or fatalities.\n\nTesla released a free over-the-air (OTA) software update to address this issue, but will also work to identify vehicles with circuit board failure, or component stress that could lead to a failure. It will then replace the affected computers in those vehicles, also free of charge.\n\nThe automaker expects to mail owner notification letters Mar. 7, 2025. In the meantime, owners can also contact the customer service department at 877-798-3752. Tesla's reference number for this recall is SB-25-00-001.\n\n2024 Tesla Model S. - Courtesy of Tesla, Inc.\n\nWhile this recall can be at least partially addressed through an OTA update that doesn't require a service-center visit, that isn't always the case with Tesla recalls. The automaker just recently recalled a small number of Model S and Model X EVs for an airbag issue that requires replacement of the airbag. Hardware, rather than software, issues were also behind many of the seven recalls of the Tesla Cybertruck during its first year on sale.\n\nThe NHTSA also recently announced a preliminary investigation of 2.6 million Tesla electric vehicles with the Actually Smart Summon remote driving feature. That follows another federal probe, opened in October, of 2.4 million Teslas equipped with what the automaker has termed Full Self-Driving, after reports of four crashes and one fatality related to that system.",

            "content": "Tesla has deployed a round of over-the-air software updates to Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X vehicles to fix a recall that was issued due to a problem with the rearview camera display.\n\nThis week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a recall report potentially affecting 239,382 Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X units, over a problem with the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) computer that can cause the rearview camera display to stop working. The issue affects Model 3 and Model S units with model years 2023 to 2025, along with Model Y and Model X units from the 2024 to 2025 model years.\n\nThe issue is being caused by a short of the primary and/or secondary power components, as related to a recall in November that was largely resolved. The agency estimates that about 2 percent of the vehicles are expected to have the issue, while Tesla has identified 887 warranty claims and 68 field reports related to the problem.\n\nTo fix the issue, the relevant updates changed the vehicles\u2019 power-up sequence to avoid the shorting failure, requiring no further action from those with the updated versions.\n\nREAD MORE ON TESLA RECALLS: NHTSA finally acknowledges Tesla will fix recalls with software updates\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the most part, owners who haven\u2019t encountered any of these issues don\u2019t have to worry about scheduling service with Tesla. However, owners who did have camera failures during the round of recalls last November, or immediately following an update, should schedule service with Tesla. Those on software update 2024.44.25.3, 2024.45.25.6 or a later release, versions which have already been installed on most vehicles, do not have to worry about the issue if they haven\u2019t already faced any camera problems or a loss of Autopilot and FSD features.\n\nIf necessary, Tesla\u2019s service personnel will replace the computer in affected vehicles with hardware that supports compliant rearview camera functionality. The NHTSA writes as follows in the recall report:\n\nOn or shortly after December 18, 2024, at no cost to customers, affected vehicles began receiving an over-the-air (OTA) software update that changes the vehicle power up sequence to prevent the shorting failure condition to the primary and/or secondary power component. No further action is necessary from owners of affected vehicles that are equipped with software release 2024.44.25.3, 2024.45.25.6 or a later release if an affected vehicle has not experienced the shorting failure condition or stress that may lead to the shorting failure condition. Tesla is actively working to identify which affected vehicles, if any, experienced stress that may lead to the shorting failure condition. If an affected vehicle experienced the shorting failure condition or stress that may lead to the shorting failure condition prior to installing software release 2024.44.25.3, 2024.45.25.6 or a later release, then Tesla will replace the vehicle\u2019s car computer at no cost to the customer.\n\nThe NHTSA recall number for the issue is 25V-002, and you can see the full recall notice below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

With the latest unveiling, Telsa has given a major facelift to its most popular electric car, first introduced in 2019.\n\nThe new Model Y from Tesla comes in two configurations: rear-wheel drive and long range all-wheel drive. The rear-wheel drive version starts at just under $36,000, offering an affordable option for the popular vehicle.\n\nAngular front end inspired by Cybercab\n\nThe redesigned vehicle is now available for purchase on Tesla's website in China, as well as other Asia-Pacific markets, with deliveries scheduled for March. As of now, there is no official announcement on when the model will be rolled out in the US and Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new Model Y features a more angular front end, giving it a modern look similar to the Cybercab, Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicle design. It includes renewed features such as a front-end camera, new wheels, and a refined suspension. The redesign aims to improve efficiency, with better use of every kilowatt-hour, yielding a range of around 450 miles per charge. Meanwhile, the updated suspension, wheels and tires also help provide a smoother and quieter ride.\n\nTesla states that the new design offers a wider field of view for automatic assisted driving and advanced smart summon. The automaker also highlighted an updated wheel and tire package, claiming it improves handling and grip.\n\nThe new Model Y features a sunroof with a silver-plated coating and 16 speakers. A notable update is the addition of a steering-column-mounted turn signal stalk, which was not present in the previous model.\n\nAnother notable feature of the Tesla Model Y is its trunk, which offers a capacity of 2,130 liters with the rear seats folded, about 100 liters more than the previous model. The new Juniper also includes Tesla\u2019s latest AI4-assisted driving hardware, with the full self-driving (FSD) system expected to be available in China later this year.\n\nLaunch comes after Tesla loses top spot\n\nThe Tesla Model Y was the bestselling car in China and worldwide in 2023, but it slipped to second place in the first 11 months of 2024, with the BYD Qin Plus sedan taking the top spot. According to China EV DataTracker, Tesla sold 418,428 units in China from January to November last year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElectrek has reported on the striking resemblance between Xpeng\u2019s P7 and Tesla\u2019s Model Y, which is particularly interesting considering that Xpeng itself was initially inspired by Tesla.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/iuJgVGZNT88\n\nHenry Xia, who founded Xpeng in 2014, openly acknowledged that Tesla's decision to open-source their patents influenced his approach. Xpeng was reportedly the first company to take advantage of Tesla's offer to use its patents for free.\n\nFurthermore, Xpeng senior designer Rafik Ferrag also pointed to the resemblance with an Instagram post saying he believes Tesla is \"paying tribute\" to Xpeng\u2019s design with the new redesign. Xpeng has experienced a 34% increase in vehicle deliveries in 2024, while Tesla's deliveries have dropped by 1%. The G7 is also expected to become one of Tesla's top competitors to the Model Y in China, its most crucial market.",

Tesla and other automakers rely on imports of graphite from China, which dominates the mining and processing of the mineral, a key ingredient in EV batteries.\n\nAlso this week, the federal government took a tougher stance against a Chinese EV battery producer working with Tesla, calling into question ongoing arrangements Tesla has in the U.S and abroad with that company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth cases shine a light on the gnarly business entanglements present throughout Tesla\u2019s supply chains as Musk takes the reins of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and spends much of his time in the orbit of President-elect Donald Trump.

            "content": "Tesla has at last revealed an updated version of its best-selling Model Y SUV, but only in China. The model is likely to reach U.S. buyers within a few months. Tesla tends to sell the same model worldwide with only software changes between countries. The company similarly launched an updated Model 3 overseas in late 2023, bringing it to the U.S. a few months later.\n\nNot a Redesign\n\nThe new version is not a complete redesign of the car. It\u2019s essentially a styling update.\n\nTraditional automakers redesign their cars completely about every five to seven years. They often make minor updates to interior tech and trim levels with each new model year. At the halfway point of production, they give each car a \u201cmidcycle refresh\u201d \u2014 restyling some bodywork to give it a fresh look and often updating cabin technology or making minor tweaks to the driving experience to keep pace with newer competitors.\n\nTesla doesn\u2019t recognize model years, and has kept some designs far longer than normal. The basic architecture of the Model S on sale today dates to 2012.\n\nBut the company does perform something akin to a mid-cycle refresh. The new Model Y, known internally as the Model Y Juniper, is essentially a refresh.\n\nNew Lighting, Rear Screen\n\nTesla hasn\u2019t revealed details of the updated Y. Translation from the company\u2019s Chinese website promises updated wheels and tires for \u201csmoother handling and better grip.\u201d\n\nThe most visible change is a dramatic lighting update.\n\nThe vehicle\u2019s essential shape stays the same \u2014 manufacturers often update only the front and rear fascia in a refresh, leaving panels in between unchanged. But the front borrows a lighting treatment from the Cybertruck.\n\nA single wide light bar now stretches from headlight to headlight. The headlamps themselves are thin LEDs barely wider than the bar.\n\nIn back, a similar single-bar treatment in red is thicker. But it eliminates the appearance of separate taillights, mirroring the new nose. Language on the website promises, \u201cThe redesigned front and rear appearance effectively improves the vehicle\u2019s endurance, performance, and service life.\u201d That\u2019s likely a reference to improved aerodynamics.\n\nInside, the major change is a rear-seat entertainment screen mounted to the back of the center console. A reshaped steering wheel matches the one found in the updated Model 3.\n\nTesla\u2019s Most Important Car\n\nThe Model Y is Tesla\u2019s best-selling model and, at times, has been the most-produced car on the planet.\n\nHowever, Tesla is facing new competition in the electric vehicle (EV) market and is losing ground. The company suffered its first-ever annual sales drop in 2024 and finished the year in control of less than half of a market it once dominated.\n\nIt made waves with the Cybertruck last year, but sales of that model fell dramatically late in 2024.\n\nTesla may have no new high-volume models in the pipeline for 2025. The company dropped its effort to build a separate sub-$30,000 EV last year, replacing it with a Robotaxi project. Robotaxis face state-by-state legal hurdles \u2013 a prospect so daunting that some rivals have abandoned projects further along than Tesla\u2019s.\n\nA recent analyst report sparked discussion that the company may have a secret, inexpensive \u201cModel Q\u201d project in the works, but it could be nothing more than a Model 3 with a lower-range, inexpensive battery meant for foreign markets.\n\nSo, a refresh of its best-selling model may be the most important step Tesla could take early in 2025.",

            "content": "The world's best-selling electric car gets a makeover. The restyling of the Tesla Model Y, known as Project Juniper, has been unveiled in China. At the moment, the battery-powered SUV is only available in the country of the Dragon (first deliveries are expected in March), but in the coming months it will also arrive in the rest of the world, including Europe.\n\nThis is a really important update when you consider that the model has been on sale since 2019 and that over the years it has had to contend with increasingly fierce competition in all markets, while remaining at the top of the sales charts all this time.\n\nCompared to the outgoing Tesla, which is still available in our market, there are significant differences, and not just from an aesthetic point of view. Let's find out.\n\nInspired by the Cybertruck and Model 3\n\nA look at Tesla's Chinese website reveals the various changes the Model Y has undergone.\n\nThe new crossover design focuses even more on efficiency and aerodynamics. Length has increased to 4,797 mm from the previous version's 4,751 mm, while width and height remain essentially unchanged at 1,921 mm and 1,624 mm.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025): the new colour Glacier Blue\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y restyling, the new rear LED bar Photo by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025), side view\n\nThe front end has been redesigned with a Cybertruck-inspired light signature, with thin LED headlights connected by a light strip. The bumper has also been revised, with a new front camera to support manoeuvring and improve Autopilot. At the rear, 'C'-shaped light clusters are joined by a light bar with the Tesla logo.\n\nFive colours: Stealth Grey, Pearl White Multi-Coat, Quicksilver and Ultra Red, as well as the new Glacier Blue.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025), the interior\n\nThe interior reflects innovations already introduced with the restyled Model 3. These include thicker windows for improved soundproofing, customisable ambient lighting, ventilated front seats and power-folding rear seats, as well as new fabric upholstery for the dashboard.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025), the dedicated screen for rear passengers\n\nThe 15.4-inch main screen has been upgraded, as has the 8-inch rear passenger display. The steering wheel is similar to that of the Model 3, although the images on the Chinese site show a small additional lever, perhaps to operate the direction indicators (a function that until now could be activated directly from the steering wheel controls).\n\nMotors and prices for China\n\nMoving on to the powertrain, the restyled Model Y is sold in China in RWD (with a single rear motor) and Long Range versions with twin motors and all-wheel drive. The RWD version accelerates from 0 to 62 mph in 5.9 seconds, with a claimed range of 368 miles in the Chinese CLTC cycle (which tends to be more optimistic than the WLTP), while the Long Range reaches 62 mph in 4.3 seconds and has a range of 447 miles.\n\nPhoto by: Tesla Tesla Model Y (2025), the rear three-quarter\n\nBoth variants are equipped with LFP batteries - the capacity of which is not stated - and support fast recharging, with maximum outputs of 170 kW for the RWD and 250 kW for the Long Range. Naturally, we wait to see whether these figures will be confirmed on the European model.\n\nAt the moment, there is no Performance version on the Chinese configurator, which should be introduced at a later stage.\n\nIn the meantime, in China the new Model Y starts at 263,500 yuan (approx. \u00a329,200), which is about 5% more than the price of the previous model in China. Although we don't yet know the expected price list for Europe, it is likely that the restyled Model Y in the UK will cost a few thousand pounds more than the current \u00a346,990. We should also remember that the car will also be produced in Europe at the Gigafactory in Berlin, unlike the Model 3 which is assembled in Shanghai and the USA.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Tesla's Model Y electric crossover SUV became the world's best-selling car of 2023. Not just the best-selling EV, but the best-selling vehicle, even outselling the Toyota Corolla, making the Model Y a key player in EV adoption. Now we get to see what's new in the 2025 version.\n\nOnly yesterday, Tesla China's website quietly revealed the 2025 Model Y, which is codenamed \"Juniper.\"\n\nTesla is doubling down in 2025 on its success and gave the EV \u2013 known for its performance, range and versatility \u2013 a refresh by adding new features and design improvements.\n\nStarting with what everyone sees first, the exterior has a completely new look. The front bumper and headlights have been redesigned giving it a sleeker, more modern look. The rear, also redesigned, still screams \"TESLA!\" when you look at it, but now has a full-width rear tail light, reminiscent of a Cylon in Battlestar Galactica.\n\n\"By your command,\" the full-width tail light when you tap those brakes will be sure to get everyone's attention Tesla China\n\nThe 19-inch wheels have gotten an update as well. And what you can't see behind them are suspension tweaks for a smoother ride and better handling.\n\nAnother nifty feature is the ability of the \"frunk\" and trunk to open up for you when you're nearby, making it easy to toss in your groceries or luggage as you approach the SUV without having to open any latches. We're not sure if the Tentsla is still compatible with the new design yet.\n\nThe newly updated Tesla Model Y \"Juniper\" sure looks sleek Tesla China\n\nOnce you hop inside, you'll notice right away that gone are the 2023-24 touch-sensitive turn signal buttons, replaced with the return of the beloved physical stalk to indicate your turns \u2013 thus proving the point, \"If it ain't broke, fix it til it is\" ... then just go back to what worked best in the first place.\n\nYou'll also notice improvements in the quality and feel of the interior, such as sleek ambient lighting. The interior has also been upgraded with more advanced acoustic materials \u2013 including those in the windshield \u2013 to make for a quieter, more luxurious ride.\n\nThe 2025 Model Y Juniper also gets the full self-driving (FSD) suite found on many other Tesla models. Active safety features include a pre-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, plus lane deviation and avoidance.\n\nYour passengers in the back can play games or set their desired climate with the new 8-inch touchscreen in the back Tesla China\n\nPassengers in the rear now get an 8-inch touchscreen for zone climate control as well as entertainment options. That screen might be tough to reach with a seatbelt on, so Tesla allows passengers to connect to entertainment functions via Bluetooth, making it easy to play some games or click on some Bluey for the kids on a long drive.\n\nIf you have pets, the Model Y also has a pet-safe mode to keep the interior at a comfortable temperature.\n\nQuite a few other aspects of the new dual-motor, all-wheel-drive Model Y caught an upgrade as well.\n\nThere's price, for one. The 2025 model comes in at US$41,390, down about $7,600 from the 2023 version.\n\nThe new Model Y Juniper has a CLTC estimated 446-mile (718-km) range over the 2023 EPA 330-mile (531 km) range. To be fair, the CLTC (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) leans towards the optimistic side of EV range, to say the least. Usually 15-20% higher than real-world estimates like the EPA. So we'll call the range of the new Model Y something more like 350-360 miles (563-579 km) on a single charge.\n\nThe Tesla Model Y Juniper can DC fast-charge at 250 kW at one of the 60,000 Tesla Superchargers world-wide \u2013 15 minutes should be good enough for another 155 miles (250 km) Tesla China\n\nThe outgoing 2023 model has around 346 hp and a 3,500-lb (1,588-kg) towing capacity. Specs for the Juniper are likely to be similar, but haven't been disclosed publicly yet. Battery pack size also isn't disclosed publicly for the Model Y, but it's estimated that the 2023 version was around 75 kWh.\n\nOf Tesla's range of vehicles \u2013 the Model S, 3, X, and Y \u2013 the Y has been the best-selling with 1.2 million sold worldwide in 2023, roughly 200,000 more than the next best-selling compact SUV \u2013 EV or otherwise \u2013 the Toyota Rav4.\n\nClick any image for the full gallery of photos.\n\nSource: Tesla China",

The headlights also have a similar new lighting look. \"The Model Y's awkward tall and swoopy proportions remain,\" the publication notes.\n\nNotably, the Model Y still has a turn-signal stalk instead of the unloved turn-signal buttons like the Model 3, which was redesigned last year.

Your dad pulls up in a Tesla Cybertruck. You are stunned. He wasn't joking.\n\nYour dad loads your luggage into the bed, and after sliding the cover closed, you get into the big truck. So far, so good.\n\nIt's about an hour's ride from the SLC airport to the Park City ski resort. You will get to travel through the snowy and scenic Rocky Mountains to get there.\n\nThe roads are clear, but it snowed the night before you arrived. Your dad is driving; you are in the back seat while your mom navigates. However, the ride isn't smooth.\n\nThere are numerous turns and sharp curves going over the mountain pass on the way to your ski destination. The truck lurches forward and backward as he puts on the brakes on the winding roads. That's when it hits you. Now you start feeling sick. Is it the Cybertruck or something else?\n\nLet's pick up Ansley's account.\n\n\"We thought our dad was joking when he said he rented a Tesla Cybertruck for our family vacation. But he wasn't joking!\"\n\n\"My dad rented a Tesla Cybertruck for our family vacation because it was significantly cheaper. I'm here to say that the worst part is not how ugly it is, but how bad it lurches and brakes. It's like a giant golf cart. I have never felt so sick before.\"\n\nWhat caused Ansley to get sick?\n\nHer criticism of the Cybertruck sparked a heated debate in the comments section. Some said it's because her father doesn't know how to drive an EV. Others reported feeling the same way as Ashley after riding in a Tesla vehicle themselves. This debate highlights the varying experiences people have had with the Cybertruck's driving dynamics.\n\nNicholas Smart says, \"Everyone says this is driver error, but I test-drove one of these things (Cybertruck), and if you so much as lift your foot off the gas, it literally brakes checks you. Especially at slow speeds. It was awful.\u201d\n\nAnsley responds, \"Driver error is definitely a contributor, but can we not acknowledge that the vehicle is also insanely sensitive and part of the problem?\"\n\nAnsley says, \"I'm so ready to get out of this toaster on wheels. I'm refusing to get in one ever again,\" she says with revulsion.\n\nSo, was it Ashley's dad's driving or something else?\n\nPart of the problem is the Cybertruck's poor visibility.\n\nA report from Forbes says that after driving the Cybertruck for an extended time, they found that the inside of the cabin presented visibility issues for the driver and passengers.\n\nForbes says, \"Like other Teslas, the ceiling is tinted glass, as is the narrow rear window, which makes for a lot of glare and not a lot of visibility. The tonneau cover further obscures what you can see through the back window; with it closed, you see only the interior of the truck bed.\"\n\nIf you are in the backseat and can't see out, it's like riding in the bottom of a boat, and you don't have anything to fix your eyes on. You feel a rocking back and forth, making you feel sick.\n\nIf you've driven in the mountains, it can be even worse, and you may experience motion sickness. However, being in an EV can make it worse.\n\nAn Economic Times report says EVs can contribute to motion sickness.\n\nThey say that there is a fundamental difference in driving dynamics between gasoline-powered and electric vehicles. That difference is the way gasoline and electric engines move the car forward.\n\nThe report says, \"For example, whereas we would associate acceleration with the engine revving in regular gas cars, electric cars suddenly deprive us of this reference point. Also gone are the combustion engine's vibrations, which some perceive as soothing.\"\n\nWhen an internal combustion engine (ICE) engine is in \"drive,\" it will lurch forward slowly while on a flat surface. This means you must always be ready to put your foot on the brake when driving, i.e., you ride the brakes.\n\nThe Crybertruck's driving dynamics played a key role.\n\nThe report says that the opposite is true for electric cars. Electric cars, like the Cybertruck or the Tesla Model 3, feature regenerative braking technology. This allows vehicles to charge batteries from a car's deceleration. The kinetic energy created when a car slows down or brakes is delivered back into the vehicle's system.\n\nThe Economic Times says that motion sickness in EVs is a significant issue. It affects around 25-30% of the population, with 60-70% of travelers experiencing sickness at some point.\n\nAnsley's dad played a role also.\n\nIt can be a challenge if Ansley's dad is not accustomed to driving in the mountains. Roads can be icy, and black ice is a significant issue. The driver can brake more often to prevent the vehicle from sliding.\n\nThe CDC says, \"Driving in the mountains can cause motion sickness because the winding roads create a sensory conflict between what your eyes see and what your inner ear feels, leading to confusion in your brain about your body's movement, which can result in nausea and dizziness.\"\n\nConclusion.\n\nWhen Ansley's dad rented the Tesla Cybertruck, he thought it would be a fun ride, but it turned out to be anything but fun, especially for Ansley. There were four factors at play.\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck's driving dynamics, limited visibility, her dad's inexperience, and the drive through the Utah mountains created a perfect storm. It's why Ansley was feeling carsick.\n\nIt's Your Turn.\n\nHave you experienced motion sickness when driving or riding in an EV?

The investigation includes 2016-2025 Tesla Model S and Model X, 2017-2025 Model 3, and 2020-2025 Model Y vehicles.\n\nThe investigation was triggered by reports that vehicles failed to detect obstacles like posts and parked cars while being remotely operated, and that drivers had too little time to react before a crash.\n\n2024 Tesla Model Y. - Courtesy of Tesla, Inc.\n\nThis new investigation comes after the NHTSA in October opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the misleadingly-named Full-Self Driving system after reports of four crashes\u2014including one in which a pedestrian was killed after being struck by a Model Y.\n\nIn addition to two investigations, Tesla has had to deal with the troubled launch of its Cybertruck\u2014which has now been recalled seven times\u2014and saw sales fall in 2024.

The list was created by a 2021 defense spending bill.\n\nThe move is significant given that Ford is currently working to build an EV factory near Marshall, Michigan, with the use of technology from CATL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder that agreement, CATL will license its EV battery technology to Ford, which has said it will operate the plant. CATL is also working to provide faster charging batteries for Tesla. A top CATL executive also told Reuters last year that it would seek to build another facility in the U.S. if incoming president-elect Donald Trump would allow it.\n\nWhile Ford and Tesla did not immediately respond when asked for comment, CATL issued a statement rebutting the designation.\n\n\u201cCATL has never engaged in any military-related business or activities, so this designation by the Department of Defense is a mistake,\u201d the company said. \u201cIt does not restrict CATL from conducting business with entities other than DoD and is expected to have no substantially adverse impact on our business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will proactively engage with DoD to address the false designation, including legal action if necessary, to protect the interests of our company and shareholders as a whole,\u201d CATL added.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s designation adds fodder to China hawks on Capitol Hill already skeptical of the company, including incoming president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s appointee to lead the State Department, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).\n\nRepublicans in both chambers of Congress have pushed the Biden administration to ramp up scrutiny of CATL and Gotion High-Tech Co., another Chinese battery-maker, accusing the companies of working with China\u2019s military and using forced labor in their supply chains.\n\nIn August, Rubio and Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the new chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, joined their colleagues in calling on the DOD to add CATL and Gotion to the list of companies tied to China\u2019s military.\n\nLast year, the House passed by voice vote H.R. 8631, the \u201cDecoupling From Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act,\u201d which would prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from buying batteries from six companies with China ties \u2014 including CATL.",

            "content": "Tesla Inc. must pay $176 million in legal fees to the shareholder attorneys who challenged four years of pay for its board of directors, including Elon Musk , a judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nA Delaware judge signed off on a settlement worth up to $919 million, resolving the lawsuit by a pension fund that challenged the board\u2019s compensation from 2017 to 2020, and awarded the fees to McCarter & English LLP, Fields Kupka & Shukurov LLP, and Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP. The ruling by Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick came the same day Musk formally appealed her landmark decision in a separate case last year voiding a record $56 billion CEO pay package given to the tech titan in 2018.\n\nThe settlement in the board pay case called for directors including Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison , Musk\u2019s brother Kimbal, and a son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch to return stock and options worth up to $735 million and forgo three years of pay allegedly worth $184 million. McCormick, chief judge of Delaware\u2019s Chancery Court, called the accord \u201cmore than reasonable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a good settlement,\u201d McCormick said in a bench ruling delivered by phone.\n\nBoth sides supported the settlement\u2019s chief terms, but Musk, Tesla, and the other board members had fought a request for $230 million from the lawyers leading the litigation. McCormick largely rejected their argument that the amount would represent an unearned windfall.

The earlier compensation case yielded a $345 million attorney payout, the largest ever in Delaware.\n\nIn addition to overseeing both pay cases, McCormick is the same judge who presided over litigation between Musk and the former Twitter Inc. after he tried to renege on his offer to buy the social media giant for $44 billion. He ultimately capitulated on the eve of trial.\n\nThe board pay lawsuit, filed by a Detroit police and firefighters retirement fund, involved shareholder derivative claims, which are technically filed on a corporation\u2019s behalf against its leaders.\n\nTesla is represented by Bayard PA.

Although Musk didn\u2019t specify an exact release date, he mentioned that Grok\u2019s arrival will be soon.

            "content": "On New Year\u2019s Day, a Tesla Cybertruck pulled up to the entrance of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, where the driver triggered a device consisting of fuel canisters and fireworks, detonating the vehicle. He claimed no lives but his own, whether or not he intended to.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack \u2013 the second of that day, coming on the heels of a mass casualty attack in New Orleans earlier in the morning \u2013 media and law enforcement worked through the standard paces, identifying the bomber and attempting to discern his motivations. His name was Matthew Livelsberger, a 37-year-old Green Beret, a five-time recipient of the Bronze Star, and a resident of Colorado Springs. And he made sure no one would need to puzzle over why he did what he did, leaving three separate pieces of correspondence explaining his motivations in detail. Manifestos, as we tend to call them in this kind of scenario.\n\nAnd then the coverage shifted. Upon seeing the bomber\u2019s motivations in his own words, media outlets apparently decided en masse to sidestep and sugar-coat the contents of the manifestos, with week-two coverage all but abandoning the documents in favor of focusing on Livelsberger\u2019s service record \u2013 and I think I know why.\n\nSuppressing an attacker\u2019s manifesto is not new, and is often the responsible thing to do. Outlets have done it in the past, with documents produced by the Christchurch shooter, or Anders Behring Breivik, opting to summarize the contents rather than proliferate the kinds of vile racism and extremism contained within. But this can\u2019t be why the media has shied away from Livelsberger\u2019s manifestos: they contain no such content.\n\nRather, I suspect that much of the media has opted to ignore the manifestos for the opposite reason: because the ideas expressed in those documents \u2013 the things a Green Beret listed among his reasons for perpetrating a bombing against a civilian target \u2013 are shockingly mainstream right-wing talking points.\n\nI often object to the idea that someone must be mentally unwell to perpetrate violence: the fevered attempts to dismiss every mass shooter as a psychiatric patient, the self-soothing idea that mental health screenings could be a stand-in for stricter gun laws. It\u2019s baseless \u2013 history is overrun with violence committed by those of sound mind and body \u2013 but it comforts us, so we cling to it.\n\nAs more information has emerged about Matthew Livelsberger, however, it has become clear that something was indeed amiss with the Green Beret. His former girlfriend, an Army nurse, believes he sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) during a deployment in 2019, and the FBI has concluded that Livelsberger likely suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well. His mood and behavior changed after the 2019 injury, and there is ample reason to believe that he was not a rational actor by the time he left his home in Colorado Springs the day after Christmas to rent a Tesla Cybertruck in Denver, pack it with explosives, and drive it to Las Vegas \u2013 not because of the actions he took, but because of the very real conditions he appears to have suffered from.\n\nLivelsberger was not the only one carrying the weight of life-altering, unseen combat wounds. Traumatic brain injuries can impact motor function, speech, reasoning, and emotion. PTSD can have both physical and psychological effects, and is strongly correlated with mental health issues. Both of these conditions are prevalent among Global War on Terrorism veterans like Livelsberger, with PTSD in particular having been dubbed the \u201csignature wound\u201d of the conflict.\n\nThe less political parts of Liversberger\u2019s manifestos made it clear that he was suffering from trauma incurred during his service. In one of the documents Livelsberger left behind \u2013 a letter sent to a friend shortly before the attack, which police believe to be genuine \u2013 he talks about his role in conducting targeting for airstrikes in the Nimruz Province of Afghanistan in 2019, which he believes claimed civilian lives. In another document, Livelsberger said his death was a way to \u201ccleanse my mind of the brothers I\u2019ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.\u201d It\u2019s clear that Livelsberger\u2019s combat service damaged him, and that the bombing he perpetrated in Las Vegas on New Year\u2019s Day was yet another tragic servicemember suicide \u2013 but his manifestos also make it clear that he had a lot of political ideas swirling around in his troubled mind, and that he chose to commit suicide via spectacle for the explicit purpose of drawing attention to those ideas. Livelsberger\n\n\u201cAmericans only pay attention to spectacles and violence,\u201d Livelsberger wrote. \u201cWhat better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives?\u201d\n\nYet the political ideas Livelsberger details in his manifestos \u2013 the political ideas that contributed to him building a bomb, driving it across state lines, and blowing himself up with it \u2013 were not the avant-garde ravings of a new kind of extremist. They were the kinds of sentiments that would be right at home on Donald Trump\u2019s Truth Social, Elon Musk\u2019s X, or your uncle\u2019s Facebook page. And that\u2019s more troubling than the alternative.\n\nDEI is a cancer,\u201d Livelsberger wrote in one of his manifestos. Altogether, the manifestos consist of three documents: one addressed to \u201cFellow Servicemembers, Veterans, and All Americans,\u201d and two which he sent as emails to friends.\n\n\u201cThankfully we rejected the DEI candidate and will have a real President instead of Weekend at Bernie\u2019s.\u201d\n\nDEI \u2013 or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion \u2013 is just one of a handful of mundane, everyday bits of right-wing grievance politics occupying Livelsberger\u2019s manifestos. His reference to Vice President Kamala Harris as \u201cthe DEI candidate\u201d is so commonplace in right-wing circles that Republican members of Congress were tweeting the same insult seven months ago. \u201cStop obsessing over diversity, we are all diverse,\u201d Livelsberger wrote.\n\nAnd his disdain for diversity was not the only position Livelsberger shared with Republican members of Congress or online right-wing activists. He also despaired about the abandonment of family values and traditional morality.\n\n\u201cWe are crumbling because of a lack of self-respect, morales [sic], and respect for others,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have strayed from family values and corrupted our minds.\u201d\n\nThis is such a boilerplate conservative sentiment that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance just ran a sizable portion of their campaign on the idea of a \u201cpro-family\u201d agenda and traditional American values.\n\nIn his letters, Livelsberger also rails against screen time, obesity, the lack of masculinity in America, and a \u201cculture of weakness.\u201d He warned of Chinese drones \u2013 another sentiment shared by a Republican congressman in the last month \u2013 and said his attack was a \u201cwake-up call.\u201d He encouraged everyone to \u201crally around\u201d Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to bring a \u201cnew chapter of health for our people.\u201d\n\nThen he set a timer on his device and ended his own life.\n\nIt would be disingenuous to portray Livelsberger as a rational political actor, or to depict his crime as the logical end-point of the political views he expressed in his manifestos. His political views are striking, not because those views are destined to result in violence, but because so many Americans \u2013 including many of our leaders \u2013 share them.\n\nAnd I suspect that\u2019s why most of the mainstream media abandoned the manifestos after seeing their contents: how are they supposed to talk about the views expressed in a bomber\u2019s manifesto when those views are routinely expressed by Republican leaders? How muddy do the lines get when the contents of a manifesto are indistinguishable from comments made every day by the president-elect, the wealthiest man on earth, and their millions of supporters?\n\nWhat does it say about the state of political life in the United States that news outlets are dancing around a would-be terrorist\u2019s motives because those motives are, seemingly, too mainstream? And what does it say about the conservative movement, that its ideas resonated so thoroughly with a traumatized, brain-damaged, suicide bomber?\n\nNothing good.",

            "content": "The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a probe into Tesla's software that allows cars to operate autonomously over short distances, after reports of the code crashing in a physical sense.\n\nThe software under investigation is called \u201cSmart Summon\u201d and \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d and is accessed via the Tesla app. It can be used to instruct some of the automaker\u2019s vehicles to drive themselves to the location of a driver\u2019s choosing. Tesla says the code can navigate around obstacles to reach the desired destination, though only over distances of up to 100 metres, and suggests it as a means to do things like automatically leave a tight parking space. You can see it in action below.\n\nYoutube Video\n\nTesla\u2019s promises may be hollow: Multiple reports claim the self-driving machines have hit with obstacles and other vehicles. Twelve of these apparent accidents were by Teslas using the original Smart Summon software, while four more incidents have since been alleged by customers using its successor Actually Smart Summon, including one formal complaint being investigated by the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI).\n\n\"All four incidents involve the subject Tesla vehicles operating in Actually Smart Summon failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash,\" the watchdog wrote [PDF] on Tuesday.\n\n\"ODI is aware of multiple crash allegations, involving both Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon, where the user had too little reaction time to avoid a crash, either with the available line of sight or releasing the phone app button, which stops the vehicle\u2019s movement,\" the NHTSA added.\n\nNotably, the agency said it had received no reports of these alleged incidents from Tesla, which is required to disclose any accident involving a car using self-driving software on a public road. The probe affects every Tesla Model S, 3, and X purchased since 2016, potentially covering 2,585,000 or so vehicles.\n\nSmart Summon was widely panned after its launch in 2019 as being buggy and prone to either not working at all or making cars bump into objects \u2013 thin trees seemed to be a particular problem. Actually Smart Summon debuted in September 2024 and, while sentiment on Tesla forums suggests it is an improvement, issues remain.\n\n\"Actually Smart Summon and Full Self-Driving are defective engineering prototypes, and should not be allowed on the road,\" said long-term Tesla critic Dan O'Dowd, the billionaire founder of the Dawn Project, in a statement sent to The Register, referring to FSD, Tesla's more general-purpose self-driving software.\n\n\"Tesla has repeatedly shown its contempt for regulators and it is concerning that Tesla failed to report any of the 15 accidents NHTSA identified Actually Smart Summon to be involved in to federal regulators,\u201d he claimed.\n\n\"Tesla claims its software is safe but, just like with its Full Self-Driving software, it has been under-reporting the number of crashes that its software has been involved in and then used this incomplete data to paint a false picture of the software\u2019s safety.\"\n\nThe NHTSA and Tesla regularly cross swords over the regulation of self-driving cars, and the automaker is subject to multiple investigations by the agency.\n\nTesla appears to be silent on the matter at the time of writing, and given how close its CEO Elon Musk is now to incoming US president Donald Trump, it may have to do simply nothing at all. \u00ae",

In short, each company has a specific emissions target that must be met based on the total number of vehicles sold. A portion of new car sales, estimated at around 20 percent, must be EVs. And many major brands have doubts about reaching that metric.\n\nIn Europe, automakers can pool together to balance the proverbial scales. A company easily meeting targets for emissions can offset a brand falling behind, and that's where Tesla comes in. Being an all-electric manufacturer with significant sales in the European market, Tesla has all kinds of breathing room for the new regulations. Thus far, major players such as Ford, Stellantis, Mazda, Subaru, and even Toyota have teamed up with the Texas-based EV brand.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nWith 2025 barely a week old, companies still have plenty of time to determine whether they'll need to pool fleets. According to Automotive News Europe, pooling together now could be a fail-safe measure for some brands in case they come up short later in the year. Others likely know they won't be hitting the necessary targets and are already mitigating the financial hit.\n\nAnd there will be a hit. Each gram of emissions over the limit will result in a fine of $105, and that can add up very quickly. Depending on how far over a company goes, paying Tesla to pool fleets might be the smartest financial play. As it stands right now, analysts think the total payout to Tesla could reach $1 billion by the end of the year.\n\nThere has been pushback from several automakers over stiff EU rules, especially with a softening demand for EVs. Everything is rolling towards a 2035 rule requiring automakers to go EV-only, or use combustion engines running solely on e-fuel throughout Europe. The next few years will likely determine whether that plan is upheld or scrapped.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nSource: Automotive News Europe\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Tesla is under order to report crashes on \u201cpublicly accessible roads\u201d involving vehicles being operated through its autonomous driving technology.\n\nThe new investigation follows another probe launched in October looking into the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian. That investigation covers 2.4 million Teslas from the 2016 through 2024 model years.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\nOne driver filed a complaint after a crash while using Tesla\u2019s \u201cActually Smart Summon\u201d technology and NHTSA is looking into another three similar incidents based on media reports, the NHTSA said. The agency is looking into 12 total incidents reported by users of the technology.\n\nEach of the vehicles failed to detect posts and other parked vehicles, according to the NHTSA.\n\nRegulators say the vehicles struck objects because the users had \u201ctoo little reaction time to avoid a crash, either with the available line of sight or releasing the phone app button, which stops the vehicle\u2019s movement.\u201d\n\nShares of Tesla Inc., based in Austin, Texas, slid more than 4% in late afternoon trading Tuesday.\n\nMusk has complained that U.S. regulations are too onerous and are holding back the development of self-driving cars. Ethics experts are worried that once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, Musk will push him to ease oversight of Tesla, which just suffered its first decline in annual sales in more than a decade.\n\nMusk donated an estimated $250 million to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and is a frequent guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago, vetting cabinet nominees and meeting with foreign heads of state. Trump has put Musk in charge of an advisory group, the Department of Government Efficiency, that will recommend where to cut government expenses and staff at federal agencies and reduce regulation.\n\nThe NHTSA said Tuesday it will look into the top speed that Teslas can reach when users deploy its \u201csummons\u201d technology, as well as restrictions on public roads and line of sights requirements. It also said it expects to check for any \u201cconnectivity delays\u201d with the app that could result in increased stopping distance.\n\nTesla\u2019s Model 3 owner\u2019s manual says that its \u201csummons\u201d feature is designed for use only in parking lots and driveways on private property and is disabled on public roads.\n\nThe new probe covers 2016-2025 Model S and X vehicles, 2017-2025 Model 3, 2020-2025 Model Y equipped with Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving driver assistance system.",

            "content": "Twenty miles outside Corpus Christi, Texas \u2014 an area so dry the local water company distributes shower timers at high school football games \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man is nearly done building a lithium refinery that could require as much as 8 million gallons of water per day.\n\nIn a rare public update on the $1 billion project, Tesla Inc. in December said it was starting to test the ability to process lithium through the new factory. But the carmaker still doesn\u2019t have a contract for the water needed to operate the facility, presenting a hurdle for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk\u2019s goal of turning lithium into chemical products used to make electric vehicle batteries.\n\nThe factory, where Tesla aspires to start production this year, is part of a broader effort by Musk to ease bottlenecks and build a more robust domestic supply chain of the critical raw material. It has also set off alarm bells among some in the small Texas town who are worried about having enough water to live on, let alone help supply a big factory.\n\nIn 2022, Tesla estimated it would need 400,000 gallons per day to run the lithium plant, rising to 800,000 gallons per day at peak usage. Two years later, a Tesla employee told a consulting firm, Raftelis, that the forecast has spiked to as high as 8 million gallons per day, according to South Texas Water Authority records obtained by Bloomberg News through a public records request.\n\nSouth Texas Water Authority controls the water but doesn\u2019t sell it directly to Tesla, which is negotiating a water contract with Nueces Water Supply Corp., a water utility company. Nueces Water Supply didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. South Texas Water Authority didn\u2019t provide a comment for this story.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to determine what kind of drain Tesla\u2019s factory would have on the area\u2019s water supply. But the average American family uses about 300 gallons of water per day or 109,500 gallons per year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nFor Robstown, which had 3,804 households as of 2023, that would equate to about 1.1 million gallons a day. At the high-end estimate of 8 million gallons per day, Tesla would be using eight times Robstown\u2019s average residential water use. That\u2019s enough water to fill eight ten-foot-deep swimming pools that are nearly the size of a football field, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nDrought Levels\n\nIt\u2019s always been dry in this hot corner of South Texas best known for its beaches and energy exports \u2014 but there\u2019s even less water to go around today than when Tesla first broke ground in May 2023. The area\u2019s drought status was just upgraded to stage 3 \u2014 urgent \u2014 meaning turning off non-essential water use across facilities and parks and adding new restrictions on washing cars, watering lawns and operating decorative fountains.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re telling us to take shorter showers and turn the faucet off when we\u2019re brushing our teeth,\u201d said Marie Lucio, a resident of the nearby Lost Creek neighborhood. The area already has frequent problems with water quality, including low pressure and a milky-like tint, and she\u2019s worried the area\u2019s aging water pipes won\u2019t be able to keep up with new demand like the Tesla factory. \u201cWe\u2019re not equipped to handle getting water to these industries.\u201d\n\nAbout a year into construction, Tesla\u2019s plant manager Jason Bevan told a county judge that the company had \u201cstruggled to advance the discussion\u201d on water agreements, an email obtained by Bloomberg News shows. \u201cI\u2019m at a stage now where we need to escalate the urgency around getting this agreement complete,\u201d he wrote at the time. Tesla didn\u2019t reply to a request for further comment.\n\nEven without a water agreement, Tesla has plowed ahead. In true Musk fashion, the billionaire has pushed forward with building other infrastructure and held an event last month showcasing the plant for the community.\n\nMusk is known for pushing back against regulations, often saying they slow projects down. And he now has a new political ally in President-elect Donald Trump, who has joined the Tesla CEO in railing against government regulation. Trump recently proclaimed that any person or company investing a billion dollars in a US project should receive expedited approvals and permits. Musk reposted the idea with an American flag emoji, a rocket ship emoji and three words: \u201cThis is awesome.\u201d\n\nOne way he\u2019s been able to expedite projects has been to build factories in Texas\u2019 city buffer zones or unincorporated areas that have fewer rules and government oversight compared with bigger cities.\n\nMusk\u2019s Robstown site fits the bill. The factory sits on former farmland in an unincorporated portion of Nueces County in South Texas. The area is industrializing, with the Port of Corpus Christi and other companies buying up space in the area and driving up water needs.\n\nEven at the lowest estimated demand, Tesla\u2019s water needs are raising concerns for local residents. \u201cIt\u2019s just upsetting that we still give water contracts out when we\u2019re in such dire straits,\u201d said Myra Alaniz, a Nueces County resident who lives just outside of Robstown.\n\nDespite the complaints, local officials have made little public pushback.\n\nThe facility is expected to bring around 250 permanent jobs, with average salaries around $80,000 in an area where the average income is less than half that. To spur investment, county commissioners in 2022 voted to make the site a tax increment reinvestment zone, a designated area that bookmarks a portion of property taxes for redevelopment. The same year, the Robstown Independent School District passed its own tax abatement extension.\n\nIn December, South Texas Water Authority passed an infrastructure deal that will allow Nueces Water Supply to sell rights to the pipe Tesla will need to obtain water, which was one of the hold-ups for a water deal. In a meeting last month, Nueces Water Supply\u2019s board authorized management to \u201ctake any and all actions necessary or convenient\u201d to reach an agreement to provide Tesla with the water it needs.\n\nCopyright 2025 Bloomberg.\n\nTopics Texas Tesla",

            "content": "NHTSA opens probe into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles due to summon feature\n\nFederal regulators have opened a probe into roughly 2.6 million Tesla vehicles after a remote summoning feature reportedly led to crashes.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced the probe on Tuesday, stating it received one complaint alleging a crash due to the Actually Smart Summon feature and is investigating reports of three additional crashes.\n\nThe \u201cActually Smart Summon\u201d feature launched in September and enables drivers to remotely summon or move their vehicles to another location via a button on a mobile phone app. Tesla previously had a feature, called Smart Summon, that allowed drivers to move their cars into or out of a parking spot. According to the notice, the Office of Defects Investigation has received 12 complaints related to the Smart Summon feature.\n\nThe four crashes, according to the notice about the investigation, relate to the Tesla vehicles failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in crashes when the Actually Smart Summon feature is on.\n\nThe notice read that the office knows of several crash allegations \u2014 though Tesla has not reported any crashes through the Standing General Order requiring reporting of crashes on publicly accessible roads \u2014 involving Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon in which drivers had little to no reaction time to avoid a crash with the available line of site or releasing the button to stop the vehicle\u2019s movement.\n\nNHTSA is opening a preliminary evaluation into the Actually Smart Summon feature and will then decide whether to update the probe to an engineering analysis before seeking to require a recall. NHTSA will look into the vehicles\u2019 operations and field performance, top speed attained with the Actually Smart Summon feature engaged and line of site requirements as well as stopping distance requirements.\n\nThis probe covers 2016-2025 Model S and X vehicles, 2017-2025 Model 3 and 2020-2025 Model Y with the Full Self-Driving driver assistance system.\n\nTesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMichael Brooks, executive director at the Center for Auto Safety, told the American-Statesman that Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving system is a \u201cvision-only system,\u201d meaning it is camera-based and doesn\u2019t use other sensors like other automakers are using to sense hazards.\n\n\u201cAlmost invariably, you see cameras unable to cope with nighttime conditions in really lit areas and also, there's some problems in weather. Being able to cope with nighttime problems is critical to safe driving,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe camera-only approach without some other sensor to check what inputs the camera is getting to make sure that at nighttime or in bad weather that the cameras are getting it right, there needs to be some sort of redundancy there.\u201d\n\nBrooks said all the current autonomous driving features on Tesla vehicles \u2014 summoning, autopilot and more \u2014 require human intervention and active participation, something he is concerned many drivers are not doing when using these features.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be aware that they are fully responsible for anything that occurs while they\u2019re using (the summon feature),\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf you\u2019re holding a button down on your phone to make your vehicle move and that vehicle then runs over a child in a grocery store parking lot, you are ultimately going to be held responsible. That\u2019s not an autonomous vehicle. Tesla is not going to step in and save you from liability.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time NHTSA has opened investigations into Tesla vehicles.\n\nTesla recalled more than two million U.S. vehicles in December 2023 to install safeguards for its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system. NHTSA opened a probe in April to see if the recall was adequate to address the concerns that drivers are not paying attention.\n\nIn October, NHTSA opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving software following four reported crashes. One of these incidents involved a pedestrian who was struck and killed by a 2021 Tesla Model Y in Rimrock, Arizona, in November 2023. The investigation is still ongoing.\n\nA week prior to that probe announcement, Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled Tesla\u2019s two-seater, two-door \"Cybercab\" robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals, using solely cameras and artificial intelligence to navigate roads. Musk at the time said he hoped to get approval for the vehicles in Texas, possibly in California, this year with hopes to reach volume production for the robotaxis in 2026. NHTSA would need to approve the vehicles for use on publicly accessible roads.\n\nMore: Elon Musk unveils Tesla's new Cybercab robotaxi. See expected rollout, how much it'll cost\n\n\u201cFrankly, the Summon, the autopilot, full self-driving, all of those bells and whistles that Tesla has sold as somewhat all promise \u2014 all of them have to be supervised by humans which is a completely different animal than a true Robotaxi where there's no human supervision whatsoever,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nBrooks said the Center for Auto Safety does not anticipate Musk being able to launch his robotaxi this year, saying other self-driving robotaxi makers like Waymo are way ahead of Tesla\u2019s technology and have additional sensors to support the vehicles.\n\nMusk has complained on various occasions that U.S. regulations impede the development of self-driving and fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nMusk played an active role in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, donating an estimated $250 million to his campaign. Since then, the tech billionaire and sometime-Austin resident has frequently stayed at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago, met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, sat-in on meetings with foreign heads of state and vetted cabinet nominees.\n\nMore: Trump appoints Texas billionaire Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy to lead new 'DOGE' commission\n\nTrump announced following his election that he would create a new Department of Government Efficiency, placing Musk at the helm alongside Vivek Ramaswamy to oversee government spending and regulations.\n\nIn 2024, Tesla sales declined 1.1%, the first dip in over a decade for the automaker headquartered in Austin.\n\nMore: Tesla just posted its worst numbers in over a decade; here's why investors aren't worried\n\nBrooks said NHTSA investigations decrease during some Republican administrations, and he expects the same under Trump. He said there\u2019s an ongoing question whether or not federal regulators will continue pursuing the Tesla investigations \u201cwith the same fervor\u201d as under the current Biden Administration.\n\n\u201cOnce the administration change happens later this month, is NHTSA going to really pursue these investigations to an appropriate conclusion or whether there's going to be political influence to prevent the investigations from digging too much into that,\u201d Brooks said.",

            "content": "Given the stock's sky-high valuation, the electric car maker's sales should be soaring. But they're not.\n\nTesla (TSLA 3.86%) stock is off to a stumbling start in 2025. At the time of this writing, shares are down nearly 2% year to date. The pullback is due to the company's latest vehicle delivery numbers spooking some investors. The automaker said it delivered nearly 496,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, up only 2% year over year. Even worse, the quarterly delivery figure put total deliveries for the year at about 1.789 million units, down from approximately 1.81 million in 2023.\n\nA year of underwhelming growth -- particularly during a time when interest rates moved higher -- wouldn't be too concerning if it weren't for the stock's pricey valuation. But a high valuation demands rapid growth, and Tesla isn't delivering.\n\nSlowing growth\n\nAdding to the bearish narrative for Tesla stock in 2025, the company's quarterly year-over-year growth rate in vehicle deliveries actually declined during Q4. Tesla's 2% growth rate was about 4 percentage points lower than the 6% growth the company posted in Q3. Further, the quarterly delivery number Tesla reported was below the consensus analyst forecast for the period. On average, analysts were expecting Tesla to deliver about 9,000 more units than it did.\n\n\"One trend which we observed in the industry [is] that, because of the affordability being impacted because of interest rates, people are holding on to the cars longer,\" explained Tesla Chief Fnancial Officer Vaibhav Taneja during the company's third-quarter earnings call last October, \"especially in the U.S.\"\n\nOf course, the upside to the current demand situation is that if interest rates decline, there could be \"a massive effect on the automotive demand,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors during the same earnings call.\n\nTesla is between \"growth waves\"\n\nIn addition to interest rates being a headwind, Tesla says there's a temporary self-inflicted structural problem affecting sales trends. In its third-quarter letter to shareholders, Tesla said the company is \"currently between two major growth waves,\" with the first being the expansion of its Model 3 and Y vehicles and the second expected to \"be initiated by advances in autonomy and introduction of new products, including those built on our next-generation vehicle platform.\"\n\nBut investors shouldn't get too excited about this second growth wave. First, it's impossible to accurately predict its timing or how significant and profitable it will be. Second, this growth wave may already be priced in. Tesla currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 110. Therefore, the stock is arguably already priced for declining interest rates and successful execution in unpredictable growth markets.\n\nTo be fair, Tesla is executing quite well in some growth areas. For instance, the company's energy storage business is booming. It deployed 6.9 gigawatt hours (GWh) worth of energy storage in Q3, up 75% year over year. And this figure rose to a record 11 GWh in Q4. But Tesla's energy generation and storage business is still a small part of its overall business, representing about 9% of quarterly revenue. Further, it's not like Tesla is resting on its laurels when it comes to its ambitions for autonomous driving. Its supervised \"self-driving\" software has seen more than 2 billion miles of use as of the end of Q3. If Tesla can transition this software to an unsupervised version in the coming years, the company could roll out its planned autonomous driving robotaxi service, adding another revenue stream.\n\nWith good momentum in some important but fast-growing areas of its business, there's a chance that Tesla will end up living up to its current valuation. But if some unexpected challenges arise, like an interest rate increase or higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the company's plans for its next growth wave, it may be difficult for investors to earn meaningful returns in the coming years.",

            "content": "Today, I'd like to talk Tesla. It's one of my favorite topics and something I've written about many times in this newsletter. I describe myself as both a Tesla enthusiast and a Tesla critic - a stance that keeps my eyes wide open to both the magic and the flaws of these vehicles. And yes, those flaws are wide enough to drive a Cybertruck through.\n\nBut let's start with the happy stuff.\n\nOn New Year's Day, my husband and I orchestrated our first synchronized \"light show\" in our driveway. We were giddy with excitement. While we've used this feature before on our individual cars, this was our first time creating a dual performance. It was like a double date with our vehicles, complete with both cars serenading us with Auld Lang Syne. In that moment, even the most hardened critic would have struggled not to smile.\n\nI've owned my Tesla for two years now, and I still feel a spark of joy every time I back out of my driveway, accompanied by that signature spaceship sound. It makes me feel like I'm driving the future. I'll admit - I sometimes drive extra slowly just to savor that sound.\n\nThe whisper-quiet cabin, the glass roof, the concert-hall quality of my Spotify playlists through the ridiculous number of speakers (I play my music LOUD, like teenager LOUD), and yes, even the heated seats that pamper my California-softened self on our rare cold days - it all adds up to an experience that explains why Tesla owners love their cars so passionately.\n\nBut loving something means being honest about its flaws, especially when those flaws involve promises of technological revolution. This brings us to the heart of today's discussion: the divergent paths toward autonomous driving being pursued by Tesla and Waymo, and what they tell us about the future of transportation.\n\nTwo Roads to the Self-Driving Future\n\nTesla and Waymo represent fundamentally different philosophies in the pursuit of autonomous driving. Tesla, under Elon Musk's leadership, has committed to a vision-only approach, believing that cameras alone - combined with sophisticated neural networks - can achieve full autonomy. It's an elegant theory: humans drive using primarily visual input, so why shouldn't machines be able to do the same?\n\nWaymo, on the other hand, has taken what might be called the \"belt and suspenders\" approach. As a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., Waymo combines multiple sensor types - LiDAR, radar, and cameras - to create a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's environment. Their vehicles map their surroundings with millimeter precision, creating a detailed digital twin of the world they navigate.\n\nUnderstanding the Autonomous Vehicle Landscape\n\nTo truly grasp the magnitude of difference between Tesla and Waymo's approaches to autonomous driving, we need to first understand the established framework for measuring vehicle autonomy. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has defined six levels of driving automation, from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous). This framework helps us understand exactly where each company stands in their journey toward true self-driving capabilities.\n\nAs the visualization shows, Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, despite its ambitious name, operates at Level 2 autonomy. This means that while the vehicle can control both steering and speed simultaneously, the driver must remain fully attentive and ready to take control at any moment. Think of it as having a talented but inexperienced student driver who needs constant supervision. Waymo, on the other hand, has achieved Level 4 autonomy within specific areas, allowing their vehicles to operate without human intervention in carefully mapped zones \u2013 more like having a skilled chauffeur who can handle most situations independently, but only along routes they know well.\n\nBut the differences between these companies go far deeper than their current autonomy levels. Their entire approaches to achieving self-driving capabilities represent two fundamentally different philosophies about how to solve one of technology's most complex challenges.\n\nThis interactive comparison reveals the stark contrasts in how these companies approach autonomous driving. Tesla's vision-only system, relying on cameras and neural networks, is like teaching a car to drive the same way humans learn \u2013 primarily through vision. Waymo's multi-sensor approach, combining cameras with LiDAR and radar, is more like giving the car multiple ways to perceive its environment, similar to how a pilot uses various instruments to fly a plane safely.\n\nThe deployment strategies of these companies are equally divergent, each with its own set of challenges and opportunities.\n\nTesla's approach favors rapid iteration and learning from a vast fleet of consumer vehicles, collecting data from millions of miles driven daily. This is like having millions of practice sessions happening simultaneously, each contributing to the system's overall learning. Waymo, conversely, takes a more controlled approach, thoroughly mapping and testing specific areas before expanding their service \u2013 more like methodically charting a new territory before allowing others to explore it.\n\nThe Promise vs. Reality\n\nThe contrast between these approaches becomes stark when we examine the timeline of promises versus achievements. Since 2015, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has made bold predictions about the imminent arrival of full self-driving capabilities. Let's look at this timeline:\n\nIn December 2015, Musk predicted \"complete autonomy\" by 2018. In 2016, Tesla released a promotional FSD video that was later revealed in court to be staged. By 2017, Musk was promising that within two years, drivers would be able to sleep in their vehicles while they drove themselves. The predictions continued: a million robotaxis by 2020, \"feature complete\" FSD by the end of that same year, and Level 5 autonomy by the end of 2021.\n\nAs of the writing of this article in January 2025, Tesla FSD remains at SAE Level 2 autonomy.\n\nWaymo, in contrast, has taken a more measured approach. Their autonomous vehicles operate in carefully mapped areas, with clear communication about their capabilities and limitations. While this has meant slower expansion, it has also resulted in a more reliable service. Today, Waymo operates fully autonomous taxis in select cities - no human safety driver required. Waymo\u2019s vehicles are currently at Level 4- also known as \"High Automation.\u201d In SAE Level 4 vehicles can operate autonomously in specific conditions or environments, but humans can still take control. (The YouTube video included at the end shows these features.)\n\nThe Technical Reality\n\nThe core of this debate isn't just about timelines - it's about fundamental technical approaches. Tesla's vision-only system relies on neural networks trained on data from its vast fleet of vehicles. In theory, this should allow the system to learn from millions of real-world driving scenarios. However, this approach faces significant challenges in edge cases - rare but critical situations that can be difficult for AI to handle.\n\nWaymo's multi-sensor approach provides redundancy and precision but at a higher cost and with more complex hardware requirements. Their LiDAR systems can create precise 3D maps of the environment, providing robust data even in poor visibility conditions. However, this approach requires extensive mapping and infrastructure, making rapid global scaling more challenging.\n\nThe Road Forward\n\nAs we move into 2025, both companies continue to refine their approaches, though with notably different strategies. Tesla has just rolled out FSD v13 to vehicles equipped with Hardware 4 (HW4) or AI4 computers in North America, while owners with Hardware 3 await an updated v12.6 version. This split rollout highlights one of the ongoing challenges in autonomous vehicle development: balancing hardware capabilities with software advancement.\n\nThe contrast between Tesla and Waymo's approaches becomes particularly stark when considering environmental challenges. Tesla's vision-only system, while innovative, faces fundamental limitations in conditions like heavy fog, severe rain, or snow - situations where cameras simply cannot gather reliable data. Waymo's multi-sensor approach, incorporating LiDAR and radar alongside cameras, provides redundancy that helps their vehicles navigate in these challenging conditions, though at a significantly higher cost per vehicle.\n\nThe question isn't just which approach will win - it's whether either approach alone is sufficient for truly safe, reliable autonomous driving in all conditions. Perhaps the future lies in a hybrid approach that combines the best elements of both strategies, finding a sweet spot between Tesla's scalable, lower-cost vision system and Waymo's more comprehensive but expensive sensor suite. Or perhaps we're still missing crucial pieces of the autonomous driving puzzle, pieces that neither company has fully identified yet.\n\nThe Human Element\n\nAs both a Tesla owner and a technology journalist, I find myself in a unique position to appreciate both the promise and the limitations of these systems. When my car negotiates a complex intersection flawlessly, it feels like the future has arrived. When it becomes confused by a simple lane merge, I'm reminded of how far we still have to go.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe autonomous driving landscape is evolving faster than my Tesla can back out of my driveway (which, by the way, has become significantly less nerve-wracking with recent updates). With FSD v13 now rolling out to HW4/AI4 vehicles across North America, we're seeing meaningful progress in Tesla's vision-only approach. The update brings improved object detection and smoother decision-making, while the holiday update adds practical features like rear cross-traffic alerts that make everyday driving safer. This last feature is particularly welcome - Tesla's previous rear visibility solution was essentially \"trust your cameras and hope for the best,\" which led to more than a few close encounters with poles, walls, and that one particularly sneaky recycling bin.\n\nYet the race between Tesla and Waymo isn't just about who can release updates faster - it's about who can earn the public's trust while pushing the boundaries of what's possible. As we enter 2025, both companies are proving that there are multiple viable paths to autonomous driving. Tesla's democratized approach, pushing updates to hundreds of thousands of vehicles, contrasts with Waymo's methodical expansion of fully autonomous service areas. Both strategies have merit, and both face unique challenges.\n\nAs someone who experiences these technologies firsthand, I'm convinced that the future of autonomous driving will be shaped not by which company has the boldest vision or the most sensors, but by which one can consistently deliver on the promise of safer, more convenient transportation. For now, I'll keep enjoying my spaceship sounds and holiday light shows, while keeping my hands on the wheel and my eyes on the remarkable progress we're making toward a truly autonomous future.\n\nI write about AI and technology twice weekly in my free newsletter, Deep Learning with the Wolf. Subscribe for more in-depth analysis of the latest developments in AI, autonomous vehicles, and other emerging technologies.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nWhat's the current state of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD)? As of early 2025, Tesla's FSD remains in beta testing, requiring active driver supervision. It's classified as a Level 2 autonomous system, meaning the driver must maintain control and attention at all times. Tesla plans to release FSD v13 and expand outside North America in Q1 2025.\n\nWhy doesn't Tesla use LiDAR like Waymo? Tesla believes that cameras alone, combined with advanced neural networks, can achieve full autonomy. Elon Musk has called LiDAR a \"crutch\" and argues that since humans can drive using primarily vision, vehicles should be able to do the same. This approach also keeps hardware costs lower and allows for easier mass production.\n\nHow does Waymo's approach differ from Tesla's? Waymo uses a multi-sensor approach combining LiDAR, radar, and cameras. They create detailed maps of their operating areas and focus on achieving full autonomy within specific geographic regions before expanding. Their vehicles operate at Level 4 autonomy within these areas, requiring no human intervention.\n\nCan either system handle all weather conditions? Currently, both systems face challenges in severe weather. Camera-based systems can struggle with heavy rain, snow, or fog, while LiDAR can have difficulty with precipitation and road spray. Both companies continue to work on improving performance in adverse conditions.\n\nWhat are the regulatory hurdles for full autonomy? Autonomous vehicles face varying regulations across different jurisdictions. Key challenges include liability frameworks, safety standards, testing requirements, and the need for new laws addressing fully autonomous vehicles. Companies must also navigate public trust and acceptance.\n\nIs Tesla's vision-only approach viable for achieving full autonomy? This remains a subject of debate in the industry. While computer vision has made remarkable progress, many experts believe that sensor fusion (combining multiple types of sensors) provides necessary redundancy for safety-critical systems. The success of the vision-only approach may depend on further advances in AI and neural network technology.\n\nWhat the WolfPack Is Watching:\n\n\n\nCheck out a world record Tesla light show in Finland.

Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nElectric vehicle-maker Tesla's sales in China climbed to a record high last year. Sustaining that performance in 2025 could prove tricky as competition with homegrown players intensifies, analysts said. The U.S. electric vehicle maker saw annual sales in China jump 8.8% to a record high of more than 657,000 cars in 2024. In December alone, its sales rose 12.8% from the previous month to 83,000 units, according to Tesla China. However, Tesla has been losing market share to Chinese new-energy-vehicle players, down from 7.8% in 2023 to 6% in the January to November period last year, according to Bill Russo, founder and CEO of Automobility, who believes Tesla is \"struggling to keep pace [with domestic rivals] and has a limited and aging product portfolio.\" Brand resiliency and price cuts have supported Tesla's sales so far, said Tu Le, founder and managing director of Sino Auto Insights, but he was less certain that Tesla could keep up its momentum in 2025, given the lack of new products and increased local competition, especially from Chinese companies.\n\nAggressive price war\n\nTesla slashed the price for its best-selling Model Y in China by 10,000 yuan ($1,364.5) in late December and extended a zero-interest five-year loan plan for car buyers until the end of January. Its best-selling Model Y now starts at 239,900 yuan after the discount, while the Model 3 sedan starts at 231,900 yuan \u2014 Tesla had cut its prices by 14,000 yuan in April \u2014 according to its website. Still that marked a significant premium over a swath of cheaper models offered by Chinese domestic carmakers. BYD, which dominated the market with around 34% market share, prices one of its best-selling models Seagull at 136,800 yuan, and the more affordable Yuan Plus model, starting at 96,800 yuan.\n\nTOPSHOT - People look at a BYD Seagull car by Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD Auto at the Bangkok International Motor Show in Nonthaburi on March 27, 2024. (Photo by Lillian SUWANRUMPHA / AFP) (Photo by LILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA/AFP via Getty Images) Lillian Suwanrumpha | Afp | Getty Images\n\nAs the price war extends into the new year, Li Auto introduced cash subsidies of 15,000 yuan per purchase along with a three-year zero-interest financing scheme, according to a post last Thursday on its social media Weibo account. Nio also extended a similar three-year zero-interest loan plan for its EV buyers. The purchasing incentives came on top of Chinese authorities' push to extend the consumer goods trade-in program, which subsidizes consumers to trade in old cars or appliances and buy new ones at a discount. The government-subsidized trade-in program could further lower prices for both Model 3 and Model Y by up to 50,000 yuan, Tesla China said. \"Tesla has to discount aggressively to keep pace with the ongoing price war in the market,\" Russo noted. Despite dwindling market share, Tesla is unlikely to lose its ground completely in China, according to Joe McCabe, CEO and president of AutoForecast Solutions, who compared Tesla as \"the Apple of cars\" \u2014 an \"early adopter\" in the EV space with \"phenomenal\" technology. \"I don't think Tesla is at risk of not surviving,\" McCabe added, \"all [Elon Musk] has to do is drop the price by 5%, because he can, and that will help for little blips.\"\n\nHead-to-head race\n\nIn addition to lowering prices, Chinese electric carmakers have rolled out a slew of new models, many with fancy in-car features, such as projectors, embedded refrigerators and driver-assist systems. Meanwhile Tesla has been slow in adopting any of these features, with its product portfolio focused solely on fully electric vehicles, while its homegrown rivals have steered into plug-in hybrid cars and extended-range EV categories. These more traditional models appeal to buyers who are \"still worried about the leap to fully electric [cars],\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions said. \"Tesla has no plans for anything other than fully electric vehicles.\"",

The night before, he recorded a video message for his family informing them he had joined ISIS \u2013 whose flag he carried in the truck.\n\nThe same day, Matthew Livelsberger, an active-duty US Army Green Beret soldier, blew up a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Las Vegas hotel, injuring seven people. He was found dead inside the vehicle, a gun at his feet, having died by suicide shortly before the blast.\n\nThough both men had served in the military and deployed to Afghanistan, the Pentagon press secretary said there was no evidence of overlap between the two incidents, which are both still under investigation by the FBI. Yet both cases indicate common problems facing the US military today.\n\nLas Vegas Police Department/AAP\n\nI am an oral historian researching veterans\u2019 experiences with violence in the War on Terror, the US-led global military response to the September 11 2001 attacks. Through my research, I\u2019ve encountered significant connections between military service and violent extremism.\n\nMost military personnel go on to lead peaceful, well-adjusted lives. But US military members and veterans make up around 28% of the nations\u2019s mass shooters and only 7% of its general public. Being a military member or veteran is on par with other statistically significant backgrounds of mass shooters, such as being a perpetrator of domestic violence (27%).\n\nThe data on mass violence shows that a history of inflicting violence in one setting can normalise using it to express one\u2019s views and maintain social order.\n\nFestering resentments\n\nAfter attacks of mass violence, we commonly see widespread speculation that the perpetrator was mentally ill, particularly if they were a veteran. Yet most people who have a mental illness (including veterans) are nonviolent. In fact, experts of mass violence agree that mental illness tends to be incidental to attacks, rather than a motivating force behind them.\n\nHowever, perpetrators of mass violence do have something else in common. They hold certain groups, or society at large, responsible for their suffering.\n\nFarhad Khosrokhavar, a sociologist who pioneered research into radical groups in the 1970s and 1980s, argues individuals who become radicalised tend to feel humiliated in their own society and victimised by power structures around them. They also tend to feel connected to a group they perceive as under attack \u2013 either as a part of the group, or as a defender of it.\n\nThe manifestos and suicide notes of perpetrators of mass violence \u2013 from mass shooters to suicide bombers \u2013 show a deep feeling of entitlement to a particular status, and a corresponding sense of injustice at being deprived of these entitlements.\n\nShawn Fink/AAP\n\nVeterans are at heightened risk for these factors. They have often been told, for their entire careers, that their military skills are highly sought after and that they will easily transition into the civilian world, with support from the government should they need it.\n\nYet this is often not the case. Nearly half of War on Terror veterans struggled to readjust to civilian life and the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 bureaucracy is notoriously complex to navigate. Many veterans feel their value to society is diminished after their service.\n\nBy publicly celebrating veterans as heroes, militarised societies like the US can create an expectation of ongoing glory. These expectations are impossible to meet in reality. The rupture between expectation and reality can result in profound resentment, manifesting in conspiracies about hostility and abuse toward veterans.\n\nFBI Handout/AAP\n\nFollowing his discharge in 2020, Jabbar had reportedly experienced a turbulent few years of financial losses, a recent eviction, the sickness of his father and a third divorce that \u201cburned the shooter financially\u201d. Over the past few years, his former partners reported Jabbar was making threatening phone calls and acting erratically. One of his ex-wives limited his contact with their children.\n\nThe disparity between his service in the military \u2013 where he was publicly commended and automatically awarded a \u201cGlobal War on Terrorism\u201d medal for his service \u2013 and his struggles afterwards may have been a trigger for him to seek belonging elsewhere.\n\nFinding belonging in rigid hierarchies\n\nThe military has been a key recruiting ground for extremist groups for decades. Historian Kathleen Belew has shown that after the Vietnam War, white power groups rapidly recruited soldiers, veterans and law enforcement who were disillusioned with post-war society and sought belonging in familiar structures.\n\nThe military has a rigid hierarchy, with clear lines of command and a sense of purpose. It is more conservative than wider US society and promotes traditional ideas of masculinity. Many who stay in the military long-term find this structure reassuring. Jabbar, for instance, was \u201cgrateful for his time in the military\u201d because \u201cit gave him some discipline\u201d and \u201cgrounded him\u201d.\n\nMilitias and terrorist organisations have similarly rigid structures. Both usually envision an idealised hierarchy for society, which can appeal to individuals who feel the loss of structure and purpose on discharge.\n\nThese groups also offer someone or something to blame for the sense of injustice the individual is experiencing \u2013 whether that be migrants, the government, foreign policy or changing cultural mores. They provide a vehicle for expressing the individual\u2019s sense of injustice, tapping into conspiratorial thinking about how certain values are being undermined.\n\nResearchers of violent extremism argue that belief in conspiracy lies \u201cat the heart of nearly all extremist movements\u201d. These include white power movements, sovereign citizen movements and Islamic terrorism.\n\nSoldiers\u2019 attraction to extremist ideologies\n\nThe recruitment of soldiers and veterans into white power and sovereign citizen movements is a major, ongoing problem in the US: 244 (15%) of those charged for involvement in the January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol had ties to the military or law enforcement.\n\nSome studies estimate that current and former military make up \u201cat least 25% of militia rosters\u201d. And one of the deadliest attacks on US soil in history was by white supremacist and US army veteran Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people and injured hundreds more in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nAP\n\nExpressing allegiance to Islamic extremist groups is less common. But Jabbar is not the first US soldier or veteran to do so.\n\nNidal Hasan, a US Army psychiatrist, was radicalised after hearing his military patients describe actions in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s and being harassed by his military colleagues because of his faith.\n\nFacing a deployment to Afghanistan in 2009, Hasan killed 13 people in his attack at Fort Hood, Texas. His actions were motivated by anger and a sense of injustice, rather than piety.\n\nThough Jabbar was raised a practising Muslim after his father converted, his upbringing was moderate. He \u201ctook a step away from religion at some point in his life\u201d. Although he returned to faith in recent years, neighbours in his Muslim community reported they had \u201cnever seen him worshipping in our lives\u201d.\n\nInstead, Jabbar\u2019s interest in Islam appeared to be focused on condemning the excesses of a modern American society that he believed was leaving traditional ideals behind. For instance, he warned rap music was luring Muslims \u201cinto the things that God had made forbidden to us\u201d. His brother connected the attack on Bourbon Street to Jabbar\u2019s disapproval of \u201cdrinking and partying\u201d.\n\nJabbar\u2019s apparent initial plan to kill his family indicates a grievance toward the breakdown of his marriages and his inability to control his former partners and children. His allegiance to ISIS \u2013 a group that upholds an intensely patriarchal vision for structuring society \u2013 suggests he was attracted to an organisation that offered a rigid hierarchy and traditional worldview.\n\nUniformed Services University/AAP\n\nThe ISIS-led \u201cwar between the believers and the disbelievers\u201d mirrors the vision of veterans in white supremacist groups. Both groups see the world as made up of \u201cgood guys and bad guys\u201d, and fighting as \u201cthe only way to stand up to the bad guys\u201d. These reductive reasonings echo the US military\u2019s in the War on Terror.\n\nIt is not surprising a person embedded in the US military for decades would have absorbed this approach to the world \u2013 and adopted a parallel ideology upon leaving it.\n\nViolence as a solution\n\nThere are further parallels between the military, and militia and terror groups. Both view violence as an appropriate method for maintaining social order, and use it as the primary solution to social problems. Veterans have been conditioned to this worldview through military training.\n\nBoth attacks on New Years\u2019 Day reflected a mentality that violence is the solution to a corrupted world.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Livelsberger left two letters on his phone. In them, he declared his attack was a \u201cwake up call\u201d for a country being led by the \u201cweak\u201d who only serve to \u201cenrich themselves\u201d.\n\nThe authorities have framed the New Orleans incident as a terror attack and the Las Vegas Tesla explosion as a \u201ctragic case of suicide involving a heavily decorated combat veteran who was struggling with [post-traumatic stress disorder]\u201d.\n\nBut using violence to express a political position is the accepted definition of terrorism.\n\nLas Vegas Police Department/AAP\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nExtremist groups actively recruit for individuals with military experiences, eager to draw on their training and experience. The vulnerabilities of serving military personnel and veterans to extremist groups have led terrorism experts to repeatedly encourage the US departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to vet new recruits and security clearances more carefully. They\u2019re also encouraged to closely monitor the soon-to-be discharged personnel most vulnerable to recruitment.\n\nThese actions might remove a handful of potential extremists from the military. Yet veterans themselves offer other, more proactive approaches.\n\nSignificant numbers of War on Terror veterans have turned away from violence and joined the US veteran peace movement. These activists mourn the losses of war without glorifying any and all military action. They demand more substantial support for the veteran community and run programs to help veterans reconcile their military background with a peaceful future. They call for an end to unjust wars and oppose the growing militarism in US society.\n\nSuch anti-war demands can be taken up by the broader US population, and by American allies. More sober commemorations of war would lessen the expectation (and so resentment) of a venerated status, or valourised life. Public engagement on issues such as veteran support and reintegration programs would reduce the civil\u2013military divide, helping veterans adjust to civilian life.\n\nAnd insisting on public scrutiny of US military actions, holding them to higher moral standards, would demonstrate that no one\u2019s violence is above the law.",

Different kinematics to allow the suspension to do its job, softer anti-roll bars, tyres with bespoke compounds, acoustic glass all-round, even better layers of wheelarch sound-deadening. It\u2019s all in there.\n\nThe biggest news for the Model Y is undoubtedly the fact that the driving experience has improved immeasurably. Or measurably, if you\u2019ve got ears and a sense of touch. It\u2019s still a heavy car at around two tonnes, but it doesn\u2019t feel too hefty, at least in terms of EVs. The initial impression is one of quiet, compliance and sophistication that was missing from gen one. It\u2019s a car that feels more expensive.\n\nSo the car rides better, smothers bumps and holes with more authority. And the steering has been slowed slightly to make the car feel calmer from initial turn-in. It\u2019s not diving at a curve now, and that helps the car feel more mature. There\u2019s plenty of grip and it\u2019s reliable, repeatable and predictable \u2013 perfect for a family car. If only the brakes had a bit more feel and bite.\n\nIs it fun to drive then?\n\nIt\u2019s nice, but you won\u2019t go hooning for the sake of it. But really, who does that in what usually ends up as a family hack? Still, this AWD Launch car gets from 0-62mph in just 4.8 seconds, and has the usual EV \u2018in-gear\u2019 shove, even though it obviously only has one gear to push with.\n\nThe typical overtaking speeds you use are very healthy. That\u2019s 364lb ft of torque doing the work, but 507bhp for a family SUV isn\u2019t slouchy. So you can still be childish at the lights.\n\nBut it does mean that the one you probably want is either of the less aggressive Long Range versions, be that AWD or RWD. The latter is the rangiest of all, returning 387 miles in the lab. The Model Y really doesn\u2019t need a Performance line. This is a family car for the most part, and suits this more relaxed demeanour \u2013 and the extra range won\u2019t hurt that.",

Tesla shares surged more than 60% in 2024, with the lion\u2019s share of those gains coming after the November 5 election.\n\nTesla slumped after the Christmas break, tracking a broader market decline, and tumbled 6% on the first trading session of 2025 last Thursday when the company\u2019s fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries report came in weaker than expected. The stock jumped 8% the following day as the automaker said its sales in China hit a record last year, boosting confidence that a recovery could be underway in the world\u2019s largest car market where the company faces intense competition from domestic EV rivals.\n\nTesla shares finished Monday's session up 0.2% at $411.05. That's 16% below the stock's all-time high set on December 18.\n\n\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Tesla\u2019s weekly chart and point out important price levels to watch out for.\n\nStrong Uptrend Remains Intact\n\nDespite the recent pullback, Tesla shares have trended sharply higher since breaking out from an ascending triangle in early November following the U.S. election.\n\nMoreover, the relative strength index (RSI) still gives a reading near overbought levels, highlighting the stock\u2019s bullish price momentum.\n\nLet\u2019s apply technical analysis to predict how the current uptrend may unfold and identify important support levels where investors may look for buying opportunities.\n\nBars Pattern Analysis\n\nTo forecast a bullish price target and project how long the trending move may last before the stock consolidates, investors can use the bars pattern tool, which analyzes prior trends to predict future moves.\n\nWhen applying the analysis to Tesla\u2019s chart, we take the price bars that comprise the stock\u2019s strong trend from October 2019 to February 2020 and reposition them from the November breakout. This forecasts a target of around $745 and indicates the current move higher may last until early March if price history rhymes.\n\nWe selected this prior trending move because it commenced following a weekly breakout of nearly 30% from a prior ascending triangle, closely mimicking the stock\u2019s current price action.\n\nImportant Support Levels to Watch\n\nIf the stock continues to retreat from its recent highs, investors should initially keep an eye on the $370 level, a location on the chart where the shares may find support near several peaks positioned just below the stock\u2019s early November 2021 top.\n\nA close below this level could see the shares revisit lower support around $300. Investors may look to join the longer-term uptrend in this area near the psychological round number and a trendline that links peaks in August and July last year.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "content": "Tesla\u2019s Trajectory\n\nWhat do recent developments teach us about the world?\n\nRecent news about Tesla sheds light on the company\u2019s future, the global EV market, and crony capitalism, along with the state of American democracy. It may also say something about Elon Musk\u2019s role in the company. That\u2019s a lot of information wrapped up in Tesla\u2019s stock prices and related developments. Overall, the upshot is good news for the environment but bad news for democracy.\n\nThe first of these developments is that Tesla experienced its first drop in annual sales despite generous purchaser incentives. That\u2019s partly due to softness in the EV market in places like the U.S. But a global boom in EV sales is leaving Tesla behind.\n\nWhile Tesla\u2019s sales were going down, the Chinese company BYD increased its sales by 40%. BYD is now almost neck-and-neck with Tesla, and it will likely displace Tesla as the world\u2019s largest EV company in 2025. This is part of China\u2019s strategy of dominance in clean technology, a domain that offers both a lucrative export market and a way of increasing Chinese influence. Nothing the Trump Administration does is likely to budge Chinese policy or make its products less appealing to other countries. If anything, Trump seems interested in undermining U.S. clean tech manufacturing and ceding those markets to the Chinese.\n\nInterestingly, this news caused only a 3% decline in Tesla stock. This may be a sign, from what I\u2019ve read, that investors don\u2019t really view Tesla as a car company. Instead, they are hoping for a bonanza from AI and and the technology for self-driving cars, which Tesla can license to others. Still, while awaiting that hoped-for jackpot, the company does need to keep selling EVs, so there was a small price decline.\n\nThe 3% loss due to Tesla\u2019s languishing car business was dwarfed by its gains from Trump\u2019s victory. Tesla had an instant price surge of 14% immediately after the election. Prices continued to rise as Musk\u2019s influence over Trump became clear. Notably, Tesla\u2019s price surge outstripped comparable companies, so Tesla wasn\u2019t just benefitting from Trump\u2019s general pro-business policies.\n\nTesla stock has seen spectacular results during a period in which Musk appears to be paying no attention at all to the company\u2019s strategy or products. Investors also seem unfazed by the prospect that Musk will remain immersed in diversions from his business role as he devotes himself to running DOGE. From the perspective of Tesla shareholders, Musk may now be more valuable as a lobbyist and influence peddler than as an engineer or business leader.\n\nMusk\u2019s influence over Trump has also been a boon for him personally. Within a month of the election, Musk\u2019s wealth was up 69%. Every dollar in the nearly $300 million he spent to elect Trump paid off several hundred times. In fact, Musk now seems to be camping out at Mara Lago on a long-term basis to cozy up to Trump, concentrating his efforts in the area with the biggest economic payoff: politics.\n\nWhen researchers study crony capitalism, they look for signs that closeness to a ruler translates into financial gain. By that sign, the increase in Tesla\u2019s prices is a clear signal of crony capitalism. It seems clear that investors see Musk\u2019s cozy relationship with Trump as bankable profit. Otherwise, you\u2019d have expected Tesla to do about as well post-election as other tech companies rather than leaving them all in the shade.\n\nConservatives seem to have attained their dream in which there are no barriers to the political influence of corporations and the wealthy. Musk invested what was for him a trivial amount of money \u2013 a few hundred million dollars. In return, he has achieved a unique position of national dominance, with some Republicans referring to him as the \u201cprime minister.\u201d Of course, Musk\u2019s impact was also bolstered by his ability to buy a major social media company as his personal mouthpiece.\n\nEven if Musk turns out to have less sway than he seems to have at the moment, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019ll retain a lot of clout. Of course, Musk is far from being the only billionaire to find political involvement to be a good business strategy.\n\nFrom an environmental point of view, there may yet be a silver lining. Tesla remains invested in electric vehicles, battery power storage, and solar. For that reason, Musk\u2019s influence may limit what might otherwise be an all-out effort by Trump to destroy these newer energy technologies. Since Tesla\u2019s longterm future does not seem to lie in selling EVs, other firms will have to fill that role. It\u2019s also encouraging that, with or without the U.S., the global shift to electric vehicles and clean tech seems to be proceeding. Yet these environmental considerations may not be much of a consolation to those who care about democracy.",

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nI wrote an article a few days ago that I think has to be classified as \u201cventing.\u201d Once being an extremely influential site covering Tesla\u2019s positive, I feel reality has pushed us to cover more and more concerns at Tesla. Naturally, many Tesla fans (especially TSLA shareholders) have not been thrilled with this, and some even hate us \u2014 or, I should probably say, me \u2014 quite vehemently. I don\u2019t think ignoring reality is smart, even when reality stings, and the push from so many people to ignore or deny reality has irritated me. So, as some of these concerns are \u201cproven out\u201d more, it\u2019s hard to not let out some of that frustration with tribalism and reactionary hate. Also, I want to point out that there are many good people who hold a lot of shares of TSLA for good reasons and it can be very hard to make any changes in that world (stocks and money management). There\u2019s a difference between wishing for the best (or having a very optimistic mindset) and hating on people for pointing out inconvenient truths and disagreeing with you on some things.\n\nI was overwhelmed with appreciation from all of the support provided under that article \u2014 comments I just got to reading a few days later because of other obligations. Also, unsurprisingly, there were many, many superb comments under the article. I could \u2014 and maybe should \u2014 post many more of them in their own articles, but one popped out at me to repost, and then I decided to grab a few more under the similar theme to include here as well. The theme is in the headline: \u201cWhat is going wrong at Tesla?\u201d If you don\u2019t think anything is going wrong, that\u2019s fine, but I don\u2019t see how anyone can objectively have that opinion when Tesla sales dropped in 2024 and it was not that long ago that we were being told Tesla sales should increase ~50% a year (on average) through 2030. On to the comments:\n\nFrom disqus user \u201cCMG300\u201d (the comment that reminded me I could repost comments as new articles and just called for that to be done):\n\n\u201cI do not want Tesla to fail because they have a great product (that\u2019s been allowed to stagnate) and a ton of smart people working for them (albeit, a notable absence of brains sitting at the top).\n\n\u201cAs astute readers may have picked up, I feel that the biggest problem at Tesla is the CEO. He\u2019s gone from hero to villain in a very short time.\n\n\u201cI feel he\u2019s abandoned the mission (transitioning the world to sustainable energy). This is important because smart people are motivated to come work and give their best for Tesla BECAUSE it\u2019s a worthwhile cause. As they\u2019ve strayed, there\u2019s less and less reason for top talent to stay and we\u2019re seeing a continual brain bleed out of Tesla.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that Musk even shows up for work at Tesla, he\u2019s more interesting in throwing his weight around (firing the SC team, devoting all resources to autonomy), than to pushing the aging product lineup forward.\n\n\u201cMusk is also engaging in rampant \u2018resource tunnelling\u2019. That is to say, he\u2019s doing his best to strip out the valuable parts of Tesla and redirect them to areas that he personally controls. The most recent example is his conflict of interest in AI. With him putting off Tesla acquiring GPUs so that his private AI company could have them. Another example is with the Twitter takeover. He pushed as many of the engineers at Twitter to quit as he could, then backfilled the gap by pulling over a bunch of Tesla software engineers on a temporary basis. Oh, and he broke his on rule and suddenly began advertising on Twitter/X.\n\n\u201cOh, and how could I forget his politics. Not much needs to be said here other than he keeps attacking his natural customer base. As competition ramps up in the EV space, people will look elsewhere first because Musk is doing his best to make driving a Tesla a political statement.\u201d\n\nFrom Matthew Green:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty unhappy with Musk for his politics as well. But the biggest concern I have is the reduction in vehicle quality and features. My 2018 Model 3 has radar and sonar and turn signal stalks and a huge amount of power. The latest Model 3s have changed battery chemistry (fine, but not great) and removed the radar and sonar and the turn signal stalks. Trading \u2018up\u2019 to a new Model 3 means I will be effectively trading down to a lower-quality vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe big issue here is that I understood the Model 3 to be a compromise back in 2018: it was hard to build a high-quality car at that price range, so some things needed to go. No dashboard (instead a center console), a very basic interior, etc. I still loved the car because nothing else like it existed. But now it\u2019s six years later and some really nice stuff is showing up on the market. I expect Tesla to improve the car, not reduce its feature set. The long range is still nearly $50k before government rebates (and excluding FSD)! Why shouldn\u2019t I buy a car that\u2019s nicer than the one I have for that kind of money?\u201d\n\ncitizenjs writes:\n\n\u201cFor a few years, it\u2019s been pretty obvious that Tesla would have (and now has proven to have) an issue with producing only 1.5 mass market models (3+Y) that they were slow to refresh. There was always going to be a ceiling for sales, with the only question being how many.\n\n\u201cThe Toyota Corolla has spent decades as the top or near-top selling car in the world. But if Toyota announced one day that they would basically abandon all market segments except Corolla + a Corolla hatchback and make up the difference by just selling more Corollas, that would be universally (and correctly) regarded as an insane plan.\u201d\n\n*Rich writes:\n\n\u201cI feel that Tesla has peaked and is now in decline relative to their automotive products. The reason is similar to what has happened to many corporations in the past \u2014 \u2018yes-men\u2019 management, a \u2018group-think\u2019 board of directors and only a part-time CEO who uses an antiquated management style \u2014 authoritative rule by fear. (Much like his new boss.)\n\n\u201cReminds me of the Osbourne Computer company who had it all at the beginning of their industry, portable personal computers. Then sales of their minimal product line stalled and they went bust, while the CEO had been too busy with speaking engagements and TV appearances about promised future products that came too little and too late.\u201d\n\nMadDash writes:\n\n\u201cI think that far too much emphasis is placed on the Robotaxi and FSD and not enough on increasing the model range. Tesla needs a small, cheaper car. There are a very limited number of buyers for a polarizing vehicle like the Cybertruck, and this vehicle has no future in Europe. Maybe Australia? Maybe China? I think Tesla is a great company, and I don\u2019t care about Musks politics \u2013 I buy the product. If politics was such a major component in people\u2019s buying strategy then nobody would buy a VW. VW spent decades lying to and deceiving its customers, and had factories in China using forced Labour (Uyghur people). I only see the Robots being suitable for industrial applications in the near future, and I think the Robots suffer the same problem as FSD \u2013 the big breakthrough is always just around the corner.\u201d\n\nTo which, Username Taycan responded:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been following Tesla for any length of time you might have noticed that the optimism is always due to some project which is always just over the horizon, but never actually appears over it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the factory that built the factory (atleast twice), we\u2019ve had Tesla\u2019s unsurpassable battery tech, their was the SC moat, the flying Roadster, allegedly a production ready Semi then Tesla is worthless without FSD, oooh we are an energy company now, no, no we are a robotics company \u2026 and an AI company\u2026\n\n\u201cSomething as simple as spending an afternoon sitting down with designers and sketching out a model 3 based pick up or a van, or \u2026 and extracting more value from the work they\u2019ve already done would mark them out as what they are, a small car manufacturer, and would you do that if a significant portion of your wealth was leveraged against the Tesla share price?\u201d\n\nAs always, our comments section is a gold mine. The comments are frequently better than the article itself. Thank you to all of you commenters mentioned above, and everyone else, for chiming in!",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nI hate this Tesla, and I want my Camry back.\n\nThat's what Mariah (@this.is.not_mariah) said right after she bought a used Tesla Model 3. She traded in her Toyota Camry and purchased the Tesla on the advice of other Tesla owners and from the Toyota dealer.\n\nImagine the thrill of anticipating a Tesla Model 3, fueled by the glowing reviews of its owners. The promise of significant fuel savings and the allure of the 'best car they've ever owned' echo in your mind.\n\nYou find a Tesla Model 3, which you think is beautiful, at the Toyota dealer where you purchased your Camry. You like your Camry, but buying a Tesla is the only thing you can think about.\n\nThe Toyota dealer, sensing the slow sales of electric vehicles, is eager to offload the Tesla Model 3. They see an opportunity to profit from your desirable Toyota Camry, and the deal seems too good to pass up.\n\nYou make what appears to be a great deal, and the dealer takes your Camry, which is in good shape, in on trade. You drive away in your new shiny Tesla Model 3, and life couldn't be better. And then you realize you made a big mistake.\n\nHere is Mariah's sad story.\n\nMariah says,\" So, yeah. I just posted a video,\" she says as she begins to cry, \"oh, my gosh, I can't even speak right now,\" she says, crying. \"Anyway, I know I just told everyone how good this car is. I said, I love, I love the Tesla.\"\n\n\"But I hate this Tesla. I want my Camry back. I miss my Camry. I don't even have anywhere to put my freaking car phone in this car.\"\n\n\"This car sucks. If you are talking about how great your Tesla is, I love my Tesla, you are a liar. This car sucks, it sucks.\"\n\nThe Toyota dealer likely wanted to get the slow-selling Tesla Model 3 off its lot and told Mariah how much she would save on gas and what a great deal she was getting.\n\nMariah says, \"But honestly, I think Toyota screwed me over. Because I don't drive 40 miles to my job, I drive 20 miles. Tell me how I wasted 40 freaking miles. How often I have to charge it is the same as putting gas in my Camry.\"\n\nMariah's plea for someone to buy her Tesla is laced with desperation. She's in a situation she never expected, and the urgency in her voice is noticable.\n\n\"So, does anyone want to buy a Tesla? Please, please buy this car from me.\"\n\nMariah was likely experiencing what's known as 'range anxiety.' This is when an EV owner becomes worried about running out of battery power before reaching their destination. She looked at the EV's gauge and saw the miles dropping fast as she drove to and from work.\n\n\"Who convinced me that buying a Tesla is better than a Camry? Oh, because you are wrong. I was gaslighting myself and making myself believe it was the best car ever because I really wanted it. Because it's so pretty.\"\n\n\"But it's so bad. Like, literally, I hate this car. But yeah, who really genuinely likes their Tesla? Does anyone want to buy a Tesla? Please, please buy this car from me,\" she pleads.\n\nTwo days later, Mariah still doesn't like her new Tesla.\n\nShe says, \"Like please, anyone, does anyone want to buy my freaking Tesla? I've had this car for two days and I hate this car. I'm going back to where I got it today because I don't know, I don't know about my battery.\"\n\n\"My miles (battery life) go so fast. I live 20 miles from work, so how do I use 40 miles from my battery? How did it take 40 miles from my battery? I don't understand what's going on.\"\n\n\"If you are posting that you like Teslas, are you lying? Because what is going on?\"\n\nMariah dislikes the Tesla Model 3 so much that she returns to the dealer to get her Toyota Camry back.\n\n\"I'm going back to where I got it today. I went to see what I could do about it. Because I want my old car back, I want my freaking Camry back. I don't know if there is anything I can do about it.\"\n\n\"I went to talk to the used car manager because I bought it used. But the used car manager is off today. Hopefully, I can get my old car back.\"\n\nUpdate after four days.\n\nMariah is back at the Toyota dealer for the fourth day in a row.\n\nShe says, \"I'm back at the Toyota dealer, and I'm trying to get my old car back, and I'm losing so much, so much money, on what I just did, but I'm willing to do it because I feel they lied to me about the Tesla.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to get my old Camry back, but they said they need to do an inspection on it, and I'm not waiting for that. I'll probably have to get a new car now.\"\n\nThe Toyota dealer doesn't want to sell Mariah her old Camry because they likely gave her very little for her car to make the deal for the Tesla. So they tell her it's already in the shop for an \"inspection.\" They can make thousands selling it to someone else after reconditioning the Camry.\n\nThey also see that she'll likely buy a new 2025 Camry with a little persuasion and they can make even more on the deal.\n\nMariah signs the paperwork for a new Camry and gets the deal done.\n\nMariah says, \"Ok, this is my new car, a 2025 Toyota Camry SE. This car is so much better than the Tesla. Don't ever buy a Tesla in your life.\"\n\nBack home, she says, \"Obviously, I was a little screwed up with money because it just happens. It happened. It's a life lesson we live and learn. Now I have a Camry again. It's not the same Camry I had before. It doesn't have a sunroof like my old Camry, but I love it.\"\n\n\"I needed to get out of the Tesla immediately, and I'm so happy about my new Camry. That Tesla was nothing but stress and anxiety.\"\n\nConclusion.\n\nThe comments to Mariah were brutal, and it's easy to say that she made a bad decision by trading in her Camry and buying the Tesla Model 3. What can buyers learn from Mariah's experience?\n\nIt reveals that range anxiety is real. A new owner can be left with questions unless someone explains how an electric vehicle operates. She wasn't told that charging a Tesla's battery at a public station can be expensive.\n\nAlso, we don't know how many miles were on the Tesla Model 3, but it could have had high mileage, and the battery was close to being replaced. That's why the battery drained so quickly.\n\nThe Toyota dealer saw Mariah coming and the opportunity to unload the high-mileage Tesla and, at the same time, get a Toyota Camry they could make a lot of money on\u2014a \"double score,\" as it's called in the car selling business.\n\nThey then sold Mariah a new Camry and made even more from her mistake. She was taken to the cleaners.\n\nWhat should Mariah done differently?\n\nShe should have taken an experienced person like a friend, family member, or an auto broker who can give her sound advice about buying a used Tesla. They could have informed her to walk away because it was not a good deal.\n\nEdmunds give this advice:\n\n\"The vast majority of car dealers have no written policies that allow you to rescind the purchase agreement you've signed. This means your only recourse is to plead your case. You can say that you have discovered you don't like the car or that it will stretch your budget and put you in dire financial straits.\"\n\n\"If you have buyer's remorse, you can call the salesperson first as a courtesy, but be prepared to contact someone higher up in dealership management, such as the sales manager, general manager or owner. It's solely at the dealer's discretion whether to undo the purchase. Make your call on a business day as opposed to a weekend.\"\n\nWhat do you think Mariah should have done?

            "content": "Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill briefs the media about the Tesla Cybertruck explosion Wednesday in front of the entrance to Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nYour car is spying on you.\n\nThat is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become more like computers on wheels.\n\nIs your car company violating your privacy rights?\n\n\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d\n\nMany of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cellphone syncing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.\n\nWithin hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software \u2014 and to great acclaim.\n\n\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome privacy experts were less enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double-edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d\n\nGeneral Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.\n\nCars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk.

On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private.\n\n\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \u201cYour information is kept private and secure.\u201d\n\nAuto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight said he doesn\u2019t think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They\u2019re connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d\n\nTensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames.

            "content": "Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) stock rose by 70% during 2024, catapulting the company to a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. But the stock actually spent most of the year trading in the red -- it didn't gather momentum until Donald Trump won the presidential election in November.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk put his cash and influence behind the Trump campaign, and investors are speculating the company will benefit from lighter regulations under the incoming administration, which might help fast-track its artificial intelligence-powered full self-driving (FSD) technology.\n\nFSD has the potential to transform Tesla's economics, but the company faces a serious challenge in the shorter term. Its electric vehicle (EV) sales shrank in 2024, the first annual decline since Tesla launched the Model S in 2011.\n\nThat's a problem because Tesla stock is unquestionably expensive right now, and its current valuation is very difficult to justify while its EV business is shrinking. Here's why I think the stock will decline in 2025 and drop out of the trillion-dollar club.\n\nMusk says EV deliveries will grow in 2025, but how?\n\nLast week (on Jan. 2), Tesla reported its production and delivery numbers for the fourth and final quarter of 2024. It delivered 495,570 electric vehicles to customers, which was below Wall Street's consensus forecast of 504,770. It took the company's total deliveries for the year to 1.79 million, down 1.1% from 2023.\n\nEven though Tesla stock soared last year because of the potential of its FSD technology, EV sales still account for 79% of the company's revenue. Therefore, if this part of its business isn't performing, it becomes hard to justify further upside in its stock price (more on that later).\n\nMusk recently told investors EV deliveries could grow by 20% to 30% in 2025, but at the same time, he said he was canceling plans to produce a new low-cost model. Conflicting media reports emerged over the last few weeks that suggest Tesla is now planning to launch an affordable EV called the Model Q sometime this year, alongside a cheaper variant of its popular Model Y.\n\nTesla might struggle to grow its sales without selling entry-level EVs, because competition is surging from low-cost manufacturers in countries like China. BYD, for example, sells an EV called the Seagull for less than $10,000 in China, and it's likely to enter Europe during 2025. China and Europe are critical markets for Tesla, and since its cheapest EV is currently priced at around $30,000, it simply can't compete.\n\nIt's all about full self-driving, but meaningful revenue could be years away\n\nThe reason Musk wanted to scrap plans for a low-cost EV is because he wants Tesla to focus on autonomous EVs instead, like its new Cybercab robotaxi. It was unveiled in October last year, and it will enter mass production sometime in 2026.\n\nThe Cybercab won't come with pedals or even a steering wheel, because it will run entirely on Tesla's FSD software. Owners of Tesla's passenger EVs can already use FSD in beta mode, but the company hopes it will be approved for full unsupervised use in California and Texas this year. That's why having a friendly regulatory regime in the U.S. could be so valuable to Tesla.\n\nTesla intends to build its own ride-hailing network so the Cybercab can earn revenue around the clock by hauling passengers -- think Uber except without human drivers. Plus, consumers will be able to buy the Cybercab for personal use, or they can buy a fleet of them to run an autonomous ride-hailing service of their own using Tesla's network.\n\nSimply put, full self-driving technology will create several new ways for Tesla to earn revenue. Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management estimates the company will generate $1.2 trillion in annual revenue by 2029, with FSD and the Cybercab accounting for 63% of that total. Another top Wall Street analyst, Dan Ives, also predicts FSD will become a $1 trillion opportunity over time.\n\nTesla's valuation is sky-high, which poses a big risk to investors\n\nThe primary reason Tesla stock could decline this year is because of its lofty valuation, which isn't justifiable based on the current state of its business.\n\nThe company delivered $3.65 in earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 104. It's significantly more expensive than every other tech stock with a valuation of $1 trillion or more -- except for Broadcom, which isn't a consistently profitable company (so its P/E ratio is skewed):\n\nRemember, Tesla's EV deliveries declined in 2024, and a shrinking business normally warrants a lower P/E ratio, not a higher one. And even if investors believe in products like FSD and the robotaxi, the Cybercab isn't scheduled for mass production until 2026.\n\nThat means investors are paying a huge premium for Tesla stock in the hope of seeing meaningful FSD revenue that might not come for another two years. In reality, 2025 will probably be similar to 2024, meaning the majority of Tesla's financial results will hinge on EV sales.\n\nTesla's market capitalization is currently $1.2 trillion, so it only has to fall by 16% to drop out of the trillion-dollar club. I think an even steeper decline might be possible this year. The stock would have to fall by 47% just for its P/E ratio to trade in line with Nvidia's P/E ratio, for example, which would result in a market cap of around $630 billion.",

            "content": "Video footage and other data collected by Tesla helped law enforcement quickly piece together how a Cybertruck came to explode outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year\u2019s Day. The trove of digital evidence also served as a high-profile demonstration of how much data modern cars collect about their drivers and those around them.\n\nData privacy experts say the investigation \u2014 which has determined that the driver, active-duty U.S. Army soldier Matthew Livelsberger, died by suicide before the blast \u2014 highlights how car companies vacuum up reams of data that can clear up mysteries but also be stolen or given to third parties without drivers\u2019 knowledge. There are few regulations controlling how and when law enforcement authorities can access data in cars, and drivers are often unaware of the vast digital trail they leave behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are panopticons on wheels,\u201d said Albert Fox Cahn, who founded the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, an advocacy group that argues the volume and precision of data collected can pose civil liberties concerns for people in sensitive situations, like attending protests or going to abortion clinics.\n\nFederal and state officials have begun to scrutinize companies\u2019 use of car data as evidence has emerged of its misuse. There have been reports that abusive spouses tracked partners\u2019 locations, and that insurers raised rates based on driving behavior data shared by car companies. There have also been cases in which local police departments sought video from Tesla cars that may have recorded a crime, or obtained warrants to tow vehicles to secure such footage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something deeply ironic that this emblem of personal autonomy, the idea of a car on the open road, might be one of the most heavily surveilled places in many of our lives,\u201d Cahn said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 75 percent of car brands said they can share or sell drivers\u2019 data, according to a 2023 Mozilla Foundation report assessing 25 international brands\u2019 data privacy policies. More than half said they can share information at the request of law enforcement or the government. Only two, Renault and Dacia \u2014 neither of which is marketed in the United States \u2014 said drivers have the right to have personal data deleted, the report said.\n\nIndustry groups say data collection protects drivers and allows automakers to identify potential defects. Sensitive information can\u2019t be used for marketing or shared without consent, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a 2023 memo.\n\n\u201cYes, your vehicle is generating and transmitting certain safety data. That\u2019s by design,\u201d the memo said. \u201cNo, your car isn\u2019t spying on you.\u201d\n\nMany cars have access to location data and camera footage if they\u2019re equipped with features such as parking assistance and navigational systems. But Tesla likely has access to far more data thanks to its suite of cameras used in its driver assistance features, its onboard computers and its nationwide charging network.\n\nTesla chief executive Elon Musk directly assisted investigators in the New Year\u2019s Day Cybertruck explosion and provided charging-station footage tracking Livelsberger as he drove from Colorado to Las Vegas, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said. Musk offered investigators \u201cquite a bit of additional information\u201d on the truck and sent a team to Las Vegas to help investigators extract data and video from the charred remains of the truck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcMahill also said investigators were looking for vehicles that may have been at the charging stations at the same time as Livelsberger, \u201cbecause their vehicles would have also had cameras that would have taped anybody in and around them.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the team of investigators in Las Vegas \u2014 which includes the local sheriff and FBI \u2014 showed video footage of Livelsberger, recorded from multiple different angles, at a Tesla charging station in Arizona.\n\nLas Vegas Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren did not specify how that exact footage was obtained, but said the Tesla team sent by Musk helped investigators recover a thumb drive that \u201crecords other types of data that includes video by the Tesla.\u201d The team also helped investigators retrieve data from the vehicle that determined it was not in self-driving mode at any point during Livelsberger\u2019s journey to Las Vegas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Musk\u2019s swift assistance was applauded by authorities, his highly publicized actions also raised complicated emotions for people like Justin Demaree, a Cybertruck owner and Tesla enthusiast, who runs a popular YouTube channel called Bearded Tesla Guy.\n\nDemaree said while he appreciates Musk\u2019s willingness to help investigators \u2014 especially in a case the FBI was initially probing as a potential act of terrorism \u2014 the incident showcased just how much personal information Tesla has at its fingertips about its drivers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d said Demaree, 36, as he drove his Cybertruck in \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d mode from Orlando to Las Vegas to attend CES, the prominent annual tech conference. \u201cWe want our privacy and we don\u2019t want our data shared \u2026 but you want to help in a situation where terrorism could be a factor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla owner Adam Gershowitz, a law professor at William and Mary who has studied police searches of digital data, said he is willing to sacrifice a level of privacy for the convenience of the car\u2019s navigational systems, infotainment centers and backup cameras at their disposal.\n\n\u201cThe thing that makes it so dangerous from a privacy perspective is the same thing that makes it a terrific automobile,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Gershowitz said, it makes him uneasy to consider how quick Musk was to share the information that immediately dispelled speculation that the explosion was caused by an issue with the vehicle itself. As investigators pieced together the case on New Year\u2019s Day, Musk has posted developments on social media \u2014 in one case appearing to beat law enforcement to confirm the explosion was caused by fireworks and a bomb. He cited the vehicle\u2019s telemetry, the technology that automatically gathers and relays data.\n\nCarter Gibson, a 34-year-old tech worker in San Francisco who owns a Rivian \u2014 an electric vehicle also chock full of sophisticated technology and cameras \u2014 said he doesn\u2019t mind if the data is used to enhance public safety or track those who have caused harm and done something illegal. While the amount of available information opens up new problems around profiling and data sharing, he said, he believes it could be a net positive for society \u2014 if done correctly.\n\nGibson, a Rivian enthusiast who runs a subreddit of more than 100,000 users about the car, said Musk\u2019s willingness to share information so openly was \u201ccreepy\u201d and has shaken his trust in how Tesla deals with customer data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI, like most people, am not reading the privacy policy in detail, everyone just hits \u2018agree,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is where brand perception really starts to play a role in how safe people feel with the car.\u201d\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe cameras on Teslas and autonomous vehicles can record what is happening around them \u2014 a level of \u201cpassive surveillance\u201d that is invaluable to police, said Matthew Wansley, a professor at Cardozo School of Law who focuses on the intersection of technology and law.\n\nIf law enforcement needs information about what happened outside a club, for example, they might say, \u201cLet\u2019s just call Waymo,\u201d he said, to see whether one of the robotaxis now rolling in San Francisco and other cities was driving by.\n\nWaymo and the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond such passive collection of data, drivers unwittingly give away information about themselves when they rent a car, data privacy advocates say.\n\nRental companies typically opt in to tracking services and other functions that vehicle owners could turn off, said Eva Galperin, cybersecurity director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nIf the car title is in its name, the rental company has control over location history, biometrics and any other personal information a renter leaves behind, said Andrea Amico, who founded a company called Privacy4Cars that works to protect consumers from vehicle data collection.\n\n\u201cYou have zero rights,\u201d Amico said.\n\nThe Cybertruck in the Las Vegas case was rented through Turo, which operates like an Airbnb for vehicles. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but its terms of service say the rented cars may collect nonpersonal information like acceleration, location and direction. Users authorize the use or disclosure of such data unless prohibited by law, the policy says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe American Car Rental Association did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmico got the idea for Privacy4Cars while running a used car inspection company. One day, he saw the navigation system in one of the cars still had directions to the previous owner\u2019s home.",

            "content": "Just a few days into 2025, electric vehicles are already having a roller coaster ride of a year. Last week, Tesla kicked off the bumpy trip when it reported that, for the first time, the reigning champion of American EVs had delivered fewer cars globally than the year previous. The automaker delivered 1.789 million vehicles in 2024, a 1.1 percent dip compared to the 1.808 million delivered in 2023. Tesla share prices sank 8 percent on the news.\n\nThen, on Friday, more annual sales numbers appeared, and the EV story got rosy around the edges. General Motors said it sold 50 percent more electrics than last year, with its Chevrolet Equinox EV SUV leading the charge. Honda\u2019s Prologue EV, which went on sale halfway through the year, shifted 33,000 units\u2014something of a coup for the Japanese automaker\u2019s US electric debut. Even Ford, which said last year that it would back away from its plan to scale up all-electric sales in favor of a mix of EVs, hybrids, and gas cars, sold more than 50,000 Mustang Mach-Es.\n\nGlobal EV sales numbers likely won\u2019t be fully collated till next month, but analysts say that in the US, electric vehicles seem to be on track for a pretty reasonable 8 percent of all car sales in 2024.\n\nSo maybe \u201croller coaster\u201d is a bit dramatic. By many measures, the EV sales story\u2014and even the Tesla subplot\u2014is mostly playing out the way everyone in the industry thought it would. In the first part of the decade, \u201cpeople thought there would be this crazy hockey-stick growth for EVs,\u201d says Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t realistic. The way we\u2019re seeing the market evolve is more realistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is continuing to move forward slowly,\u201d says Corey Cantor, a senior associate who covers electric vehicles at BloombergNEF, of electric cars and their manufacturers.\n\nTepid Optimism\n\nNo one said the transition to electric vehicles was going to be easy. Electrifying \u201chas been one of the largest changes that the auto industry has ever seen\u2014and the auto industry doesn\u2019t change overnight,\u201d says Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, the automotive website.\n\nManufacturing a whole new powertrain\u2014and sourcing the battery minerals to energize it\u2014is just one half of the challenge. Changing people\u2019s buying habits, especially for one of the most expensive purchases they\u2019ll make in their lives, will be the other half. Given those constraints, \u201cit\u2019s remarkable that we\u2019ve seen so much change,\u201d says Drury.\n\nEven Tesla\u2019s bump in the road might be seen as evidence that CEO Elon Musk\u2019s automaker is doing something right. In 2006, Musk published his \u201cMaster Plan\u201d that laid out Tesla\u2019s \u201coverarching purpose\u201d: \u201cto help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution.\u201d Tesla\u2019s annual growth challenges stem, in part, from the fact that the gambit worked, and there is now much more global competition in the EV space. Tesla officially lost its title as the world\u2019s top EV maker last year to China\u2019s BYD, which produced about 4,500 more electrics last year. (Tesla still sold more EVs, with a serious assist from Chinese buyers, who bought 8.8 percent more of the automaker\u2019s EVs last year than in 2023.)\n\nWhether the global vehicle electrification project will stay on track comes down, in part, to policy. In the US, EV sales leapt in the last quarter of the year. This is perhaps because consumers heard about the new Trump administration\u2019s plans to do away with electric vehicle incentives and took experts\u2019 advice to buy new cars when they could still get subsidies. What will happen in 2025 if those purchase incentives go away?\n\nEven with more sales numbers to come in, 2024\u2019s figures seem to show an industry chugging along as it should. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy transition,\u201d says Brinley, the analyst, of the shift to electric vehicles. But she\u2019s confident: \u201cWe are going to see more adoption,\u201d she says.",

            "content": "In fact, he could make it worse.\n\nAlmost no other stock has done better since the presidential election than Tesla (TSLA 3.86%).\n\nFrom Nov. 5 to the end of the year, shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker jumped 61% and had nearly doubled before the Federal Reserve scaled back its forecast for interest rate cuts in 2025.\n\nIt's not a surprise that Tesla stock soared in the aftermath of the election. CEO Elon Musk bet big on President-elect Trump, campaigning on stage with him and pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into his campaign, and investors expect that contribution and access to pay off once Trump becomes president.\n\nMusk has been camping out at Mar-a-Lago, aiming to bend the president-elect's ear, and the market is hopeful that the Trump administration could streamline rules around autonomous vehicles (AVs) that will make it easier for Tesla to deploy its new Cybercab and lead the transition to AVs.\n\nHowever, Tesla is facing a more pressing issue, and it's not one that any Trump policy can meaningfully change. Demand for its vehicles appears to be plateauing, and the latest quarterly delivery report offered more evidence of sales headwinds.\n\nTesla deliveries miss the mark\n\nTesla's latest business update casts a harsh light on the company's biggest challenge right now. The EV leader reported fourth-quarter deliveries that were weaker than expected, delivering 495,600 vehicles in the quarter, which was up 2.3% from a year ago but below the consensus estimate at 510,000. The stock fell 6% on the news.\n\nFor the full year, Tesla's vehicle deliveries fell for the first time, declining from 1.81 million to 1.79 million. That slump comes even as the company added the Cybertruck to its lineup at the end of 2023.\n\nDoes Tesla have a demand problem?\n\nWhile investor attention has been focused on the election and autonomy, Tesla's core business seems to be running into a demand problem.\n\nThe electric vehicle industry has faced a number of challenges this year as enthusiasm among buyers seems to be waning now that early adopters have already purchased EVs. Sales of hybrids have climbed in their place, and even Musk has complained about the impact of elevated interest rates on vehicle sales, though that is a problem across the auto industry rather than one unique to EVs. Competition from cheaper alternatives from China and elsewhere has also made the EV market more competitive.\n\nAmong other complaints is that Tesla hasn't updated existing vehicle models, and the demand challenges are also evidenced by falling prices for used Teslas. While that doesn't show up directly in the company's financials, lower prices for used Teslas could convince some buyers to purchase a used rather than a new Tesla.\n\nWhy it could get worse under Trump\n\nThe incoming Trump administration is likely to introduce a lot of uncertainty into the stock market and for Tesla stock. While new regulatory policy could give Tesla's autonomy hopes a boost, Trump has also said he intends to get rid of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which will make Teslas more expensive in the U.S.\n\nWhat it means for Tesla investors\n\nOne quarter's delivery numbers aren't enough to indicate that demand is a long-term challenge for Tesla, but it's a clear risk for the stock, especially with its valuation looking inflated after the post-election rally.\n\nMusk has forecast 20% to 30% growth in deliveries for 2025, which would indicate that the current slowdown is temporary, but investors should see that number as a test for its demand rather than a guarantee of growth. Its growth could be helped by the expected launch of the budget-priced Model Q, which is believed to be priced under $30,000.\n\nWith Q4 deliveries weak, evidence of demand challenges, cuts to EV credits coming, and a lofty valuation, Tesla faces a number of headwinds heading into 2025.\n\nAt this point, its bet on autonomy gives the stock upside potential over the long term, but if the Q4 update is a sign, 2025 could be a rocky year for the stock. At this point, it's not a full-on red flag for investors, but the underwhelming demand is certainly an issue to monitor.\n\nThe Q4 financial results will be available at the end of the month. In particular, investors should watch whether weak deliveries led to pricing pressure in the quarter. If Tesla can't demonstrate demand growth, the stock is likely to languish until it accomplishes a true breakthrough in autonomy.",

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Your car is spying on you.\n\nThat is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels.\n\nIs your car company violating your privacy rights?\n\n\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d\n\nMany of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing.\n\nThe data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.\n\nWithin hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.\n\n\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c\n\nSome privacy experts were less enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d\n\nGeneral Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.\n\nCars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers\u2019 sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity.\n\nTesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private.\n\n\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \u201cYour information is kept private and secure.\u201d\n\nAuto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn\u2019t think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They\u2019re connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d\n\nTensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack.\n\nShortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident.\n\n\u201cThe fire is out,\u201d the police announced on the social media platform X, one of Musk\u2019s other companies. \u201cPlease avoid the area.\u201d\n\nTesla shortly thereafter swung into action.\n\n\u201cThe whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything.\u201d\n\nOver the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger\u2019s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\nThere are no federal laws regulating car data similar to those that restrict information collection and sharing by banks and health care providers. And state laws are a grab-bag of various rules, mostly focused on data privacy in general.\n\nDaniels, the privacy consultant, thinks that new national laws are needed because rules have not kept up with technology.\n\n\u201cI think law enforcement should have access to data that can help them solve things quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have a right to privacy.\u201d",

The only major market where it experienced growth last year was China, even though the trend among Chinese EV buyers was to move away from foreign brands and buy locally made models instead.\n\nReuters notes that Tesla\u2019s 2024 sales in the People\u2019s Republic went up 8.8% compared to 2023, rising to 657,000 units delivered. With 36.7% of its global deliveries, China is Tesla\u2019s second-largest market after the United States, where sales fell compared to 2023, when nearly 675,000 vehicles were delivered. U.S. sales didn\u2019t drop enough to put China in the number-one spot, but the difference was likely much lower than in 2023.\n\n2024 is also the year when China asserted its dominance as the world\u2019s biggest EV player, with a slew of very talented domestic models that also saw success outside the local market. BYD, in particular, had an excellent year and delivered 4.25 million passenger vehicles. It also narrowed the gap with Tesla, delivering 1.76 million EVs (an increase of 12.1% over 2023) to Tesla\u2019s 1.8 million (a decrease of 1.1% over 2023).\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nLower subsidies in Europe combined with an influx of talented Chinese and Korean EVs saw Tesla\u2019s sales on the continent fall by 13.7% in the first 11 months of 2024. We don\u2019t have any exact end-of-year figures from Europe, but it\u2019s likely well below 2023, when Tesla delivered around 364,000 vehicles, marking a 57% increase over 2022.\n\nIncreased competition played a big part in why Tesla stopped seeing growth this year. On home ground in the U.S., General Motors rose to become the country\u2019s second-best-selling EV manufacturer thanks to an impressive sales performance, especially in the latter part of the year\u2014GM sold almost 44,000 EVs from October through December, marking a 125% increase over Q3 2023. It amounted to 114,000 EVs sold in the U.S. in 2024.\n\nTesla was probably also banking on the Cybertruck to sell better in North America, which it seemed to be doing in its first months of sale, but then things started looking less rosy for the stainless steel electric pickup as the year drew on. Toward the end of 2024, it became apparent that Cybertrucks weren't as popular as it initially appeared, and even used examples weren't finding buyers.\n\nIf the trend continues, China could overtake the U.S. as its main market this year. Analyst John Zeng, who is the head of Chinese market forecasts at GlobalData, called China \u201cthe only major market seeing robust growth versus a slowdown or even slide in other markets.\u201d The fact is a more significant proportion of Chinese car buyers are willing to go electric, while in the U.S., buyers are going back to non-plug-in hybrids, which saw a big resurgence in 2024.\n\nWhat could reverse the trend for Tesla would be the release of the highly anticipated affordable model, which is rumored to arrive sometime around the middle of the year and cost less than $30,000 with the $7,500 federal tax credit included. There is an acute lack of affordable EVs in the U.S., which partly explains why EVs are so much more popular in China, where you can get a fully-fledged electric car like the BYD Dolphin for less than $14,000\u2014it costs twice that outside China.\n\nChinese automakers have announced their strong interest in entering the U.S. market and selling vehicles here, but they were forced to put their plans on hold after a 100% import tariff was imposed. Had this tariff not been put in place, there would have been several Chinese automakers already present and selling cars in the U.S., further diminishing Tesla\u2019s EV market share, which fell to 48% in 2024 even without them here.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Lukewarm consumer demand is weighing on sales of electric cars, an issue that could be exacerbated by Trump\u2019s push to rein in EV incentives.\n\nTesla\u2019s shares sank after the results, falling as much as 7.6% in New York. The stock rose 63% in 2024.\n\nFor the quarter ended Dec. 31, it delivered 495,570 vehicles, missing the 512,277 analysts had projected. It needed to sell nearly 515,000 vehicles in the quarter to meet its goal for \u201cslight\u201d growth in the full year.\n\nIn a note to clients, Barclay\u2019s analyst Dan Levy wrote that the data offered \u201cno change to narrative, but reinforces challenge for \u201925 growth on existing models, reliance on still unknown Model 2.5.\u201d\n\nTesla faced a series of setbacks in 2024, including an arson attack at its Berlin factory, shipping diversions and an industry-wide slowdown in EV sales. And it has told investors that demand for its all-electrics is between two major growth waves. In April, the Austin-based automaker cut more than 10% of its workforce, including sales staff.\n\nEven so, Tesla said as recently as October that it expected to achieve modest growth in its deliveries for all of 2024. The EV maker had pushed a myriad of deals related to financing, charging and leases to end-of-year buyers.\n\n2025 Projection\n\nMusk told investors on Tesla\u2019s latest earnings call that he sees 20% to 30% growth this year, fueled in part by a more affordable vehicle expected to be unveiled in the first half and on the company\u2019s autonomous technology. The EV maker has said little about what that new vehicle will look like or what its price will be.\n\nThere is already some doubt over the company\u2019s ability to achieve Musk\u2019s 2025 growth objective, particularly if EV tax credits are rolled back under Trump. The president-elect has been critical of Joe Biden-era EV policies and the EV tax credit, which Musk claimed in July would hurt Tesla in the near term \u2014 but hurt Tesla\u2019s competitors more.",

            "content": "\u00d7 Expand Phelan M. Ebenhack via AP On its current track, Tesla will be an also-ran in the global EV market within a decade.\n\nThe vast majority of Elon Musk\u2019s wealth consists of his large stake in the EV manufacturer Tesla. When Tesla\u2019s stock price nearly doubled following the election, his wealth, at least on paper, soared to over $400 billion.\n\nBut that spike plainly has nothing to do with Tesla\u2019s business fundamentals, which are increasingly shaky\u2014and its future prospects are even worse. The company\u2019s best-selling models are extremely old by auto market standards, other automakers are putting up stiff competition\u2014Chinese ones in particular are poised to massacre Tesla in the developing world\u2014its only new model in half a decade is a flop, and Musk\u2019s right-wing antics are poisoning its sleek, environmentalist brand.\n\nAbsent more assistance from the incoming Trump administration, on its current track Tesla will be an also-ran in the global EV market within a decade.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that after years of very fast growth, in 2024 Tesla\u2019s sales fell slightly for the first time since 2011. It is still the largest EV seller in the world, but only by a tiny margin\u2014China\u2019s BYD, which saw a huge increase year on year, sold 1.76 million EVs, against Tesla\u2019s 1.79 million.\n\nMore from Ryan Cooper\n\nAt first blush, this is quite curious. Practically every country on Earth has set up some kind of green transition program, and this typically includes some kind of EV incentive. Why isn\u2019t the biggest EV seller reaping the benefit?\n\nThe first reason is an aging model lineup. The minority of Tesla investors who are not starry-eyed Elon Musk fanboys have been complaining for years that the company isn\u2019t putting out enough new models. Every other car company has settled on a strategy of addressing as many market niches as possible\u2014Toyota, for instance, currently lists 55 different models for sale in the U.S. (depending on how you count), and each has a half dozen or so trim levels. This is how they sell about 11 million cars a year. Tesla, by contrast, until recently had just four: one SUV and sedan in the mid-market, and one SUV and sedan in the luxury market.\n\nNow, Tesla does have a new model in the form of the Cybertruck, which many thought would be a mega-seller because Americans love pickup trucks so much. But this has not happened. Fred Lambert at Electrek calculates: \u201cBased on how Model S and Model X sales have been tracking, we estimate that Tesla delivered between 9,000 and 12,000 Cybertrucks in Q4, which is likely less than in Q3 despite launching the cheaper non-Foundation Series models and opening orders beyond those with reservations.\u201d Those are pitiful numbers.\n\nIt could be that American truck buyers in particular are suspicious of EVs. Ford has sold about as many F-150 Lightning models as Tesla has Cybertrucks, but about 20 to 30 times as many gas-powered F-150s. Or it could be the Cybertruck is too weird-looking and niche to have mass appeal. Or perhaps it costs too much and its features are (as usual) not nearly as good as Musk promised. Or perhaps it is harmed by its reputation for breaking down or catching on fire. Whatever the case, the Cybertruck (which can\u2019t be sold in Europe because it is so heavy and dangerous to pedestrians, incidentally) was a huge waste of resources that could have been spent developing models for other underserved niches\u2014above all the minivan segment, which still has no EV options from anyone yet.\n\nThe second reason for Tesla\u2019s floundering is competition. The Big Three American automakers all have EV divisions now, and while Ford is struggling due to poor planning, GM has ironed out the kinks with its Ultium platform, has a decent variety of models, and is well on the road to profitability. What\u2019s more, Hyundai/Kia has developed a line of fantastic models with the best driver interface in the business, combining lots of fancy whiz-bang screen technology with dedicated controls for key functions like wipers, climate control, and so on. (I own a Kona EV, for the record.) Honda\u2019s new Prologue has even come on of late.\n\nEven as customers have soured on Tesla\u2019s screen-first design, as it is both annoying and dangerous to look down while driving and fiddle with touch-screen menus instead of pressing a button by feel, the company has doubled down on removing traditional controls by getting rid of turn signal stalks in its new models. (That ought to be illegal, but I digress.)\n\nIn the developing world, BYD and other Chinese automakers are eating everyone\u2019s lunch, including Tesla. Even Japanese manufacturers have been caught flat-footed and are bleeding market share. China is still Tesla\u2019s biggest single market, and I expect sales there to fall precipitously next year\u2014if for no other reason than the Communist government obviously prefers domestic companies over foreign ones.\n\nThe third reason is Elon Musk himself. It is now very clear that any Tesla purchase is directly supporting right-wing extremism around the world\u2014and specifically groups that are attempting to slow the green transition. Trump, obviously, has promised to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, and has particular animus against its EV credit. But Musk has also recently spoken out in favor of the AfD party in Germany and the Reform party in the U.K., both of which have attempted to slow or reverse their nations\u2019 climate policies.\n\nFor years, Musk marketed Tesla as taking bold steps to fight climate change by cutting transportation emissions. Now he, through his Tesla wealth, is trying to stop those efforts across the board, even for cars. Half the point of owning an EV, which can be inconvenient and annoying at times, is to do one\u2019s part to help cut emissions. Buying one from a guy who is a clear and present danger to the climate makes no sense, and customers have better options today anyhow.\n\nTesla\u2019s best hope, as I see it, is to leverage Musk\u2019s connections to Trump to extract subsidies from the government, or harm his competitors. That\u2019s obviously where he\u2019s starting by backing the cancellation of the EV rebate, which will put competitors with less mature supply chains in a weaker position than Tesla in the U.S. But more could be done. Maybe the post office could be forced to buy a million Cybertrucks. Maybe the carbon credit program, which has accounted for a large share of Tesla\u2019s profits in the past, could be dialed up. Maybe the Boring Company can get a contract to dig a tunnel between the White House and Mar-a-Lago to be filled with Teslas driving 35 miles per hour.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. Then again, it may be quite hard to get any legislation through this House Republican caucus.\n\nAt any rate, Tesla\u2019s preposterous meme stock-esque valuation may stay high for a long time. As we\u2019ve seen with GameStop, markets can stay irrational so long as there is a supply of suckers willing to throw their money down the toilet. But in terms of business fundamentals, Tesla may have already peaked.",

            "content": "Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) stock is seeing strong bullish momentum in Friday's trading. The electric vehicle (EV) company's share price was up 6.9% as of 3:15 p.m. ET amid the backdrop of a 1.2% gain for the S&P 500 index and a 1.7% gain for the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nIn addition to bullish momentum for the broader market today, Tesla is gaining ground thanks to positive industry reports and analyst coverage. In addition to a Reuters report stating the EV specialist was seeing seeing strong sales in China, the company's stock is also getting a boost from a price target increase from Canaccord.\n\nTesla stock revs up on China data\n\nReuters recently published a report on Tesla's sales performance in China across 2024, and the analysis paints a bullish picture. Vehicle sales in China increased 8.8% year over year to reach more than 657,000. Even better, the report shows that vehicle sales accelerated above that rate to deliver growth of 12.8% and sales of 83,000 units last month. The results look particularly significant on the heels of Tesla's recent vehicle deliveries and production report for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nTesla's Q4 update announced that the company had produced 459,000 vehicles and delivered 495,000 vehicles in the period. While the performance wasn't as bad as more recent projections had forecast, the results still came in below the average analyst estimate. The performance brought the company's total deliveries across 2024 to 1.79 million vehicles, below the average Wall Street forecast for deliveries of 1.806 million vehicles. Tesla's 2024 deliveries fell short of the roughly 1.8 million vehicles delivered in 2023, marking the first time that the company saw an overall decline for unit sales. With total deliveries falling short of expectations, signs of momentum in China present a significant bright spot.\n\nCannacord weighs in Tesla's near-term vs. long-term outlook\n\nIn a note published before the market opened today, Canaccord maintained a buy rating on Tesla and raised its one-year price target on the stock from $298 per share to $404 per share. Following gains for the stock today, the new price target actually implies downside of roughly 0.4%.\n\nCanaccord's analysts think that Tesla's business fundamentals justify valuation multiples that are in the same ballpark with other megacap tech peers including Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon. More importantly, the firm thinks that Tesla is positioned to capitalize on multiple \"generational\" growth opportunities in categories including self-driving vehicles, batteries, and robotics. So while Tesla's one-year price target implied limited upside at the time of publication and has already been surpassed, Canaccord thinks that the EV leader has the makings of a long-term winner.",

            "content": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, undercutting a stock that has soared since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on optimism Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.\n\nTesla\u2019s global vehicle sales rose 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 thanks to 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk\u2019s most valuable holding to overcome last year\u2019s sluggish start.\n\nThe Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.\n\nThe year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.\n\nThe fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla\u2019s average sales price to fall to just over $41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 29 and Tesla\u2019s stock fell 6.1% on Thursday.\n\nMusk donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50% since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.\n\nIn 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.\n\nThe fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.\n\nFalling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry-leading profit margins.\n\nCompetition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.\n\nDaniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.\n\n\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company ... instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d\n\nThe fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry-level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.\n\nAside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.\n\nTo meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.\n\nTesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.\n\n\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d\n\nJeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.\n\nIndustry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.\n\nAt present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.\n\nThrough September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.\n\nNearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.\n\nTesla\u2019s global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that its sales soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.\n\nFourth-quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.\n\n____\n\nCondon reported from New York City.",

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nSeveral times in the past year, I\u2019ve pointed out concerns with Tesla consumer demand and sales. That\u2019s not to say Tesla isn\u2019t an excellent company that produces superb electric cars and sells very large volumes of them. The height Tesla has risen to is amazing. I said for more than a decade it was doing amazing things and likely to find millions of buyers a year, which was a nearly unbelievable goal 15 years ago, or even 10 years ago for many people. The Tesla Model Y became the best selling automobile model in 2023, and it looks like it probably held onto its title in 2024. There\u2019s no way someone could reasonably say the Tesla Model Y, the Tesla Model 3, or Tesla as a whole hasn\u2019t been a stunning success. However, the future waits for no man, and for no auto company.\n\nTesla\u2019s plan, as repeated by Elon Musk many times, was to achieve 50% growth per year up through 2030. That was further clarified to mean 50% on average, so some years might see more growth (say, 70%) and other years may see less (say, 30%). This was a big part of why the company was valued so highly on the stock market, or so it seemed. In the second half of 2023, it became clear Tesla was facing notable consumer demand challenges, something it hadn\u2019t struggled with for quite a long time. I started highlighting and discussing signs of this, and I did so several times in 2024, as noted at the start. It seemed obvious to me several months ago that Tesla\u2019s consumer demand challenges were getting more serious. I explained various potential reasons why \u2014 as part of my job trying to track, understand, and share with others the biggest stories in cleantech.\n\nMany people have interpreted these discussions as anti-Tesla, anti-Elon, and illogical hate speech. Despite predicting the company\u2019s rise and covering its success for more than a decade (enough so that Tesla once almost recruited me to work alongside Musk before deciding that I was more useful on the outside running CleanTechnica), many Tesla fans (and I would argue more importantly, Tesla stockholders) have attacked me as having strong bias against Tesla.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ll repeat: I\u2019ve been covering what\u2019s been happening at Tesla, and what seems to be around the corner.\n\nDespite all kinds of signs Tesla consumer demand was weakening, I still gave the company the benefit of the doubt because Musk had said a couple of times in late 2023 and early 2024 that they expected sales to grow in 2024, just not by as much as recent years. I covered the signs that Tesla was struggling to find sales, but I also repeated the forecast from Musk that they\u2019d finish the year strong and have net positive sales growth despite digging a significant hole in the first half of the year.\n\nAs it turns out, Tesla could never turn things around enough to have more vehicle sales in 2024 than in 2023.\n\nThere are people who are unwilling to see what\u2019s happening or accept what\u2019s happening because it goes against what they believed in and/or goes against what\u2019s helpful for them financially. They claim people like me who point out negative trends or issues at Tesla are filled with illogical hate. I contend, as I have several times, that I\u2019m focused on seeing and sharing Tesla realism. Just as I ran across and was despised by many Tesla [NASDAQ:TSLA] short sellers for years because they didn\u2019t like the story I was sharing, the story of Tesla, it feels like there are many Tesla shareholders now who similarly don\u2019t like the story I\u2019ve been sharing, the story of Tesla today and going forward. It\u2019s not 2015 anymore, Toto, and we\u2019re not in Palo Alto.\n\nPeople are free to dislike or even hate on our coverage of Tesla, the biggest seller of BEVs in the world in 2024, but only the second biggest in the last quarter for the first time in a long time. But now that 2024 is a wrap, I think they should understand and accept that I was right in June, in July, in August, and in December that there were many signs indicating Tesla demand was not nearly as high as desired and Tesla may not hit its target of growing vehicle deliveries in 2024 (not to mention the older target of growing them by 50%). Despite what Elon said, despite what they hoped, Tesla is not able to find as many buyers as it has cars for sale. Tesla\u2019s vehicles have become a little stale, Elon\u2019s political involvement and antics have pushed many customers away, there\u2019s growing competition that is legit and even exciting, Tesla doesn\u2019t have enough model variety, and the Cybertruck is not the mass-market hit its very large reservation list implied (for obvious reasons). The fact is: Tesla sales are down, and some of us saw this coming and were hammered for talking or writing about it.\n\nOne can throw darts at the messenger, but that doesn\u2019t change the reality in the letter the messenger is delivering.\n\nIt\u2019s 2025 now. I have an open mind about what is going to come this year. There are many unknowns and many wildcards that could have a huge impact on Tesla\u2019s consumer demand. We will cover all the big twists and turns we see \u2014 positive and negative. If there are signs Tesla\u2019s buyer demand continues to be an issue, or even gets worse, we will cover it. If Tesla releases notable new or upgraded models and sales shoot through the roof, we will happily cover it. If Full Self Driving fails to deliver for the 7th(?) year in a row, we\u2019ll point that out. If there\u2019s a breakthrough and Tesla can roll out robotaxis widely, we\u2019ll be sure to be right on top of that and writing about it in as thorough a way as possible.\n\nYou can hate on me, or us, for reporting on any notable stumbles in the evolution of the biggest or second biggest BEV producer in the world. We\u2019re just doing our best to report Tesla realism.",

But that left it far behind the 595,413 pure EVs sold by Chinese rival BYD in the quarter. Tesla\u2019s full-year sales of 1.8 million vehicles nonetheless edged out BYD\u2019s annual EV total by 24,000, to retain the title of world\u2019s largest EV maker.\n\nBut Tesla\u2019s total 2024 sales were down 1% from the 2023 total, the first time the company has reported that kind of drop. Tesla at one point was reporting annual sales growth of nearly 50% a year, and its 2023 sales total was up a solid 37% from 2022, so even a narrow decline represents a significant slowdown.\n\nTesla has faced increased competition not just from Chinese rivals like BYD but also from legacy global automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen AG and Korean partners Hyundai and Kia. Even though those legacy automakers have only a fraction of Tesla\u2019s EV sales, as they sell mostly traditional gasoline-powered cars, they are posing more competition.\n\nTesla has responded to the slowing demand by cutting vehicle prices, both in China and the United States. It has the advantage of being more profitable than its legacy automaker rivals, which are still losing money on their EV sales as they try to build sales volume and reduce costs.\n\nSales of EVs in general, however, continue to grow, both in the United States and globally, though at a slower pace than in the past.\n\nShares of Tesla (TSLA) fell more than 4% in early trading on the weak sales report. But they closed 2024 up 68% for the year. Almost all of that gain came after Election Day, as investors bet that Tesla will benefit from policies under the incoming Trump administration, given the key support for the president-elect from CEO Elon Musk.",

Chief Executive Elon Musk posted 25 comments on X on Thursday morning, 23 of them political but none about Tesla.\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this article said Elon Musk posted 25 comments on X on Monday morning. It was Thursday morning.\n\nMusk\u2019s increasingly conservative politics and his alignment with Republican President-elect Donald Trump might also be a factor in left-leaning states such as California, its biggest U.S. market, Caldwell said.\n\n\u201cThere are people with a negative image of Elon Musk and that\u2019s tainted the Tesla a bit.\u201d\n\nMost of the sales decline occurred in the fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31, despite cut-rate financing deals offered by Tesla. Given the company\u2019s commanding lead in electric vehicle market share, slow or no growth at Tesla adds another challenge to California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s zero-emission vehicle aspirations. The state is under his mandate to ban new sales of traditional gasoline-powered cars by 2035.\n\nTesla, once a darling of California electric vehicle buyers, has been taking hits in the Golden State, with sales down 3.5% in the third quarter, according to the state dealers trade group. Tesla itself doesn\u2019t break out numbers state by state. Fourth-quarter estimates from the California New Car Dealers Assn. will be available later this month.\n\nWhether Tesla\u2019s drop indicates deeper trouble in the EV market in general will become clearer as other companies report their 2024 sales in coming days. The rapid growth in the market for electric vehicles has slowed as customers resist higher prices and balk at an inefficient public charging system.\n\nTesla once had the EV market almost entirely to itself, but that\u2019s no longer the case. The Ioniq 5 from Hyundai and the EV6 and EV9 from Kia are selling especially well. Dozens of models from other carmakers have been introduced in recent years, more than a dozen in 2024 alone from Volvo, Volkswagen, Cadillac, GMC, Polestar, Porsche and others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EV market could take a hit if Trump follows through on plans to eliminate the federal EV buyer tax credit of up to $7,500 a vehicle.\n\nNewsom has said he will seek to provide state tax credits should that happen, but his plan would exclude Tesla, given how much the state has already spent on Tesla subsidies. Despite slowing growth, Tesla remains by far the top seller of EVs in California and across the United States.\n\nTesla investors can expect a new round of strong growth, according to Musk, from the introduction of robotaxis, although he nas been promising full self-driving Teslas since at least 2017 but has yet to deliver.",

            "content": "After many years of gains, Tesla sales and deliveries dropped\n\nTesla\u2019s share of the U.S. EV market has fallen below 50%\n\nU.S. registration figures are yet to come\n\nTesla sales and deliveries turned downward in 2024, after a seemingly unstoppable trajectory of double-digit gains for many years.\n\nGlobally, Tesla delivered about 1,789,226 million vehicles in all of 2024, with production of about 1,773,443 million vehicles. Both of those figures are down versus the reported 1,808,581 deliveries and 1,845,985 vehicles made in 2023.\n\nThat\u2019s just over a 1% drop in deliveries in 2024 and a nearly 4% drop in production for the year. And it might have been worse without a rally in the fourth quarter. Tesla noted that it posted a delivery record for Q4, at 495,570 vehicles.\n\nTo compare, a year ago Tesla was touting some very different results. Its 2023 deliveries and sales grew 38% and 35%, respectively, over 2022. Tesla\u2019s 2023 sales surge was strong, and its sales numbers exceeded 2022 numbers every single month of the year according to DOE data. That said, China\u2019s BYD continued to edge up on Tesla on the global front in 2023.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk at Cybercab event (screenshot) - Oct. 2024\n\nIn 2023, Tesla CEO Elon Musk became political and by extension so did Tesla in a way it never had been before. By April 2024, reputational studies were showing the relationship, as even more of the American car-buying public connected Tesla with Musk. At this point, it's hard to ignore an array of consumer-sentiment data points suggesting that the world's richest man may be getting in the way of Tesla sales growth, especially in California, where it\u2019s held more than a tenth of the new-vehicle market.\n\nTesla\u2019s share of the EV market shrank in 2023 despite price cuts, to around 50% of the U.S. EV market, and with 2024 EV sales expected to rise overall by about 20% versus 2023, it will certainly lose more of that in 2024. Tesla had continued those price cuts in 2024, with an April move that repositioned the Model Y below the Model 3, thanks to the federal EV tax credit that Musk has backed eliminating.\n\nThe Model 3 and Model Y composed the vast majority of Tesla\u2019s global total. Just 94,105 of its global production and 85,133 of its global deliveries were of \u201cother models\u201d\u2014likely including the Model S, Model X, Cybertruck, and Semi.\n\n2024 Tesla Model Y. - Courtesy of Tesla, Inc.\n\nAs a footnote to this: It\u2019s not yet clear whether Tesla saw sales sputter in the same way in the U.S., looking at the entire year. Through October they were down, however. Citing registration-based figures through that month, Automotive News tallied 499,870 sales through that month, versus 535,834 for the equivalent period in 2023.\n\nTesla doesn\u2019t report U.S.-market sales figures, which generally rely on state registration numbers and their commensurate lag. But we\u2019ll have an idea on those, and whether Tesla managed to achieve U.S. sales gains for the year, within a few weeks.",

Both had attended Trump\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party at Trump\u2019s estate in South Florida.\n\nMusk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support the former president. He was at Trump\u2019s resort on election night and has been a frequent guest there. Trump has named Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, to co-lead a new effort to find ways to cut the government\u2019s size and spending.\n\nOne person died and seven others were injured Wednesday when a Tesla Cybertruck that appeared to be carrying fireworks caught fire and exploded outside President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Las Vegas hotel, authorities said.\n\n\u201cThis is a Tesla truck, and we know that Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it\u2019s the Trump Tower,\u201d McMahill said when reporters asked about possible political connections. \u201cSo there\u2019s obviously things to be concerned about and it\u2019s something we continue to look at.\u201d\n\nThe truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans\u2019 famed French Quarter early on New Year\u2019s Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack and police believe the driver was not acting alone.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely investigating any connectivity to what happened in New Orleans as well as other attacks that have been occurring around the world,\u201d McMahill said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t ruling anything out.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Turo said it was working with authorities.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn Las Vegas, witness Ana Bruce, visiting from Brazil, said she heard three explosions.\n\n\u201cThe first one where we saw the fire, the second one, I guess, was the battery or something like that, and the third was the big one that smoked the entire area and was the moment when everyone was told to evacuate and stay away,\u201d Bruce said.\n\nHer travel companion, Alcides Antunes, showed video he took of flames lapping the sides of the silver-colored vehicle.\n\nThe 64-story hotel is just off the Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall.\n\nEric Trump, a son of the president-elect and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, posted about the fire on the social media platform X. He praised the fire department and local law enforcement \u201cfor their swift response and professionalism.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Colleen Long and Zeke Miller in Washington and Michelle L.

            "content": "The IM L6 is several thousand dollars cheaper than the Tesla Model 3 in China but packs more features and performance.\n\nIt can crab walk, has a Tesla-FSD-like advanced driver assistance system with lidar and is equipped with one of the most advanced Qualcomm processors and Nvidia chips.\n\nChinese car buyers have a dizzying variety of affordable electric models to choose from. The industry producing those is not just reshaping the automotive world order but is also engaged in a Darwinian-style evolution to survive brutal competition.\n\nAs a result, Chinese EVs are far cheaper than what we get here in the U.S. and still offer more value. One case in point is the IM L6, a Tesla Model 3-sized fastback with an extensive features list and supercar levels of performance.\n\nPhoto by: IM Motors\n\nIM Motors is a joint venture between China\u2019s state-owned SAIC Corporation, Alibaba Group and investment firm ZJ High-Tech. The JV was formed in 2020 to compete with Tesla, Nio and other emerging new Chinese brands.\n\nWhat makes the L6 special is it\u2019s one of the earliest vehicles, even in China, to feature a semi-solid-state battery (SSB) pack. IM Motors claims the L6\u2019s top variant features a 133 kilowatt-hour SSB with 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of range on the China Light-Duty Test Cycle (CLTC).\n\nKyle Conner, InsideEVs\u2019 pal and the host of the YouTube channel Out of Spec Reviews, recently had the chance to drive the L6 in China. He seems to have driven the Performance variant, a direct competitor to the Model 3 Performance in China.\n\nConner claimed the software was incredible, performance ludicrous and it\u2019s packed with features like crab walk and lidar, which is unheard of in the Model 3 price range in the U.S. The IM L6\u2019s Performance version costs 305,900 yuan, or $42,300. The Model 3 Performance costs 335,900 yuan, or about $46,000 in China.\n\nConner initially wasn\u2019t impressed with the packaging of the L6. Despite being built on a dedicated EV architecture, the L6 has a tiny frunk and the boot space isn\u2019t all that great compared to the Model 3. But from behind the wheel, things are radically different.\n\nPhoto by: IM Motors\n\nThe L6 comes with an optional aircraft-style steering yoke. Three screens span the width of the dashboard and they\u2019re all super smooth and easy to use with a high refresh rate. The vehicle software is powered by some of the most advanced automotive processors and chips: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295 and Nvidia Orin X.\n\nThe cabin quality isn\u2019t top-notch. The Xiaomi SU7 is far more premium inside, as per Conner. But in terms of software and driving dynamics, the L6 is special.\n\nFor starters, the Performance version rides on a 900-volt architecture, has all-wheel drive and its motors produce 776 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque. It gets a Track mode, allowing adjustable front-rear power split. The traction control and dampers are adjustable, too.\n\nPhoto by: IM Motors\n\nThe ride is supremely comfortable, as per Conner. But it can switch personalities at the press of a button, transforming from a comfy sedan to a hooligan.\n\nThrough the video-game-like UI, you can engage launch mode and it\u2019s definitely faster than the Tesla, Conner said. (The Model 3 Performance has a claimed 0-60 miles per hour time of 2.9 seconds. The L6 races to 62 mph from a standstill in a claimed 2.74 seconds.)\n\nI highly recommend watching the video above. It highlights broader (and frankly enviable) trends in China\u2019s EV market, showcasing how far ahead they are in producing software-defined vehicles that are both affordable and highly advanced.\n\nHave a tip?

            "content": "Authorities use Tesla data to track Cybertruck before bombing, raising privacy concerns\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Shocking video shows the moment a Tesla Cybertruck explodes A Tesla Cybertruck sat outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas for just 15 seconds before it exploded.\n\nTesla vehicle telematics and records from a Cybertruck are providing key insights into the New Year's Day explosion in Las Vegas \u2013 data that may not have been available decades ago but which raise troubling questions about how governments and companies track personal travel information.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the vehicle was parked in front of the International Trump Hotel when the explosion went off, injuring seven people. The driver, identified as Matthew Livelsberger, 37, fatally shot himself moments before the Cybertruck exploded. Canisters of fuel, fireworks and two semi-automatic firearms were later discovered in the back of the vehicle, which was rented in Colorado from peer-to-peer car-sharing company Turo Dec. 28.\n\nAuthorities continue to investigate whether it was an act of terrorism and traced the Cybertruck's route from Denver to Las Vegas using Tesla charging station records and other data commonly collected by car manufacturers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed on X that the explosion was unrelated to the Cybertruck itself. \"All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of explosion,\" Musk tweeted.\n\nThe tracking of the precise movements of the Vegas bomber sheds light on the ubiquitous digital age technology sleuthing to show people's movements, habits and where they are going. As modern-day cars are built with sophisticated computers, drivers face a growing reality where their actions on the road are constantly logged and analyzed, raising concerns among technology experts about ethics and privacy.\n\n\"Most consumers actually don\u2019t understand what data is being collected,\" Jodi Daniels, founder and CEO of privacy consultancy firm Red Clover Advisors, told USA TODAY. \"Most people are like, I put gas in it and I charge it and there\u2019s an engine, and they\u2019re not thinking about computers, data and cameras.\"\n\nModern cars are equipped with numerous onboard computers, enabling features like navigation, app-based unlocking, camera-recording and self-autonomous driving capabilities. \"We're forgetting it\u2019s not the car from decades ago, it\u2019s totally different, it\u2019s all based on computers and what computers do is function on data has to be collected and stored somewhere,\" she said.\n\nBut the big question is: Whose data is it?\n\n\"If I own the car or I rent the car or I lease the car, is it my data? Is it the manufacturer's data?\" Daniels said. Automakers and dealerships often analyze data from millions of drivers to improve their vehicles and safety features. However, the data collection and sharing can be a \"little bit of a gray zone,\" according to Daniels.\n\nA lawsuit filed against General Motors from the Texan Attorney General in August alleged the Detroit automaker violated Texans' privacy rights for selling driver data to insurance companies without their consent, which often led to a rise in their premiums.\n\nMany drivers opt into data-collecting unaware that they can choose not to, or the privacy policy their manufacturer has is often too vague to understand, Daniels said. Even if someone does allow their data to be gathered, policies can change, and what they originally consented to may no longer align with how their information is used. \"Those parties need to be good responsible companies, balancing what it is they\u2019re trying to collect with the safety of cars and people with their own selfish interest and putting the consumer first,\" she said.\n\nDaniels calls it an \"education gap.\" She added, \"They're just forgetting the significant digital data everywhere. People download apps all day long, they don't think about it.\"\n\nTesla states in its Customer Privacy Notice that a Tesla car \"generates vehicle, diagnostic, infotainment system, and Autopilot data\" but \"does not associate that data with your identity or account by default,\" including camera recordings. The notice also states Tesla may share information with service providers, business partners and affiliates; third parties you authorize and other third parties as required by law.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\n\"There is a history of abuse of the kind of data that Tesla collects about its drivers,\" said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Between 2019 and 2022, Tesla employees were internally sharing invasive videos and recordings from customer cars, both when on and off, including when someone was naked and road rage incidents, according to interviews by Reuters with nine former employees.\n\nWhen it comes to law enforcement, many companies also provide data for a court order or warrant. Last year, at least three Tesla cars were towed by the Oakland Police Department for information the vehicles may have captured in connection with nearby crimes.\n\nGalperin added that it's important to note that the Cybertruck used in the blast was rented, so \"you can expect every form of tracking to be turned on,\" compared to driving your own personal vehicle.\n\nThere are no current federal regulations when it comes to the privacy of vehicle-collected data, although some states such as California have some protections. \"I don't think there'll be something on the federal level in say, the next four years,\" Galperin said.\n\nAs car technology advances and self-driving vehicles, such as the Cybertruck, become more prevalent, concerns about privacy are likely to grow.\n\n\"There are all different levels of surveillance, all potential vectors of attack not just by hackers but also abusers in domestic abuse situations and by governments and law enforcement,\" she said. \"I think people are rightfully concerned about their cars and really don\u2019t have enough protection right now.\"",

In general terms, it's possible that the new Tesla will carry over several aesthetic elements from the restyled Model 3, starting with the front headlights.\n\nAt the rear, on the other hand, there's talk of an LED bar to give the American crossover more personality. As for the powertrain, we're expecting 60 kWh LFP and 77 kWh NMC batteries, as on the Model 3, and a range structured similarly to that of the hatchback.\n\nHowever, it is likely that the most powerful version, the Performance, will have to wait a few months longer.

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, for the first time, Tesla can make more cars than it can sell. Up through 2030, Tesla promised to sell 50% more cars in the present year than it sold in the year before, at least on average, but it\u2019s not happening. We know this partly because Tesla is pulling every sales lever possible to try to sell more cars in the 4th quarter of 2024 than it sold in the 4th quarter of 2023. Tesla has lowered prices and is now offering further discounts on inventory cars. Tesla is even offering free lifetime Supercharging again on some models. It is also offering at least three months of Full Self-Driving, etc., etc.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Tesla has not been successful \u2014 the Model Y is the biggest selling car model in the world. It\u2019s sold more than Toyota Camry or Corolla, or the Toyota Hilux (Tacoma) trucks. It\u2019s sold more than the Honda Accord or Honda Civic. It\u2019s sold more than the Ford F-150. It\u2019s sold more than any Hyundai or Kia model.\n\nWhy is this sales lag happening? While the Cybertruck is a radical new vehicle, maybe too radical, the rest of the lineup has become very pedestrian. I\u2019ve owned my Model 3 now for 5 years and it used to stop traffic. When I first bought the car, I would pull up to a fast-food place or grocery store and some kid would ask me about my car. It had plenty of novel features \u2014 a big control screen, automatic unlock and lock, better acceleration than any car I\u2019ve owned, Full Self Driving, etc., etc. In the meantime, many other cars now have gotten smart cruise and autosteer and all the other features. How about styling? I still love the look of the front of my Model 3. However, the rest of it is pretty dull four-door styling. There\u2019s nothing special about the lights. Many cars, even Hyundai models, have unique LED headlights and taillights these days that say: I\u2019m a new car!\n\nThe new Highland refresh of the Model 3 and the upcoming Juniper refresh for the Model Y don\u2019t make significant styling changes. The taillights are slightly different, but just as boring as before. Why would a prospective buyer pick the rather stale Tesla design rather than something fresher? For one thing, reliability. Also, there are many happy owners out there. You can\u2019t pass an intersection on a busy street these days in northern Utah without seeing two or three Teslas. \u201cThese owners must like their cars, so maybe I will take a chance on one.\u201d Supercharging is another reason. I would know, I owned three Nissan Leafs before I purchased my Model 3. I would not travel cross country in any other brand. However, how are you going to convince current Tesla owners to trade in their cars? Also, many prospective owners are looking for something that is fresher. Have you seen all the light grey and tan cars running around these days. These are new colors that say: you never saw this color before; therefore, I am a new vehicle. Tesla could come out with new colors that would do the same thing.\n\nAlso, the Tesla choice of colors has always been pretty boring. How can the guy who picked the Cybertruck styling, who makes rockets land on their tails, and who designed a satellite system that makes communication possible anyplace on the planet make such dull looking cars. I like my white Model 3, but the red is pretty dull, the dark blue is dull, black is pedestrian, and the silver is okay. The stainless steel DeLorean with gull-wing doors that you saw in the movie Back to the Future was a unique vehicle probably specially polished by the movie crew. However, the stainless steel of the Cybertruck in real life is pretty dull. Only the styling makes it turn heads. See a bunch of Cybertrucks in the photo below.\n\nWhat can you do about it if you want your Tesla to have a look that will turn heads? You can wrap it!\n\nThe lead photo is of a Cybertruck with a yellow and brown wrap that definitely turns heads. The owner informed me that the yellow and brown two-tone wrap cost $6,500. You can now buy your Cybertruck wrapped by Tesla for $4,500 extra \u2014 if you live in the right area. However, I don\u2019t see wrapping as an option on the website for the Cybertruck or any of the other Tesla models. As you see in the photo below, the color yellow does really stand out.\n\nThe Model S with purple wrap and a diamond (fake?) studded Tesla T shown in the photo below definitely stands out, but it looks like the wrap has become a little dull with age.\n\nOn the other hand, the Model S wrapped in gold shown in the photo below still looks great even though the car could be over 10 years old. However, I would guess that the wrap is probably more recent.\n\nThe Cybertruck with the light blue wrap in the photo below also really stands out. Probably, the owner got his company to pay for it, or at least got a big tax deduction.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the owner of the black wrapped Cybertruck in the photo below was trying to accomplish. I don\u2019t think it stands out that much. Maybe a stealth look? The Utah Delicate Arch plate really spoils it. You would think he would have at least used the new black Utah plate with white lettering,\n\nWhat must Tesla do to give its sales a boost. It needs a significant styling refresh, not the lame ones we are seeing so far. It also needs a new set of colors that say: I\u2019m a new car, like the light grey and tan colors we are seeing lately.\n\nIn the meantime, what can a prospective buyer do to make his Tesla stand out and look new: Wrap it!\n\nNote: Many of us feel betrayed by Elon Musk. He was the one who was developing electric vehicles because clean energy and clean propulsion are important. But Musk spent millions of his own money to help get Trump elected. Musk is now a key advisor to Trump. Trump is the guy who has taken many millions from fossil fuel companies in exchange for the promise to promote their industries any way he can. He\u2019s also the guy who hates wind turbines, tried to stop California from having its own pollution rules, and doesn\u2019t believe in global warming.\n\nReferral Program: If you are buying a new Tesla, Tesla has reactivated its referral program.

            "content": "Tesla might be a great company, but investors should think twice before buying the stock.\n\nTesla (TSLA 3.86%) had a big year in 2024 and shareholders enjoyed a 70% gain (as of Dec. 30).\n\nA series of positive factors, such as solid sales volume and the election of Donald Trump as president, propelled the stock to new all-time highs. But as the year ends, should investors buy Tesla stock now for 2025? Let's explore.\n\nBecoming the largest car manufacturer\n\nThe rise of the electric vehicle (EV) industry has been a significant trend during the past decade as countries globally work to solve environmental issues. This major transition gave early movers like Tesla a big advantage in gaining market share from the incumbents.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Tesla has become the biggest EV car manufacturer in the U.S., making nearly 50% of EV sales in 2024. While Tesla's EV market share has fallen from 75% at the beginning of 2022 as the incumbents have started catching up, it still holds the dominant market share.\n\nDespite its remarkable achievements during the past few years, Tesla has bigger ambitions over the longer term: to become the largest car manufacturer. A series of strategies, which include reducing sales prices, cutting costs to become the cost leader, and launching a low-priced car model, demonstrate the company's resolve to achieve its long-term mission.\n\nIn fact, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has openly stated his goal of selling 20 million cars a year by 2030, even though many Tesla fans think that the company could be pivoting more toward robotaxis than just selling traditional EVs. Regardless, Tesla's ambition to dominate the automobile industry is clear and resolute.\n\nThe good news is that there are early indicators that Tesla's long-term mission is on track. For example, in the third quarter of 2024, Tesla achieved its lowest cost of goods sold per vehicle of $35,100, increased vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year over year, reduced operating expenses by 6% despite selling more cars, and improved its gross margin by 1.95 percentage points year over year.\n\nWhile a single quarter of financial performance does not indicate future results, it suggests that Tesla has been making good strides in moving toward its long-term mission.\n\nMore than just a car manufacturer\n\nTesla might have started as an EV manufacturer, but it has, over the years, gone beyond its roots into other sectors such as renewables, autonomous driving, and robotaxis.\n\nTake renewables, for example. Tesla aims to provide a complete solution for commercial and residential customers to move toward energy independence, covering major components like solar panels and energy storage. As the world becomes more conscious about sustainability and environmental friendliness, the renewable energy business sits at the center of a megatrend that could last for decades.\n\nAnother area that could become a huge game-changer for Tesla is its investment in artificial intelligence (AI), which could, in turn, help it accelerate products in areas like autonomous vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots, to name a few. Each product could yield tens of billions of dollars over time, if not more. For instance, Elon Musk claims that Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus could one day lift the company's market capitalization to $25 trillion as the world embraces these robots en masse. (Tesla's market cap now is about $1.4 trillion.)\n\nWhile it's unlikely that all of these new ventures will become as successful as the EV business, just one or two successes in these areas could create enormous value for Tesla's shareholders.\n\nBut here's the potential deal-breaker\n\nBy now, it's not hard to see that I'm bullish about Tesla's business prospects for the next few years. However, I can't say the same about Tesla's stock.\n\nOptimistic investors have bid up Tesla's price to excessive valuations. For instance, Tesla has a price-to-sales ratio of 16 and a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 125. So, while Tesla's prospects are undeniably good, conservative investors will still question whether paying such a high price tag makes sense -- especially for high-risk ventures that have yet to materialize.\n\nBesides, Tesla's stock has had a considerable run since Trump won the election, as investors expect favorable treatment for Tesla due to Musk's close association with the incoming president. Such speculation, however, is risky since it's too complex to predict how such relationships will affect Tesla.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nTesla has a bright future as it continues to scale its EV business while developing its newer ventures in robotaxis, robotics, and more. As such, existing investors, especially those who bought the stock at much lower price points, may consider holding the stock into 2025.\n\nBut for the rest, buying Tesla's stock at today's valuation is probably too risky, even though there's strong momentum for the stock price to advance further in 2025.\n\nIt's better to be safe than sorry.",

(Seth Clevenger/Transport Topics)\n\n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]\n\nIn its first accident investigation of an electric-battery heavy truck, the National Transportation Safety Board is examining the Aug. 19 crash of a 2024 Tesla Semi that burned to the ground after it veered off Interstate 80 and slammed into a tree in the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nThe crash and resulting fire are being investigated by NTSB, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, California Highway Patrol and Tesla Inc.\n\nThe single-vehicle crash occurred at 3:13 a.m. as a Tesla driver, who sustained no reported injuries, was traveling east on I-80 from Livermore, Calif., to Tesla Giga Nevada in Sparks, Nev. Tesla\u2019s facility where the electric truck was heading is located about an hour from Lake Tahoe, which spans California and Nevada. The facility bills itself as \u201cone of the world\u2019s highest-volume plants for electric motors, energy storage products, vehicle powertrains and batteries \u2014 producing billions of cells per year.\u201d\n\nThe electric Semi crash happened near Emigrant Gap in Placer County, a high-elevation ridge on the historic California Trail west of Donner Pass.\n\nThat location on I-80 has two concrete lanes in each direction divided by a forested center median and paved shoulders. The maximum posted speed limit there is 55 mph for commercial trucks and 65 mph for passenger vehicles.\n\nNTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick told Transport Topics, \u201cThe investigation is ongoing and focusing on the emergency response to the event. This is the first investigation involving an electric truck-tractor.\u201d\n\nShe noted that NTSB investigations can take one to two years to be completed. When NTSB announced in mid-September that it had opened an investigation into the Tesla electric tractor-trailer crash and fire, it stated, \u201cAll aspects of the crash remain under investigation while the NTSB determines the probable cause, with the intent of issuing safety recommendations to prevent similar events.\u201d\n\nAn FMCSA spokesperson stated the agency had no information to provide since NTSB is the primary investigative federal government organization looking into the incident.\n\nAccording to NTSB, \u201cThe truck-tractor departed the roadway to the right while navigating a right-hand curve and uphill grade. The vehicle struck a traffic delineator permanently mounted on a steel post, collided with a tree about 12.5 inches in diameter and continued down an earthen slope to rest against several trees.\u201d\n\nThen the truck\u2019s lithium-ion electric battery system ignited in a post-crash fire. NTSB stated that Tesla sent a technical expert to the scene to help with \u201cassessing high-voltage hazards and fire safety.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s media relations didn\u2019t respond to a Dec. 16 email from Transport Topics requesting comment about the incident and the current status of the battery-powered electric heavy truck development.\n\nEmergency responders tried to control the blaze by dumping 50,000 gallons of water to extinguish the flames and cool the truck\u2019s batteries.\n\nDid You Know? 50,000 gallons of water is estimated to fill a steel tank that is 25 feet in diameter and 14.23 feet high and weighs 4,735 pounds.\n\nFirefighters worked to prevent the fire from spreading to the surrounding forest. CAL FIRE deployed an airplane to the immediate area and doused it with fire retardant to keep the flames from causing more damage.\n\nA thermal scanner was deployed to monitor the temperatures of the burning batteries. Both directions of I-80 were closed for about 15 hours until firefighters determined the batteries were at a safe temperature for operations to begin for recovering the truck.\n\nThe Tesla electric Semi was then moved to an undisclosed open-air facility and monitored for 24 hours. During the observation period, officials detected no reignition of the truck-tractor\u2019s battery system.\n\nIn a separate incident involving a Tesla vehicle, one person died and seven others were injured on New Year\u2019s Day when a Tesla Cybertruck that was reported to be carrying fireworks and fuel exploded and caught fire outside President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Las Vegas hotel, authorities said.\n\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police and Clark County Fire Department officials said the person who died was inside the futuristic-looking pickup truck. Seven people nearby had minor injuries, and several were treated at a nearby hospital.\n\nThe fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m., a county spokesperson said in a statement. According to a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity, the truck was procured via a vehicle rental app.\n\nWant more news?

            "content": "Can the hot electric-car and artificial intelligence stock keep up its momentum in 2025?\n\nShares of electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) have been on an absolute tear in 2024, rising more than 70% as of this writing. This obliterated the S&P 500's 25% gain during this time. The huge gain has unsurprisingly sparked a lot of excitement around the stock. Fueling upbeat sentiment for shares, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been praised for cozying up with President-elect Donald Trump, and the company is viewed as a major beneficiary of artificial intelligence as it works on autonomous driving technology and robots.\n\nBut is the stock's recent gain more representative of hype or substance? After all, even a great company's stock can become overpriced if investor expectations become too optimistic.\n\nLet's examine whether Tesla shares look attractive at their current price.\n\nThe bull case\n\nFundamentally, the automaker's business is strong. Long gone are the days when the company was burning through cash. These days, Tesla's a cash cow. Free cash flow in the company's most recent quarter came in at more than $2.7 billion, growing 233% year over year. This helped bring Tesla's total cash and investments at the end of the quarter to approximately $33.6 billion.\n\nWhile this balance sheet and the company's profitability give the company staying power, the key to any bull thesis for Tesla stock is a rosy view for a science fiction-like future. Investors are betting that the company's artificial intelligence software and hardware product development will culminate in an autonomous network of Tesla vehicles, adding an Uber-like revenue stream for the company. In addition, investors are looking for continued rapid growth in electric car, energy storage, and solar product sales. On top of all of this, there is hope that the far-reaching technology giant can make money by selling humanoid robots.\n\nThe bear case\n\nWhile the bull case for Tesla stock is fun to think about, other more skeptical investors worry there's too much speculation and hope baked into the stock price today. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 118 at the time of this writing. A valuation like this leaves little room for potential setbacks, whether they are company, industry, economic, or geopolitical related.\n\nEven more, while Tesla's overall business does look strong, there's been a kink in its armor as of late. Automotive sales have hit a speed bump recently as high interest rates limit consumer borrowing power. Tesla's automotive revenue only rose 2% year over year in Q3. Anemic growth like this leaves much to be desired, given the stock's current valuation. Further, it's worth emphasizing that while Tesla does have other businesses beyond autos, it's still primarily an automaker. Automotive sales accounted for about 79% of its total sales in Q3. So, as long as higher interest rates make vehicle affordability a challenge for consumers, Tesla could continue to see subpar revenue growth rates.\n\nWait for a pullback\n\nWith all of this said, even though Tesla is a great company with a bright future, there's nothing wrong with staying on the sidelines after the stock's enormous run-up. If shares pull back meaningfully at some point in 2025, however, the stock is probably worth buying. After all, Tesla has a long history of strong growth and great execution, and it is well-positioned in attractive growth markets, namely electric cars and artificial intelligence.",

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nIf you\u2019re still considering getting a Tesla before the year ends, there are some big discounts available on inventory cars. In other words, Tesla has a lot of cars at delivery centers and is very eager to move then in 2024 in order to jack up sales.\n\nCredit goes to Brooke Crothers at Forbes for spotting this. \u201cTesla is giving sizable discounts \u2014 up to $4,870 \u2014 on select Model Y vehicles in inventory in the U.S. The Model S and X are seeing discounts, too,\u201d Brooke wrote yesterday. \u201cThe discounts appear on the Model Y inventory page.\u201d\n\nThe discounts are compared to pricing if you go through the Tesla Design Studio and customize a model in the way the specific inventory model is designed. So, the discounts are indeed discounts. Now, whether Tesla will go and drop pricing across the board in a week or two, we don\u2019t know. Today, though, the discounts are a good chunk of money.\n\nScanning around for a bit, I didn\u2019t find any discounts as high as $4,870. However, most of the cars in inventory had the \u201cReduced Price\u201d label on them, with discounts between about $1,500 and $3,000 on Model Ys. Perhaps Tesla has cleared through enough of the inventory that such steep discounts are no longer available. Or perhaps I\u2019m missing something.\n\nOn the Model S, price reductions are a bit higher, and I saw one up to $6,330! And with the Model X, they are even higher! Most appear to have a price reduction above $4,000, and here\u2019s one that comes with a $7,300 discount!\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 discounts are the lowest, on average, with most of them below $1,000. However, some get up to $2,300.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been thinking about buying a Tesla and you\u2019ve waited till New Year\u2019s Eve to go ahead and get one, I imagine you\u2019re just going with a last-minute impulse buy or you\u2019ve known you can get great deals at the end of the quarter and you\u2019re ready to pounce. Either way, it\u2019s a great time to get a Tesla for as little as possible, especially considering that the $7,500 EV tax credit might go away in 2025 \u2014 probably will.\n\nThere are surely great deals on other electric cars around the country as well. However, there\u2019s not such a centralized, clear way to spot and evaluate those discounts. But it\u2019s got to be a similarly good time for a discount on other EVs as well.\n\nIf buying a Tesla, also be sure to use a referral code. Tesla recently increased the amount of money you can be discounted using a referral code. If you don\u2019t have one and want a referral code for a discount on a Tesla, feel free to use mine: https://ts.la/zachary63404.",

            "content": "Elon Musk has shared when he expects to take Starship to Mars for its first uncrewed mission, and he also says Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robot will be on board for the flight.\n\nOn Friday, Musk wrote on X that SpaceX\u2019s reusable Starship rocket will take Optimus to Mars at the end of 2026, with human landings expected to commence a few years later.\n\n\u201cStarship departs for Mars at the end of next year, carrying Optimus,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIf those landings go well, then human landings may start as soon as 2029, although 2031 is more likely.\u201d\n\nHold on \u2014 Tesla Optimus (@Tesla_Optimus) March 15, 2025\n\nLast year, the SpaceX and Tesla head also expectations that SpaceX would be able to begin uncrewed launches in 2016, with early launches including both Optimus and a Cybertruck unit.\n\nMusk also followed up the announcement with a post on X on Saturday morning, noting that he expects SpaceX to launch more than 90 percent of Earth\u2019s payload mass to orbit this year. Meanwhile, he says China will make up just around 5 percent, while the rest of the world, including other parts of America, would also make up just 5 percent.\n\nHe also predicted that that number would go up even further to nearly 100 percent, once SpaceX\u2019s reusable rocket is being launched more frequently.\n\n\u201cWhen Starship is launching at high rate, SpaceX will probably carry >99 percent of Earth\u2019s payload mass to orbit. This is necessary to make Mars a self-sustaining civilization,\u201d Musk added.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT SPACEX\u2019S STARSHIP: Texas awards SpaceX $17.3M grant to expand Bastrop tech hub\n\nTo be sure, Musk has been known to make ambitious claims about when his companies\u2019 products would achieve certain milestones. For example, Musk predicted in 2018 that SpaceX could launch a rocket to Mars with humans aboard by 2024, though SpaceX only began testing the company\u2019s reusable Starship in 2023.\n\nStill, the company has been routinely testing Starship since then, and with increasing frequency, and in October, SpaceX performed the first catch of the Starship\u2019s Super Heavy booster after liftoff to demonstrate the concept that a reusable rocket could be possible. In a launch earlier this month, SpaceX again successfully caught the Super Heavy Booster, though it lost the upper stage to a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d effectively meaning that it had exploded in air and showered surrounding areas with rocket parts.\n\nThe explosion was the second consecutive launch in which debris from Starship reigned down, highlighting the continued importance of testing as SpaceX aims to make the rocket a viable product for reusable space travel.\n\nOn Friday, SpaceX also launched its Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) to rescue astronauts that have been stuck on the orbital craft, after a Boeing launch was originally intended to bring them back to Earth. While SpaceX attempted to rescue the two astronauts in September, issues with the Starliner craft\u2019s thrusters discovered upon arrival made NASA hold off on approving the return mission.",

            "content": "With estimates ranging over 500,000 vehicles, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is racing to establish a new quarterly vehicle delivery record as the fourth quarter ends. Still up for debate, though, is whether this milestone will propel an annual delivery bump.\n\nBefore the market starts on Thursday, January 2, Tesla is scheduled to reveal its fourth-quarter and full-year delivery and production data. Analyst estimates point to record-breaking Q4 deliveries only somewhat above 500,000 units. With 515,000 expected deliveries, Barclays analysts projected a year-over-year increase above Tesla's 1.8 million unit annual delivery total.\n\nThough the prospective milestone is noteworthy, Barclays pointed out that Tesla's delivery numbers might have little effect on the stock's broader optimistic picture. Driven instead by market excitement over autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, and post-election optimism, the company emphasized that Tesla's fundamentals play a lesser role in its current climb.\n\nAfter an over 5% drop on Friday, Tesla's shares dropped 2.2% on Monday and closed at $422.41. However, its important to note that the stock jumped over 20% in December. Comparable to cryptocurrencies, Barclays cautioned of a \"sharp disconnect\" between Tesla's value and fundamentals, implying that technical trading and options had been mostly responsible for the stock's rise.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",
