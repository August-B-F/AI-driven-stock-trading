            "content": "Some of America\u2019s biggest tech companies are being heavily shorted in the first quarter as traders brace for deeper losses tied to President Trump\u2019s trade agenda.\n\nAccording to Hazeltree\u2019s latest Shortside Crowdedness Report, Apple (AAPL), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron Technology (MU), Microchip Technology (MCHP), IBM (IBM), and Texas Instruments (TXN) are among the most shorted U.S. tech stocks.\n\nEach company received a \u201ccrowdedness score\u201d between 85 and 91, on a scale from 1 to 100. Higher scores indicate a larger share of hedge funds and institutional investors betting against the stock.\n\nSuper Micro Computer landed the highest crowdedness score among tech stocks at 91.\n\nIt also posted the highest \"institutional supply utilization\" rate at 53.27% \u2014 a metric that measures the proportion of institutional investors' available shares currently being lent out for short selling.\n\nInterestingly, Hazeltree connected the shorting surge to an uptick in tech-sector layoffs, suggesting worsening business conditions across the board.\n\n\u201cOur February Shortside Crowdedness Report analysis shows the U.S. tech sector continued to see layoffs, though at a slower pace than last year, alongside a surge in job postings, low unemployment, and a contracting IT job market,\u201d said Tim Smith, Hazeltree\u2019s managing director of data insights.\n\n\u201cTech remained a top target for short sellers in the Americas for the third consecutive month, with eight of the 10 most crowded large-cap securities,\u201d he added.\n\nTech sell-off deepens\n\nAlthough U.S. stocks have slumped across the board since Trump\u2019s inauguration, the tech sector has been among the hardest hit. It\u2019s facing a double-whammy: a risk-off mood on Wall Street and renewed tariffs targeting the semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe challenge is structural. U.S. tech firms remain heavily reliant on overseas chip manufacturing, particularly in Taiwan and mainland China.\n\nFor years, companies like Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Intel (INTC) embraced a \u201cfabless\u201d model \u2014 designing chips domestically but outsourcing production to overseas fabs.\n\nNow, Trump wants to reverse that.\n\nA recent White House memo cited by Axios framed Nvidia\u2019s planned U.S. expansion as \u201canother win for President Trump\u2019s push to increase U.S. manufacturing.\u201d The memo described the company\u2019s multibillion-dollar investment as proof that reshoring efforts are gaining traction.\n\nBut industry analysts say the transition will take years. The Semiconductor Industry Association estimates it will take a decade \u2014 and nearly $650 billion \u2014 to build out fabs and infrastructure capable of supporting domestic chip fabrication at scale.\n\nThe Trump administration acknowledges that reshoring will come with short-term costs \u2014 including supply chain disruption and pricing pressure \u2014 but believes it will deliver long-term economic gains.\n\nIn the meantime, traders are betting tech stocks have further to fall. For now, the bears are winning.",

            "content": "On March 24, 2025, the Moscow-based Zelenograd Nanotechnology Center reported that it had completed the development of the first Russian photolithographer with a resolution of 350 nanometers.\n\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported on his Telegram channel, \u201cThere are fewer than 10 countries in the world capable of creating this critical equipment for semiconductor manufacturing. Now, Russia is among them.\u201d\n\nThe Mayor noted that the Russian system is significantly different from its foreign counterparts. For the first time, a solid-state laser\u2014powerful, energy-efficient, with a longer lifespan and a narrower spectrum\u2014has been used as the light source.\n\nMicrochip Fabrication\n\nMicrochip fabrication involves creating billions of tiny electronic components on a wafer through a layered process. Lithography is the step that transfers a circuit pattern from a mask (a template) onto the wafer, enabling subsequent etching and deposition steps to build the chip.\n\nRole Of Photolithography Machines In Semiconductor Fabrication\n\nPhotolithography machines (often referred to as photolithographers) are an essential prerequisite for microchip fabrication and setting up a semiconductor fabrication plant (fab). They are a fundamental component of the process, without which modern chip production cannot occur.\n\nPhotolithography machines are pivotal in microchip manufacturing, serving as the core tools for patterning the intricate designs of integrated circuits onto silicon wafers during chip fabrication.\n\nFor microchip fabrication, photolithography machines are not just one of many tools\u2014they are the linchpin of the entire manufacturing process, determining a fab\u2019s viability and technological reach.\n\nTypes Of Photolithography Machines\n\nThere are two types of photolithography machines \u2013 DUV (Deep Ultraviolet) and EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography machines.\n\nDUV and EUV machines differ in their light sources and wavelengths, which directly impact the size and complexity of the features they can create.\n\nDUV machines use excimer lasers\u2014Krypton Fluoride (KrF) at 248nm or Argon Fluoride (ArF) at 193nm\u2014to emit deep ultraviolet light.\n\nEUV machines use a laser-produced plasma (LPP) system, where a CO\u2082 laser blasts tin droplets to generate 13.5nm extreme ultraviolet light.\n\nSolid State Lasers\n\nThe photolithographer developed by Russia uses a solid-state laser, unlike DUV and EUV machines that use gas lasers.\n\nSolid-state lasers have higher optical-to-optical efficiency with diode pumping (up to 20-30%), while gas lasers like CO\u2082 are less efficient (~10-15%).\n\nA solid-state laser uses a doped solid (crystal/glass) as its gain medium, differing from gas lasers (gaseous medium)\n\nThink of the gain medium as the \u201cfuel\u201d or \u201cengine\u201d inside a laser that invigorates the energy from an outside source\u2014like a flashlight bulb or electricity\u2014and turns it into the powerful, focused beam we associate with lasers.\n\nPhotolithographic Machine Manufacturing Countries\n\nAs mentioned by the Moscow mayor, there are fewer than 10 countries in the world capable of creating a photolithographic machine. They include\n\nNetherland Japan United States China Russia Turkyie\n\nThe Netherlands is the global leader. Its company, ASML, mass-produces DUV and EUV lithography machines for the global market. While other nations listed above have the capability to manufacture DUV (28nm and above) machines, ASML has a monopoly over EUV (7nm and below) systems.\n\nASML\u2019s technology integrates components from a global supply chain, but the final assembly and innovation occur domestically.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikon and Canon can both manufacture DUV lithography machines. Nikon produces systems at 28nm and above, while Canon focuses on less advanced processes.\n\nJapan once competed fiercely with ASML but has not entered the EUV market commercially, focusing instead on DUV and niche applications.\n\nBy the 1980s, United States manufacturers like GCA Corporation, which could produce photolithography machines, started to fade away. Today, no U.S. company mass-produces standalone photolithography systems for commercial fabs.\n\nHowever, U.S. companies contribute critical subsystems (e.g., optics, lasers) to ASML\u2019s machines via firms like Cymer (owned by ASML). The U.S. excels in design and components rather than full machine production.\n\nChina has made great strides in photolithography but, due to export and IP restrictions, remains behind ASML. It has yet to field an EUV machine. However, Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Group (SMEE) has produced impressive DUV systems, such as a 193nm ArF scanner reportedly capable of 7nm-8nm processes with multiple patterning (announced around 2021-2023).\n\nASML\u2019s EUV Dominance in Perspective\n\nASML\u2019s current monopoly on EUV machines stems from decades of R&D, collaboration with firms like Germany\u2019s Zeiss (for optics) and U.S. companies (for lasers), and billions in investment. EUV systems use 13.5nm wavelengths, requiring extreme precision (e.g., mirrors flat to 0.1nm), making replication by other nations extraordinarily difficult.\n\nNations with Microchip Fabrication Capability\n\nWhile just three nations\u2014the Netherlands, Japan, and China\u2014have proven capable of manufacturing photolithographic machines, the number of countries capable of manufacturing microchips is steadily rising.\n\nNations that have operational semiconductor fabs equipped with photolithography tools, such as deep ultraviolet (DUV) or extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, include\n\nTaiwan (TSMC \u2013 the global leader which plans to hit 2nm by 2026) South Korea (Samsung and SK Hynix. Samsung uses EUV lithography for advanced \u2013 3nm \u2013 nodes) United States (Intel, GlobalFoundries, and Texas Instruments) Japan (Toshiba, Renesas, TSMC, and Sony) China (SMIC) Germany (Infineon and GlobalFoundries) Netherlands (NXP) Malaysia (Infineon and Intel) Israel (Intel and Tower Semiconductor) Singapore (Globalfoundries) Russia (Mikron)\n\nRussia has a handful of companies that run fabs using imported DUV machines. Russia\u2019s main player, Mikron (based in Zelenograd near Moscow), can mass-produce chips at 90nm. In 2020, Mikron qualified a 65nm process but their output capacity is uncertain.\n\nRussia wants 28nm local chip manufacturing by 2027 and 14nm by 2030.\n\nIndian Fab Capability\n\nIndia has a strong presence in chip design, with major companies like Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm having significant R&D centers in the country. However, it is starting from scratch in terms of fabrication.\n\nIndia is in the process of setting up fabrication facilities capable of producing chips with 28-, 40-, 55-, and 110-nanometer technology nodes using imported DUV photolithography machines.\n\nIn January 2025, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos that the first \u2018Made in India\u2019 chip will be rolled out this year.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Russia\u2019s upcoming mass production of 350 nm microchips may have some limited applications despite their outdated technology, EU leaders can take comfort in knowing these chips won\u2019t even help Russia upgrade its washing machines.\n\nRussia\u2019s ability to manufacture a DUV photolithography machine is merely a baby step\u2014hardly medal-worthy. But baby steps can turn into strides and, later, even leaps.\n\nThe Zelenograd Nanotechnology Center is pressing forward under a second state contract to develop a 130 nm resolution photolithography machine, with completion expected by 2026.",

            "content": "ParkerVision Reports 2024 Results\n\n03/24/2025 - 04:50 PM\n\nParkerVision, Inc. (OTCQB:PRKR) (\"ParkerVision\"), a developer and marketer of technologies and products for wireless applications, today announced results for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nYear End 2024 Summary and Recent Developments\n\nThe U.S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\"CAFC\") overturned the federal district court's 2022 summary judgement ruling that dismissed the case prior to a jury trial in its patent infringement action against Qualcomm and ended the case. The CAFC's decision remanded the case back to be reopened in the district court in the Middle District of Florida (Orlando division) for trial. A trial date has not yet been set by the district court. The court has indicated it will set a date for trial following its ruling on remaining outstanding motions, including Qualcomm's motion for a third claim construction hearing, the Company's motion to substitute its technical expert due to serious medical issues, and Daubert motions regarding damages, among others.\n\nThe Company currently has active patent infringement cases in the Western District of Texas against MediaTek, Realtek, Texas Instruments, and NXP Semiconductors with at least two trials expected to commence in the second half of 2025 and one or more trials expected in the first half of 2026.\n\nThe Company filed a cert petition with the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the CAFC's use of Rule 36 orders to uphold decisions of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") regarding invalidation of patent claims. The Supreme Court issued its orders list today, denying the Company's petition.\n\nJeffrey Parker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The most impactful event of 2024 was the Federal Circuit's agreement with ParkerVision's appeal, reversing the Orlando district court's 2022 rulings that had ended our prospect for a jury trial in our patent infringement case against Qualcomm. This coming May will mark the start of the 12th year since this case was filed as it has faced numerous delays due to, among other things, patent validity challenges, two years of a pandemic, and, ultimately, a trip to the appellate court. We are eager to receive the district court's rulings on the remaining pending motions, after which the court has indicated it will hold a pre-trial conference and establish a trial date.\"\n\nMr. Parker continued, \"We have also made meaningful progress in our patent infringement cases in the Western District of Texas in 2024. We are anticipating at least two jury trials in the Waco court in the second half of this year, with additional trials scheduled in 2026. We are confident that juries will find our story compelling as we explain the benefits our innovations brought to the accused infringing wireless products. In certain cases, we had prior interactions with the defendants that we believe provide a basis for claims of willful infringement.\"\n\nCommenting on the recent Supreme Court decision on the Company's cert petition, Mr. Parker stated, \"We are disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision today, denying our cert petition that raised challenges to the CAFC's use of Rule 36 to affirm PTAB decisions with no written opinion. I am appreciative of the public support received for this petition, including from two former federal circuit judges, as well the number of amicus briefs filed on behalf of this petition by members of the venture capital, startup, intellectual property and national security communities.\"\n\nFinancial Results\n\nNet loss for 2024 was $14.5 million compared to net income of $9.5 million for 2023. Basic and diluted loss per common share was $(0.16) for 2024, compared to basic and diluted income per common share of $0.11 and $0.08 , respectively, in 2023. The $24 million decrease in earnings from 2023 to 2024 is primarily the result of a $25 million decrease in licensing revenue and a $9.5 million non-cash increase in loss from the change in fair value of contingent payment obligations, offset by a $10.5 million decrease in operating expenses. The decrease in revenue and related decrease in operating expenses from 2023 to 2024 is primarily the result of a $25 million license and settlement agreement reached in 2023, as a result of the Company's patent infringement litigation, and corresponding contingent expenses payable to legal counsel recognized in operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a loss of $9.6 million and $0.1 million , respectively, on the net increase in fair value of its contingent payment obligations. This increase in fair value is the result of changes in significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amounts and timing of projected future proceeds that will be used to repay the contingent obligations. The significant estimates and assumptions in 2024 were impacted, in particular, by the CAFC decision received in September 2024 that remanded the Qualcomm case back to district court.\n\nOur long-term liabilities increased by approximately $8.6 million from year-end 2023 to 2024. This increase is the result of a $9.6 million increase in our contingent payment obligations, based on an overall increase in the estimated fair value of those obligations, partially offset by a decrease in outstanding convertible notes as a result of conversions by the holders into shares of common stock during 2024.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents following a December 2024 equity financing\n\nAbout ParkerVision\n\nParkerVision, Inc. invents, develops and licenses cutting-edge, proprietary radio-frequency (RF) technologies that enable wireless solution providers to make and sell advanced wireless communication products.

This growth is catalysed by the continuous rise in AI demand and a gradual recovery in non-AI demand.\n\nTSMC leverages its technological edge in advanced nodes below 5nm and advanced packaging CoWoS, securing robust orders for AI accelerator manufacturing. With utilisation consistently at full load, TSMC is expected to expand its market share in the Foundry 2.0 market to 37% in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rebound in demand for consumer electronics\u2014such as smartphones, PCs, notebooks, TVs, and wearables\u2014has driven a projected 4% average increase in utilization for mature nodes. This resurgence fuels a significant expansion of the overall foundry market, expected to grow by 18% in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe non-memory IDM sector, hampered by insufficient deployment in AI accelerators, will experience limited expansion in 2025. Intel is aggressively promoting its process technologies, particularly the 18A process alongside Intel 3/Intel 4 processes, which are anticipated to maintain its market share in the Foundry 2.0 market at approximately 6%.\n\nIDMs specializing in automotive and industrial sectors\u2014such as Infineon, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, and NXP\u2014have completed inventory adjustments. However, market demand is expected to remain weak in the first half of 2025, with stabilisation projected for the second half. Collectively, these factors limit the overall non-memory IDM sector to a modest growth of 2% in 2025.\n\nThe Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test OSAT sector is benefiting from IDMs increasing outsourcing to foundry due to advanced nodes demands, shifting packaging and testing needs to OSAT vendors.\n\nWhile traditional packaging and testing businesses remain lukewarm, the strong demand for AI accelerators has spurred a rise in advanced packaging orders. Vendors such as SPIL (under ASE), Amkor, and KYEC are actively taking on more CoWoS-related orders, collectively driving the overall OSAT industry to an expected growth of 8% in 2025.",

Even if we\u2019re not fully at the bottom, I think we\u2019re close enough... that investors can see the upturn on the horizon.\u201d\n\nAccording to Global Market Insights, the global analog semiconductor market was valued at $87.5 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a 7.4% CAGR from 2025 to 2034 \u2014 reaching $178.9 billion by the end of that period.\n\nIn North America alone, the market is expected to hit $46.7 billion by 2034, fueled by the growth in EV manufacturing.\n\nAnalog chips play a critical role in EVs \u2014 managing power delivery, battery charging, sensor systems, and motor control. As EV adoption accelerates, it's poised to lift the entire analog semiconductor sector.",

June E-mini S&P futures (ESM25) are up +1.74%, and June E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQM25) are up +2.07%.\n\nStock indexes on Monday rallied sharply, with the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrials, and the Nasdaq 100 posting 2-week highs. Stocks rallied Monday on reports over the weekend that said the upcoming US reciprocal tariffs next week would be more targeted than previously stated and narrower than initially planned, with some countries exempt and existing tariffs on steel and other metals possibly not being cumulative. President Trump is preparing a \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement on April 2 that will include a significant expansion of reciprocal tariffs but will be more focused than the wide-ranging global tariffs that Mr. Trump has threatened, calming market fears about the impact on global trade and growth. Gains in stocks accelerated Monday when President Trump said that some nations will receive possible exemptions or reductions from next week\u2019s tariffs, saying, \u201cI may give a lot of countries breaks.\u201d\n\nThe Barchart Brief:\n\nStrength in the Magnificent Seven stocks and chip stocks Monday led the overall market higher. Also, increased M&A activity supported stocks after James Hardie Industries agreed to acquire Azek Co for $8.75 billion in cash and stock. Also, Clearlake Capital Group agreed to acquire Dun & Bradstreet Holdings for about $4.1 billion.\n\nMonday\u2019s US economic news was mixed for stocks after the Feb Chicago Fed national activity index and the Mar S&P Global services PMI rose more than expected, but the Mar S&P Global manufacturing PMI unexpectedly contracted.\n\nThe US Feb Chicago Fed national activity index unexpectedly rose +0.26 to 0.18, stronger than expectations of a decline to -0.17.\n\nThe US Mar S&P Global manufacturing PMI fell -2.9 to 49.8, weaker than expectations of 51.7. However, the Mar S&P Global services PMI rose +3.3 to 54.3, stronger than expectations of no change at 51.0.\n\nMonday\u2019s hawkish comments from Atlanta Fed President Bostic were bearish for stocks and bonds when he said he sees just one 25 bp rate cut by the Fed this year \u201cbecause I think we\u2019re going to see inflation be very bumpy and not move dramatically and in a clear way to the 2% target.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s attention will focus on Tuesday\u2019s reports on Feb new home sales (expected +3.5% m/m to 680,000) and the Conference Board\u2019s US Mar consumer confidence index (expected -4.7 to 93.6). On Wednesday, the Feb capital goods new orders nondefense ex-aircraft and parts report is expected unchanged m/m. On Thursday, Q4 GDP is expected to be unrevised at +2.3% (q/q annualized), and Mar pending home sales are expected +1.0% m/m. On Friday, Feb personal spending is expected +0.5% m/m, and Feb personal income is expected +0.4% m/m. Also, the Feb core PCE price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, is expected +0.3% m/m and +2.7% y/y. Finally, on Friday, the revised Mar University of Michigan consumer sentiment index is expected to remain unchanged at 57.9.\n\nHeightened geopolitical risks in the Middle East are negative for stocks. Israel continues its airstrikes across Gaza, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to act \u201cwith increasing military strength\u201d to free hostages and disarm Hamas. Also, the US continues to launch strikes on Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. US Defense Secretary Hegseth said strikes would be \u201cunrelenting\u201d until the group stops attacking vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthi rebels said they would respond by attacking US vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nStocks have been under pressure over the past three weeks due to fears that US tariffs will weaken economic growth and corporate earnings. On March 4, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and doubled the tariff on Chinese goods to 20% from 10%. On March 8, Mr. Trump reiterated that he would impose reciprocal tariffs and additional sector-specific tariffs on foreign nations on April 2.\n\nThe markets are discounting the chances at 16% for a -25 bp rate cut after the May 6-7 FOMC meeting.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Monday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.15%. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index recovered from a 1-1/2 week low and closed up +0.15%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.18%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nJune 10-year T-notes (ZNM25) Monday closed down -17.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose +8.3 bp to 4.329%. June T-notes retreated on Monday after stocks rallied sharply on reports that President Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs on April 2 will be more targeted than previously expected, curbing safe-haven demand for T-notes. Rising inflation expectations are bearish for T-notes after the 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose to a 2-1/2 week high Monday of 2.357%. Supply pressures also weighed on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $211 billion of T-notes and floating-rate notes this week, beginning with Tuesday\u2019s auction of $69 billion of 2-year T-notes. Losses in T-notes accelerated Monday on hawkish comments from Atlanta Fed President Bostic, who said he sees just one 25 bp rate cut by the Fed this year.\n\nEuropean bond yields on Monday were mixed. The 10-year German bund yield rose +0.6 bp to 2.771%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell from a 1-week high of 4.742% and finished unchanged at 4.713%.\n\nThe Eurozone Mar S&P manufacturing PMI rose +1.1 to a 2-year high of 48.7, stronger than expectations of 48.2.\n\nThe UK Mar S&P manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell -1.7 to 44.6, weaker than expectations of an increase to 47.2 and the steepest pace of contraction in 1-1/2 years.\n\nECB Executive Board member Cipollone said the ECB\u2019s case to keep cutting interest rates has strengthened since its last decision earlier this month.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 65% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the April 17 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks rallied Monday and boosted the overall market. Tesla TSLA closed up more than +11% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. Also, Nvidia NVDA, Amazon.com AMZN, and Meta Platforms META closed up more than +3%. In addition, Alphabet GOOGL and Apple AAPL closed up more than +1%, and Microsoft MSFT closed up +0.47%.\n\nChip stocks pushed higher on Monday to provide support to the broader market.

In addition, Analog Devices ADI, Marvell Technology MRVL, KLA Corp KLAC, and Texas Instruments TXN closed up more than +3%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks surged on Monday after the price of Bitcoin jumped more than +4% to a 2-week high. As a result, Coinbase Global COIN, MicroStrategy MSTR, MARA Holdings MARA, and Riot Platforms RIOT closed up more than +6%.\n\nAzek Co AZEK closed up more than +17% after James Hardie Industries agreed to buy the company for $8.75 billion in cash and stock.\n\nCoherent Corp COHR closed up more than +12% after Raymond James upgraded the stock to strong buy from outperform with a price target of $91.\n\nViasat Inc.

Also, Brown-Forman (BF.B) closed down more than -2%, and Kraft Heinz KHC closed down more than -1%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer SMCI closed down more than -1% after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to sell from neutral with a price target of $32.\n\nLockheed Martin LMT closed down more than -1%, adding to last Friday\u2019s -4% loss after the US government picked rival Boeing to build the next-generation US fighter jet.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best Boring Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against other best boring stocks to buy.\n\n\u201cBoring\u201d stocks, as the name suggests, are not the stocks that grab headlines like fast-growing tech stocks or high-risk investments. Instead, they belong to companies that operate in stable industries, selling everyday products and services that people and businesses need no matter what. These companies don\u2019t rely on constant innovation or disruption to grow. Instead, they focus on steady operations, generating good cash flows and providing consistent returns over time. They may not be exciting, but they can be great investments for long-term stability.\n\nHow Do We Define a Boring Stock\n\nThere is no set definition of a boring stock because investors look at them in different ways. Some may see them as companies in dull industries, others may focus on their slow but steady growth, and some may define them by their low volatility. However, boring stocks usually have a few things in common. First, they provide products or services that people will always need, meaning their business is not easily disrupted. Second, they tend to have lower stock price swings, which makes them more stable compared to high-growth stocks. Third, they generate strong cash flows and often pay dividends, making them attractive to investors looking for steady income. Finally, while they may not go up in value quickly, they have a history of delivering solid returns over long periods.\n\nWhy to Look at Boring Stocks Now\n\nIn a March 18 interview on CNBC, John Mowrey, CIO and Senior Portfolio Manager at NFJ Investment Group, shared his insights on the current market conditions. He noted that while the market appears oversold in the short term, further volatility is likely due to tight financial conditions, ongoing tariff discussions, and high valuations in large-cap growth stocks. He highlighted that current valuations are comparable to levels seen before significant market drawdowns in 2018 and 2022, urging investors to remain cautious.\n\nWith that insight, stock selection becomes of utmost importance. High-growth stocks can provide big returns, but they also come with higher risks and price swings. In times of economic uncertainty, like the one we are in now, investors often look for safer options, and boring stocks become more appealing. A good example of this mindset was shared by Neil Hennessy, Chief Market Strategist and Portfolio Manager at Hennessy Funds, in an interview with CNBC around two years ago. While discussing issues in the banking sector, he pointed out that the problems might not be as bad as they seemed. Instead of chasing risky investments, he suggested focusing on strong, reliable businesses\u2014what he called \u201cboring\u201d stocks, like coin-operated laundromats. His point was that companies with steady business models tend to perform well over time, even when the economy is uncertain.\n\nIt may not be easy to find boring stocks since they don\u2019t get as much attention as glamorous growth stocks. However, they can play an important role in a well-balanced portfolio. While they won\u2019t deliver large returns such as those from large cap tech stocks, they offer stability, steady dividends, and reliable long-term growth. With market volatility increasing, more investors are turning to these stocks as a safe and consistent way to build wealth over time.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list of 7 best boring stocks, we started with U.S. listed stocks primarily from defensive sectors with $2 billion or more in market capitalization. While our focus was on defensive sectors, we also explored other industries to identify companies that fit the \u201cboring\u201d profile. Next, we shortlisted stocks with a beta of less than 1.0, to include only stocks with lower volatility. Additionally, these stocks should have delivered an overall positive return over the last 5 years, with at least 3 of those 5 years showing positive returns. We further narrowed the list by selecting companies with a return on equity (RoE) above 10% and a positive dividend yield. Finally, we ranked the companies in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in the respective company, with the company attracting the most hedge fund interest securing the top spot.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of market close on March 18. Five-year returns data is as of December 2024 and doesn\u2019t include 2025 returns.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nTexas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nBeta: 0.98\n\n5 Year Returns: 46.2%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66\n\nTexas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) is a semiconductor company focused on analog and embedded processing chips, which are critical components in industrial automation, automotive electronics, and personal electronics.\n\nUnlike other semiconductor companies that are involved in cutting-edge technologies like AI and high-performance computing, Texas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the few in the space considered \u201cboring\u201d due to its focus on analog and embedded chips. The company\u2019s stock has not experienced a major rally in recent years, with its highest annual return in the past four years being 15%. However, it has managed to deliver positive returns in four of the last five years. Investors appreciate its disciplined capital allocation strategy, which includes steady dividend growth and consistent share repurchases, making it a popular choice for long-term investment.\n\nThe market consensus on Texas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) remains cautious, with a 1-year median price target of $200, indicating an 11% upside potential. However, in early February, Benchmark analyst Cody Acree reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $230. Around the same time, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis also maintained a Buy rating and set a price target of $284, which is the highest among analysts.\n\nOverall, TXN ranks 2nd on our list of best boring stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of TXN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TXN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Mar 24, 2025\n\nWith over 25 years in human resources \u2013 20 at the C-suite level- I\u2019ve navigated the evolving landscape of talent management across five distinct industries and two continents. From leading HR strategy at tech startups with 250 employees to orchestrating comprehensive workforce solutions for organizations of 15,000+, my experience spans the full spectrum of organizational complexity. The biggest lesson I\u2019ve learned? If it feels comfortable\u2026you\u2019re behind!\n\nTechnology Creates Opportunity, Not Obsolescence\n\nIn 1967, the calculator introduced by Texas Instruments sparked fears that bookkeepers would become obsolete. In 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 raised similar concerns for finance professionals. Today, we hear the same about AI in HR.\n\nHistory has proven these fears to be unfounded. Technologies don\u2019t eliminate jobs\u2014they transform how work gets done. Finance professionals who embraced spreadsheets shifted from delivering value through calculations to doing so through strategic analysis.\n\nThe same transformation is happening in HR. AI isn\u2019t replacing recruiters\u2014it\u2019s elevating our impact. But capturing the value requires a fundamental shift in our mindset.\n\nAdopting an Investment Mindset\n\nIf I asked you to invest $50,000 in my company, you\u2019d ask: How will you create value? What return can I expect? Over what timeframe?\n\nWhy do these questions seem to come naturally for financial investments but are often missing from org design and hiring conversations? Salary is fundamentally an investment requiring the same disciplined thought process and analysis.\n\nWe hire because we need outcomes achieved, not just tasks performed. We should consider the value of these outcomes compared to the salary we\u2019re investing to obtain them.\n\nRole Design as the Foundation of Talent Strategy\n\nThe investment mindset begins to transform how we approach hiring, but alone it isn\u2019t enough. We need to reframe why we hire in the first place.\n\nMost of us instinctively think about tasks first. Consider hiring an accountant: \u201cFollow up on delinquent accounts\u201d traditionally appears in the job description. Yet this task is merely a means to an end. The real focus should be the outcome (the end itself), in this case, reducing \u201cdays outstanding\u201d from 90 to 30 days. This outcome directly impacts organizational cash flow and financial health. So why focus on the tactic, when the outcome drives business value?\n\nEffective role design answers four critical questions:\n\nHow does this role support broader strategy?\n\nWhat specific outcomes constitute strategic contribution?\n\nHow will success be measured?\n\nWhat growth paths exist for the individual?\n\nWe hire to achieve outcomes, not just to perform activities. Effort without results delivers little value.\n\nWhen we establish these elements upfront, we improve the entire lifecycle. Sourcing becomes easier, interviewing more targeted, selection more accurate, and turnover lower. Strategic role design doesn\u2019t just improve hiring; it transforms the entire talent lifecycle, and raises engagement, as employees work with greater purpose and autonomy.\n\nAccording to a study by Towers Watson, engaged employees tend to produce about 16% more than we pay them, while disengaged employees deliver just 60% of their payroll value.\n\nThe New Value Proposition\n\nBy adopting an outcomes-focused mindset and helping managers do the same, talent professionals transform their roles. Rather than merely executing processes, they become strategic thought partners who shape how organizations design, acquire, and develop talent.\n\nWhen managers gain clarity about roles and their intended outcomes, this clarity naturally flows through the entire talent acquisition process. They talk with candidates and manage employee performance differently.\n\nOnce there\u2019s been a mindset shift, technology becomes the enabler. It creates bandwidth for consultative activities, deeper strategic conversations, and more thorough candidate assessment.\n\nIt takes courage to share what managers need to hear, not just what they want to hear. So, a new set of advanced skills will also be required:\n\nStrategic Business Acumen: Understand business operations, financial models, market dynamics, and customer needs to connect role design to strategy.\n\nConsulting Skills: Challenge assumptions, ask probing questions, and guide better talent decisions as a trusted advisor.\n\nSystems Thinking: Recognize how talent decisions interconnect; how role changes affect hiring, development, engagement, and retention.\n\nRelationship Building: Cultivate trust and influence as technology handles transactions, making human connections the differentiator.\n\nProactively Driving Technology Selection\n\nArmed with a new mindset, TA pros can become more proactive and strategic about technology adoption. Clear role design transforms technology selection from a features comparison to an outcome-driven discussion:\n\nMore Reactive: \u201cWe need an AI screening tool (because our competitors have one).\u201d\n\nMore Proactive: \u201cEach role in our company has a connection to our business strategy, and objective measures of success. Now we need a technology that identifies candidates with Y capabilities and Z experiences.\u201d\n\nThis approach positions talent professionals to lead technology conversations. By grounding technology selection in role design, talent professionals become strategic advisors who articulate exactly why certain tools create value. That\u2019s the ROI part of the conversation.\n\nExecutive Alignment: Creating the Foundation\n\nThis shift requires alignment from the Chief People Officer and CEO as well. Organizations must prepare for fewer but higher-level talent acquisition professionals. As AI handles transactional work, remaining team members must deliver higher-value contributions. Organizations need to be ready to invest \u2013 not just in technology \u2013 but in advanced level skill development for talent professionals. This combination of elevated strategic value plus technology-created bandwidth produces the ROI.\n\nConclusion: Adapt Thinking, Don\u2019t Just Adopt Tools\n\nTechnology is important. It creates bandwidth. But we create value. Proactively staying relevant during periods of rapid change is about mindset. Start by rethinking role design: How can you help managers align hires with business outcomes? Tomorrow\u2019s talent leaders won\u2019t just be divided by who adopts AI, but by who fundamentally rethinks their value proposition. By helping managers design roles that connect directly to business results, we transform how we select candidates, engage employees, and ultimately, how we choose the technologies that we need to help us.",

            "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Texas Instruments, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.17 = US$5.4b \u00f7 (US$36b - US$3.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nTherefore, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 17%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Semiconductor industry average of 7.2% it's much better.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Return on Capital Employed March 22nd 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Texas Instruments compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Texas Instruments .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Texas Instruments doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 36%, but since then they've fallen to 17%. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. This could mean that the business is losing its competitive advantage or market share, because while more money is being put into ventures, it's actually producing a lower return - \"less bang for their buck\" per se.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFrom the above analysis, we find it rather worrisome that returns on capital and sales for Texas Instruments have fallen, meanwhile the business is employing more capital than it was five years ago. Yet despite these poor fundamentals, the stock has gained a huge 105% over the last five years, so investors appear very optimistic. Regardless, we don't feel too comfortable with the fundamentals so we'd be steering clear of this stock for now.\n\nIf you want to continue researching Texas Instruments, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.",

To celebrate its quasquicentennial, the orchestra\u2019s 2025-26 season highlights significant moments, artists and music from the orchestra\u2019s history.\n\nThe orchestra was founded in 1900 with 40 musicians under the direction of conductor Hans Kreissig. It is the oldest orchestra in Texas and one of the oldest in the nation.\n\nWatch NBC 5 free wherever you are WATCH HERE WATCH HERE\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to unveil an extraordinary concert season that celebrates the DSO\u2019s 125th anniversary,\u201d said Michelle Miller Burns, the orchestra\u2019s Ross Perot President & CEO. \u201cThis season, we continue our longstanding tradition of artistic excellence with a dynamic lineup of programming, including world premieres and cherished masterworks within the Texas Instruments Classical Series, and thrilling fan-favorites in the Pops Series Presented by Capital One. We look forward to welcoming audiences to experience the joy of 125 years of music with us at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center.\u201d\n\nThe 2025-26 season marks the sixth year of Fabio Luisi as the orchestra\u2019s Music Director.\n\nGet top local stories in DFW delivered to you every morning with NBC DFW's News Headlines newsletter. SIGN UP SIGN UP\n\n\u201cI am honored to be part of the DSO\u2019s history as its Music Director. This season brings joy in recognizing what we have accomplished in recent years, provides a moment to reflect on our past 125 years, and presents an opportunity to look forward to the exciting, essential work we will continue to pursue,\u201d Luisi said. \u201cI am particularly eager to further develop two crucial skills of the DSO: sound shaping and spontaneous musicianship. In this spirit, it makes perfect sense that this season we will deepen the DSO\u2019s connection with the music of Gustav Mahler.\u201c\n\nAmong the 11 programs that he will lead as part of the Texas Instruments Classical Series are\n\nMahler\u2019s Fourth Symphony in concerts October 2 and 5; Bruckner\u2019s Symphony No. 9 on Jan. 15 and 16; and the glorious Eighth Symphony (\u201cSymphony of a Thousand\u201d) on May 15 and 17.\n\nLuisi will also present Puccini\u2019s Madama Butterfly as this season\u2019s opera-in-concert production on Jan. 9 and 11, continuing the orchestra\u2019s tradition of presenting operas as concerts.\n\nThe 2025 Symphony Gala is a nod to the orchestra\u2019s history. On Oct. 4, Luisi will lead the orchestra in Beethoven\u2019s Egmont Overture, which Sir Georg Solti conducted at the first subscription concert of his tenure as Music Director in the early 1960s at the orchestra\u2019s then-home venue, McFarlin Memorial Auditorium at SMU. The 2025 Gala program culminates with the glorious Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto featuring Artist-in-Residence Leonidas Kavakos. This annual fundraising event is the official start of the season and benefits the DSO\u2019s education and outreach initiatives including the Young Strings and Kim Noltemy Young Musicians programs.\n\nThe milestone season combines classics and new works.\n\nAlong with historic pieces, the 2025-26 season features six world premieres. A few are so new they don\u2019t have titles yet.\n\nThe orchestra commissioned former Composer-in-Residence Ang\u00e9lica Negr\u00f3n to write an expansive work for orchestra, chorus and four vocalists in honor of the orchestra\u2019s 125th anniversary. The new work will be premiered Oct. 16\u201318, alongside Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue, and Gould\u2019s Latin-American Symphonette.\n\nKathryn Bostic, Emmy-nominated composer of film, TV and Broadway music, pays homage to Harlem Renaissance blues singer Gladys Bentley in a new work commissioned by the orchestra. Written for soprano and orchestra, the work will feature Karen Slack as the soloist. Marin Alsop will lead the orchestra in this world premiere Nov. 7\u20139, in a program also featuring Strauss\u2019 Don Juan and Brahms\u2019 Second Symphony.\n\nLuisi will lead the orchestra in a program featuring two world premieres Nov. 20\u201322: Dallas-based composer Jonathan Cziner\u2019s Clarinet Concerto featuring DSO Principal Clarinet Gregory Raden and composer/pianist Moni (Jasmine) Guo\u2019s new work titled \u201cthe sound of where i came from\u201d \u4e61\u97f3.\n\nSphinx alumna Melissa White makes her Dallas Symphony Orchestra debut with the world premiere of Composer-in-Residence Sophia Jani\u2019s Violin Concerto on Feb. 12\u201315. Led by Norwegian conductor Tabita Berglund, the orchestra will also perform Tchaikovsky\u2019s Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture and Rachmaninoff\u2019s Symphonic Dances on the program.\n\nThe orchestra will perform the sixth world premiere of the season on April 16-19. Principal Viola Meredith Kufchak will be the featured soloist in a new concerto from Grammy-nominated composer Jonathan Leshnoff. Colombian conductor Ana Mar\u00eda Pati\u00f1o-Osorio\u2019s debut program with the DSO also includes Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Cello Concerto (with Julian Steckel) and Mendelssohn\u2019s \u201cItalian Symphony.\u201d\n\nThe 2025-26 season marks Jeff Tyzik\u2019s 13th year as Principal Pops Conductor.\n\n\"Collaborating with the remarkable musicians of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra is always a privilege, but this season is truly special. As we celebrate 125 years of extraordinary music-making, the energy and passion are palpable. I can\u2019t wait to bring this thrilling lineup to life and share it with audiences,\u201d Tyzik said.\n\nThe Pops Series features Troupe Vertigo; the US Naval Academy\u2019s Men\u2019s & Women\u2019s Glee Clubs and Pipes & Drum Corps performing with the orchestra in a program of patriotic favorites in celebration of America\u2019s 250th anniversary; Icons of the Strip: Sinatra & The Rat Pack; Dolly Parton\u2019s Threads: My Songs in Symphony; and a 125th anniversary Pops celebration called Pops Through Time: Iconic Scores & Classic Hits.\n\nPrincipal Conductor, Dallas Symphony Presents, Enrico Lopez-Ya\u00f1ez brings La Vida Loca to the Meyerson Symphony Center Jan. 30 \u2013 Feb. 1. The show features Lopez-Ya\u00f1ez\u2019s original symphonic arrangements of Latin pops hits of the 1990s and 2000s from artists such as Enrique Iglesias, Gloria Estefan, Santana and Ricky Martin.\n\nThis season\u2019s movies-in-concert performances include Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on Sept. 4\u20137, Home Alone on Dec. 5\u20137 and Top Gun: Maverick on May 22\u201324, 2026.\n\nBefore the orchestra officially wraps up the milestone season in June 2026, the orchestra will tour the West Coast. In the spring of 2026. Luisi and the orchestra bring the Schumann Piano Concerto (featuring H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Grimaud) and Mahler\u2019s Fourth Symphony to audiences in three cities in California: Palm Desert on March 31, Santa Barbara on April 1 and Costa Mesa on April 2.\n\nLearn more: Dallas Symphony Orchestra",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the way businesses approach marketing, offering powerful tools to improve efficiency, customer engagement, and lead generation. While large corporations have been early adopters of AI-driven marketing strategies, small local businesses are now discovering how AI can help them stay competitive in an evolving digital landscape. Industry expert Newell Starks sheds light on how small businesses can effectively implement AI to enhance their marketing efforts.\n\nNewell Starks is a seasoned business strategist with over 30 years of experience in technology and business transformation. With a background in engineering and investment, he has worked with major companies like Texas Instruments, Citicorp Venture Capital, Sterling Holding Company, and Stratos International. As the founder of YourLeadPartners, Starks focuses on helping businesses navigate technological shifts, particularly in AI-driven marketing and client acquisition.\n\nThe Growing Role of AI in Small Business Marketing\n\nAI is no longer a tool reserved for large enterprises; small businesses can now access AI-powered solutions to streamline marketing processes, reduce costs, and improve customer interactions. AI tools enable businesses to analyse data, predict customer behaviour, and automate repetitive marketing tasks, making their campaigns more effective and efficient.\n\nSome of the key areas where AI is transforming small business marketing include:\n\n1. AI-Powered Customer Targeting and Personalisation\n\nAI enables small businesses to analyse customer data and create personalised marketing campaigns. Machine learning algorithms can track customer preferences, online behaviours, and purchase history, allowing businesses to tailor their messaging and offers to specific audiences. Personalised marketing not only enhances customer engagement but also increases conversion rates.\n\n2. Chatbots and AI-Driven Customer Support\n\nSmall businesses often struggle with providing 24/7 customer support due to limited resources. AI-powered chatbots can assist customers in real-time, answering frequently asked questions, resolving issues, and guiding users through the purchasing process. This improves customer satisfaction and frees up human resources for more complex tasks.\n\n3. Marketing Automation for Efficiency\n\nAI-powered marketing automation tools help businesses save time and effort. These tools can manage email campaigns, schedule social media posts, and optimise ad placements based on audience insights. Automating repetitive marketing tasks allows small business owners to focus on strategy and customer engagement rather than manual work.\n\n4. AI for Social Media and Content Creation\n\nAI-driven tools can assist in content generation, helping small businesses produce high-quality blog posts, social media updates, and video content. AI can also analyse engagement metrics and suggest the best times to post, ensuring maximum visibility and impact.\n\n5. Data-Driven Decision Making\n\nAI tools provide real-time analytics and predictive insights, allowing businesses to make informed marketing decisions. Instead of relying on guesswork, small business owners can use AI to track campaign performance, optimise ad spending, and refine their strategies based on accurate data.\n\nOvercoming AI Adoption Challenges\n\nWhile AI presents numerous opportunities for small businesses, some challenges need to be addressed. The main hurdles include:\n\nLack of technical expertise : Many small business owners are unfamiliar with AI tools and how to implement them.\n\nBudget constraints : AI solutions can be expensive, but many affordable and scalable options are now available.\n\nIntegration with existing systems : Businesses must ensure that AI solutions align with their current marketing tools and workflows.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, Newell Starks advises businesses to start small by adopting AI tools that address specific pain points. For example, implementing an AI-powered chatbot for customer service or using an AI-driven email marketing tool can provide immediate benefits without requiring a significant investment.\n\nThe Future of AI in Small Business Marketing\n\nAI will continue to play a crucial role in shaping the future of small business marketing. As AI technology advances, it will become even more accessible and affordable for local businesses. Companies that embrace AI early on will gain a competitive advantage by improving customer engagement, increasing efficiency, and driving revenue growth.\n\nAccording to Newell Starks, small businesses should approach AI adoption with a clear strategy, selecting tools that align with their goals and gradually integrating AI into their operations. By leveraging AI effectively, local businesses can compete with larger players, enhance their marketing efforts, and secure long-term success in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nAI is no longer an exclusive resource for large enterprises; small local businesses can now use AI to enhance marketing, customer engagement, and decision-making. With expert insights from Newell Starks, businesses can better understand how to integrate AI into their strategies and maximise its benefits. By leveraging AI tools for personalisation, automation, and analytics, small businesses can stay competitive and thrive in today\u2019s fast-changing market.\n\nFeature Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay",

(Photo by Gregg Brekke)\n\nThe two-day meeting brought committee members to the island of Puerto Rico to witness and understand the ongoing needs of the U.S. territory that has been ravaged by a series of hurricanes and an earthquake in recent years.\n\nBeginning its work at the PC(USA)-affiliated Seminario Evang\u00e9lico de Puerto Rico, committee members discussed proposed and upcoming shareholder resolutions that were filed with Antero Resources Corporation, Dollar General, Duke Energy, Oxy, Albertsons Companies, Delta, Expedia and Texas Instruments. All but the resolutions with Antero and Albertsons have been withdrawn in exchange for significant commitments from the named companies.\n\nAdditionally, in response to Walmart rolling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, MRTI signed on to an investor letter to encourage its reconsideration and dialogue with the company is ongoing.\n\n\u201cSuccess is hard \u2014 it\u2019s a spectrum,\u201d said Katie Carter, director of faith-based investing and shareholder engagement at the PC(USA) in response to comments about the long-term results of engagement with partners and corporate groups. Some of the most important conversations \u201cwould have never happened if we\u2019d divested.\u201d\n\nEchoing the desire to stay engaged to effect corporate change, which cannot happen if the PC(USA) divests its holdings in a corporation, the Rev. Marci Glass, MRTI committee chair, said, \u201cThere is a win even if the needle is moving slowly \u2014 but that can\u2019t happen if we leave.\u201d\n\nCarter informed the committee that MRTI had shifted its reporting structure as part of changes initiated by the Interim Unified Agency. MRTI, along with several advocacy committees, had previous reported to Barry Creech in the Presbyterian Mission Agency. With the merging of the Mission Agency and the Office of the General Assembly, MRTI now reports to Kerry Rice, deputy stated clerk, who had previously overseen OGA\u2019s committees.\n\nFurther discussion on the \u201ctop 10\u201d fossil fuel companies added to the PC(USA) 2025 Divestment List as required by the 226th General Assembly (ENV-06) included comments on the difficulty of engaging foreign companies, primarily different shareholder resolution regulation and processes, location and language, that limited the original engagement criteria to U.S.-based companies. In later business, the committee decided not to amend the top 10 fossil fuel list pending further advice from the General Assembly and the results of an evaluation of MRTI and its policies by the 1984 divestment policy task force.\n\nWhile at the seminary, committee members heard from Prof. Emilio Pantojas, a sociology professor at the University of Puerto Rico, who spoke on the theme of \u201cFrom Sugar Cane to Tax Haven,\u201d chronicling the change in an economic situation that has resulted in mass investment in Puerto Rico with little return for the inhabitants of the island. With a low 4% tax rate for foreign investors, and the ability for the ultra-wealthy to use anonymous numbered accounts to move money, he noted, \u201cPuerto Rico\u2019s economy is still shrinking.\u201d\n\nDr. Gonzalo Alers, a New Testament professor at the seminary, also spoke to the committee on the effects colonialism has had on the people of Puerto Rico and the theological implications.\n\n\u201cPeople have tried to say what Puerto Ricans are for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the only people who know who Puerto Ricans are us.\u201d\n\nCommittee members discussed how to best represent the concerns they heard through their powers of corporate engagement. Although no corporations were named, the prospect of engaging private equity firms buying large amounts of land and developing properties that price local inhabitants out of their homes was proposed, in addition to adding criteria to the MRTI Guideline Metrics about how a company repairs past actions and harms.\n\nTo better understand from Puerto Ricans who they are and learn from their work on economic, environmental and social justice, committee members visited Fideicomiso del Ca\u00f1o Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a (Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a Canal Land Trust) and the ENLACE project that is restoring the canal connecting the harbor lagoons around San Juan. Project coordinator Estrella Santiago P\u00e9rez described the dramatic turnaround that has happened because of the cleanup and restoration effort, and toured portions of the canal and surrounding communities with MRTI committee members.\n\nFideicomiso del Ca\u00f1o Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a and ENLACE have been supported by Presbyterian Disaster Assistance.\n\nThe following day, committee members visited another PDA-supported project, Taller Salud (Health Workshop) that began as a women\u2019s collective dedicated to improving women's access to health care, reducing community violence, and fostering economic development through education and activism. Taller Salud\u2019s executive director, Tania Rosario M\u00e9ndez, gave committee members an overview of the organization\u2019s 45-year grassroots efforts that included disaster relief in recent years in addition to its primary goals.\n\nMRTI members also met with the National Presbyterian Hispanic Latino Caucus, which was concurrently holding its gathering in Puerto Rico. Members of the two groups discussed ways in which each could inform the work of the other, including a proposal for a letter of understanding that would allow the National Presbyterian Hispanic Latino Caucus to bring issues and concerns to MRTI for consideration.\n\nA more detailed report on partner visits will be available in an upcoming article.\n\nThese sessions and other encounters informed the MRTI committee as they discussed the impact the visit will have on their future work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given me a new perspective on Puerto Rico,\u201d said Ken Whitehurst from Stone Mountain, Georgia. \u201cEspecially how many people here don\u2019t want it to become the 51st state.\u201d\n\nSeeing first-hand the effects of environmental racism, committee member Kymberlaine Banks from Garland, Texas, said, \u201cYou just met someone who\u2019s family members are dying, and that\u2019s hard. These are people who need others to partner with them and say what needs to be said to corporate interests.\u201d\n\nOn that note, committee members considered the question: What does courage in corporate engagement look like in the current political climate?\n\nCommittee member Brenton Thompson from Philadelphia suggested the work of MRTI could expand to include dialogue with other PC(USA) entities including PDA, the Presbyterian Committee on the Self-Development of People and the Advisory Committee on Social Witness Policy.\n\nWith the assumption that fewer shareholder resolutions will be filed in the next year, Simon Doong, associate for corporate, community and church engagement, proposed the approach of such engagements might change in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe asks may look slightly different, Doong says, but the goal and commitment remain the same.\n\n\u201cWe used to lead with the moral imperative (of corporate responsibility) and then build the business case,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we need to lead with the business case and follow up with the moral imperative.\u201d\n\nMRTI was created in recognition of the PC(USA)'s unique opportunity to advance its mission faithfully and creatively through the financial resources entrusted it. MRTI implements the General Assembly\u2019s policies on socially responsible investing \u2014 also called faith-based investing \u2014 by engaging corporations in which the church owns stock.",

            "content": "Just because a business does not make any money, does not mean that the stock will go down. For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.\n\nSo, the natural question for SiTime ( ) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway.\n\nHow Long Is SiTime's Cash Runway?\n\nA company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. When SiTime last reported its December 2024 balance sheet in February 2025, it had zero debt and cash worth US$419m. Importantly, its cash burn was US$13m over the trailing twelve months. That means it had a cash runway of very many years as of December 2024. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.\n\nHow Well Is SiTime Growing?\n\nIt was quite stunning to see that SiTime increased its cash burn by 221% over the last year. On the bright side, at least operating revenue was up 41% over the same period, giving some cause for hope. In light of the data above, we're fairly sanguine about the business growth trajectory. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at .\n\nCan SiTime Raise More Cash Easily?\n\nSiTime seems to be in a fairly good position, in terms of cash burn, but we still think it's worthwhile considering how easily it could raise more money if it wanted to. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash and fund growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).\n\nSiTime has a market capitalisation of US$4.3b and burnt through US$13m last year, which is 0.3% of the company's market value. That means it could easily issue a few shares to fund more growth, and might well be in a position to borrow cheaply.\n\nHow Risky Is SiTime's Cash Burn Situation?\n\nIt may already be apparent to you that we're relatively comfortable with the way SiTime is burning through its cash. For example, we think its cash runway suggests that the company is on a good path. While we must concede that its increasing cash burn is a bit worrying, the other factors mentioned in this article provide great comfort when it comes to the cash burn. Looking at all the measures in this article, together, we're not worried about its rate of cash burn; the company seems well on top of its medium-term spending needs.

TXN stock has also underperformed its industry peers, including NVIDIA NVDA, STMicroelectronics STM and Intel INTC.\n\nSix-Month Price Return Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nReason Behind TXN\u2019s Underperformance\n\nTXN\u2019s underperformance highlights challenges stemming from weakness in its industrial, automotive and enterprise systems end markets. The industrial and automotive markets, which together account for 70% of Texas Instruments\u2019 revenues, experienced modest sequential declines in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, TXN\u2019s Embedded Processing segment, which has contributed more than 15% to its total revenues in the past five years, is facing the industry\u2019s cyclicity resulting in decreased sales.\n\nMargins of the Embedded Processing segment are also under pressure as TXN expands its Lehi facility in Utah with the construction of a second fabrication facility, LFAB2, which will be integrated with the existing LFAB1. This expansion has led to underutilization of the entire Lehi factory, which primarily supports Embedded Processing products.\n\nInvestors are also spooked by the U.S. government\u2019s stance toward China and have been concerned about its negative impact on TXN\u2019s business. Texas Instruments is significantly exposed to the Chinese market, which accounted for approximately 20% of its 2024 revenues. Rising geopolitical tensions and potential trade restrictions amid the U.S.-China face-off can potentially impact the future TXN\u2019s performance.\n\nNevertheless, it's not all gloom and doom for Texas Instruments investors, as the company is actively implementing measures to drive a rebound.\n\nTXN\u2019s Road to Recovery: Key Strategies for Growth\n\nWhile the industrial and automotive markets remain stagnant, TXN is strategically building its inventory, maintaining a healthy level of $4.5 billion. This inventory will enable the company to swiftly meet customer demand once the market rebounds, avoiding the need for a sudden production ramp-up.\n\nFurthermore, TXN recently received $1.6 billion in CHIPS Act funding from the U.S. government. This funding will support new 300mm wafer fabs in Texas and Utah, strengthening TXN\u2019s position as a dependable supplier of analog and embedded chips.",

            "content": "AMD CEO Lisa Su has been the highest-paid female CEO for five years running, according to an AP survey.\n\nOn Su's watch, AMD's market cap has grown from $2 billion to $175 billion in a decade, surpassing rival Intel along the way.\n\nShe's now taking on Nvidia and trying to grab a bigger chunk of the artificial intelligence market.\n\nWhen Lisa Su became CEO of Advanced Micro Devices in late 2014, the company was in dire straits and on the brink of potential bankruptcy.\n\nIn its core market, computer processors, AMD wasn't competitive with rival Intel. The company had billions of dollars of debt, and had committed to manufacturing chips for customers that may or may not exist. By the end of the year, AMD was worth a mere $2 billion in market value, while Intel was valued at about $180 billion.\n\n\"I actually had mentors in my career saying, you know, I don't think that that's a good move,\" Su, 55, said in a speech at Stanford University in March, reflecting on her decision to take the gig a little over a decade earlier.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nSu is in a very different spot today.\n\nAMD passed rival Intel in market value in 2022 and is now worth $172 billion, a roughly 85-fold increase during Su's tenure. Millions of gamers rely on AMD processors every day as they power up their Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation consoles. AMD chips are so important that the U.S. government sees them as critical to national security.\n\nYet AMD still views itself as an underdog. That's because it's a distant second in artificial intelligence, behind Nvidia, the almost $3 trillion behemoth that dominates the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs. To have a serious role in the future of technology, AMD knows it needs a bigger chunk of the AI GPU market, where the biggest tech companies in the world are spending many billions of dollars a year on advanced infrastructure.\n\nUnderpinning AMD's strategy is Su's belief, rooted in her engineering background, that success in this industry is driven by making the right technical decisions that lead to the highest-performance chips. It can take a long time to see the results show up in products.\n\n\"One of the things that I like to say about the semiconductor industry, or technology in general, is the decisions that we make today, you will really see the impact three to five years down the road,\" Su said at Stanford. \"It is all about making the right bets.\"\n\nSu stands out in Silicon Valley, especially during Women's History Month, because she's the only female CEO among the top 10 semiconductor companies by market cap. Chips remain a male-dominant field, with women accounting for just 30% of the industry's head count, according to Accenture.\n\nShe's also been the highest-paid female CEO for five years running, according to an Associated Press survey.\n\nThe stats aren't favorable across the corporate world. About 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women, with 52 in the group in 2024, up from 41 in 2021, according to the Women Business Collaborative.\n\n'She knows what they do'\n\nSu, who's known to make bets in her personal life \u2014 she's a fan of Texas Hold 'em, and has been spotted playing poker with her sales staff \u2014 is making a long-term professional wager on AI.\n\nAMD has committed to announcing new AI chips on an annual basis and building out a software division with thousands of employees to create open-source tools for its chips that can compete with Nvidia's dominant CUDA language.\n\nSu is deeply involved with the company's technology road map, frequently visiting the company's chip labs, said AMD technology chief Mark Papermaster.\n\n\"Lisa is so admired by the engineering team because she knows what they do, and they know she knows it,\" Papermaster said.\n\nAMD declined to make Su available for an interview.\n\nSu was born in Taiwan in 1969 and came to the U.S. as a child because her dad came for graduate school. She's described her childhood as a \"typical Asian upbringing\" centered around school. She attended The Bronx High School of Science in New York.\n\nShe first encountered the semiconductor industry as a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she did her undergraduate work before pursuing a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Her research centered on the manufacturing side of chips.\n\nAs a graduate student in 1992, she wrote an award-winning paper about testing silicon-on-insulator technology. That ended up being one of the core production methods used to improve chips during the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nSu went to work at Texas Instruments after graduating and then IBM, overseeing research and design teams focused on chip manufacturing. There, she was tapped to be the technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM's chair and CEO at the time.\n\nAfter IBM, Su joined Freescale Semiconductor as its CTO, a particularly rare feat, as even today only about 8% of tech companies have women in that role.\n\nIn 2012, she was hired by AMD's then-CEO Rory Read to run the company's business units.\n\nSu's ascension to the top role in 2014 kicked off one of the biggest turnarounds in the history of the technology industry. When she joined AMD, it was a company at a low point and many people believed it might not survive much longer.\n\n\"AMD was having some serious cash issues,\" said Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights and a former AMD executive who left the year before Su joined. \"AMD had to completely press the reset button.\"\n\nAnnabelle Chih | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nOn her first day as CEO, AMD's stock was trading at just over $3 per share. It's now at more than $106 per share. AMD is the fourth-most-valuable U.S. chip company, ahead of Intel, and behind Nvidia, Broadcom and Qualcomm.\n\nThe rebound started with tough decisions nearly as soon as Su took over. That included cutting 7% of AMD's staff.\n\nShe also turned to Sony and Microsoft to build AMD's game console chips, a move designed to help the company's cash flow and to fill the chip factories it had already committed to using.\n\nBut Su said during her talk at Stanford that it wasn't the cuts that saved AMD. Rather, it was the bet on developing new technology.\n\n\"It's fairly clear in tech, there's no such thing as cutting yourself to be a winner,\" she said.\n\nSu turned AMD's attention to products, and she encouraged staff to prioritize building the highest-performance chips. She also made the decision to stop selling lucrative server chips until AMD had products that could compete with Intel on performance, Papermaster said.\n\nRedesigning from the ground up\n\nOne big problem for AMD was that its processor design was aging \u2014 and quickly.\n\nSu approved a \"blank sheet\" approach that emphasized a redesigned compute core \u2014 AMD's most valuable intellectual property \u2014 from the ground up. It took years, and AMD didn't start selling products based on its \"Zen\" core until 2017. The technology is now on its fifth generation of improvements.\n\nOn Su's watch, AMD was the first major company to embrace a technology called \"chiplets.\" Instead of manufacturing one big chip with all the elements needed \u2014 the compute cores as well as an input and output block \u2014 AMD could make smaller chips and then assemble them together.\n\nChiplets allowed AMD to be more flexible and more efficient in manufacturing. The change also allowed AMD to use different foundries for different parts of the chip, and reduce the risk associated with manufacturing, a critical consideration due to the company's tight cash position. It was a good fit for AMD, especially as it transitioned in 2019 to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to build its chips.\n\nThe focus on chiplets allowed AMD to grow at a time when Intel was suffering from its investments in the wrong manufacturing technologies, said Scott Thompson, professor of electrical engineering at the University of Florida, who said he has followed Su's career since her doctorate.\n\n\"Lisa Su knows fundamentally how chips are made,\" Thompson said. \"She understands the risk with different technology options, and she can assess that risk and make the right choice.\"\n\nIntel declined to comment.\n\nChiplets are now used by nearly every major processor company, and the technology was a core part of AMD's first \"big GPU.\"\n\nAMD's experience in chiplets enabled it to take an announced data center GPU \u2014 originally designed for supercomputing, which is different from AI applications \u2014 and simply swap out the CPU chiplets to make it one large GPU better suited for AI. AMD's first big GPU, the Instinct MI300X, launched in 2023, just over a year after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and kicked off the generative AI boom.\n\nBenoit Tessier | Ritzau Scanpix | Mads Claus Rasmussen | Reuters\n\nThe next arc\n\nAMD's revenue in 2024 jumped 14% to about $26 billion, nearly five times as much as when Su took over as CEO. The company spent $6.5 billion on research last year, over six times its outlay in 2014.\n\nBut its current relationship to the GPU market leader, Nvidia, resembles its standing against Intel in CPUs a decade ago.\n\nAMD has AI accelerators on the market, has told customers and investors when to expect future chips, and recorded $5 billion in AI chip sales last year, up from $100 million in 2023, according to Papermaster.\n\nStill, it lags far behind Nvidia, which reported $115 billion of data center chip and networking sales in its latest fiscal year.\n\nAMD shares are down more than 10% so far this year after dropping 18% in 2024. That followed a 128% pop the prior year.\n\nThe biggest challenge for Su may lie in software.\n\nAMD's hardware is comparable to Nvidia's chips and can even win in some benchmarks. The company's AI chips are viable, and Su is building their credibility.\n\nWhile AMD is the only real alternative to Nvidia, most AI developers already know how to use Nvidia's proprietary CUDA software, which allows programmers to access core hardware parts of a GPU for AI development.\n\nFor Su, the answer is ROCm.\n\nThat's AMD's version of CUDA, and it's free to use. Su is counting on ROCm to help AMD win over developers who want more than just what Nvidia offers.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year, AMD reorganized some of its software groups, including the teams working on ROCm, into a new AI software division. AMD also began to open source many of its important components and hardware details, allowing programmers to more easily access the raw power of the company's AI chips.\n\nTo achieve widespread adoption of ROCm, Su will need her team to hit up AI developers and make efforts to shake off AMD's reputation as a hardware-only company.\n\nIn December, Su personally reached out to one public critic of AMD's software, posting on social media after the meeting that \"we have put a ton of work into customer and workload optimizations but there is lots more we can do.\"\n\nSu generally plays down the market-share rivalry with Nvidia. She sees the AI chip market growing to $500 billion per year by 2028 \u2014 the same size as the entire semiconductor market before the AI boom.\n\nShe's counting on AMD to get a big chunk of it.\n\nWATCH: AMD beats on Q4 results, CEO Lisa Su calls 2024 'transformative' year",

It has all the essential features that you\u2019ll need from it even with its small size, like an Arm 32-bit Cortex-M0+ CPU, capable of operating at frequencies up to 24MHz that can give you sufficient processing power. For data processing, it can offer up to 16KB of flash memory for program storage and 1KB of SRAM for data processing. It also has a 12-bit analog-to-digital (ADC) converter so it can interface with analog sensors.\n\nThis MCU is designed for low-power consumption so you can use it for battery-powered devices and its low-power mode can even extend its battery life. Its size is perfect for medical wearable devices like health monitors, hearing aids, and medical probes. It can also be used for small personal electronics like earbuds, smart pens, stylus devices, and fitness trackers. It can also be used for environmental sensors and small monitoring devices since it has analog to digital capabilities.\n\nBasically, any device or application that needs a small and efficient microcontroller will find the MSPM0C1104 useful especially in terms of size and cost. They even have a LaunchPad development kit that companies or product developers can purchase if they want to try it out first before buying in bulk for their devices. This innovation from Texas Instruments underscores a crucial trend in modern electronics: miniaturization without compromise. The MSPM0C1104\u2019s ability to deliver robust processing power, essential analog capabilities, and low-power efficiency within such a remarkably small footprint opens up a new realm of possibilities for device design. It\u2019s not just about shrinking components; it\u2019s about enabling entirely new categories of products that were previously constrained by size and power limitations.",

            "content": "First 48V integrated hot-swap eFuse with power-path protection Technology News | March 20, 2025 By Nick Flaherty\n\n\n\nTexas Instruments (TI) has launched several power-management chips for datacentre designs, including the first 48V device with integrated eFuse.\n\nAn gallium nitride (GaN) power stage also combines TI GaN and a high-performance gate driver with advanced protection features in an industry-standard transistor outline leadless (TOLL) package.\n\nAs the adoption of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI) increases, datacentres require more power-dense and efficient solutions.\n\nThe TPS1685 is the first 48V device with an integrated hot-swap eFuse with power-path protection. The 48V stackable device is aimed at power requirements over 6kW\n\nThe integration of the eFuse and protection mechanisms such as integrated black box for fault logging, a guaranteed FET safe operating area, active current sharing and health monitoring all simplify designs and reduce the size by half compared to existing hot-swap controllers.\n\nOne of the differentiating features of the TPS1689 is the blanking timer, which prevents false tripping by enabling the system to distinguish between peak load currents and actual fault conditions.\n\nThis enables short transient overloads to pass through without triggering a circuit breaker, ensuring that temporary, high-amplitude load pulses common in AI, GPU and processor-intensive applications do not disrupt the system. However, the eFuse promptly shuts down the circuit during sustained overcurrent events.\n\nThe blanking timer minimizes the need for oversized power-supply units (PSUs) and reduces the number of eFuses required in parallel configurations. This significantly lowers bill-of-materials costs while maintaining reliable operation.\n\nThe device also supports stacking capabilities for increased current handling, allowing multiple devices to work together in high-power applications.\n\n\u201cWith datacentres increasingly demanding more energy, powering the world\u2019s digital infrastructure begins with smarter, more efficient semiconductors,\u201d said Robert Taylor, general manager, Industrial Power Design Services. \u201cWhile advanced chips drive AI\u2019s computational power, analog semiconductors are key to maximizing energy efficiency. Our latest power-management innovations are enabling data centers to reduce their environmental footprint while supporting the growing needs of our digital world.\u201d\n\nThe LMG3650R035, LMG3650R070 and LMG3650R025 integrated GaN transistor and gate driver use an industry-standard TOLL package, allowing designers to take advantage of TI GaN efficiency without costly and time-consuming redesigns.\n\nThe power stages integrate a high-performance gate driver with a 650V GaN field-effect transistor (FET) while achieving high efficiency (>98%) and high-power density (>100W/in3). They also integrate protection features including over-current protection, short-circuit protection and over-temperature protection. This is especially important for AC-DC server power supplies that need to push more power into smaller spaces.\n\nDell Technology is using the integrated GaN gate drivers for a 12V, 1.8kW server power-supply unit (PSU), while Vertiv is using TI GaN for a 5.5kW server PSU that scales up to provides 132kW per rack.\n\nPreproduction quantities of the TPS1685, LMG3650R035, LMG3650R070 and LMG3650R025 are available now.\n\nwww.ti.com\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : If you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : eeNews on Google News\n\nShare:",

            "content": "Moscow is actively using American electronics to produce weapons and equipment to wage war against Ukraine.\n\nAs Ukrinform reports, this is according to a journalistic investigation by Bloomberg.\n\nDocuments obtained by the agency reveal details of an ongoing supply chain from Silicon Valley to Russia, which includes multi-step actions by Russian defense industry suppliers to buy components from US chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc. (TI), based in Dallas.\n\nAmerican high-tech products are used to produce drones, air-guided bombs, communication systems, Iskander missiles and other capabilities.\n\nThe purchase process is surprisingly simple, the investigation says. Some Russian distributors have integrated information from Texas Instruments' online store, the TI store, into their sales platforms, allowing customers to see semiconductor inventory and prices before placing orders.\n\nIn Moscow or St. Petersburg, they can buy IT components with a few clicks of the mouse, placing orders delivered through companies outside Russia.\n\nGoods arrive in Russia via Hong Kong or other countries.\n\nA Russian portal with a catalog, available for viewing only after the customer's company registers, contains millions of products, including those made by IT.\n\nExperts believe that the portal collects information through an application programming interface (API), which allows programs to interact and exchange data with each other.\n\nAccess to the website of the TI corporation (TI.com) is possible in Russia through a VPN connection, which allows you to hide location data and Internet addresses.\n\nMany products purchased in the IT store end up in Russia from third countries without the knowledge of the manufacturer. TI struggles to track where its chips end up as the company sells large volumes of components at relatively low prices.\n\nWhen Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US and EU imposed export controls on dozens of goods, electronics and technology used to make weapons, but many supply routes cross the borders of several jurisdictions before reaching Russia. making verification difficult.\n\nThe US has investigated the operations of companies such as Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Infineon and Analog Devices, but only IT has been held responsible. While other companies use risk management databases early in the sales process to block unauthorized buyers, TI implements such procedures \"significantly later in the customer screening process, and sometimes not at all.\" according to a report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. TI also allows companies to buy chips on its website without disclosing the end user of the products \u2013 unlike most other chipmakers.\n\nAmong the brokers offering IT products, according to the documents, are Sure Technology, Chipower Electronics and Horseway Tech in Hong Kong. Public records show that they are subsidiaries of trading companies based in Shenzhen, China, and one of them has announced the hiring of Russian-speaking employees.\n\nGoods are sent from Hong Kong to Russia mainly through the shipping company Sea Global SCM Ltd and the Russian air carrier Aeroflot.\n\nAt the end of the supply chain is a group of distributors, including Arvis Group, Alternativa and Getchip. According to the Russian Register of Companies, all of them are registered on Khokhryakov Street in Yekaterinburg.\n\nIt is from this group of companies that IT products are delivered to end customers, including enterprises from the Russian military-industrial complex.",

            "content": "Even when a business is losing money, it's possible for shareholders to make money if they buy a good business at the right price. By way of example, Neonode ( ) has seen its share price rise 553% over the last year, delighting many shareholders. Nonetheless, only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.\n\nGiven its strong share price performance, we think it's worthwhile for Neonode shareholders to consider whether its cash burn is concerning. In this article, we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow, which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. Let's start with an examination of the business' cash, relative to its cash burn.\n\nWhen Might Neonode Run Out Of Money?\n\nYou can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. As at September 2024, Neonode had cash of US$18m and no debt. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through US$6.7m. That means it had a cash runway of about 2.6 years as of September 2024. That's decent, giving the company a couple years to develop its business. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.\n\nHow Well Is Neonode Growing?\n\nAt first glance it's a bit worrying to see that Neonode actually boosted its cash burn by 28%, year on year. Also concerning, operating revenue was actually down by 24% in that time. Taken together, we think these growth metrics are a little worrying. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. So you might want to take a peek at .\n\nHow Easily Can Neonode Raise Cash?\n\nWhile Neonode seems to be in a fairly good position, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash and drive growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.\n\nNeonode has a market capitalisation of US$135m and burnt through US$6.7m last year, which is 5.0% of the company's market value. That's a low proportion, so we figure the company would be able to raise more cash to fund growth, with a little dilution, or even to simply borrow some money.\n\nHow Risky Is Neonode's Cash Burn Situation?\n\nEven though its falling revenue makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought Neonode's cash runway was relatively promising. Based on the factors mentioned in this article, we think its cash burn situation warrants some attention from shareholders, but we don't think they should be worried. An in-depth examination of risks revealed that readers should think about before committing capital to this stock.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

            "content": "Question: How would you react if you held Texas Instruments stock (NASDAQ: TXN) and its value fell by 30% or more in the upcoming months? Although this might seem extreme, such an occurrence has happened before and could repeat itself. Texas Instruments stock has been a mixed performer of late. It has declined by about 4% year-to-date in 2025 and has gained about 6% over the last 12 months. This compares to the S&P 500 which has gained about 10% over the past 12 months. While the broader semiconductor industry has picked up a bit, led by a surge in demand for artificial intelligence chips, and a modest recovery in the personal computer market, Texas Instruments has been witnessing some headwinds in its key automotive and industrial segments. Moreover, the overall market is undergoing a significant sell-off, spurred by increasing concerns about a U.S. recession following tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on major trading partners. Demand for Texas Instruments products is more levered to the broader economy and industrial activity and the stock could see a sharp correction in the event of a downturn.\n\nHere\u2019s the point: The key takeaway is that during a downturn, Texas Instruments stock might incur meaningful losses. Data from 2020 indicates that TXN stock lost about 30% of its value in only a few quarters while also seeing a peak-to-trough decline of about 22% during the 2022 financial crisis, faring a tad worse than the S&P 500. This raises the question: Could the stock see a sell-off and reach as low as $125 if a similar situation were to unfold? Naturally, individual stocks are generally more volatile than diversified portfolios. Therefore, if you are looking for growth with reduced volatility, you might consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its inception.\n\nTexas Instruments\u2019 financial performance has been mixed in recent quarters. In the automotive market, customers have been reducing inventory built up after pandemic-related supply chain issues. The industrial segment, which includes analog products like amplifiers, power management devices, microcontrollers and specialized processors, is also witnessing some weakness. The communications equipment sector also scaled back purchases due to a slowdown in 5G network deployment, especially in the U.S. Moreover, Texas Instruments\u2019 gross margins have also faced pressure with slightly higher production costs associated with reduced factory utilization. For 2024, gross margins stood at roughly 58%, down from about 62% a year earlier.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff measures -including a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with tighter immigration restrictions \u2013 have raised concerns that inflation might return. All of this suggests that the U.S. economy could encounter significant difficulties and even a recession \u2013 our analysis here on the macro picture. In fact, last week, during an interview, the President did not rule out the possibility that new tariffs might trigger a recession. When taking into account the heightened uncertainty from the Trump administration\u2019s policies, these risks become especially critical. The ongoing Ukraine\u2013Russia war and global trade tensions further obscure the economic outlook. Tariffs increase import costs, leading to higher prices, reduced disposable income, and weaker consumer spending. This could impact TXN as the company\u2019s product lineup is seen to be more dependent on macroeconomic factors, compared to other parts of the semiconductor industry. For perspective, industrial and automotive chips, which are very cyclical, account for over two-thirds of Texas Instruments\u2019 revenue.\n\nHow resilient is TXN stock during a downturn?\n\nTXN stock has seen an impact that was slightly worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on TXN stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Texas Instruments Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.\n\nInflation Shock (2022)\n\n\u2022 TXN stock fell 22.3% from a high of $191.01 on 29 March 2022 to $148.34 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 14 May 2024\n\n\u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $220.29 on 10 November 2024 and currently trades at around $180\n\nCovid Pandemic (2020)\n\n\u2022 TXN stock fell 29.8% from a high of $133.13 on 19 February 2020 to $93.50 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 July 2020\n\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2008)\n\n\u2022 TXN stock fell 62.4% from a high of $36.59 on 9 October 2007 to $13.77 on 2 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 2 May 2013\n\nPremium Valuation\n\nAt its current price of about $180 per share, TXN is trading at approximately 34x consensus 2025 earnings, which seems somewhat expensive. Moreover, the company\u2019s growth rates have been middling. Revenues contracted over 2024, and are expected to grow in the high single-digits for 2025. With recession risks increasing, things could get tricky for TXN.\n\nGiven this potential slowdown in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you intend to hold on to your Texas Instrument stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins dropping to $150, $125, or even lower? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy.

            "content": "Citi Research named Texas Instruments (TXN) as its top pick after stating that it has the best risk-reward ratio among analog semiconductor stocks. Analysts, led by four-star rated Christopher Danely, are optimistic about the analog sector because they believe that inventory levels are low, profit margins and earnings per share have likely bottomed out, and sales are on the verge of a recovery. As a result, they expect upside revisions to consensus estimates.\n\nThe analysts also predict that sales, gross margins, and EPS will soon return to pre-pandemic levels and lead to an estimated 70% growth in EPS by the second half of 2026. Indeed, they are already seeing early signs of this recovery, as multiple analog chipmakers, such as Texas Instruments and Analog Devices (ADI), are reporting an increase in bookings.\n\nTherefore, Citi has a Buy rating on all the analog semiconductor stocks it covers, with Texas Instruments as the top choice, followed by Microchip Technology (MCHP), Analog Devices, and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). The next key catalyst for Texas Instruments is expected to be its Q1 2025 earnings, where analysts anticipate that the company will confirm there is a broad-based recovery in the works, similar to the recent comments made from Analog Devices. They also noted that Microchip Technology has already reported significantly higher bookings in January and February, which adds more evidence of a rebound.\n\nIs TXN a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TXN stock based on eight Buys, 12 Holds, and two Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average TXN price target of $208.91 per share implies 15.8% upside potential.\n\nSee more TXN analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Hazeltree, a leader in active treasury and intelligent operations technology for the alternative asset industry, also identified Kering SA and H&M as the most shorted large-cap stocks in EMEA, with Kering and APAC\u2019s Disco Corporation both appearing for the second consecutive month.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report is a monthly listing of the top 10 shorted securities in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions in the large-, mid-, and small-cap ranges. The data is compiled from Hazeltree\u2019s proprietary securities finance platform data, which tracks approximately 15,000 global equities across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. The data \u2013 available to select clients \u2013 is aggregated and anonymized from the contributing Hazeltree community, which includes approximately 700 asset manager funds. The securities are assigned a Hazeltree Crowdedness Score, a key metric, which grades securities on a scale of 1 to 99, with 99 representing the highest concentration of shorting activity. This scoring highlights securities most targeted by investors and reflects key supply-demand dynamics.\n\n\u201cOur February Shortside Crowdedness Report analysis shows the U.S. tech sector continued to see layoffs, though at a slower pace than last year, alongside a surge in job postings, low unemployment, and a contracting IT job market,\u201d said Tim Smith, Managing Director of Data Insights at Hazeltree. \u201cThis points to a market in transition \u2014 not collapse \u2014 as companies recalibrate talent strategies to align with shifting priorities and economic conditions. Tech remained a top target for short sellers in the Americas for the third consecutive month, with eight of the 10 most crowded large-cap securities.\u201d\n\nHighlights from the February 2025 report include:\n\nAmericas\n\nIn the large-cap category, Chevron Corporation held steady for back-to-back months as the most crowded security with a score of 99. Super Micro Computer, Inc. was the second most crowded security following January with a score of 91 and held the highest institutional supply utilization (53.27%) for the third straight month.\n\nIn the mid-cap category, Dayforce, Inc. returned to the top from 2024, with a Hazeltree Crowdedness Score of 99. Shift4Payments, Inc. held the highest institutional supply utilization figure (35.88%).\n\nIn the small-cap category, Wolfspeed, Inc. continued its hold as the most crowded security for the seventh consecutive month, with a score of 99. Enovix Corporation had the highest institutional supply utilization (85.91%).\n\nEMEA\n\nIn the large-cap category, Kering SA and H&M Hennes & Mauritz AB were the most crowded securities with a score of 99. Kering returned to the top for the second consecutive month and H&M had the highest institutional supply utilization (76.34%) for the eighth successive month.\n\nIn the mid-cap category, Kingfisher plc, BE Semiconductor Industries NV and Delivery Hero SE were the most crowded securities (99). Carl Zeiss Meditec AG had the highest institutional supply utilization (51.20%).\n\nIn the small-cap category, Alphawave IP Group plc was the most crowded security for the third straight month, achieving a score of 99. Oxford Nanopore Technologies PLC led in institutional supply utilization (74.11%).\n\nAPAC\n\nIn the large-cap category, Disco Corporation was one of the most crowded securities with a score of 99 for the second consecutive month. MTR Corp. Ltd. had the highest institutional supply utilization (21.07%).\n\nIn the mid-cap category, Kokusai Electric Corporation, was the most crowded security with a score of 99 for the second consecutive month and had the highest institutional supply utilization (51.66%).\n\nIn the small-cap category, Tokai Carbon Co., Ltd., reemerged as the most crowded security (99) for the second consecutive month.

The securities are graded on a scale of 1-99, with 99 representing the security that the highest percentage of funds are shorting. Institutional Supply Utilization: This figure represents the percentage of the institutional investors\u2019 supply of a particular security that is being lent out. The institutional supply utilization rate is an indicator of how \u201chot\u201d a security is in terms of the supply-demand dynamic. It is possible to see 100% utilization of a security\u2019s availability, making it difficult to establish new short positions. Hazeltree Community Borrow Fee: This figure is the average weighted fee for what funds in the Hazeltree community are paying to borrow a security. The fee is represented as the annualized cost calculated as a percentage of the price of the security.\n\nAbout Hazeltree\n\nHazeltree is a leader in active treasury and intelligent operations technology.

            "content": "recently launched new power-management chips, broadening its product portfolio to address the growing demands of high-performance computing and AI in data centers. Despite this innovation, the company's share price dipped 1.66% over the past month. This move comes amid a broader selloff in the technology sector, as reflected by major indices such as the Nasdaq Composite, which slid 1.5% amid economic concerns and market volatility. While showcasing its power-management technologies at significant industry events like APEC 2025, the market climate proved challenging, with investor sentiment rattled by geopolitical uncertainties and potential economic headwinds. The company's presence at technological showcases did not immediately sway investor confidence, perhaps overshadowed by larger market trends. As a result, this minor decline aligns with trends affecting other tech giants, despite TI's strategic advances and innovative breakthroughs in power technology.\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the last five years, Texas Instruments has delivered a total shareholder return of 110.17%. This substantial appreciation reflects a combination of share price growth and dividends, positioning the company favorably relative to many peers. Among the key developments, Texas Instruments enhanced its U.S. semiconductor production capacity with government support worth up to US$1.6 billion, reflecting its investment in future growth. Furthermore, the company significantly expanded its share repurchase program, culminating in the repurchase of 44.58 million shares for US$6.75 billion, thus returning considerable capital to shareholders.\n\nDiversification efforts included announcing new power management chips and opening a new distribution center in Germany to improve logistics across Europe. Although recent quarterly results showed declines in earnings and net income, a steady rise in dividends provided a counterbalance, with a 5% increase announced in late 2024.

There are clues aplenty: the more-or-less central location, the nearby crystal oscillator, the maze of supporting passives, and perhaps even an obvious flash chip lurking about. The dead giveaway, though, is all those traces leading to the chip, betraying its primacy in the circuit. As all roads lead to Rome, so it often is with microcontrollers.\n\nIt looks like that may be about to change, though, based on Texas Instruments\u2019 recent announcement of a line of incredibly small Arm-based microcontrollers. The video below shows off just how small the MSPM0 line can be, ranging from a relatively gigantic TSSOP-20 case down to an eight-pin BGA package that measures only 1.6 mm by 0.86 mm. That\u2019s essentially the size of an 0603 SMD resistor, a tiny footprint for a 24-MHz Cortex M0+ MCU with 16-kB of flash, 1-kB of SRAM, and a 12-bit ADC. The larger packages obviously have more GPIO brought out to pins, but even the eight-pin versions support six IO lines.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s hard not to write about a specific product without sounding like you\u2019re shilling for the company, but being first to market with an MCU in this size range is certainly newsworthy. We\u2019re sure other manufacturers will follow suit soon enough, but for now, we want to know how you would go about using a microcontroller the size of a resistor. The promo video hints at TI\u2019s target market for these or compact wearables by showing them used in earbuds, but we suspect the Hackaday community will come up with all sorts of creative and fun ways to put these to use \u2014 shoutout to [mitxela], whose habit of building impossibly small electronic jewelry might be a good use case for something like this.\n\nThere may even be some nefarious use cases for a microcontroller this small. We were skeptical of the story about \u201cspy chips\u201d on PC motherboards, but a microcontroller that can pass for an SMD resistor might change that equation a bit. There\u2019s also the concept of \u201cOreo construction\u201d that these chips might make a lot easier. A board with a microcontroller embedded within it could be a real security risk, but on the other hand, it could make for some very interesting applications.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on this? Can you think of applications where something this small is enabling? Or are microcontrollers that are likely to join the dust motes at the back of your bench after a poorly timed sneeze a bridge too far? Sound off in the comments below.",

Texas Instruments has unveiled the world\u2019s smallest microcontroller, the MSPM0C1104, measuring a mere 1.38 square millimeters. The microcontroller\u2019s tiny footprint could open doors for a new wave of medical wearables, smart home devices, and even surgical tools that were once deemed impossible.\n\nThe MSPM0C1104 microcontroller. Credit: Texas Instruments\n\nA Pepper-Sized Computer\n\nMicrocontrollers\u2014small, self-contained computers\u2014are the silent workhorses of modern electronics, embedded in everything from smart thermostats to fitness trackers. Texas Instruments\u2019 latest MCU, part of its Arm Cortex-M0+ series, takes this miniaturization to the extreme. Despite its size, the MSPM0C1104 packs a surprising amount of power, with a 24 MHz processor, 16KB of flash memory, and 1KB of SRAM. It even features a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter for interpreting sensor data in applications like medical monitoring and environmental sensing.\n\nThe microcontroller\u2019s tiny size is made possible by wafer-level chip-scale packaging (WLCSP), an advanced manufacturing technique that eliminates the need for traditional packaging, making it 38% smaller than its closest competitor. For engineers designing ultra-compact devices\u2014think smart pills that monitor internal health or next-generation earbuds\u2014this could be a real game-changer.\n\n\u201cWith the new TI MCU, we could see a new class of super micro-devices not just targeting consumers but commercial uses,\u201d William Luk told CNET, a consultant at Quandary Peak Research. \u201cOne of the important verticals for micro-devices is in healthcare and surgical: smart pills, embedded sensors, or even surgical devices that can reach places like never before.\u201d\n\nSpecs for a Speck-Sized Chip\n\nTexas Instruments is positioning this MCU as the perfect fit for battery-powered and space-constrained devices. The MSPM0C1104 operates with impressive efficiency, consuming just 87 microamps per megahertz when active and a mere 5 microamps in standby mode\u2014features that could extend battery life in wearables and medical devices where long battery life is essential.\n\nThe device is also built to endure extreme conditions, functioning in temperatures ranging from -40\u00b0C to 125\u00b0C. Whether inside an industrial sensor in a freezing warehouse or a high-temperature medical probe, it remains operational with potential applications beyond just consumer electronics.\n\nMSPM0C110x functional block diagram. Credit: Texas Instruments\n\nTexas Instruments is making this technology accessible to large manufacturers as well as hobbyists and researchers. The company is offering a LaunchPad development kit for just $5.99.\n\nAt just 20 cents per unit in bulk orders, the MSPM0C1104 is remarkably affordable for applications at scale. \u201cThis innovation may be enough to move Texas Instruments up the chain of MCU developers currently dominated by STMicroelectronics, Infineon, NXP, Microchip, and Renesas Electronics,\u201d Luk noted.\n\nFor years, the race in microelectronics has focused on packing more power into ever-smaller chips. While many advancements have centered on making processors faster and more powerful, Texas Instruments\u2019 microcontroller represents a different kind of approach: focusing on miniaturization foremost and energy efficiency.\n\nThere\u2019s a big market for tiny computers. Smart medical implants could monitor patients\u2019 health in real time, sending data wirelessly without invasive procedures. Tiny environmental sensors could be deployed in places previously inaccessible to electronics, monitoring air quality or detecting contaminants in water. Even consumer products, from hearing aids to smart styluses, could become more discreet and efficient.",

            "content": "Software-defined vehicles (SDVs) are transforming the automotive industry by enabling remote updates, enhanced customization, and new business models, allowing manufacturers to improve vehicle performance and user experience over time without requiring hardware changes.\n\nWhat can vehicles enabled by software mean for manufacturers, drivers and passengers? Imagine a world where you don\u2019t have to go to the car dealership to get your car serviced; instead, you press a button or make a call, and the update happens in real time. In this world, you can keep your car for several years, and when it feels outdated or you want a new feature, you might not need to buy a new one.\n\nFeatures that you might not even be able to think of now \u2013 like your back seat being a fully functioning second office with Wi-Fi\u00ae and a webcam \u2013 could become a reality. I already live in that world. I drive a software-defined vehicle (SDV), which is a car where software controls the operation, design and user experience, rather than just hardware. Designing with a software-first approach allows manufacturers to improve vehicles over time and provide new experiences and customizations for both the driver and passengers.\n\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of SDV adoption, but its growth is momentous. Manufacturers are embracing SDV architectures, which will soon change the driving experience for consumers and the automotive industry.\n\nLet\u2019s look at three ways I see SDVs impacting the future of the automotive industry.\n\nIncreased collaboration between technology companies and auto manufacturers\n\nIn electrical engineering, electronics are structured into different sections, called zones. A car can perform several different functions per zone, ranging from steering to playing a radio. Zones are beneficial to manufacturers because they centralize all of these functions in three or four boards, which reduces the complexity of wires and increases design efficiency. So your front zone might perform functions such as wiper control, seat control, steering control and headlight control.\n\nA zone architecture enables easier management of the software system, reduces overall latency and increases flexibility for updates and modifications, making it the first step to building an SDV. Reducing several boards to just three or four zones can enable and simplify software updates.\n\nAt the heart of each zone are semiconductors. Because of this, companies like ours work closely with auto manufacturers to provide the technologies that allow these vehicles to run on software systems, such as intelligent power distribution across various temperatures; scalable computing solutions; signal conditioning to monitor sensors; and communication interfaces for in-vehicle networking such as Controller Area Network, Local Interconnect Network or Ethernet. Highly integrated radar chipsets help prevent accidents with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and real-time monitoring in battery-management systems monitor voltage, currents and temperatures to determine when a battery needs service.\n\nSDVs centralize software and decouple hardware from software, enabling rapid innovation. The software leverages data from processors, microcontrollers (MCUs) and sensors to optimize overall vehicle performance and help increase safety, as in ADAS or battery monitoring and customization. As the industry designs chips that become smarter and can be programmed or modified to adopt new features, design engineers must write software for it.\n\nA software-first approach\n\nIn order to create the world I describe, in which everything happens with the press of a button, software must be at the forefront of a design engineer\u2019s mind to make vehicles flexible and customizable. SDVs are all about continual improvements and what you can add to the vehicle, even after it\u2019s been purchased and on the road. Decoupling hardware from software enables manufacturers to accelerate their time to market. Hardware teams can release first, while software teams can do a parallel and staged rollout where they continually add to their product.\n\nSimilar to how a smartphone is updated, manufacturers can roll out updates and improvements to the software continuously. The consistent updates of SDVs enable drivers to keep their vehicles for longer. Because the electronics in the car are so advanced, drivers can browse and select new software upgrades from the manufacturer.\n\nHaving a software-based vehicle gives users the intelligence needed for them to really enjoy the vehicle, while giving car manufacturers the ability to push features to fix bugs (reducing the need to interact with vehicles) or to receive advanced diagnostics about vehicles. The implementation of hardware into a zone architecture reduces the overall number of boards and actions needed, reducing costs for manufacturers and enabling customers to have their issues addressed remotely, with no need to visit the service department at a dealership.\n\nOpportunities for new business models\n\nSDVs have the potential to adapt to different types of driving algorithms and preferences. If you want to drive autonomously, your SDV can implement a feature to stop at your favorite coffee shop every morning on the way to work. If several different family members share the same car, a user can set different preferences in an SDV for music or air conditioning based on who\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nThese examples each give manufacturers more opportunity for revenue streams; when drivers opt in for these enhanced features, manufacturers can seamlessly incorporate them into the vehicle and receive payments similar to a subscription-based model.\n\nLook around you \u2013 everything is becoming smarter. SDVs can enable the integration of artificial intelligence into your vehicle to have a deeper connection with other devices and an industrial infrastructure. For example, an electric vehicle can communicate with your home and power it through vehicle-to-grid or vehicle-to-home communication.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that SDVs are changing the automotive industry for both users and manufacturers, and with continual embrace of this pivot in the industry, so much more is possible.\n\nMark Ng is Director of Automotive Systems at Texas Instruments.

            "content": "Let's talk about the popular Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$204 and falling to the lows of US$174. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Texas Instruments' current trading price of US$174 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Texas Instruments\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\n\nWhat Is Texas Instruments Worth?\n\nTexas Instruments appears to be overvalued by 25% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$174 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $138.90. This means that the opportunity to buy Texas Instruments at a good price has disappeared! In addition to this, it seems like Texas Instruments\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\n\nWhat does the future of Texas Instruments look like?\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Earnings and Revenue Growth March 14th 2025\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 43% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Texas Instruments. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? TXN\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe TXN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.",

            "content": "Texas Instruments says it has shrunk the size of the smallest microcontroller unit in its industry with a new MCU the size of a black pepper flake.\n\nThe MCU packaging is only 1.38 square millimeters in size and is part of the company's Arm Cortex line of embedded designs. TI says the product is aimed at small products including medical wearables, earbuds, stylus pens and electric toothbrushes. The product includes a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter and has 16KB of flash memory and 1KB of SRAM and runs at 24MHz.\n\nThe diminutive device is known as the MSPM0C1104. Alas, that's as catchy as it gets (no PepperPower for this piece of tech).\n\nTI says the microcontroller costs 20 cents per unit in quantities of 1,000, which means a company could get an army of robot spiders project started for as little as $200. TI is showing off this and other MCUs (not Marvel-related) at Embedded World 2025 in Nuremberg, Germany.\n\nOpens up opportunities\n\nWilliam Luk, a consultant and technology expert at Quandary Peak Research, said the MCU shrinkage opens up opportunities in areas where miniature devices weren't previously possible.\n\n\"One of the important verticals for micro-devices is in healthcare and surgical: smart pills, embedded sensors, or even surgical devices that can reach places like never before,\" Luk said.\n\nLuk also said the innovation may be enough to move Texas Instruments up the chain of MCU developers currently dominated by STMicroelectronics, Infineon, NXP, Microchip and Renesas Electronics.\n\n\"With the new TI MCU, we could see a new class of super micro-devices not just targeting consumers but commercial uses (such as healthcare). But there are also challenges such as government approval (for medical devices). Manufacturing of these new micro devices could also be challenging,\" Luk said.\n\nCorrection, March 14: An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed the cost of the microcontroller. It costs 20 cents per unit.",

In other words, that almost-invisible thing isn't just the silicon chip, but the entire chip package equivalent to a fully packaged CPU from Intel or AMD, not just the silicon inside. Yup, mind veritably blown.\n\nFor reference, the package for the Broadcom BCM2712 chip that powers the Raspberry Pi 5 is about 20 mm\u00b2. So you could fit about 200 of these things in the space the Broadcom BCM2712 takes up.\n\nDespite the diminutive proportions, which Texas Instruments claims to be 38% smaller than any other MCU, this teensy spec of a chip packs a fully functional Arm 32-bit Cortex-M0+ CPU core running at a towering 24 MHz. It also has 16 KB of flash memory and 1 KB of SRAM.\n\nIn broad terms, that seems to put it about on par with an Intel 386 chip from 1985, which offered clock speeds from 12.5 MHz up to 40 MHz and 16 KB of L2 cache. Unfortunately, Texas Instruments doesn't quote a process node or transistor count, so it's a little hard to get an overall feel for the complexity level and performance of the chip.\n\nThe Texas Instruments MSPM0C1104 is so small, it makes an earbud look like a bus (Image credit: Texas Instruments)\n\nStill, it also sports a 12-bit ADC or analogue-to-digital converter with three channels and it's listed on Texas Instruments' website as an automotive mixed-signal microcontroller but is designed for small systems like earbuds and medical devices.\n\n\"Consumers are continuously demanding that everyday electronic items, such as electric toothbrushes and stylus pens, offer more features in a smaller footprint at a lower cost,\" Texas Instruments says, and the MSPM0C1104 chip will help enable that.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.91 billion, up 6.74% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.35 per share and revenue of $17.05 billion, which would represent changes of +2.88% and +9%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Texas Instruments. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed an unchanged state. Currently, Texas Instruments is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Texas Instruments is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 32.86. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 29.01.\n\nIt's also important to note that TXN currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.84. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.79 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 52, positioning it in the top 21% of all 250+ industries.",

This includes billions to help build and improve Texas factories producing materials for microchips.\n\nThe CHIPS Act \u2013 formally the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act \u2013 was an effort by the federal government to encourage more semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Semiconductors, which make up microchips, are found in nearly every electronic device including cars, cellphones and computers.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, introduced the Chips for America Act, the bill that set up the programs funded by the CHIPS and Sciences Act, in 2020. The lawmakers are prominent Republican supporters of government programs that encourage semiconductor production.\n\nThe Chips for America Act was included in the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, which became law after Congress overrode a Trump veto for reasons unrelated to semiconductor production.\n\nMcCaul said the foundations for the CHIPS act go back to when members of Trump\u2019s national security team \u2013 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross \u2013 approached him in 2020, while he headed the House China Task Force. They asked for help to start manufacturing \u201cnational security assets\u201d inside the country and to pull supply chains out of Taiwan, McCaul said.\n\nIn his second term, Trump shocked many lawmakers during his March 4 joint address to Congress by asking House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, to \u201cget rid of\u201d the act.\n\n\u201cYour CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn\u2019t mean a thing.\u201d\n\nThe president implied that tariffs on semiconductors would be enough to encourage companies to move production to the United States.\n\nBut McCaul told The Texas Tribune that he thinks the president \u201cwent off script and was not well informed,\u201d during the joint address.\n\n\u201cI think there's a little bit of cleanup behind the scenes,\u201d McCaul said.\n\nTrump might think it was a Biden administration idea, McCaul said, because Biden signed the CHIPS and Sciences Act into law. McCaul said Trump\u2019s comment against the act \u201cdefies the history of CHIPS, which goes back to his administration and his national security team.\u201d\n\nThe joint address wasn\u2019t the first time Trump criticized the act. In January, Trump called CHIPS a \u201cridiculous program.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, during his January Senate confirmation hearing, called the act an \u201cexcellent downpayment,\u201d to begin to bring semiconductor manufacturing to the United States, but added that the administration needs to study the law to \u201cmake sure that you get the benefit of the bargain.\u201d Lutnick did not fully commit to continuing to fund CHIPS after being asked to by Democrats.\n\nMcCaul and Cornyn penned an op-ed days into the second Trump administration that called for Republicans to \u201creclaim rightful credit,\u201d for the act and remove some grant recipient criteria.\n\nCornyn, one of 17 Senate Republicans to vote for the CHIPS Act, told The Texas Tribune Tuesday that he does not think getting rid of the act is likely.\n\n\u201cIf something were to happen to the supply chain for advanced semiconductors, which is largely based in Asia, we would be in a depression,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn said. \u201cIt would very negatively affect our national security interests.\u201d\n\nWhile the United States used to produce a significant portion of the world\u2019s semiconductors, in recent years Asia \u2013 specifically Taiwan \u2013 has become the center of production. Taiwan, as of 2023, produces over 60% of semiconductors worldwide.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, who voted against the CHIPS Act, was a leader on a successful bipartisan bill last year to take away some requirements for applicants \u2013 such as environmental reviews and permits.\n\nAsked for comment, Cruz\u2019s team did not send a statement about his current stances on the CHIPS Act in time for publication.\n\nMcCaul said the manufacturing jobs the law created and the national security aspect \u201cplays right in line with America First,\u201d a goal of Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nMultiple Texas facilities have been awarded funding from the CHIPS Act. This includes up to $4.7 billion for Samsung to build new facilities in Taylor and to improve one in Austin. Three new facilities in Sherman \u2013 up to $900 million for two Texas Instruments facilities and as much as $380 million for a GlobalWafers facility \u2013 were also granted funding under the act.\n\nOther planned Texas projects have a more uncertain fate. In December, the federal government signed a $50 million nonbinding preliminary memorandum to modernize a X-Fab facility in the state. On Jan. 16, the federal government signed similar agreements with IntelliEPI for over $10 million to improve a facility and with Sumika to construct a Baytown factory for around $52 million.\n\nThe federal CHIPS Act was replicated by the Texas state government in 2023, setting aside almost $700 million to subsidize companies that make microchips.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/12/texas-congress-cornyn-mccaul-trump-chips-act/.\n\nThe Texas Tribune is a member-supported, nonpartisan newsroom informing and engaging Texans on state politics and policy.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -8.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Texas Instruments falls in, has lost 16.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Texas Instruments is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share, indicating a change of -11.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.44 indicates a change of +20.5% from what Texas Instruments is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Texas Instruments is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

But a new microcontroller unit from Dallas-based Texas Instruments could have a big impact on a range of industries.\n\nTI has announced the launch of the world\u2019s smallest microcontroller unit (MCU), a product it said will allow designers to optimize board space in applications such as medical wearables and personal electronics without hampering performance via a wafer chip-scale package (WCSP).\n\nThe MCU expands Ti\u2019s comprehensive Arm Cortex-M0+ MSPM0 MCU portfolio, the company said. It measures only 1.38mm, and\u2014as you can see on the photo of the finger above\u2014packs a lot into something exceedingly little.\n\n\u201cIn tiny systems such as earbuds and medical probes, board space is a scarce and valuable resource,\u201d Vinay Agarwal, VP and GM of MSP Microcontrollers at TI, said in a statement. \u201cWith the addition of the world\u2019s smallest MCU, our MSPM0 MCU portfolio provides unlimited possibilities to enable smarter, more connected experiences in our day-to-day lives.\u201d\n\nAdvancing innovation in \u2018shrinking products\u2019\n\nWith more than 100 cost-effective MCUs, TI said its MSPM0 MCU portfolio offers scalable configurations of on-chip analog peripherals and a range of computing options to enhance the sensing and control capabilities of embedded designs. TI displayed the devices at Embedded World 2025 this week in Nuremberg, Germany.\n\nTI said that consumers demand that everyday electronic items, such as electric toothbrushes and stylus pens, offer more features in a smaller footprint at a lower cost. The company said that to innovate within these shrinking products, engineers are increasingly seeking compact, integrated components that enable them to add functionality while preserving board space.\n\nTI said the MSPM0C1104 MCU leverages the advantages of WCSP packaging technology, along with intentional feature selection and TI\u2019s cost optimization efforts. The size of the eight-ball WCSP is 38% smaller than competing devices.\n\nAccording to TI, its new MCU features 16KB of memory; a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter with three channels; six general-purpose input/output pins; and compatibility with standard communication interfaces such as Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C).\n\nIntegrating accurate, high-speed analog components into the world\u2019s smallest MCU gives engineers the flexibility to maintain the computing performance of their embedded systems without increasing board size, the company said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss what\u2019s next.

TI is targeting medical wearables and personal electronic applications for the new MSPM0C1104, which it claims is 38% smaller than the most compact rival MCUs and will cost buyers just 20 cents a piece in bulk.\n\nSo, what are the key features of this incredibly small MCU? As per the definition of an MCU, TI\u2019s MSPM0C1104 contains all the essential ingredients of a self-contained computer, albeit on a scale smaller than we are used to talking about on Tom\u2019s Hardware. For example, the CPU in this MCU is an Armv32-bit Cortex-M0+, which runs at frequencies up to 24 MHz. The processor has access to 1KB of SRAM and up to 16KB of flash memory.\n\nOther key components of the MSPM0C1104 for device makers include its \u201c12-bit analog-to-digital converter with three channels; six general-purpose input/output pins; and compatibility with standard communication interfaces such as Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C),\u201d notes TI in its blog post about the tiny new MCU. It adds that the accurate and high-speed on-chip analog peripherals will be of great utility for devices that can be enhanced by sensing and control capabilities.\n\n(Image credit: TI)\n\nThe new MSPM0C1104 is the smallest member of TI\u2019s MSPM0 MCU portfolio and will be particularly valuable in devices such as earbuds and medical probes where board space is scarce. TI says it will deliver smarter, more connected experiences in diminutive devices.\n\nLooking through the data sheets, we also noticed that these new MCUs can operate in environments as extreme as \u201340\u00b0C to 125\u00b0C. They are also power efficient, consuming just 87\u03bcA/MHz when running and 5\u03bcA in standby with SRAM retention. There\u2019s even a built-in beeper.\n\nIn the intro, we mentioned that the MSPM0C1104 costs just $0.20 in bulk orders from TI. Interested makers and DIYers can also investigate this MCU by purchasing the MSPM0C1104 LaunchPad development kit, available for $5.99 on TI.com via the link.\n\nOur favorite MCU is the far more powerful Raspberry Pi RP2040 ($1). This MCU is significantly larger and more potent than TI\u2019s new MSPM0C1104. However, powering over 100 third-party boards with a diverse range of prices, features, and capabilities, the RP2040 and RP2350 make great options for smaller-volume device makers who don\u2019t absolutely need the tiniest MCU/board available.",

With thousands of powerful, inexpensive options on the market, the requirements of most applications could be fulfilled by dozens of different chips. With price, performance, and energy consumption being roughly the same in so many cases, developers often make their purchasing decision based on factors other than differences in the hardware specs, like their familiarity with the development toolchains.\n\nAn overview of the chip's architecture (\ud83d\udcf7: Texas Instruments)\n\nHowever, every so often a new chip comes along with a real differentiator. Texas Instruments\u2019 new microcontroller, the MSPM0C1104, is one such example. While this chip is powerful and does have plenty of options for communicating with other devices, there is nothing about these features that is exactly going to knock your socks off. But when it comes to size, the MSPM0C1104 is like no other \u2014 literally. At just 1.38 square millimeters, it is about the size of a black pepper flake, which makes it the smallest microcontroller in the world.\n\nThe diminutive size of this chip makes it a desirable platform for use in everything from electric toothbrushes to wearable electronics and medical devices. After all, no one has ever bought a pair of wireless earbuds, then complained that they simply were not cumbersome enough to use because of their lack of excessive bulk. We like electronics to transparently fit into our lives, and it is small components such as the MSPM0C1104 that make that possible.\n\nAn 8-pin YCJ package (\ud83d\udcf7: Texas Instruments)\n\nThe team at Texas Instruments has managed to fit an Arm Cortex-M0+ core into their new chip, along with 16KB of flash memory and 1KB of SRAM. It also has plenty of ways to integrate with other devices, including six GPIO pins, a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter with three channels, and UART, SPI, and I2C interfaces. Full details can be found on the product information page.\n\nIf you could use a little more breathing room in your product designs, the MSPM0C1104 might be worth checking out. At 38% smaller than the industry's next smallest microcontroller, it is likely to stand in a class of its own for some time to come. Prices start at $0.16 in 1,000-unit quantities.",

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stock is up an impressive 104% over the last five years. The last week saw the share price soften some 2.0%.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Texas Instruments actually saw its EPS drop 0.3% per year.\n\nBy glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.\n\nOn the other hand, Texas Instruments' revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 3.6% over the last five years. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Earnings and Revenue Growth March 10th 2025\n\nTexas Instruments is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Texas Instruments, it has a TSR of 134% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nTexas Instruments' TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 12%. It has to be noted that the recent return falls short of the 19% shareholders have gained each year, over half a decade. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes Texas Instruments a stock worth watching. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Texas Instruments better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Texas Instruments you should know about.",

This marked the ninth consecutive months of more than 17% year-over-year growth for semiconductor sales.\n\nThe robust sales growth is experienced across a wide range of microchips, including microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory chips, RFID modules, power management ICs, digital signal processors, security authentication modules, optical chips, edge AI controllers, and advanced driver assistance systems, among others.\n\nFactors Driving the Semiconductor Market\n\nThe rise in microchip sales is driven by their growing demand by hyperscalers, cloud service providers, telecom, artificial intelligence, and data center customers who are dedicating a significant part of their capital expenditure to acquire more powerful chips.\n\nSemiconductor - General Industry 5YR % Return\n\nSemiconductor - General Industry 5YR % Return\n\nInventory normalization among industrial and automotive customers is also driving sales, particularly due to the strength in the Chinese electric vehicle market. Semiconductor manufacturers are also benefiting from increased sales and improved margins as easing inflation reduces pricing pressure.\n\nAmerica is Leading the Semiconductor Market Internationally\n\nThe SIA report mentioned that year-over-year sales were up in the Americas by 50.7%, Asia Pacific/All Other by 9.0%, China by 6.5%, and Japan by 5.7%, but were down in Europe by 6.4%. The massive growth in semiconductor sales in America can be attributed to the U.S. CHIPS Act incentivizing the semiconductor manufacturing companies that are shifting production back to the United States.\n\nA report published collaboratively by SIA and BCG in May 2024 stated that the United States will capture 28% of global capital expenditures from 2024 to 2032 under the CHIPS Act regime. The report further suggested that the United States could have captured 9% of global capital expenditures only if the CHIPS Act was not implemented.\n\nSince the U.S. CHIP Act has incentives for designing, developing and manufacturing semiconductor products, companies with or without fabrication facilities are to benefit from it. U.S.-based Semiconductor companies, including Intel INTC, Micron Technology MU, Texas Instruments TXN and Microchip Technology MCHP, have a huge scope to capitalize on these incentives.\n\nAccording to a report by SIA, Intel, Micron Technology and Texas Instruments will receive grants of approximately $7.8 billion, $6.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, under the CHIPS Act. Microchip Technology will receive a smaller grant of approximately $162 million for the expansion and modernization project for its microcontrollers and specialty mature-node semiconductors.\n\nChallenges for Semiconductor Companies\n\nThe global semiconductor manufacturing and supply-chain landscape is dominated by companies based out of the United States, including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and the Netherlands. The geopolitics around the semiconductor industry is mainly impacted by U.S. relations with Southeast Asian countries and China.\n\nThe United States and China\u2019s tit-for-tat trade war is a major threat to the semiconductor industry. This is because the United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest importer. The trade war between the two countries is likely to escalate as the U.S. government imposes a new licensing requirement for semiconductor players, barring some of them from selling their products in China.\n\nMost U.S.-based semiconductor companies operate fabless, relying on foundry-based companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung. This poses significant supply chain risks, given the presence of foundries in Southeast Asia where China dominates in the regional geopolitics.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 17.9% increase in global semiconductor sales in January 2025 indicates a strong demand for microchips among hyperscalers, cloud service providers, telecom, artificial intelligence, automotive, industrial and data center customers. While geopolitical challenges remain a limiting factor for the industry, long-term prospects remain bright as semiconductors are being the fuel for AI, HPC, automotive and hyperscale innovations.\n\nOf the leading players, Intel and Texas Instruments carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each at present.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF is down nearly 4% as of 12:15 p.m. ET, nearly twice as much as the benchmark US stock index.\n\nChips have gone from market leader to laggard real quick. The AI trade has had its legs kicked out from under it, and semiconductor demand outside of that high-flying segment hasn\u2019t been able to stand on its own two feet.\n\nBroadcom is off more than 5%, losing most of its post-earnings gains, while Marvell Technology and Microchip Technology are doing even worse. Semi kingpin Nvidia is also down more than 4% on the session.\n\nThe chip-centric fund is now trailing the S&P 500 by more than 15% over the past year. Since the launch of the ETF in late 2011, it\u2019s been rare for semis to lag the benchmark US stock index by much more than this over a one-year period, which may hint at a relative bottom. On the other hand, we\u2019ve seldom seen the degree of colossal outperformance that a handful of chip stocks have been able to deliver in recent years.\n\nBroadcom, Nvidia, TSMC, Analog Devices, and Texas Instruments are the only five out of 25 components in SMH to deliver a positive return over the past 252 sessions; on the other side of the spectrum, Intel and AMD have shed over half their value during this span.",

And so, not only is it true that we\u2019re trying to expand, which requires more people, [but] that in turn creates great career opportunity. But there\u2019s a bit of a vacuum above [entry-level roles] in terms of great leadership and management. That\u2019s because we as a nation have exported an awful lot of that over the course of time.\n\n\u201cSo, I think there\u2019s kind of a double bang for your buck if you get into the into the semiconductor field, as far as opportunity goes. And I also think there\u2019s are some sexy aspects to it. I mean, who\u2019s the world\u2019s richest man in the world right now? He\u2019s someone in the technology space.

This suite of innovative offerings could have reinforced positive sentiment around Intel's growth trajectory. The chipmaker's stock surged 8% last month, reflecting optimism amid robust product launches and potential M&A activity with Silver Lake for Altera Corp. The broader market context reveals a volatile environment, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posting consecutive weekly declines despite a solid economic outlook from the Federal Reserve Chair. Notably, AI-focused companies, such as Broadcom and Nvidia, experienced ups and downs, influencing semiconductor investor sentiment. While tech stocks, like Nvidia, saw mixed results, rising the day Musk's Tesla extended declines, Intel's strategic product developments aligned with investor interest, contributing to its notable price increase in February.\n\nNasdaqGS:INTC Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past three years, Intel's total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, declined by 51.81%. This period saw Intel grappling with various challenges impacting its long-term stock performance. Intel's underperformance is evident compared to the broader US market, which returned 11.9% over the past year, and the US Semiconductor industry, which saw a 10% return.\n\nKey factors influencing this downturn include the Q3 2024 earnings report, which revealed a sales decline to US$13.28 billion and a net loss of US$16.64 billion. The suspension of dividends starting the fourth quarter of 2024 prioritized liquidity for investments but affected investor sentiment. In terms of strategic decisions, Intel's ongoing litigation, such as the patent infringement lawsuits, continued to present financial uncertainties. Lastly, the CEO transition announced in December 2024 could have introduced some volatility as the company navigated executive leadership changes during a critical period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

It works by transferring energy between two coils: one is placed on the charging pad and the other is mounted on the device side of the charging pad. As mentioned previously, the charging process is based on resonant induction where, when the device is placed at the center of the pad, an ac flows through the pad's coil and generates a magnetic field that in turn charges another coil provided at the centre of the device thereby charging the battery. This method is more convenient and only put less stress on the charging ports as opposed to frequent use of the ports.IMR is solidifying its reputation as a leading market research and consulting service provider, delivering data-driven insights that help businesses make informed strategic decisions.

            "content": "The rising concerns about the environment and energy costs force the power sector to undergo significant transformation. As a result, renewable energy-based distributed generation (DG) is considered an effective solution to this issue. These DGs are integrated with energy storage devices and loads to form a controlled microgrid that can operate connected to the utility grid or as a standalone or islanded system1.\n\nPower converters are crucial components in microgrids, facilitating the efficient processing and integration of energy generated by renewable energy sources. Power converters can be divided into two types based on how they operate in an alternating current microgrid: grid-feeding and grid-forming2. Grid-feeding power converters are primarily designed to provide power to an electrified grid. They can be considered as an ideal current source in parallel with a high impedance. On the other hand, the grid-forming converters set the microgrid\u2019s frequency and voltage amplitude by using a proper control loop. They can be modeled as an ideal AC voltage source in series with a low output impedance.\n\nGrid-feeding power converters rely on the presence of a grid-forming unit or a local synchronous generator to establish the voltage amplitude and frequency of the AC microgrid, making them unsuitable for independent operation in island mode. Grid-feeding converters are typically managed by high-level controllers, such as power plant controllers or maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controllers, which define the reference values for active and reactive power. These converters are suitable for controlling renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) and wind3.\n\nGrid-forming units generally employ a three-level hierarchical control structure: primary, secondary, and tertiary controls. The primary control is responsible for maintaining stable voltage and frequency operation while ensuring accurate power sharing among inverter units4,5. However, the primary control results in deviations from nominal values in frequency and voltage6. These deviations are eliminated by the secondary control7. A synchronization control could be added to the secondary control to ensure a seamless transition from islanded to grid-connected mode. Tertiary control ensures the optimal operation of the microgrid by managing power flow between the microgrid and the utility grid, taking into account both economic and environmental considerations8. The tertiary control is not addressed in this paper. In industrial applications, grid-forming power converters are often powered by a stable DC voltage source such as a battery, a fuel cell (FC), or another primary source9.\n\nFig. 1 Microgrid structure under study. Full size image\n\nMaintaining a stable and reliable microgrid despite parameter uncertainty is vital for proper operation. Because of a lack of inertia and poor selection of controller parameters, the microgrid could suffer from severe variations in voltage and frequency especially when operating in islanded mode. Therefore, careful controller design is essential to ensure the required power quality and control performance under different operating conditions. Classic methods for tuning individual controllers include heuristic approaches such as frequency domain methods that account for gain and phase margins, Ziegler Nichols method, and analytical methods such as pole placement. However, there are several controllers in a microgrid system and the result of tuning one control parameter is likely to affect other parameters tuning. So, using these methods to tune multiple DG controllers would be rather complicated and inefficient. Recently, Numerous metaheuristic optimization techniques have been proposed to help solve a variety of engineering issues, including the design of control systems10. These techniques would be the best option since there is a lot of flexibility in defining fitness functions (FF) which express control objectives, and optimal parameters can be obtained using automatic computerized iterative searches.\n\nRegarding the topic of microgrids, these meta-heuristic methods have been applied in the literature to optimize the design of controllers for improving power quality and dynamic performance. Most research in this domain concentrates on enhancing the performance of proportional-integral (PI) controllers in microgrids11,12,13,14,15,16,17. However, literature indicates that PR controllers outperform PI controllers in microgrid applications, particularly in terms of voltage and frequency regulation, power quality, and power-sharing18,19,20,21. Unlike the conventional PI control strategy, which operates in the \\(\\:dq\\) rotating synchronous frame, PR controllers work in the \\(\\:\\alpha\\:\\beta\\:\\) stationary frame, offering superior sinusoidal reference tracking without steady-state errors and enhanced disturbance rejection capabilities. Additionally, PR controllers can be paired with harmonic compensators to effectively suppress selective positive and negative harmonics. Also, this approach eliminates the need for feedforward elements and decoupling terms, simplifying the control design. Given these advantages, PR controllers are employed in this study.\n\nDespite their benefits, research on the optimization of PR-based microgrids developed in \u03b1\u03b2 stationary reference frame, especially in islanded mode, remains limited. Moreover, the optimization of the transition process from islanded to grid-connected mode has not been thoroughly explored. To address these gaps, this paper focuses on optimizing the performance of PR-based islanded microgrids and considers the optimization of synchronization control loops for a seamless transition into grid-connected mode. A novel optimization strategy, Electric Eel Foraging Optimization (EEFO), is proposed for tuning control parameters. The optimization process is directly applied to the nonlinear model, incorporating the fitness function into the simulation results. This methodology produces more practical and accurate outcomes compared to traditional tuning approaches, which are typically based on linearized models. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through comparisons with two well-established optimization techniques, PSO and GWO.\n\nThe microgrid is comprised of three parallel DG units feeding a common load as indicated in.\n\nFigure 1. One unit operates as a grid-feeding unit while the other two operate as grid-forming units to ensure the continuity of operation in case of failure of one unit thus increasing the reliability of the system. Each DG includes a three-phase two-level power converter, and LC filter, as well as an ideal DC source representing the DC link of a typical renewable energy generation system or energy storage. The microgrid could be connected to the utility grid via a static transfer switch (STS).\n\nThe microgrid model was developed and simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK (version R2021a)22. Additionally, the proposed system was experimentally validated using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) real-time emulation setup, implemented with the C2000 Microcontroller LaunchPad XL-TMS320F28379D kit.\n\nThis paper\u2019s main contributions can be highlighted as follows:\n\nApplication of a novel optimization technique, EEFO, for optimal design of control parameters in PR-based islanded microgrid modeled in \\(\\:\\alpha\\:\\beta\\:\\) stationary reference frame. The optimization framework also addresses synchronization control to facilitate a seamless transition from islanded into grid-connected operation.\n\nThe proposed optimization approach demonstrates robustness and superior performance, particularly in terms of convergence speed and solution quality, when compared to established techniques such as PSO and GWO.\n\nThe effectiveness of the optimized controllers is experimentally validated through HIL emulation, highlighting their potential for practical deployment in real-world microgrid applications.\n\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: Section II introduces the main ideas behind Electric Eel Foraging Optimization (EEFO).

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), global company that specializes in manufacturing semiconductor devices used in computer processing. The company also produces flash memories, graphics processors, motherboard chip sets, and a variety of components used in consumer electronics goods. The company is a major supplier of microprocessors (computer chips). AMD is based in Santa Clara, California.\n\nAMD was founded in 1969 by Walter Jeremiah (\u201cJerry\u201d) Sanders, a former executive at Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, and seven others. The company released its first product in 1970 and went public two years later. In the mid-1970s the company began producing computer chips. Starting out as a second-source manufacturer of computer chips, the company placed a great emphasis on quality and grew steadily. In 1982 the company began supplying second-source chips for Intel Corporation, which made the microprocessor used in IBM personal computers (PCs). The agreement with Intel ended in 1986. In 1991 AMD released the Am386 microprocessor family, a reverse-engineered chip that was compatible with Intel\u2019s next-generation 32-bit 386 microprocessor. There ensued a long legal battle that was finally decided in a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in AMD\u2019s favour. That same year, Compaq Computer Corporation contracted with AMD to produce Intel-compatible chips for their computers.\n\nIn 1996 AMD acquired a microprocessor company known as NexGen and began branching out from the Intel-compatible chip market. In 2000 AMD introduced the Athlon processor, which was designed to run the Microsoft Corporation\u2019s Windows operating system. With the release of the Athlon processor, AMD became the first company to produce a 1-GHz (gigahertz) microprocessor, which marked AMD as a serious competitor in the chip market. In 2003 the company released the Opteron chip, another product that showcased the company\u2019s ability to produce high-end chips. In 2006 AMD absorbed ATI Technologies, a manufacturer of video graphics cards for use in PCs. In 2008 AMD announced plans to split the company in two\u2014with one part designing microprocessors and the other manufacturing them. This announcement followed news that the Advanced Technology Investment Company and the Mubadala Development Company, both based in Abu Dhabi, would acquire a controlling interest in AMD, pending approval by shareholders and the U.S. and German governments.\n\nIn 2009, following a series of complaints lodged by AMD, the European Commission fined rival Intel a record \u20ac1.06 billion (\u00a3948 million; $1.45 billion) for engaging in anticompetitive practices that violated the European Union\u2019s antitrust laws. These practices allegedly involved financially compensating and providing rebates to manufacturers and retailers who favoured its computer chips over those of AMD, as well as paying manufacturers to cancel or postpone the launching of products utilizing AMD\u2019s chips.\n\nIn 2014 the company was restructured into two parts: computing and graphics, which made processors for personal computers, and enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom, which made more-specialized processors.",

            "content": "Micron Technology MU and Broadcom AVGO are still Citi's top AI-linked semiconductor picks, even as chip sales stumbled in January. The sector pulled in $50.8 billion, down 14% month-over-monthworse than the typical 9.1% seasonal dip. The drag came from weaker memory and microcontroller sales, but Citi isn't backing down. AI now makes up around 20% of semiconductor demand, and Citi expects inventory replenishment in the analog space to fuel a 13% rebound in 2025. Texas Instruments, Microchip, Analog Devices, and NXP Semiconductors are also in the spotlight as potential winners.\n\nBroadcom, a quiet giant handling 99% of all internet traffic, is cashing in on AI's explosion. In its latest quarter, AI-driven revenue soared 77% to over $4 billion, while infrastructure software jumped 47%pushing total sales to a record $15 billion. Cloud providers are loading up on Broadcom's connectivity tech and XPUs to accelerate AI workloads, and the company is already shipping samples of its next-gen Tomahawk switch. Looking ahead, Broadcom's three largest cloud customers alone represent a $6090 billion opportunity by 2027. And that doesn't even count the four additional cloud players knocking on its door for custom AI accelerators. Despite a 26% dip since late January, Broadcom's stock trades at 28 times forward earningsfar below its 37-times multiple earlier this year.\n\nFor investors, this setup is hard to ignore. AI demand isn't slowing down, and the semiconductor sector is primed for a major rebound next year. Micron, Broadcom, and leading analog chipmakers are sitting in the driver's seat as AI weaves deeper into cloud computing, enterprise applications, and next-gen data centers. The short-term volatility? Just noise. The real story is unfolding over the next decadeand these names are at the center of it.",

            "content": "Recent discussions at Texas Instruments surrounding a shareholder proposal allowing a 10% shareholder group to call special meetings have been a focal point, especially as the company recommended voting against this change. Over the past month, Texas Instruments' stock price rose 8%, despite a general tech sector decline triggered by tariff-related jitters. While the Nasdaq faced a 1% decline and broader market indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones also dipped amid economic concerns, TXN shares managed to buck the trend. The resilience in TXN's stock could reflect investor confidence in the company's governance and business fundamentals, which stood firm against sector-wide pressures and geopolitical uncertainties affecting tech stocks. This differentiation underscores TXN's performance against market volatility, highlighting its relative strength in a challenging investment landscape.\n\nUnlock comprehensive insights into our analysis of Texas Instruments stock here.\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nThe last five years have seen Texas Instruments achieve a total shareholder return of 111.08%, reflecting a robust combination of share price appreciation and steady dividend payouts. Despite the challenges highlighted by the recent earnings showing a contraction in net profit margin and a slight dip in earnings growth, the company has capitalized on strategic initiatives to drive long-term performance. A significant factor in this growth was the US $1.6 billion funding through the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to develop wafer fabs, enhancing production capacity. Moreover, collaborative ventures such as those with Delta Electronics for automotive charging solutions underscore Texas Instruments' commitment to innovation and future growth within the semiconductor industry.\n\nContributing to their strong returns, recent investor-friendly actions include consistent dividend increases, with the quarterly cash dividend elevated to US$1.36 as of October 2024. Meanwhile, regulatory support and advancements in automotive chip technology further bolster investor confidence. The company's strategic expansions, evidenced by the opening of a new distribution center in Germany, illustrate a commitment to growth in international markets. Collectively, these efforts have distinguished Texas Instruments in an evolving market landscape, reflecting its strength relative to the semiconductor industry over the past year.",

Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Texas Instruments, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Ownership Breakdown March 6th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nTexas Instruments already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Texas Instruments' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Earnings and Revenue Growth March 6th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Texas Instruments is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 10% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.",

This positive development comes amidst a challenging period for tech stocks, with the broader market experiencing a 1.9% decline, largely driven by tariff concerns affecting the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. The collaboration with Safetrust to integrate MIFARE DUOX\u00ae also positions the company favorably in addressing future identity management challenges. Nevertheless, macroeconomic uncertainties, including looming U.S. tariffs and inflation fears, have placed downward pressure on the sector, evident in downward moves from peer firms like Marvell Technology. NXP's ability to navigate these hurdles, bolstered by its dividend announcement and partnerships, highlights a resilience that sets it apart within a fluctuating tech market environment.\n\nNasdaqGS:NXPI Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nThe last five years have seen NXP Semiconductors deliver a total shareholder return of 134.03%. This robust performance contrasts with its one-year underperformance relative to both the US Market and the semiconductor industry. Key factors contributing to its longer-term success include significant earnings growth, averaging 37.5% per year, and efficient capital allocation reflected in its high Return on Equity. Moreover, the company has consistently issued interim dividends, boosting shareholder returns while trading at a good value compared to peers.\n\nIn recent years, NXP has been proactive in establishing strategic partnerships that likely enhanced its market position. These include collaborations with Safetrust on identity management and VicOne on vehicle cybersecurity. Additionally, securing a \u20ac1 billion loan from the European Investment Bank highlights its focus on research and development in advanced technologies, suggesting a forward-looking approach that may have supported its longer-term price appreciation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "President Donald Trump is calling for Congress to get rid of the CHIPS Act. The Biden administration's signature legislation was meant to boost semiconductor production and research in the US and wean the country from its dependence on chips made overseas.\n\nDuring his address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, Trump called the CHIPS Act a \"horrible, horrible thing\" and claimed that companies that have received funding aren't spending the cash.\n\nThe bipartisan CHIPS Act, which was signed into law in 2022, set aside $52.7 billion to fund the construction of semiconductor manufacturing and research facilities across the US. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the US accounts for just 10% of the world's chip production.\n\nThe bulk of chips used in devices ranging from smartphones and laptops to cars, communications, and military equipment is manufactured overseas. That lopsided equation came into stark relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, when chip plants in other countries were forced to shut down, causing a massive shortage that limited or slowed the sale of a wide array of products for months.\n\nThe CHIPS Act was meant to bring manufacturing back to the US with incentives including grants and loans. So far, the Commerce Department has announced more than $36 billion in proposed and allocated funding.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with C.C. Wei, chairman and CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, March 3, 2025. (Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nIntel (INTC), the largest chip manufacturer in the US, has received the largest payout through the CHIPS Act, a $7.9 billion grant that will help the company set up new plants across the country. Samsung, SK Hynix, GlobalFoundries (GFS), Texas Instruments (TXN), and a slew of other companies have also received CHIPS Act funding.\n\nDuring his address, Trump touted TSMC's (TSM) recently announced plan to spend $165 billion on plants at its Arizona chip manufacturing facility. Trump claimed that TSMC is building the facilities without any money from the US.\n\nBut TSMC will actually receive $6.6 billion via the CHIPS Act that will support its previously announced $65 billion construction plans in Arizona. On Monday, the company said it would put an additional $100 billion into the facilities, bringing the total price tag for the project to $165 billion.\n\nTrump has previously toyed with the idea of killing the CHIPS Act and levying tariffs on semiconductors built overseas as a means of forcing companies to bring manufacturing back to the US. But shuttering the legislation would also put Intel's plans to build out its manufacturing footprint in danger at a time when the company is attempting to set up a third-party foundry that would build chips for customers, similar to TSMC.",

The total funding includes an additional $75 billion in low-interest loans. Other companies to get allocation from the federal government include TSMC, Micron, Samsung, Texas Instruments, and GlobalFoundries. The total awarded amount has reached $33 billion \u2014 meaning these are signed contracts that the government would likely have difficulty backing out of \u2014 and the Biden administration finalized the disbursements before it left office.\n\nHowever, these subsidies aren\u2019t cash payments that will be deposited in a company\u2019s account immediately after receiving notice of the award. Instead, they are paid in tranches once an awardee has hit certain milestones. This is why Intel was frustrated with the delay in CHIPS Act payments, as it only received a total of $2.2 billion of the planned $7.86 billion as of January 2025.\n\nThere were rumors that Donald Trump opposed the subsidies his predecessor championed even while he was on the campaign trail. However, these weren\u2019t substantiated then. Now that Trump is back in the White House, he prefers to impose tariffs instead of spending money to encourage chipmakers to build their semiconductor factories within the U.S.\n\nJust hours before his speech, the U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Trump also doubled the tariff rate placed on Chinese goods to 20%. This is why he\u2019s pointing out that many companies announced investments within the country during the first few months of his presidency. According to Trump, a total of $1.7 trillion in semiconductor spending was announced since he came into power, citing figures from SoftBank ($200 billion), OpenAI and Oracle ($500 billion), Apple ($500 billion), and TSMC ($165 billion). We should note, though, that TSMC has already invested $65 billion in its Arizona fab and that it\u2019s adding $100 billion more to expand it.\n\nThe tariffs that the White House is putting on goods \u2014 especially those coming from China, where many electronics and computer hardware come from \u2014 have likely spurred big companies to start moving their manufacturing operations into the U.S. Smaller companies like ASRock are also slowly moving out of China to avoid the worst of the tariffs. It will take time to move and set up manufacturing bases and supply chains, though, especially for things as complicated as chips. So, it's possible that the average consumer could have to deal with increasing prices while we wait for the factories within our borders to start churning out the chips, computer parts, and other electronic equipment we buy.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.",

            "content": "Nvidia designs the most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which are the key pieces of hardware when it comes to developing AI models. The company recently announced its fiscal year 2025 financial results, and it delivered a record $130.5 billion in total revenue, which was a 114% increase from the prior year. Demand is unlikely to slow anytime soon, because CEO Jensen Huang says new AI models that are capable of reasoning (or \"thinking\") can require 100 times more compute than previous generations.\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Feb. 27, 2025, and are subject to change.\n\nWith that said, the ETF offers an incredible amount of exposure to the AI hardware spending boom . Despite holding 30 stocks, its top five positions account for 36.4% of the total value of its portfolio, and they are some of the biggest names in the industry:\n\nHighly concentrated ETFs such as this one can be a double-edged sword for investors. On the one hand, they can deliver spectacular returns when they are in favor, but on the other hand, they can underperform the rest of the market if investors pull back from the underlying theme (in this case, the semiconductor industry). As a result, investors should own the iShares ETF as part of a diversified portfolio of other funds and individual stocks.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF has a very narrow focus, which is reflected by its small number of holdings. It invests exclusively in U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but especially those that will benefit from powerful trends like AI .\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds a portfolio of 30 top hardware stocks including the three mentioned above. It's currently down 21% from its record high, which offers investors a rare opportunity to buy it at a discount, and with so much AI hardware spending in the pipeline this year, here's why it might be a good idea to do so.\n\nA close look at some of the forecasts issued by those companies more recently suggests they might even exceed Morgan Stanley's estimate. A lot of that spending will flow to hardware giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which supply the most advanced data center chips and networking equipment for AI development.\n\nLate last year, Morgan Stanley issued a forecast suggesting Amazon , Microsoft , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms could spend a combined $300 billion on data center infrastructure and chips to power their artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions during 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEach of the four tech giants I mentioned at the top (Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet) are big buyers of Nvidia's chips. However, some of them are also making their own chips in partnership with Broadcom, which assists in the design and manufacturing processes. Broadcom is also a leading supplier of AI data center networking equipment, like its industry-leading switches, which regulate how fast data travels between chips and devices.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has emerged as a competitor to Nvidia in the data center space with its own lineup of AI GPUs. The company is now sending samples of its new MI350 to customers, which is expected to rival Nvidia's latest Blackwell-based GB200.\n\nHowever, AMD is also the industry's top supplier of AI chips for personal computers, which could be a huge growth area in the future because AI models are quickly becoming efficient enough to run on devices without the help of external data centers. Qualcomm is another emerging player in this space with its Snapdragon chips, which are used in Microsoft's Surface laptops and Samsung's Galaxy smartphones.\n\nOutside of its top five positions, the iShares ETF holds other popular AI semiconductor stocks like Micron Technology, which makes memory and storage solutions, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is the world's largest chip fabricator.\n\nThe iShares ETF has a track record of generating strong returns\n\nThe iShares ETF is down almost 4% in 2025 so far, and it's down 21% from its record high, which was set in the middle of last year. However, it has delivered a compound annual return of 11.1% since its inception in 2001, beating the average annual gain of 8.4% in the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nIn other words, the ETF has successfully navigated several tech booms driven by the internet, enterprise software, the smartphone, and cloud computing over the last two decades, so the recent dip might be a buying opportunity.\n\nBased on its top holdings, the ETF is already positioned for the AI boom, which could last for years. Morgan Stanley's estimate for 2025 might only be the start because, in early 2024, Huang said he expects data center operators to invest $1 trillion over five years to upgrade their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers.\n\nA lot of that spending will be absorbed by the 30 companies that make up the iShares ETF, so it might be the ultimate investment for those looking to capture the subsequent value creation.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, it's important for investors to buy the ETF as part of a diversified portfolio. If companies struggle to monetize AI software over the next couple of years, they might pull back on their hardware spending, which would lead to a period of underperformance for stocks like Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD, and more.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you\u2019d have $323,920 !*\n\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $45,851 !*\n\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $528,808!*\n\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nContinue \u00bb\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 3, 2025\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

            "content": "(March 5): President Donald Trump called for ending a bipartisan US$52 billion (RM230.8 billion) semiconductor subsidy programme that\u2019s spurred more than US$400 billion in investments from companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Intel Corp.\n\n\u201cYour Chips Act is horrible, horrible thing,\u201d the president said in a prime-time address to Congress on Tuesday. Trump implored US House Speaker Mike Johnson to get rid of the legislation and use \u201cwhatever is left over\u201d of funds apportioned to the programme to \u201creduce debt or any other reason.\u201d\n\nHis remarks were met with applause in a chamber that less than three years ago passed the Chips and Science Act. Vice-President JD Vance, whose home state of Ohio won a massive Intel project thanks to the law, stood up to show his support for its revocation.\n\nThe Chips Act is among the most significant US forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. It set aside US$39 billion in grants \u2014 plus loans and 25% tax breaks \u2014 to revitalise American semiconductor manufacturing, as well as US$11 billion for chip research and development. The aim was to reduce reliance on Asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centres.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have touted the Chips Act as crucial to US national and economic security, and Trump could have a hard time getting the votes to repeal it. Dozens of GOP lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s TSMC and South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co and SK Hynix Inc have announced or begun construction on multibillion-dollar projects in the US that were contingent on funding and support from the US government. Representatives of the companies declined to comment on the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nTrump has expressed support for the overall goal of boosting domestic chipmaking, but he\u2019s consistently derided the Chips Act as the wrong means of achieving it. Instead, the president has called for tariffs to stoke investment in the US, and he\u2019s signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month.\n\nCompanies can avoid those duties, Trump has said, by building factories on American soil. He has not offered additional details.\n\nOn Monday, Trump credited the tariff threats for TSMC\u2019s decision to invest US$100 billion in the US, on top of a previous US$65 billion commitment. He touted that project in his address Tuesday, referencing the full US$165 billion figure. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them no money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAll that was important to them was they didn\u2019t want to pay the tariffs.\u201d\n\nWhat that actually means for TSMC is murky. The company originally announced plans for a US$12 billion US site during Trump\u2019s first term and expanded that project to three factories under Biden. To support those facilities, TSMC struck an agreement with Biden officials for US$6.6 billion in Chips Act grants and US$5 billion in loans.\n\nAs is the case for other Chips Act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as TSMC hits negotiated project milestones. The company received US$1.5 billion before Biden left office.\n\nTrump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that\u2019s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives already earned by TSMC, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker\u2019s latest investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the newly announced projects \u2014 three additional chip plants, plus an R&D site and a factory for advanced packaging \u2014 won\u2019t win federal funds.\n\n\u201cThe main uncertainty is the future of TSMC,\u201d said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. \u201cOne long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in Taiwan, where labour costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. It\u2019s completely different in the US if they are to shift more manufacturing. Subsidies from US were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.\u201d\n\nTSMC is among 20 companies that reached binding Chips Act agreements with Biden officials. The deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the programme, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc \u2014 as well as older-generation factories by the likes of GlobalFoundries Inc and Texas Instruments Inc.\n\nCompanies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad \u2014 regardless of who\u2019s in office. But some of them have worried that the Trump administration could seek to modify the terms, Bloomberg has reported. Lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first.\n\nThat review is ongoing, and Lutnick\u2019s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. So far, his questions to programme staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government\u2019s legal authority to claw money back, Bloomberg has reported. The current Chips Act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive.\n\nA spokesperson for GlobalWafers Co, which won US$406 million from the Chips Act for factories in Texas and Missouri, said the Taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the Chips Act as \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\nBut if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, \u201cwe would reassess future investments, including evaluating US market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the US.\u201d",

The Dallas, Texas-based company develops analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits and embedded processors.\n\nCompanies valued at $10 billion or more are typically classified as \u201clarge-cap stocks,\u201d and TXN fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this mark, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the semiconductors industry. TXN's strong manufacturing and technology foundation, including ownership of much of its manufacturing capacity, enables lower costs and greater supply chain control. This, along with a broad portfolio of approximately 80,000 products and extensive market channels allow the company to reach a wide range of customers and design projects, increasing sales opportunities and customer insight.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nThis tech giant is currently trading 11.1% below its 52-week high of $220.39, reached on Nov. 8, 2024. Shares of Texas Instruments have declined 1.6% over the past three months, outpacing the broader Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLK) 2.6% decrease during the same time frame.\n\nMoreover, in the longer term, TXN has rallied 20.2% over the past 52 weeks, outpacing XLK\u2019s 10.2% return. On a YTD basis, shares of TXN are up 4.5%, compared to XLK\u2019s 3% decline over the same time frame.\n\nTo confirm its recent bullish trend, TXN has been trading above its 50-day moving average since mid-February. However, it is trading below its 200-day moving average recently.\n\nOn Jan. 23, TXN released its Q4 earnings results. Shares of the company fell 7.5% the following day despite delivering better-than-expected Q4 net income of $1.30 per share and revenues of $4 billion. However, both the bottom-line and top-line figures declined by a notable 12.8% and 1.7%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily driven by weaker demand in its key industrial and automotive markets. Additionally, profitability was impacted by a 200-basis point contraction in gross margin and a 320 bps drop in operating margin year-over-year.\n\nLooking ahead, for Q1 2025, TXN expects revenue between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion, indicating a potential 3% sequential decline. This outlook reinforced concerns about ongoing short-term demand weakness and might have further dampened investor confidence.\n\nTexas Instruments has lagged behind its rival, Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), which gained 22.5% over the past 52 weeks and 8.3% on a YTD basis.\n\nLooking at TXN\u2019s recent outperformance compared to its broader sector, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d from the 30 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $208.25 suggests a modest 6.3% premium to its current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "High tech: How federal government helped birth Austin industry along with other essentials\n\nAustin's owes the origins of its vaunted high-tech industry to the federal government.\n\nAt the close of World War II, the feds closed a bustling plant north of Austin that had processed magnesium used in explosives by the military.\n\nEngineers at the University of Texas lobbied the federal government to release the sprawling complex \u2014 north of what is now Research Boulevard, south of what is now the Domain \u2014 so that it could be used as a site for fresh scientific research.\n\nThus was born the Balcones Research Center, later renamed the Pickle Research Center, after U.S. Rep. J.J. \"Jake\" Pickle, who followed Lyndon Baines Johnson and Homer Thornberry as congressional representatives for Austin and for the research hub located up on the former wooded prairie.\n\nMore on the feds in Austin: The short suborbital career of Austin native Sam the Space Monkey\n\nAssociated with this center were new, indigenous tech firms such as Tracor and National Instruments. In the 1960s and '70s, they were joined in Austin by IBM, Texas Instruments and Motorola, among others. Research collaborations and academic launchpads such as UT's IC\u00b2 Institute, Microelectronics and Computer Consortium (MCC) and Sematech followed, along with home-grown tech home runs like Dell.\n\nToday, descendants of these Austin projects stand alongside AMD, Samsung, Oracle, Apple, Meta, Google, Intel, Amazon, Silicon Labs, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX and other giants in the field. The support of locally based investors, such as Austin Ventures, has encouraged entrepreneurs to found countless additional tech startups.\n\nIn turn, the rush of tech-related money, ideas and leadership has changed the face of Austin culture. That includes its philanthropic, educational, culinary, retail, arts, design, moviemaking, festival and music scenes.\n\nMore on the feds in Austin: Trip to LBJ Presidential Library unearths unexpected family history\n\nNot all the newcomers have expressed an interest in the community's past or its future. Yet those who have, following the mentorship of enlightened pioneers such as UT's George and Ronya Kozmetsky, have enriched our city immeasurably.\n\nAnd let's not forget other gifts from the feds and what else they contributed to the shape of Austin and Texas.\n\n1840s: The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas on generous terms, which included the eventual payment of the young country's considerable debt and a provision letting Texas keep its public lands, which benefited the new state's public schools, universities and construction of the majestic Texas Capitol, among other big projects.\n\nThe U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas on generous terms, which included the eventual payment of the young country's considerable debt and a provision letting Texas keep its public lands, which benefited the new state's public schools, universities and construction of the majestic Texas Capitol, among other big projects. 1840s-1920s: The U.S. ensured the protection of the state's citizens against Mexico, which did not easily accept the loss of so much of its territory, and against the Native Americans who actually controlled most of that territory in the mid-19th century. The U.S. had ended Native American rule by the 1870s, and while formal peace was made with Mexico in 1848, combatants crossed back and forth across the Rio Grande well into the 1920s.\n\nMore on the feds in Austin: More than 50 million artifacts from Texas\u2019 past kept at UT lab\n\n1930s: While the Texas economy \u2014 dependent on cotton and newly discovered oil \u2014 thrived during the go-go 1920s, the Great Depression, along with the Dust Bowl, crippled most of the state in the 1930s. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his New Deal came to the rescue. In Austin, not only were many impoverished residents helped by programs such as direct relief and Social Security, as well as work programs like the WPA, CCC and NYA, the feds paid for local projects such as the UT Tower, numerous buildings, bridges and, perhaps most importantly, the dams along the Colorado River that offered essential flood protection along with electricity, water and recreation.\n\nWhile the Texas economy \u2014 dependent on cotton and newly discovered oil \u2014 thrived during the go-go 1920s, the Great Depression, along with the Dust Bowl, crippled most of the state in the 1930s.

As in World War I, military bases proliferated, shipbuilding increased, and armament factories popped up all over the state. Families poured into the booming cities, and by 1950, Texas had become, for the first time, a state with a predominately urban population. Perhaps only California, with its Pacific Ocean ports and gargantuan defense industries, was altered more significantly.\n\n1950s-2010s: Major Texas highways, airports, medical centers and research universities all depended on federal dollars. Fort Worth's defense plants, Dallas' financial enterprises, Houston oil and chemical industries, San Antonio, Corpus Christi and El Paso's military bases, Austin's university and tech sector \u2014 all of them required federal investment and federally funded infrastructure.\n\nMajor Texas highways, airports, medical centers and research universities all depended on federal dollars.

That goal rarely wavered over the following decades. Among the major installations in Austin was the Del Valle Army Air Base, later renamed Bergstrom Air Force Base, after a native son who was an early casualty of World War II. In the 1990s, the feds turned the base over to the city of Austin to make way for what is now Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, an essential if overworked component of the city's success story.\n\nTexans like to think of themselves as self-sufficient individualists, but, as this stroll through the American-Statesman archives demonstrates, we've had a little help along the way.",

That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$170 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$155. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nIn the last year SiTime insiders didn't buy any company stock.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. SiTime insiders own about US$66m worth of shares. That equates to 1.8% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At SiTime Tell Us?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

            "content": "It\u2019s not an iPhone\n\nAn EV lasts much longer\n\nBMS is key\n\nWe\u2019ve recently passed a quarter century since the lithium-ion battery first powered a battery electric vehicle (BEV). With the demonstration of its superior power density over nickel-metal hydride and lead-acid chemistries, lightweight Panasonic laptop cylindrical cells were destined for mobility applications with the Tesla Roadster in 2008. This was followed by popular vehicles like the pouch-celled Nissan Leaf in 2009, and subsequently the cylindrical-celled Tesla Model S in 2012 and the Tesla Model 3 in 2017.\n\nQuick Change to Supercharging\n\nThe Model S, first prototyped in 2009, was designed for quick battery swaps. However, a revolutionary paper on ultra-fast DC charging of lithium batteries at elevated temperatures, coupled with Tesla Model S\u2019s onboard charger that was designed to be stacked for higher output power levels, produced the Tesla Supercharger, introduced in September 2012, which was capable of quarter megawatt class charging levels.\n\nTo be able to pull off this fast-charging parlor trick meant provisioning of a sophisticated, onboard, thermal management of the high-voltage battery (HVB) by a system known as a \u201cBMS\u201d (battery-management system). The BMS was normally responsible for reading cell-group voltages, battery-module temperatures and pack current. To be able to supercharge, though, the battery had to first be \u201cpre-conditioned\" by heating the battery coolant circulating through the pack\u2019s modules to a high temperature sufficiently ahead of time to account for the thermal mass of a pack weighing in at over half a tonne.\n\nThe brilliance here was in geolocating the vehicle and using the vehicle navigation system to determine ETA, which was then back-calculated to determine when to have the BMS start heating the pack. Arriving at the Supercharger station, the BMS negotiated the amount of charge current with the Supercharger, with the BMS following an optimized charging-current profile until constant-current charging mode reached the target cell voltage. At that point, the BMS adjusts the current requested from the charging station by holding the voltage until the current tapers off to a minimum current cutoff.\n\nKeepin\u2019 It Chill\n\nThe charging of the pack at high charge current meant high power dissipation in the battery cells. Thus, another mode of the thermal system is invoked by the BMS\u2014using the vehicle\u2019s air conditioner to cool the pack coolant, creating a sink for the heat being produced during Supercharging. That was state-of-the-art a dozen years ago. Fast charging and battery longevity depend entirely on the design of the vehicle\u2019s thermal system and the BMS architecture.\n\nVehicle electrification, since the early days of the NiMH-powered GM EV1, hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot on the propulsion side. The EV1 weighed in at almost 3,000 pounds, was powered by an AC motor, and achieved an efficacy of almost 6 miles/kWh at 60 mph, whereas a Chevy Bolt EV or Tesla Model 3 have an efficacy of about 4 miles/kWh.\n\nMotor efficiency has risen from high 80%\u2019s to mid 90%\u2019s, primarily as a result of using rare-earth permanent-magnet rotors in place of a caged induction rotor, but also through the use of high-speed ceramic bearings and, since last April when Remy\u2019s patent expired, hairpin stator windings. Inverter technology has advanced markedly in the technology being used, recently by using IGBTs and now by using wide-bandgap devices that include silicon-carbide (SiC) MOSFETs. Nothing much more to see here folks, so move along.\n\nDespite these powertrain advances creating efficacies that make BEVs extremely compelling, what EV users see and feel is determined exclusively by the BMS. It determines how much whip gets cracked, how fast the vehicle can charge, and how far the driver is being told the vehicle can go.\n\nAutomotive Electrification Week\n\nI\u2019ve been recently working on an Automotive Electrification project, which has launched today, that has resulted in five articles on battery-management systems, written by subject matter experts from National Instruments, Electrified Veronika, Electronic Design\u2019s James Morra and myself, and the sponsor of this Automotive Electrification Week, Texas Instruments (thank you!).\n\nThe perspective provided by these technical articles will leave readers with an understanding of how much further BMS advances can go in delivering accurate \u201cfuel gauging,\u201d in reducing BMS characterization times, which now take years, through simulation using digital twins; and the importance of precise sensing of voltage to better balance battery cells (a pair of 0.5% SMT resistors aren\u2019t good enough) thereby providing battery pack longevity and precision state measurement (SOH, SOC).\n\nThe articles also go into how making every EV battery\u2019s BMS accessible can create a circular economy where each EV battery can displace combustion vehicles and fossil-fueled power plants for a half century before needing recycling, as well as providing insight into what capabilities are coming for future onboard BMS computing power through the use of onboard edge-AI and by using vehicle resources to perform impedance spectroscopy on the battery pack.\n\nDino is Dying\n\nAs stellar as they presently are, EVs will get much better and more accurate in coming years, with the current crop of BEV offerings looking like The Flintstones car by comparison. And most of those improvements, what owners and manufacturers will see and value, will likely be in the battery- management system, not in solid-state batteries, not in motor advances, not in alternative battery chemistries.\n\nElectric vehicles will go farther, will perform better, will charge faster, will have their range extended\u2014all through BMS advancements.\n\nAll for now,\n\n-andyT\n\nAndy Turudic\n\nTechnology Editor\n\nElectronic Design\n\nAndyT's Nonlinearities blog arrives the first and third Monday of every month.

            "content": "Advances in AI-Enabled Automotive Radar Sensors and Audio Processors\n\nRadar sensors serve many functions in a modern automobile including position sensing, safety and comfort features as well as motor control. Added safety sensing as well as improved in-cabin experience from the use of the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and an immersive audio experience are key protection and infotainment features desired by automotive customers. In this article, we will highlight advances in radar sensors, audio processors, and amplifiers from Texas Instruments (TI).\n\nRadar Sensors in Automotive Applications\n\nAn automotive radar works by transmitting a radio wave in the direction of interest and using sensors to compare the characteristics of the reflected waves. The position and movement of objects can thus be determined.\n\nWhile other sensors such as cameras have been adopted by some car companies, automotive radars have seen strong growth due to advantages such as all-weather performance, cost-effectiveness, use of direct velocity measurements, and the potential to detect obstacles around corners. The global automotive radar sensor market is estimated at around $4 billion annually, with a compounded annual growth rate of > 10%.\n\nA typical automotive radar system comprises of 5 main modules:\n\nRF-front end, including the antenna, oscillators, etc.\n\nThe transceiver ICs that transmit and receive the radio signals\n\nThe radio processing unit converts the radio high frequencies to intermediate frequencies and can consist of amplifiers, mixers, etc.\n\nThe processor converts measured data into useful information that can be used by the car\u2019s Electronic Control Units (ECU)\n\nThe system enclosure\n\nAutomotive radars typically operate mainly at both the 24 GHz and 77 GHz frequencies, with 60 GHz used in some in-cabin monitoring applications, as will be discussed later. The higher frequency offers a wider bandwidth, which increases the range and velocity resolution of the radar. This improves the detection and avoidance of objects. The smaller antenna size at the higher frequencies makes the system more compact.\n\nAnother key advantage of the higher frequencies is the higher permitted transmit power levels. For example, the Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) at 77 GHz is 55 dBm, while it is only 20 dBm at 24 GHz. This can improve the range considerably. These higher frequency range radars are also called millimeter-wave radars for their wavelength.\n\nOne method to classify automotive radars is the range. Long Range Radars (LRR) can have a range of 150 \u2013 250 m and a field of vision (FOV) angle of 20 \u2013 25\u00b0. This can be used by Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) at the front section of the vehicles to detect traffic changes. Medium Range Radars (MRR) with a range of 50 \u2013 150 m and an FOV of 50 \u2013 60\u00b0 can be used in all 4 corners of the vehicle for collision avoidance or adaptive cruise control. Short Range Radars (SRR) with a range of 5 \u2013 15 m and a FOV of 80 \u2013 90\u00b0 are typically used when the car is moving slowly, for blind spot detection or lane change assist.\n\nThe AWRL6844 Three-in-One AI-Enabled Radar Sensor\n\nTI recently released a new AI-enabled radar sensor, the AWRL6844. This 60 GHz radar sensor addresses recent trends and regulatory requirements such as the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) in adding greater sensing capabilities within the vehicle. The AWR6844 integrates four transmitters and four receivers, an on-chip accelerator and digital system processing (DSP) unit, a hardware security module, an Arm\u00ae core, along with 2.5 MB memory and standard communication interfaces to create the industry\u2019s first edge-AI enabled three-in-one radar sensor.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the three sensing functions are:\n\nChild presence detection: This important function can save lives by alerting adults to children left behind in a parked vehicle. Detection needs to distinguish a child from an adult and be able to detect in both front and rear seats as well in footwells and rear-facing cars-seats. While traditional ultra-wideband (UWB) 24 GHz sensors can be used, achieving full coverage necessitates adding at least one more sensor, raising system cost. In addition, the resolution would not be as good. The wide FOV of the AWRL6844 increases the ability to detect children in typical blind spots such as vehicle footwells. The use of a hybrid system where traditional radar processing is combined with local machine learning algorithms helps create quicker tuning and model modification to distinguish adults from children and hence reduce OEM deployment time. A classification accuracy of > 90% is achieved for up to five occupants.\n\nThis important function can save lives by alerting adults to children left behind in a parked vehicle.

Monitoring of rear seats doubles the number of sensors needed, along with added cabling and tuning time. Further, weight sensors cannot distinguish between living and inanimate objects such as a grocery bag, which can create false alerts. The AWRL6844\u2019s 16 virtual channels provide enhanced spatial resolution to detect and localize occupants and the AI processing of high-resolution data helps distinguish living beings from inanimate objects. A seat occupancy detection and localization accuracy of over 98% is achieved with the AWRL6844.\n\nA variety of in-seat meshes of weight sensors are traditionally used for this purpose.

A seat occupancy detection and localization accuracy of over 98% is achieved with the AWRL6844. Intrusion-detection: simpler systems such as those based on ultrasonic sensors can often trigger false alarms such as from a person walking beside the vehicle. The AWRL6844 can filter out noise while maintaining high accuracy running intruder detection processing on the on-chip accelerator, which minimizes interruptions from other cores on the device. The low-power modes and machine learning help enhance sense capability without draining the battery while the vehicle is off. The AWRL6844 can sense and compute intruder detection events 10 times per second while consuming < 50 mW. A detection intrusion accuracy of up to 98% is achieved.\n\nFigure 1: The AWRL6844 three-in-one radar sensor functions (Source: Texas Instruments)\n\nThe benefits of combining these three functions on the cost of ownership are highlighted in Figure 2. Close to 50% of cost savings can be achieved with this integrated sensor.\n\nFigure 2: Cost of ownership savings for in-cabin vehicle monitoring with the AWRL6844 (Source: Texas Instruments)\n\nAudio System Improvements\n\nAutomotive audio systems have been transitioning from Class-AB to Class-D amplifiers with the benefits of higher power efficiency, reduced thermal dissipation, and lower system weight. TI has previously developed audio amplifiers capable of switching up to 2.1 MHz. which significantly reduces the size and cost of the two inductor-capacitor (LC) filters needed per audio channel.\n\nThe new TAS6754-Q1 Class-D amplifier takes the next step in filter size reduction by using a proprietary one-inductor (1L) modulation technology. This reduces inductor cost by 50%, while also creating similar advantages in size and weight. This 1L modulation is seamlessly incorporated, hence minimizing new design efforts. Real-time diagnostics capability tracks the status of the load for open loads, shorted loads, shorts to power or ground, and whether the audio is playing. This ensures a safe and reliable operation. A low latency path option allows for a quick response for noise cancellation.\n\nThe new AM275x-Q1 MCU and AM62D-Q1 processor integrate the next-generation C7x DSP core for audio applications. These devices achieve four to eight times greater processing performance than competing devices. Running at 1 GHz, they provide 40 GFlops per core, with each core capable of managing multiple audio features simultaneously. Up to two C7x DSP cores are integrated into these devices, which feature 265-bit vector architecture, single cycle accessible L2 memory, and an integrated neural processing accelerator unit (NPU) to enable AI algorithms. The AM275x-Q1 MCU is a DDR-less MCU, while the AM62D-Q1 is a DDR-based processor.\n\nThis combined embedded processing and analog solution for premium automotive audio systems is depicted in Figure 3.",

As part of NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost Mission 1, named Ghost Riders in the Sky, sets the tone for the future of exploration across cislunar space as the first commercial company in history to achieve a fully successful soft-landing on the Moon.\n\n\u201cFirefly is literally and figuratively over the Moon,\u201d said Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. \u201cOur Blue Ghost lunar lander now has a permanent home on the lunar surface with 10 NASA payloads and a plaque with every Firefly employee\u2019s name. This bold, unstoppable team has proven we\u2019re well equipped to deliver reliable, affordable access to the Moon, and we won\u2019t stop there. With annual lunar missions, Firefly is paving the way for a lasting lunar presence that will help unlock access to the rest of the solar system for our nation, our partners, and the world.\u201d\n\nCarrying 10 NASA instruments, Blue Ghost completed a precision landing in Mare Crisium at 2:34 a.m. CST on March 2 and touched down within its 100-meter landing target next to a volcanic feature called Mons Latreille. Blue Ghost\u2019s shock absorbing legs stabilized the lander as it touched down and inertial readings confirmed the lander is upright in a stable configuration. Following touchdown, Firefly is successfully commanding and communicating with the lander from its Mission Operations Center in Cedar Park, Texas.\n\nBlue Ghost will now begin its surface operations and support several NASA science and technology demonstrations over the next 14 days \u2013 equivalent to a full lunar day. The surface operations include lunar subsurface drilling, sample collection, X-ray imaging, and dust mitigation experiments. On March 14, Firefly expects to capture high-definition imagery of a total eclipse when the Earth blocks the sun above the Moon\u2019s horizon. On March 16, Blue Ghost will then capture the lunar sunset, providing data on how lunar dust levitates due to solar influences and creates a lunar horizon glow first documented by Eugene Cernan on Apollo 17. Following the sunset, Blue Ghost will operate several hours into the lunar night and continue to capture imagery that observes how levitating dust behavior changes after the sunset.\n\n\u201cWith the hardest part behind us, Firefly looks forward to completing more than 14 days of surface operations, again raising the bar for commercial cislunar capabilities,\u201d said Shea Ferring, Chief Technology Officer at Firefly Aerospace. \u201cJust through transit to the Moon, Firefly\u2019s mission has already delivered the most science data to date for the NASA CLPS initiative. CLPS has played a key role in Firefly\u2019s evolution from a rocket company to a provider of launch, lunar, and on-orbit services from LEO to cislunar and beyond. We want to thank NASA for entrusting in the Firefly team, and we look forward to delivering even more science data that supports future human missions to the Moon and Mars.\u201d\n\nThroughout its 45-day journey to the Moon, Blue Ghost traveled more than 2.8 million miles, downlinked more than 27 GB of data, and supported several payload science operations. This included signal tracking from the Global Navigation Satellite System at a record-breaking distance with the LuGRE payload, radiation tolerant computing through the Van Allen Belts with the RadPC payload, and measurements of magnetic field changes with the LMS payload.\n\nFirefly will continue to provide regular updates on the Blue Ghost Mission 1 webpage through the completion of the mission. NASA\u2019s Artemis blog will share additional details on payload operations.\n\nAbout Firefly Aerospace\n\nFirefly Aerospace is an end-to-end responsive space company with launch, lunar, and on-orbit services. Headquartered in central Texas, Firefly is a portfolio company of AE Industrial Partners (\u201cAEI\u201d) focused on delivering rapid, reliable, and affordable space access for government and commercial customers. Firefly\u2019s small- to medium-lift launch vehicles, lunar landers, and orbital vehicles provide the space industry with a single source for missions from low Earth orbit to the surface of the Moon and beyond.

Paradoxically, the most talked-about quantity in an EV\u2014its range\u2014isn\u2019t a directly measured value; it\u2019s an estimation. Historically, state estimation has relied on pre-defined algorithms and lookup tables developed through extensive lab testing. But is this traditional approach enough in a world where real-world driving conditions and battery aging introduce unending variability?\n\nWhere Traditional BMS Approaches Fall Short\n\nDeveloping a BMS is a resource-intensive task, deeply tied to the unique architecture of each battery pack. The most expensive and time-consuming part is the calibration of the BMS as it relies on extensive lab testing of the battery at hand.\n\nCells, modules, and packs undergo years of rigorous testing under varied conditions to map their electrochemical behavior. These tests encompass performance assessments, safety evaluations, and lifetime measurements. The data collected forms the foundation for battery models and for static lookup tables, which serve as the backbone of traditional BMS algorithms.\n\nThus, these lookup tables can be seen as pre-computed datasets that map parameters like the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the battery to actual SOC across different temperatures, typically from \u221220 to 60\u00b0C. Additional dimensions, such SOH and charge/discharge rates (C-rates), are often incorporated for greater precision.\n\nTo process these tables and use them in an actual vehicle, traditional BMS algorithms rely on parametrized battery models combined with techniques such as Kalman filters and their variants. Kalman filters dynamically integrate data on voltage, current, and temperature to estimate the SOC and SOH. They rely on highly accurate cell voltage measurements, especially in batteries with lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cathode chemistry that exhibits flat voltage profiles, making small measurement deviations lead to significant prediction errors (Fig. 4).",

That's huge, but here's the real question: can Broadcom maintain that momentum?\n\nAnalysts are currently predicting an EPS of $1.51 for the quarter, with an expected range of $1.44 to $1.55slightly higher than last quarter's $1.42. Broadcom has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time over the past 12 months, whereas its peers have only managed it about 66.88% of the time. If Broadcom outperforms again, it might give investors more confidence in its lofty P/E of 172.87. But let's face it: any slip-up could trigger a steep sell-off.\n\nShould You Invest in Broadcom Inc? A Detailed Stock Breakdown\n\nOn the revenue side, forecasts for Q1 2025 come in at $14.62 billion, up from $14.05 billion last quarter, with projections ranging between $14.39 billion and $14.83 billion. Broadcom has beaten sales estimates 75% of the time, outperforming the industry average of 67.37%. Still, this quarter is a big testwill AI infrastructure and software revenues keep surging?\n\nBeyond EPS and revenue, you'll want to pay attention to free cash flow (FCF) and debt management. Broadcom's FCF margin stood at 39% last quarter, which helped extend its 14-year dividend growth streak. However, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 97.94%, the company's financial leverage is higher than that of its peers. If Broadcom can keep its cash flow stable and allocate capital efficientlyespecially given how capital-intensive AI can beit might keep investors happy.",

The Blue Ghost lunar lander, managed by Texas company Firefly Aerospace, touched down Sunday morning on the moon's near side with NASA's scientific instruments to study the surrounding environment.\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption NASA instruments land on moon with 'Blue Ghost' unmanned lander Texas-based Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" landed on the Earth-facing side of moon with 10 NASA instruments.\n\nA second American company has landed a spacecraft on the moon in an extraordinary feat once solely the realm of government space agencies like NASA.\n\nThe uncrewed lander, named Blue Ghost, made its touch down early Sunday on lunar surface after more than six weeks voyaging millions of miles through the cosmos. Firefly Aerospace, the Texas-based company that built and is operating the spacecraft, was hired by NASA to carry a fleet of scientific instruments to the moon's Earth-facing side to study its environment ahead of plans for astronauts to return in the years ahead.\n\nThe landing precedes by just four days the planned arrival of a second uncrewed American spacecraft built and operated by Intuitive Machines. The space exploration company, also based in Texas, etched its name in the history books a year ago when its spacecraft, Odysseus, became the first commercially-built lunar lander in the U.S. to ever make it to the moon.\n\nIntuitive Machines' second lander, Athena, is targeting a Thursday, March 6 touchdown on the lunar south pole following a Feb. 26 launch from Florida.\n\nWere astronauts to step foot on the moon as early as 2027 under NASA's Artemis campaign, they'd be the first Americans to do so in five decades since the space agency's Apollo era came to an end in the 1970s.\n\nBut as nostalgic as humanity's return to the moon would be, NASA's lunar interests are far from being merely sentimental. Once astronauts can return to the moon \u2013 and uncrewed landers like Blue Ghost and Athena are considered vital in laying that groundwork \u2013 they'd then fuel up and prepare to continue onward to Mars.\n\n\u201cThis incredible achievement demonstrates how NASA and American companies are leading the way in space exploration for the benefit of all,\u201d NASA acting Administrator Janet Petro said in a statement. \u201cThe technological and science demonstrations onboard Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost Mission 1 will improve our ability to not only discover more science, but to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments for future human exploration \u2013 both in the short term and long term.\u201d\n\nFirefly Aerospace lands Blue Ghost spacecraft on moon\n\nAfter arriving more than two weeks ago to lunar orbit, the Blue Ghost lander, standing more than 6 feet tall, took about an hour to descend in the early Sunday hours. The landing, which NASA and Firefly both livestreamed, concluded by 3:34 a.m. EST with the spacecraft landing in an \"upright, stable configuration,\" Firefly Aerospace said on its mission blog.\n\nPowered by three solar panels, the spacecraft was designed to stick the landing with shock-absorbing feet, a low center of mass and a wide footprint, according to Firefly Aerospace.\n\nThe landing site is near a volcanic feature called Mons Latreille. The region is located within Mare Crisium, a 300-mile-wide basin in the northeast quadrant of the moon's near side, that is believed to have been created by early volcanic eruptions and flooded with basaltic lava more than 3 billion years ago.\n\n\u201cFirefly is literally and figuratively over the moon,\u201d said Jason Kim, the CEO of Firefly Aerospace in a statement. \"Our Blue Ghost lunar lander now has a permanent home on the lunar surface with 10 NASA payloads and a plaque with every Firefly employee\u2019s name.\"\n\n'Literally, figuratively over the moon': Firefly's Blue Ghost lands on lunar surface\n\nLunar landing comes after 45-day trip through space\n\nThe landing concludes a more-than 2.8 million-mile journey that began Jan. 15 when Blue Ghost hitched a ride aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket for a launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on the historic launch pad 39A \u2013 the site of the space agency's Apollo moon mission launches.\n\nFirefly Aerospace has since been regularly providing online updates on the mission, which it's dubbed Ghost Riders in the Sky after the popular country song. Among those updates are many stunning images and videos Firefly has shared that the lander captured throughout its 45-day expedition.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Blue Ghost captured the first images of the moon in the distance days after it fired its engines in a critical burn to raise its apogee \u2013 the point when it is furthest from Earth in its orbit of the planet \u2013 as it prepared to enter the moon's orbit.\n\nThe lander also observed and documented the Earth eclipsing the moon \u2013 from its vantage, at least \u2013 and on Feb. 3 beamed back an incredible \"selfie\" with Earth in the background.\n\nBlue Ghost then captured some striking images of the moon shortly after it entered lunar orbit Feb. 13.\n\nLast week, Blue Ghost got a look of the moon's far side, an area not visible to Earth, that shows our planet rising and setting behind our celestial neighbor. Firefly Aerospace shared the imagery following Blue Ghost's maneuvers to get the spacecraft closer and closer to the lunar surface ahead of the landing.\n\nWhat's next for Blue Ghost lunar lander?\n\nNow that Firefly Aerospace's spacecraft has made it to the surface, it can begin its mission to deliver and help test a fleet of NASA's scientific instruments to study the moon's environment before humans return.\n\nThe 10 instruments Blue Ghost transported to the moon constitute what NASA said is the largest delivery to date under its Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS. The CLPS program allows the U.S. space agency to find lower-cost methods to finance lunar deliveries without having to develop spacecraft of its own, as it historically has done.\n\nThe technology will next be put to use for a complete lunar day, equivalent to about 14 Earth days.\n\nThe instruments Blue Ghost carries, many of which were tested in transit to the moon, are for things like lunar subsurface drilling, sample collection, X-ray imaging and dust mitigation. The data NASA hopes to collect should also provide insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect Earth.\n\nAdditionally, Blue Ghost plans to capture high-definition imagery of a total lunar eclipse as the Earth blocks the sun above the moon's horizon just before a lunar sunset ushers in frigid lunar night a couple days later. The total lunar eclipse will be visible to millions from Earth on March 13-14.\n\n\u201cThe science and technology we send to the moon now helps prepare the way for future NASA exploration and long-term human presence to inspire the world for generations to come,\u201d Nicky Fox, associate administrator for science at NASA's headquarters in Washington, D.C. said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re sending these payloads by working with American companies \u2013 which supports a growing lunar economy.\u201d\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

This was accomplished by designing on-chip, high-efficiency DC-to-DC conversions to operate circuitry that normally hogs current. The system-on-a-chip solution required redesigning select memory and logic circuits to operate at the lower voltage.\n\nAnother key to the design was overcoming processing variations on chips, since even the slightest variations are exaggerated by the ultra-low power operating voltage.\n\nPartner Content View All\n\nBy GLOBAL UNICHIP CORP.

These include devices ranging from cellphones to medical implants to wireless sensor networks. Portable devices based on the technique could increase battery life by a factor of 10, according to the developers, and some could even run off of energy harvested from the environment.\n\nThe design technique could show up \u201cin five years, maybe even sooner,\u201d said Chandrakasan.\n\nMedical implants are an especially attractive application, according to Chandrakasan, because the ultra-low voltages could be harvested from the \u201cambient energy\u201d in a patient's body, thereby powering medical implants indefinitely without batteries.\n\nPortable devices could also be based on the new design technique, according to Chandrakasan, as well as military applications such as ultra-small wireless sensor networks that could draw power from the environment after deployment on the battlefield.\n\nResearch funding for the project was provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Texas Instruments.",

While many have raced out to juicy gains, we\u2019ve also seen previous investor favorites like Applovin and Palantir nosedive 25%, illustrating the true extent of sentiment volatility pervading the market. Investors are concerned about inflation, the effects of potential tariffs, and elevated valuations ripening for a fall. This backdrop makes it as good a time as any to return to basics and consider investing in some tried-and-true value-oriented dividend stocks. Whether you\u2019re looking to avoid market volatility or add a more defensive holding to your portfolio to complement high-flying but volatile growth stocks, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is worth consideration.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving Strong Buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on SCHD based on its diversified and inexpensively valued portfolio, attractive 3.5% dividend yield, and cost-effective expense ratio. Additionally, sell-side analysts collectively rate it as Moderate Buy and view it as having a double-digit percentage upside over the next 12 months.\n\nSchwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) price history over the past 10 years\n\nSCHD ETF has appreciated 13% over the past year, 21% over the past three years, and 95% over five years. Over ten years, the fund\u2019s return stands at 189%. When it comes to consistent performance and reliable returns, this is it.\n\nWhat is the SCHD\u2019s Market Strategy?\n\nSCHD tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and is one of the most popular ETFs out there today, with assets under management (AUM) of nearly $70 billion. According to Charles Schwab, SHCD is \u201cfocused on the quality and sustainability of dividends\u201d and \u201cinvests in stocks selected for fundamental strength relative to their peers, based on financial ratios.\u201d\n\nSCHD holds 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 42.8% of its assets, so this is a reasonably diversified fund. You can check out an overview of SCHD\u2019s top 10 holdings below, using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nSchwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) holdings information\n\nSCHD invests primarily in blue-chip U.S. dividend stocks spanning an array of industries and sectors. Its top 10 holdings include consumer staples giants like Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP), big-name healthcare and pharma stocks like Abbvie (ABBV), Amgen (AMGN), Pfizer (PFE), and Bristol-Myers Squib (BMY), and dividend-paying tech stocks like Cisco (CSCO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).\n\nIn addition to paying dividends, an advantage to owning these stocks is that they are quite a bit cheaper than the broader market. The S&P 500 trades at nearly 26x trailing 12-month earnings, while SCHD\u2019s portfolio trades for just 17 times earnings (as of the end of the most recent month), meaning that SCHD is about one-third cheaper than the S&P 500. The inexpensive valuation of SCHD\u2019s holdings and its strong dividend yield give SCHD a strong defense against market volatility and pullbacks.",

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nBrooks & Dunn, popular American country music duo who became a fixture in the genre in the early 1990s. The band members are:\n\nBy age six Brooks was playing the ukulele; by the time he was a student at Louisiana State University, he was performing regularly in nightclubs. He moved around the United States, working on the Alaska oil pipeline and at an advertising job in Maine. Finally he went to Nashville, where he took a position on the staff of Tree Publishing, writing hit songs for acts such as Sawyer Brown and the Oak Ridge Boys. He also recorded a self-titled solo album before teaming with Dunn in 1990.\n\nDunn\u2019s father was a musician who also worked on oil rigs; his father\u2019s musicianship and his mother\u2019s devout Baptist faith were strong influences on him. When he was a student at Abilene (Texas) Christian College, planning to be a preacher, a dean gave him an ultimatum: quit playing music in bars or leave school. Dunn chose music. After winning the Marlboro Country Music Talent Search, he moved to Nashville and signed with Tree Publishing.\n\nArista Records executive Tim DuBois was familiar with the songwriting talents of both men and introduced them in 1990, suggesting that they write songs together. Both artists had set their sights on solo careers but agreed to give the partnership a try. Their first effort became the title track of the album Brand New Man (1991), which also included the hit single \u201cBoot Scootin\u2019 Boogie.\u201d Their second full-length recording, Hard Workin\u2019 Man (1993), confirmed their popularity, debuting at number three on the Billboard country album chart. Brooks & Dunn continued to satisfy country music audiences with such releases as Waitin\u2019 on Sundown (1994), If You See Her (1998), Steers & Stripes (2001), and Red Dirt Road (2003). With the laid-back Dunn singing and the wildly energetic Brooks playing guitar, the duo also had strong appeal in concert.\n\nDuring their career together, Brooks & Dunn won several entertainer of the year awards\u2014one from the Country Music Association (CMA) and three from the Academy of Country Music (ACM). From the string of good-time honky-tonk hits of their early years to the slick musicianship of Cowboy Town (2007), they parlayed their partnership into extraordinarily consistent success. By 2007, with two Grammy Awards and a host of CMA and ACM awards to their credit, Brooks & Dunn had expanded their musical repertoire, incorporating some straight-ahead rock and roll, covering the occasional classic country hit, and even composing a few somber ballads.\n\nBrooks & Dunn disbanded after their 2010 concert tour; Dunn released his debut solo album, Ronnie Dunn, in 2011, and Brooks resumed his own solo career a year later. In 2015, however, the duo and Reba McEntire performed in a residency show at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Brooks & Dunn continued to appear together, and in 2019 they released Reboot, on which they rerecorded their hits with younger country musicians. That year the duo also was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 2024 they released Reboot II and picked up the CMA Award for vocal duo of the year.",

            "content": "SiTime Corporation ( ), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGM over the last few months, increasing to US$261 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$153. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether SiTime's current trading price of US$155 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at SiTime\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nWhat Is SiTime Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, SiTime seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy SiTime today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $190.37, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because SiTime\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nCan we expect growth from SiTime?\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. SiTime's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 70%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SITM\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on SITM, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

            "content": "Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) has had a rough month with its share price down 16%. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Qorvo is:\n\n0.8% = US$27m \u00f7 US$3.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.01 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Qorvo's Earnings Growth And 0.8% ROE\n\nIt is hard to argue that Qorvo's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 35% seen by Qorvo was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nThat being said, we compared Qorvo's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 15% in the same 5-year period.\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is QRVO fairly valued? This has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Qorvo Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nQorvo doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about Qorvo. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it. Discover if Qorvo might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.

Today we are looking at onsemi (NASDAQ:ON) and the best and worst performers in the analog semiconductors industry.\n\nDemand for analog chips is generally linked to the overall level of economic growth, as analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment. Unlike digital chip designers, analog chip makers tend to produce the majority of their own chips, as analog chip production does not require expensive leading edge nodes. Less dependent on major secular growth drivers, analog product cycles are much longer, often 5-7 years.\n\nThe 14 analog semiconductors stocks we track reported a mixed Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.7% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was above.\n\nWhile some analog semiconductors stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 3.6% since the latest earnings results.\n\nonsemi (NASDAQ:ON)\n\nSpun out of Motorola in 1999 and built through a series of acquisitions, onsemi (NASDAQ:ON) is a global provider of analog chips specializing in autos, industrial applications, and power management in cloud data centers.\n\nonsemi reported revenues of $1.72 billion, down 14.6% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.8%. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with a significant miss of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to navigate this market downturn, our actions over the last four years have proven we are a structurally different company that is well-equipped to navigate prolonged volatility,\u201d said Hassane El-Khoury, president and CEO, onsemi.\n\nonsemi Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 7.1% since reporting and currently trades at $47.61.\n\nRead our full report on onsemi here, it\u2019s free.\n\nBest Q4: Himax (NASDAQ:HIMX)\n\nTaiwan-based Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a leading manufacturer of display driver chips and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, and mobile phones.\n\nHimax reported revenues of $237.2 million, up 4.2% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 7.3%. The business had an incredible quarter with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates.\n\nHimax Total Revenue\n\nThe market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 7.1% since reporting.

Steve Campbell/Houston Chronicle\n\nApple\u2019s decision this week to build a massive facility in Houston for making AI servers could mark a resurrection of the region's tech past that began with Texas Instruments in the 1970s, continued with Compaq Computer Corp. in the '80s and '90s and faded as Asia dominated the arena.\n\nPart of a $500 billion investment in U.S. technology over the next four years, the Houston project will thrust the area into the competitive artificial intelligence arena. That\u2019s because the servers that will be assembled here will be a key part of delivering Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s AI effort that trails most rivals.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nApple left a lot unsaid in its announcement on Monday, including where in Houston its 250,000-square-foot manufacturing plant will be built and the identity of the \u201cpartners\u201d that will handle the server assembly until the factory is up and running. But the Greater Houston Partnership, the region's chamber of commerce, identified Hon Hai Foxconn, which builds many of Apple\u2019s products in China, as at least one of those involved in the project.\n\n\u201cThe Apple announcement is an expansion of a multi-building manufacturing complex managed by Foxconn in northwest Harris County, which produces high-tech components for numerous global technology companies, including Apple,\u201d GHP said in a statement. \u201cFoxconn\u2019s parent company, Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., announced in November that it was expanding its Houston presence by acquiring land and a facility to enhance its artificial intelligence server production in the U.S. That specific expansion project is expected to create 300 jobs with $225 million in capital investment.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s reveal filled in some blanks in Foxconn\u2019s November announcement, but it wasn\u2019t the newest of news, given that pieces of the deal had been made public as far back as August. But it likely was helpful to package it together now as Apple CEO Tim Cook has been cozying up to President Donald Trump, who is threatening to levy tariffs on foreign imports. Apple said in its announcement that the Houston facility would replace others overseas.\n\nApple behaved similarly in the Trump 1.0 era, touting a factory in Austin in 2019 that builds the Mac Pro, the company\u2019s high-end desktop computer, in a gesture designed to avoid tariffs then. However, the factory had been making the machines since 2013, long before Trump toured it with Cook as a photo op. That said, the Houston server facility will indeed be bringing overseas manufacturing back to the U.S.\n\nIt also may serve to jump-start the return of electronics manufacturing in Houston, which was a major industry in its heyday, spurred on by the presence of Compaq Computer Corp., at one point the biggest maker of personal computers in the world. Mark Vena, a tech industry analyst who was a consumer product manager at Compaq from 1991 to 2001, said the company relied on the contract manufacturers here, many of whom grew as Compaq did.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThat\u2019s because Compaq made all its products in Houston, in a multimillion-dollar factory in northwest Harris County, Vena said. But in the late 1990s, Asian manufacturers became a more cost-effective way to build electronics, and companies like Compaq began feeling economic pressure to move those operations out of the U.S.\n\n\u201cTaiwan was becoming a big, big threat,\u201d Vena said. \u201cIn 1995 or \u201996 our supply-chain folks would come to a meeting and they would basically tell us, \u2018Hey, by the way, you know, if a Compal or a Foxconn (Taiwanese computer-makers) built a PC for us, you could reduce our costs significantly.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne of the \u201csupply-chain folks\u201d in those meetings was Cook, who worked as vice president of corporate materials at Compaq in 1997 before he was lured to Apple by Steve Jobs a year later.\n\nAt the time, Houston was home to large and small electronics companies, including Benchmark, Sterling and Kent. Craig Rhodes, GHP's senior vice president of economic development, said through a spokesperson that once Compaq moved its manufacturing overseas, many of those companies dried up.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nBut one has remained: Foxconn, which has been active in the Houston area for about 20 years and had worked with Compaq.\n\nRhodes said Apple\u2019s facility, scheduled to open next year, could be the start of a \u201crenaissance\u201d for electronics companies, particularly in the wake of the boom in AI, which requires data centers built around the kinds of servers Apple will manufacture here.\n\nAnd Apple is going to need a lot of them. The servers are the foundation of the company\u2019s Private Cloud Compute, in which Apple Intelligence tasks too demanding to be done on a user\u2019s device are encrypted and dispatched to data centers, and results returned to the device.\n\nFor now, Apple Intelligence is available only to a relatively small subset of Apple devices. But as more products supporting Apple Intelligence are released, the company will need to set up more data centers that use the servers built in Houston.\n\nWhether or not it\u2019s the start of a renaissance of electronics manufacturing in Houston, it\u2019s certainly the seed of a growth industry.",

Based on his congratulatory phone call to former president Tsai Ing-wen (\u8521\u82f1\u6587) after her return to power in 2020, the more optimistic among us might have hope for continued support.\n\nAlas, Trump 2.0 is a proposition that has taken even the most canny and cynical of observers by surprise with the aggression he and his administration have shown toward traditional allies. Following threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico and hints of the same against Europe, Trump raised the prospect of trade sanctions against Taiwan, which he accused of stealing US microprocessor know-how.\n\n\u201cTaiwan took our chip business away,\u201d Trump told a press conference on Feb. 13. He followed this up with a threat of 100 percent duties on chips from Taiwan \u201cif they don\u2019t bring it back.\u201d\n\nIsland Tinkerers: Innovation and Transformation in the Making of Taiwan\u2019s Computing Industry, by Honghong Tinn.\n\nTo anyone who had been listening to his campaign pledges, it shouldn\u2019t have been a bombshell. In July last year, Trump had told Bloomberg that Taiwan stole the US\u2019 chip manufacturing industry, that Taipei gave America nothing and that, as such, it should pay Washington for defense just like \u201can insurance policy.\u201d\n\nEconomists and industry experts quickly pointed to the impracticalities of Trump\u2019s strategy, arguing that hitting Taiwan with exorbitant tariffs would simply drive high-end chip prices up, with US consumers footing the bill. The idea that this was would suddenly drive reshoring was also dismissed, with the five-year lead time on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co\u2019s (TSMC) first Arizona fab, set to open this year, offered as an example of how long these things take, and the obvious issues of labor costs highlighted.\n\nElsewhere, Trump\u2019s critics charged that the president betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of how the semiconductor industry works: The US, they explained, was largely responsible for chip design, while Taiwan focused on manufacturing. President William Lai (\u8cf4\u6e05\u5fb7) echoed these remarks, calling the industry an \u201cecosystem\u201d which relied on a division of labor.\n\nIn response, Trump might argue that this was not always so. As Honghong Tinn (\u912d\u82b3\u82b3) writes in this engrossing and meticulously researched new book, it wasn\u2019t until 1987, when Morris Chang (\u5f35\u5fe0\u8b00) founded TSMC as the world\u2019s first dedicated or pure-play foundry, that these distinct roles emerged. Prior to that, leading US technology companies, such as Intel, IBM and Texas Instruments and Asian giants such as Samsung and Toshiba had been integrated device manufacturers, handling all aspects of chip design and fabrication.\n\nREPLICATING SUCCESS\n\nThe dedicated foundry model, which Tinn notes may have been pilfered from then-UMC chairman Robert Tsao (\u66f9\u8208\u8aa0), who had previously consulted Chang about the feasibility of such an undertaking, was established after Taiwan\u2019s \u201cgodfather of technology\u201d minister without portfolio Li Kwo-ting (\u674e\u570b\u9f0e) persuaded Chang to relocate to Taiwan to head the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).\n\nUnlike most of the technologists featured in this book, Chang had never previously lived in Taiwan but \u201chad shaped Taiwan\u2019s electronics industry in a substantive manner\u201d as an informal advisor to the government on technology transfer projects, establishment of manufacturing facilities, and subcontracting work for Texas Instruments and, later, General Instrument.\n\nChang and Tsao\u2019s hunch that dedicated foundries were the way forward for Taiwan was based on several considerations, including the belief that the tinkering-based know-how that had brought Taiwan\u2019s researchers, engineers and technicians success in computer manufacturing could be replicated in the production of integrated circuits (ICs). Another prediction was that IC demand would soon explode, leading electronics companies that lacked the requisite expertise to outsource production.\n\nIn such an environment, large-scale manufacturers would thrive, Chang believed. He was also inspired by Introduction to VLSI System, a legendary textbook by a pair of American computer scientists that is credited with spawning the IC design industry and the division with manufacturing.\n\nMISSING THE BOAT\n\nMore evidence that all of this started before America needed making great again, the Magadonians will insist. Perhaps. But, leaving aside the issues of legitimate technology transfer through official cooperation, the emergence of transnational supply chains, and the legions of US-educated Taiwanese- and Chinese-Americans who moved seamlessly between countries and institutions, a key point missed by those who cry theft is that the US big guns were invited in from the get-go, but declined.\n\nIn fact, on trips to the US to raise seed money, Chang failed to get a hearing with most companies who considered his proposal \u201cunfeasible.\u201d The two that did receive his pitch \u2014 Intel and Texas Instruments \u2014 politely declined. In the end, Dutch multinational Philips was the sole foreign investor with 27.5 percent of the startup capital.\n\nTrue, Intel did soon send personnel to Taiwan to finesse TSMC\u2019s processes with a view to eventually having them subcontract. This began with \u201cleftover\u201d contracts but, with Intel soon unable to fulfil orders, quickly became an official \u201cqualified\u201d independent contractor arrangement. By the mid-1990s, most of TSMC\u2019s sales were to fabless design firms.\n\nBut all of this misses the point: Trump\u2019s playbook on how to lose friends and alienate people tramples all over a relationship that was and continues to be founded on mutual benefit.\n\n\u2018ASPIRATIONAL TINKERERS\u2019\n\nTracing the history of Taiwanese tinkering to National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) alumni who pushed for the re-establishment of the institution in Taiwan, Tinn not only contradicts received wisdom about top-down processes, but she also shows how this was a transnational process from the start.\n\nTo be sure, officials played a role, with vice minister of communications Chien Chi-chen (\u9322\u5176\u741b) pushing the bid for technical assistance under a United Nations Special Program \u2014 the kind of fruitful cooperation that Trump and his enforcer Elon Musk are currently attempting to end.\n\nIn her conclusion, Tinn uses the example of a US high school team comprising undocumented immigrants which bested a group of MIT grads in a robot design competition to highlight what \u201caspirational tinkerers\u201d can achieve.\n\nChien and other early technologists cunningly secured government approval by tying the field of electrical engineering to atomic energy \u2014 an obsession of Chiang Kai-shek (\u8523\u4e2d\u6b63) and his Chinese Nationalist Party government.\n\nThere are, Tinn notes in her conclusion, clear parallels with the way Taiwan\u2019s contemporary technologists have made their products indispensable \u2014 not only to their own national defense but to that of the US and, indeed, the world. Trump would do well to remember where some of the specialized chips used in American fighter jets are sourced.\n\nAside from pragmatic concerns, something more affecting, more essential permeates the pages of this remarkable story: the close personal bonds that were formed between generations of innovators that form the book\u2019s dramatic personae.\n\nRecalling fondly his time as training at an electronics factory in Watseka, Illinois, in the 1960s, Bruce C.H. Cheng (\u912d\u5d07\u83ef) \u2014 who would later found Delta Electronics \u2014 was struck by the camaraderie he was shown.\n\nHis American coworkers were aware that their company was poised to establish a Taiwan facility, jeopardizing their own livelihoods. Joking that they would be hastening their redundancy if Cheng learned too fast, they nevertheless took him under their wing.\n\n\u201c[They] remained enthusiastic about teaching Cheng and his fellow Taiwanese colleagues every part of the production,\u201d writes Tinn, \u201cand they generously took turns inviting Cheng and others to each of their homes.\u201d",

We celebrate the generous IWF members who have volunteered to devote their time and counsel as mentors to our 2024-2025 IWF Leadership Fellows Program class.\n\nIWF Mentors break down one of the three top barriers to women fulfilling their leadership potential: A lack of mentorship. Mentors are matched to meet the specific leadership development needs of Fellows, and work with them one-on-one throughout the fellowship.\n\nMentors are a crucial component of the broader IWF Leadership Fellows Program, which was created in response to the US Department of Labor\u2019s 1991 Glass Ceiling Report which identified three key forces that propelled men in their careers but weren\u2019t there for women: Formal leadership training, mentorship, and access to networks. These forces have been confirmed repeatedly over the last three decades by institutions like Harvard, and companies like Deloitte and Accenture.\n\nOur program was custom built to provide women with these important resources. In partnership with world class resources like INSEAD and Harvard Business School, the Leadership Fellows program provides customized leadership training, as well as global networking opportunities with both a peer cohort and IWF members around the world.\n\nThis year\u2019s IWF Member Mentors are from 27 IWF forums in 8 countries, including Australia, Canada, Finland, South Africa, Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, United Kingdom, and United States.

            "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Texas Instruments (TXN) standing at $198.24, reflecting a -0.87% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.01%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.43%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.26%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 10.75% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 5.51% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.26% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Texas Instruments in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.06, showcasing a 11.67% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.91 billion, up 6.74% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.35 per share and revenue of $17.05 billion, which would represent changes of +2.88% and +9%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Texas Instruments should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.57% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Texas Instruments is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Texas Instruments's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 37.4. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 30.95, which means Texas Instruments is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nIt's also important to note that TXN currently trades at a PEG ratio of 3.23. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The average PEG ratio for the Semiconductor - General industry stood at 2.17 at the close of the market yesterday.",

By Scott's side was his wife Sherry, his daughters Amber (Xiao Ye) and Brandi, his brother John, his sister Amy and his nephew Bobby. Scott was born in Dallas, Texas and raised in Allen, Texas until his early teenage years when most of his family, including Scott, moved to Singapore where Scott spent most of his adolescent years.\n\nScott married Sherry Lynn Davis on January 28, 1995 in Atlanta, Georgia. They were married for 30 years and were blessed with 2 beautiful daughters. Scott and Sherry adopted both girls from China when they were 9 months old, saying over and over that the girls are probably more loved than a blood child.\n\nScott worked as a chemical engineer at Texas Instruments in Lehi, Utah. Scott was more than his occupation and was known for his love of music, football, movies and cooking. During his free time Scott would volunteer for FIRST LEGO competitions and speed skating.\n\nOn January 14th, 2024 Scott underwent a dual lung transplant surgery that saved his life. During his recovery, he had become his best self in years, but then he got COVID 19. The transplant team did everything they could, however none of the treatments worked. Scott's cause of death was rapidly progressive rejection with resistance to all treatments.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife Sherry Lynn Davis Holmes, his daughter Amber (Xiao Ye) Holmes and Brandi Holmes, his mother Bettye Holmes, his brother John Holmes and his sisters Amy Holmes and Beth Alonzo.\n\nScott was preceded in death by his father Robert Holmes and brother Patrick Holmes.\n\nScott will be known for his wise words that were laced with humor and for his kind heart that affected many lives.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family asks to instead make donations to the University of Utah lung transplant research program.\n\nhttps://ugive.app.utah.edu/designation/345?specialInstructions=Transplant%20Buddy%20Fund%20(HSC11160-40165)&utm_source=vanity\n\nIn honor of Scott's wishes, viewings will take place on March 6 from 6-8 PM and March 7 from 5:45- 6:45 with a funeral service following the viewing on March 7.

            "content": "Texas Instruments (TXN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +10.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.3% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Texas Instruments belongs, has lost 9.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nTexas Instruments is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.35 points to a change of +2.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.44 indicates a change of +20.5% from what Texas Instruments is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Texas Instruments.",

Measured from the top surface of the tendon, the entire bone anchor is inserted to a depth of greater than or equal to 20 mm. during a rotator cuff repair on the humeral head. The anchor is pushed by the same bone punch that formed the initial hole to assure proper depth of placement. Further, the apparatus includes a nub portion that, in use, protrudes into the bone hole formed by the bone punch and maintains registration with the bone hole when the bone punch is retracted. An angled distal end on the anchor initiates toggling during insertion into the bone and at least one proximal projecting fin prevents the anchor from backing out of the bone hole while facilitating further rotation of the anchor when a suture is pulled to complete toggling.\n\n[A61B] DIAGNOSIS; SURGERY; IDENTIFICATION (analysing biological material G01N, e.g. G01N 33/48)\n\nSelf-adjusting catheter\n\nPatent No. 12201312\n\nInventor(s): Arthur John Ulm, III (Nashville, TN), Gustavo Prado (San Diego, CA), Russel Corvese (Lake Forest, CA)\n\nAssignee(s): Legacy Ventures LLC (Plano, TX)\n\nLaw Firm: No Counsel\n\nApplication No., Date, Speed: 18668339 on 05/20/2024 (246 days app to issue)\n\nAbstract: Catheters and uses of same are described.

Apple on Monday said it would open a 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility in the Houston area, part of what it said would be a $500 billion investment in several business lines over the next four years Jeff Chiu/AP Apple CEO Tim Cook is seen on the field prior to Super Bowl LIX between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at Caesars Superdome on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Cooper Neill/Getty Images\n\nApple on Monday said it plans to open a 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility in the Houston area, part of an anticipated $500 billion investment in several business lines over the next four years.\n\nWhile the location of the planned facility was not identified, Apple has a longstanding relationship with Foxconn, the China-based manufacturer that assembles most iPhones. Foxconn, which has its U.S. headquarters in Milwaukee, has been developing a presence in Houston, leasing 200,200 square feet in the Sam Houston Distribution Center in northwest Houston in 2021 and 287,000 square feet about a mile away last year, according to data from Transwestern.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nFoxconn's parent company, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., said in November that it had acquired more than 10 acres in Harris County near the first Foxconn warehouse in a $33 million deal, reportedly to expand its artificial intelligence server production.\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said the proposed plant was scheduled to open in 2026 and would create thousands of jobs.\n\nThe server components built in the Houston area would replace those manufactured overseas, the company said in a statement. Apple's announcement comes as President Donald Trump imposed a 10% tariff earlier this month on goods imported from China and days after the president met with CEO Tim Cook.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump lauded the news.\n\n\"APPLE HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A RECORD 500 BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE REASON, FAITH IN WHAT WE ARE DOING, WITHOUT WHICH, THEY WOULD\u2019NT (sic) BE INVESTING TEN CENTS. THANK YOU TIM COOK AND APPLE!!!,\" he wrote Monday morning.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Apple announcement comes days after Trump and Cook met in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I had Tim Cook in the office from Apple,\" Trump said Feb. 21. \"He's investing hundreds of billions of dollars.\"\n\nThe servers produced at the Houston facility would be used in the company\u2019s Apple Intelligence, an artificial intelligence product the company is rolling out in iPhones, iPads and Macintosh computers. While the company strives to keep most of its AI processing on users\u2019 devices in the name of privacy, tasks bigger than the device can handle are completed at data centers.\n\nThe investment in the Houston region is part of what the company said was its \u201clargest-ever spend commitment,\u201d supporting \u201ca wide range of initiatives that focus on artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and skills development for students and workers across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d Cook said in the statement. \u201cFrom doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we\u2019re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we\u2019ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe focus of the investments, the company said, would be on \u201ca wide range of initiatives that focus on artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and skills development for students and workers across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s announcement further solidifies Houston\u2019s leadership as a hub for innovation and advanced manufacturing,\" Steve Kean, CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership, said in a statement. \"This is a testament to our region\u2019s business-friendly environment, skilled workforce, strategic global positioning, and proven ability to attract world-class companies. As U.S. companies continue to onshore their manufacturing operations, we are bullish on Houston\u2019s ability to win big.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the investment in the Houston area, Apple said the $500 billion commitment included plans to double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, create a training academy in Detroit and to expand research and development investments in the U.S. to support fields such as silicon engineering. The company said the spend would affect suppliers across all 50 states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data centers, corporate facilities and Apple TV+ productions.\n\nHouston has a long history of electronics manufacturing and distribution, dating to the days of Texas Instruments in the 1970s and 1980s; to the rise of Compaq Computer, where Cook worked when Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs recruited him; to a slew of third-party electronics manufacturers that spun up to supply Compaq in the 1980s and '90s.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nApple's arrival in Houston came in 2002, when it opened a retail location in the Galleria. In 2017 Houston Community College began offering an Apple app development curriculum.\n\nTech columnist Dwight Silverman and staff writers Erica Grieder and Marissa Luck contributed.",

Used with Permission.\n\nWe all know the stories. A Kodak researcher invented the first digital camera, but the company decided not to adopt it, fearing it would cannibalize their film business. Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center developed a wide range of technologies that Apple and Microsoft then used to dominate the personal computer market. Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor invented the integrated circuit, only to have Intel, AMD, and other companies commercialize it.\n\nThese anecdotes are potent examples of successful inventions that failed to translate into durable innovations\u2014at least for the inventors. In all three cases, a company\u2019s central research organization delivered a groundbreaking invention but did not realize the commercial benefits. Why is this pattern so common, and how can it be avoided?\n\nTo answer this question, we turn to the story of Microsoft Research (MSR). To get the story underway, let\u2019s review a framework introduced by Donald Stokes in his 1997 publication Pasteur\u2019s Quadrant: Basic Science and Technological Innovation. Stokes defined research in two dimensions: first, the degree to which research seeks deep, foundational understandings of the universe, and second, the extent to which it aims to create practical solutions to real-world problems.\n\nViewing research through this lens, he defined three categories:\n\nPure basic research: Often called curiosity-driven research, pure basic research has the sole mission of deciphering the mysteries of the universe without an immediate agenda to convert that wisdom into practical applications. Theoretical physics and molecular biology fit here. Applied research: This stands in stark contrast to pure research. The mission here is crystal clear: apply knowledge to create valuable products and services. This is the realm of applied scientists, engineers, technologists, and others developing solutions to practical problems. Use-inspired basic research: Straddling the worlds of pure and applied research, this category aims to advance knowledge to solve real-world problems. While it is rooted in pursuing knowledge, its trajectory is driven by practical needs. The Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is one of the most successful organizations with this focus.\n\nStokes organized these categories into a two-by-two matrix and named the quadrants after Niels Bohr, Thomas Edison, and Louis Pasteur. He left the lower-left quadrant unnamed, maybe deciding that something with no practical purpose that also does not advance knowledge wasn\u2019t worth the effort. This unnamed quadrant is sometimes referred to as tinkering.\n\nStokes\u2019s framework visualizes the invention-innovation challenge of industrial research labs: how to balance the effort within the three named quadrants of research. A focus on basic research is necessary for groundbreaking discoveries that fuel future revolutions. But, without follow-through to commercialization, the return on investment will end up in someone else\u2019s pocket (as the researchers at Kodak, Texas Instruments, Fairchild, and Xerox learned). Conversely, too pronounced a preference for applied research might yield short-term victories, but risks boxing the company into a follower position.\n\nPasteur\u2019s quadrant, introduced by Donald Stokes in 1997.\n\nThen there\u2019s the allure of use-inspired basic research, which, on the surface, seems like the perfect middle path. Few companies in the private sector have mastered this balance, though. Even with the best intentions, the scale often leans, shifting the focus toward one of the other two quadrants over time. In publicly listed companies, the pull toward more applied research can be particularly strong given the emphasis on delivering near-term profitability.\n\nIn 1991, when Bill Gates and Nathan Myhrvold, then the head of Microsoft Advanced Technologies, invited Rick Rashid, a prominent professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, to be the inaugural lab director of MSR, Stokes\u2019s framework did not yet exist. But the challenge it illustrated did.\n\nTo walk the tightrope Stokes would later describe, Rick started by crafting a clear mission statement. He believed it was essential to highlight the lab\u2019s expansive vision and the nuanced challenges, providing clarity to all employees and collaborators about MSR\u2019s purpose. After in-depth reflection and discussions, a three-part, 27-word statement emerged.\n\nTry Big Think+ for your business Engaging content on the skills that matter, taught by world-class experts. Request a Demo\n\nThe first part, expand the state of art in each of the areas in which we do research, emphasizes the commitment to progress in knowledge, i.e., Bohr\u2019s quadrant. Early on, Rick noted that the essence of this principle was about advancing research, regardless of the immediate utility to Microsoft. This ideal was cemented when MSR adopted an open publication approach, commonly seen in academia but unprecedented in industry due to concerns regarding intellectual property. MSR researchers were given free rein to publish any research findings if no information on products or planning was involved. They were also given the freedom to engage in and decide on seeking relevant IP protection via patents before publication.\n\nThe second part, rapidly transfer innovative technologies into Microsoft products, emphasizes the importance of turning scientific developments into real-world applications, i.e., Edison\u2019s quadrant. Dan Ling, an early member of MSR, reflected on this at the lab\u2019s 20th anniversary. He highlighted the significance of MSR\u2019s central location within Microsoft\u2019s campus, fostering collaboration and technology transfer between research and product teams.\n\nThe last part, ensure that Microsoft products have a future, underscores the ever-evolving nature of the tech sector. Long before Andy Grove\u2019s book Only the Paranoid Survive was published, MSR embraced the idea that longevity in tech must be continually earned. This principle was implemented through later practices at MSR, like the annual Disruptive Technology Review, where top company executives received a day-long intensive briefing from researchers about potentially game-changing technologies of likely profound importance to the company and the industry.\n\nMSR\u2019s mission statement encapsulated the organization\u2019s ambitions and pointed it squarely at the namesake quadrant of Stokes\u2019s matrix. Remarkably, only a handful of words in this statement have been modified over the last three decades.",

This new pledge builds on Apple\u2019s long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing, and will support a wide range of initiatives that focus on artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and skills development for students and workers across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cFrom doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we\u2019re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we\u2019ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\u201d\n\nAs part of this package of U.S. investments, Apple and partners will open a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston to produce servers that support Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that helps users write, express themselves, and get things done. Apple will also double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, create an academy in Michigan to train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering.\n\nThe $500 billion commitment includes Apple\u2019s work with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data centers, corporate facilities, and Apple TV+ productions in 20 states. Apple remains one of the largest U.S. taxpayers, having paid more than $75 billion in U.S. taxes over the past five years, including $19 billion in 2024 alone.\n\nToday, Apple supports more than 2.9 million jobs across the country through direct employment, work with U.S.-based suppliers and manufacturers, and developer jobs in the thriving iOS app economy.\n\nOpening a New Manufacturing Facility in Houston\n\nAs part of its new U.S. investments, Apple will work with manufacturing partners to begin production of servers in Houston later this year. A 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs.\n\nPreviously manufactured outside the U.S., the servers that will soon be assembled in Houston play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence, and are the foundation of Private Cloud Compute, which combines powerful AI processing with the most advanced security architecture ever deployed at scale for AI cloud computing. The servers bring together years of R&D by Apple engineers, and deliver the industry-leading security and performance of Apple silicon to the data center.\n\nTeams at Apple designed the servers to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers \u2014 which already run on 100 percent renewable energy. As Apple brings Apple Intelligence to customers across the U.S., it also plans to continue expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\nDoubling Apple\u2019s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund\n\nAs part of this new investment, Apple is doubling its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which was created in 2017 to support world-class innovation and high-skilled manufacturing jobs across America. The growing commitment will increase the fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, focused on promoting advanced manufacturing and skills development throughout the country.\n\nThe fund\u2019s expansion includes a multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon in TSMC\u2019s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. Apple is the largest customer at this state-of-the-art facility, which employs more than 2,000 workers to manufacture the chips in the United States. Mass production of Apple chips began last month.\n\nSilicon used by Apple is designed to bring Apple users incredible features, performance, and power efficiency across their devices. Apple\u2019s suppliers already manufacture silicon in 24 factories across 12 states, including Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, and Utah. The company\u2019s investments in the sector help create thousands of high-paying jobs across the country at U.S. companies like Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Skyworks, and Qorvo.\n\nTo date, Apple\u2019s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund has supported projects in 13 states \u2014 including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Indiana \u2014 that have helped build local businesses, train workers, and create a wide range of innovative manufacturing processes and materials for Apple products.\n\nGrowing R&D Investments Across the U.S.\n\nApple continues to expand its R&D across the U.S. In the past five years, Apple has nearly doubled its U.S.-based advanced R&D spend, and it will continue to accelerate its growth.\n\nRecently, Apple announced the newest addition to its iPhone lineup, iPhone 16e. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1 \u2014 the first cellular modem designed by Apple, and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone. Apple C1 adds a new chapter to the story of Apple silicon and is the result of years of R&D investment, bringing together the work of thousands of engineers. Apple C1 is the start of a long-term strategy that will allow Apple to innovate and optimize the modem system for additional Apple products.\n\nIn the next four years, Apple plans to hire around 20,000 people, of which the vast majority will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning. The expanded commitment includes significant investment in Apple\u2019s R&D hubs across the country. This includes growing teams across the U.S. focused on areas including custom silicon, hardware engineering, software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\nSupporting American Businesses with a New Manufacturing Academy in Detroit\n\nTo help companies transition to advanced manufacturing, Apple will open the Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. Apple engineers, along with experts from top universities such as Michigan State, will consult with small- and medium-sized businesses on implementing AI and smart manufacturing techniques. The academy will also offer free in-person and online courses, with a skills development curriculum that teaches workers vital skills like project management and manufacturing process optimization. The courses will help drive productivity, efficiency, and quality in companies\u2019 supply chains.\n\nApple has long been committed to investing in education and skills development for American workers and students. That includes ongoing and expanding grant programs for organizations like 4-H, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and FIRST, which work closely with Apple in communities across the country to create free programming that helps young people learn vital skills like coding.\n\nApple\u2019s support for the next generation of innovators also includes efforts like the company\u2019s New Silicon Initiative, which prepares students for careers in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. Last year, this program expanded to students at Georgia Tech, and it now reaches students at eight schools across the country. Apple is continuing to expand the initiative, including a new collaboration with UCLA\u2019s Center for Education of Microchip Designers (CEMiD) beginning this year.\n\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple\u2019s six software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+.

Cremation arrangements are under the direction of Carroway Funeral Home.\n\nSteve was born March 22, 1958 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to Mary Lou (Mallet) and Charles Patrick Hartman. He was raised just outside Lufkin and attended Herty Elementary. Their Catholic faith was important as Steve as growing up and he served as an altar boy for Sunday Mass. He was involved in Boy Scouts, attaining the ranking of Second Class, but mostly due to the urging of his dad, who was one of the Scout Masters. His dad registered him for a social security card when he was 13 so he began working at an early age. After high school, a neighbor introduced him to an apprentice job in Saudi Arabia. After working hard and saving money, he was so proud to have purchased a brand-new car, a T-top Trans-Am. However, two weeks later he was involved in an accident that left him as a quadriplegic in a wheelchair. After nine months in a Houston hospital, he returned home to learn how to live a very different life. With a lot of help and support from friends, family, students and teachers, he attended Angelina College. He was instrumental in working with new programs coming from Texas Instruments, involving new voice command programs. Purchasing a van was another door opening towards his independence. Upon graduating, he secured a job at the Texas Highway Department. With his disabilities and wheelchair requirements, he forged a lot of new ground in those days. He attended Stephen F. Austin State University to major in Rehabilitation and Psychology. The university was just completing guidelines for the Disability Act of 1973, therefore most classes had wheelchair accessibility and some buildings had elevators. After graduation he began teaching life skills to developmental high school students through the co-op of area schools. He also became a Walmart greeter, which he thoroughly enjoyed because he had the opportunity to meet and visit with a lot of people. Although he had a busy work schedule, he looked so forward to going every day, because at one time he thought he would never be able to, and it gave him purpose and made his life worth living each day. Life threw a lot of challenges his way, but his independence was something he greatly valued.\n\nSurvivors include his sisters and brothers-in-law, Melissa and Michael Morrison of Apple Springs, Laurie McCleskey and Kevin Salley of Lufkin; niece, Jennifer Morrison of Cypress; nephews, Allen Morrison of Tyler and Terry Morrison of Tom Bean; along with numerous cousins and other relatives.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents and multiple aunts and uncles.\n\nMemories and condolences may be added at www.carrowayfuneralhome.com.\n\nCarroway Funeral Home, Lufkin, directors.",

            "content": "GaN driver GaN in Space\n\nModern satellite systems are becoming increasingly complex. Therefore, the demand for efficient and space-saving power supply solutions for space applications is growing. New GaN FET gate drivers enable compact, high-performance energy management. This optimizes size, weight, and energy efficiency.\n\nIn addition to GaN FETs, GaN FET gate drivers are also needed and provide precise control with short switching times. (Image: Texas Instruments)\n\nSatellites have to handle a variety of tasks, ranging from high-resolution earth observations to global data transmissions. This naturally increases the power demand, as sensors and data processing become increasingly sophisticated. Therefore, compact and highly efficient power supplies are essential. In addition to GaN-FETs, GaN-FET gate drivers are also required to provide precise control with short switching times. This allows for improved utilization of energy generated by solar cells, which directly affects the operational efficiency of the satellites.\n\nWhen using semiconductors in space, many challenges need to be considered. One of the most significant is the exposure to radiation. Electronic components can be damaged or disrupted in their function by high-energy particles from cosmic radiation or from the sun. For this reason, semiconductors must be either radiation-tolerant or radiation-hardened (Rad-Hard / Radiation-hardened).\n\nTwo major radiation effects are the Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and the Single Event Effects (SEE). A TID involves a long-term radiation exposure that changes the electrical properties of a semiconductor. SEE, on the other hand, can trigger switching processes in the semiconductor or cause permanent damage due to single particles.\n\nIn addition to radiation, semiconductors must also withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Although it's often comfortably cool in space, which rarely leads to overheating (-328\u00b0F), temperatures over 302\u00b0F can also occur. To endure such conditions, special cooling mechanisms or heat-resistant housing materials are necessary. Furthermore, the components must withstand mechanical stresses. In addition to constant thermal expansion, intense vibrations and acceleration forces occur during rocket launches. To tackle these challenges, semiconductors for space use are often employed in hermetically sealed housings. These protect them from mechanical stresses and environmental influences. Therefore, material choice is crucial. For radiation, housing materials with high density and high atomic number are necessary.\n\nLong-term reliability is also a crucial factor. Since satellites and space probes are often operated for years or decades without maintenance possibilities, semiconductors must exhibit a very low error rate. Components qualified for space use meet strict standards such as QML-V (Qualified Manufacturers List) or Space Enhanced Plastic (SEP), ensuring a long lifespan. Power supply in space is mostly achieved with the help of solar energy. To optimally use the limited energy of these cells, semiconductors with high efficiency are necessary. Especially modern technologies like gallium nitride (GaN) or silicon carbide (SiC) are the first choice here.\n\nSWaP optimization for satellites\n\nThe reduction of Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) is a crucial factor for modern space missions. GaN technology contributes to increased efficiency and mass reduction and offers the following benefits:\n\nHigher performance and improved energy conversion\n\nExtended mission lifespan through reduced thermal stress\n\nMore compact design for space-saving layouts\n\nReduced cooling effort due to lower power loss\n\nVersatile applications\n\nWide input voltage support for various satellite systems\n\n200V variant for propulsion systems and primary power conversion from solar panels\n\n60V and 22V versions for distribution and conversion tasks within the satellite\n\nThe radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant variants make the components suitable for long-term use in low, medium, and geostationary orbits.

            "content": "experienced a significant 13% price move over the last week, catching considerable market attention. This came amid several key corporate updates. The company announced its fourth-quarter earnings on January 23, revealing a decline in sales and net income compared to the previous year, impacting investor sentiment. Despite this, Texas Instruments maintained a robust buyback initiative, repurchasing 2.75 million shares in Q4 2024. Furthermore, the filing of a new shelf registration on February 14 allows the company flexibility in capital raising, potentially appealing to investors looking for strategic growth. In a broader market context, while major indices like the Dow and Nasdaq faced weekly declines, TXN\u2019s distinct corporate activities seemed to resonate positively with investors, perhaps contrasting with the market\u2019s generally cautious sentiment due to factors like the UnitedHealth probe and declining indexes.\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2025\n\nOver the past five years, Texas Instruments' shares have delivered a total return of 107.23%, reflecting robust overall performance. Despite recent challenges, such as reporting decreases in net income and sales in 2024, several factors have likely contributed to this longer-term performance. Notable among these is the company's ongoing commitment to returning value to shareholders through substantial share buybacks, repurchasing more than 44.58 million shares, which has supported the share price by reducing supply. Additionally, innovation in product lines, such as integrated automotive chips, has helped maintain competitive advantage and market presence.\n\nTexas Instruments has also strategically positioned itself for future growth through initiatives like the $1.6 billion investment under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to develop new wafer fabs, aligning with broader industry trends and government support. However, in the past year, TXN's returns lagged behind the US Semiconductor industry, which saw a return of 41.3%, although it did outperform the broader US Market's 20.8% return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Furthermore, the company\u2019s outlook was above the expectations and its stock has surged to all-time high levels around $240 following the earnings release.\n\nGRMN stock, with 91% returns since the beginning of 2024, has outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 28%. An uptick in profitability has boded well for its stock lately. But, if you want an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nWearables Led The 23% Revenue Growth\n\nGarmin\u2019s revenue of $1.82 billion in Q4 reflected a 23% y-o-y jump. The Fitness segment was the standout performer, posting a 31% revenue increase to $539 million, driven by robust demand for wearable devices including the newly launched Lily 2 Active GPS watch. The Outdoor segment also showed impressive growth, with sales rising 29% to $629 million, boosted by recent product launches such as the Fenix 8, Enduro 3, Approach R50, and Descent X50i.\n\nIn other segments, Aviation revenue grew 9% to $237 million, supported by new partnerships involving the G3000 avionics system. Marine sales saw a modest 5% increase to $251 million, while Auto OEM revenue jumped 30% to $166 million, benefiting from increased adoption of Garmin\u2019s Unified Cabin domain controller solution.\n\nStrong Margins Fuel 40% Earnings Growth\n\nGarmin\u2019s financial performance showed strong improvement across multiple metrics in Q4. The company\u2019s operating margin saw substantial expansion, rising 530 basis points to reach 28.3%. This margin improvement, combined with higher sales, drove a 40% year-over-year increase in earnings per share to $2.41.\n\nOptimistic 8% Revenue Growth Outlook for 2025\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, Garmin maintains an optimistic outlook, expecting to capitalize on both recent and upcoming product launches. The company\u2019s guidance projects annual revenue of $6.8 billion, representing 8% growth, and adjusted earnings per share of $7.80, up 6% from the previous year. These forecasts slightly exceed Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $6.7 billion in revenue and $7.77 in earnings per share.\n\nGRMN Stock: Can You Handle the Volatility?\n\nGRMN stock surged 13% post its Q4 results announcement. Volatility isn\u2019t new for Garmin stock. Looking at a slightly longer timeframe, the increase in GRMN stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 15% in 2021, -30% in 2022, 43% in 2023, and 63% in 2024.\n\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Verdict \u2013 Should You Pick GRMN Stock At $240?\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could GRMN face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, GRMN appears to be fully priced now.\n\nAt its current levels of near $240, GRMN stock is trading at 33x trailing earnings of $7.39 per share, around 50% higher than the stock\u2019s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last five years. Although Garmin\u2019s strong Q4 performance and favorable 2025 outlook help justify some of its recent valuation gains, the stock appears to be fully valued at current levels. Investors seeking robust long-term returns may find better entry points by waiting for a pullback.\n\nWhile GRMN stock looks like it is fairly priced, it is helpful to see how Garmin\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

            "content": "First space-grade 200V GaN FET gate driver Technology News | February 20, 2025 By Nick Flaherty\n\n\n\nTexas Instruments (TI) has launched a family of radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant half-bridge gate drivers for 200V gallium nitride (GaN) field-effect transistors (FET), including a first for the space industry.\n\nThe TPS7H6xxx family provides gate drives voltages from 22V to 200V and supports different radiation levels to improve the power efficiency of every type of space mission\n\nThe devices are available in pin-to-pin compatible ceramic and plastic packaging options and support three voltage levels. This helps engineers design satellite power systems for all types of space missions using just one chip supplier, including the first space qualified 200V gate drive in the industry.\n\nGaN FETs are increasingly popular for satellite and space designs as the ability to operate at higher frequencies allows smaller magnetics, reducing the weight and size os power systems. The higher efficiency, over 99%, also reduces the size and weight of the thermal management systems where these are critical parameters for system designers.\n\nThe gate drivers are designed to accurately drive GaN FETs with fast rise and fall times for those higher frequency designs, particularly for the power management from solar cells on the space craft. The 200V GaN FET gate driver is suitable for propulsion systems and input power conversion in solar panels while the 60V and 22V versions are intended for power distribution and conversion across the satellite.\n\nThe radiation-hardened TPS7H5001-SP (100 krad TID, 75 MeV\u22c5cm2/mg) and radiation-tolerant TPS7H5005-SEP (rad-tolerant 30 to 50 krad TID, 43 MeV\u22c5cm2/mg) controller families enable the use of a common power architecture for many of the circuits in an electrical power system across a number of different missions and diverse orbits.\n\nTI has developed reference designs use space-grade PWM controllers in various power-supply circuits across the satellite, not only in the power system but also on select payload boards.\n\nThis includes an isolated flyback design using a 100W isolated synchronous flyback topology that supports an input of 22 V to 36 V with an output of 5 V and uses GaN FETs in the power stage. This design is optimized for power-supply topologies that require only a single output.\n\nA non-isolated high-current dual-phase buck design uses the TPS7H5001-SP gate driver in a single-phase synchronous buck topology supporting an input of 11 V to 14 V with an output of 1 V and uses GaN FETs in the power stage. The design is capable of supporting 20 A and maintains tight DC and AC tolerance.\n\nA 200W non-isolated high-voltage buck design supports an input of 50 V to 150 V with an output of 28 V. This is optimised for regulating the highly variable output of 100V solar panels before the satellite passes the power to the battery storage portion of the power subsystem.\n\n\u201cSatellites perform critical missions, from providing global internet coverage to monitoring climate and shipping activity, enabling humans to better understand and navigate the world,\u201d said Javier Valle, product line manager, Space Power Products at TI. \u201cOur new portfolio enables satellites in low, medium and geosynchronous earth orbits to operate in the harsh environment of space for an extended period of time, all while maintaining high levels of power efficiency.\u201d\n\nThe GaN FET gate drivers have packaging options for the three voltage levels qualified for space designs, including Radiation-hardened; Qualified Manufacturers List (QML) Class P and QML Class V in plastic and ceramic packages. There are also Radiation-tolerant Space Enhanced Plastic (SEP) products.\n\nProduction quantities of the TPS7H6003-SP, TPS7H6013-SP, TPS7H6023-SP and TPS7H6005-SEP GaN gate drivers are available now.\n\nPreproduction quantities of the TPS7H6015-SEP and TPS7H6025-SEP are also available, with the TPS7H6005-SP, TPS7H6015-SP and TPS7H6025-SP available for purchase by June 2025.\n\nEvaluation modules for all nine devices, as well as reference designs and simulation models are also available.\n\nwww.ti.com\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : If you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : eeNews on Google News\n\nShare:",

            "content": "Texas Instruments Incorporated TXN has had a rough three months, with its stock declining 7.3% and underperforming the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry. It has also lagged behind major semiconductor players such as Micron Technology MU, Marvell Technology MRVL and Broadcom AVGO. This underperformance is largely due to weaker demand in its key industrial and automotive markets, pressure on margins and elevated capital expenditures.\n\nThree-Month Price Return Performance\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite these challenges, TXN remains one of the strongest long-term semiconductor plays, thanks to its dominance in analog and embedded processing, shareholder-friendly capital return policies and strategic investments in advanced manufacturing capacity. While near-term headwinds persist, holding the stock remains the best approach for now.\n\nTXN\u2019s Revenue Growth Faces Short-Term Challenges\n\nTexas Instruments\u2019 fourth-quarter 2024 revenues came in at $4.01 billion, which slightly beat expectations but still reflected a 1.72% year-over-year decline. The company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30 also exceeded estimates, but semiconductor demand remains weak, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, which make up 70% of total revenues.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, industrial revenues declined by a low-single-digit percentage sequentially, while automotive revenues fell by a mid-single-digit percentage. Management\u2019s guidance for the first-quarter 2025 revenues of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion suggests another 3% sequential decline, reinforcing concerns about short-term demand weakness.\n\nWhile these numbers indicate continued softness in Texas Instruments\u2019 key segments, they also reflect the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. The long-term demand for power management, factory automation and electric vehicles (EVs) remains intact, making TXN well-positioned for future recovery.\n\nTechnical Weakness Suggests Near-Term Pressure on TXN Stock\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, TXN stock is trading below its 50-day moving average, which is often seen as a bearish signal. This suggests that short-term downward pressure could continue, particularly if broader semiconductor weakness persists.\n\n50-Day Moving Average Signals Bearish Trend\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, investors should look beyond short-term technical trends. TXN\u2019s long-term fundamentals remain solid, and a rebound is likely once demand in industrial and automotive markets stabilizes.\n\nIndustrial & Automotive Segments to Fuel TXN\u2019s Future Growth\n\nDespite the current softness, Texas Instruments\u2019 focus on industrial and automotive markets remains its biggest long-term strength. These sectors require longer product lifecycles and more stable demand compared to consumer electronics, making TXN\u2019s revenue base less volatile over time.\n\nTexas Instruments sees secular growth opportunities in factory automation, robotics and energy infrastructure, all of which are becoming more reliant on high-performance analog and embedded processing chips. Meanwhile, the automotive segment \u2014 despite a mid-single-digit decline in the fourth quarter \u2014 remains a key driver of future growth, particularly as EV adoption and demand for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) accelerate.\n\nWhile current industrial and automotive demand remains weak, Texas Instruments\u2019 positioning in these markets ensures it will benefit from the next semiconductor upcycle, expected in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nCapacity Expansion to Strengthen TXN\u2019s Competitive Edge\n\nTexas Instruments is nearing the completion of its six-year capital expenditure (CapEx) cycle, which has focused on expanding low-cost 300mm wafer fabrication capacity. This investment is a strategic move to reduce long-term production costs and strengthen margins.\n\nThe company\u2019s new fabrication facilities in Texas and Utah will allow Texas Instruments to increase production at a lower cost, reducing dependence on external suppliers. While the near-term impact on margins is negative due to high CapEx spending, these investments will ultimately enhance TXN\u2019s competitive position and improve long-term profitability.\n\nAdditionally, Texas Instruments secured $1.6 billion in CHIPS Act grants to support its expansion, with total funding expected to reach $7.5 billion to $9.5 billion over the coming years. This will offset some capital expenses and further strengthen its cost advantage.\n\nStrong Shareholder Returns Make TXN a Stable Hold\n\nDespite ongoing industry headwinds, Texas Instruments remains one of the most shareholder-friendly semiconductor companies. In 2024, TXN increased its dividend by 5% for the 21st consecutive year, underscoring its commitment to returning capital to investors.\n\nTexas Instruments returned $5.7 billion to shareholders in 2024 through dividends and stock buybacks, reinforcing its reputation as a reliable income-generating stock. Additionally, TXN generated $6.32 billion in operating cash flow, providing a solid foundation to sustain its dividend and buyback programs even during industry downturns.\n\nThis focus on consistent capital returns makes TXN an attractive stock to hold, particularly for long-term dividend investors.\n\nTXN\u2019s Valuation is Becoming More Attractive\n\nTexas Instruments currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.93, slightly below the industry average of 35.54.\n\nWhile this suggests that Texas Instruments is not significantly undervalued, its stock is now cheaper relative to its historical valuation range. Investors looking for a strong semiconductor stock with long-term stability may find TXN more attractive at these levels.\n\nForward 12-Month P/E Ratio\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion: Hold TXN Stock for Now\n\nTexas Instruments\u2019 7.3% decline over the past three months reflects short-term semiconductor industry challenges, but it does not change the company\u2019s strong long-term fundamentals.\n\nWith a dominant position in analog and embedded processing, a disciplined capacity expansion strategy and a commitment to shareholder returns, TXN remains one of the best-positioned semiconductor stocks for long-term growth. However, with near-term demand still weak and CapEx spending weighing on margins, the immediate upside may be limited.\n\nFor now, investors should hold Texas Instruments stock, waiting for either a better buying opportunity or clearer signs of an industry recovery before adding more exposure. Currently, TXN carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

            "content": "Humanoid robots integrate such subsystems as servo control, battery management (BMS), sensors, AI system control and more. Size and heat dissipation requirements are challenging to meet when integrating these systems into the volume of a human shape while maintaining the smooth operation of the system.\n\nTo achieve a range of motion similar to that of humans, 40 or more servo motors and control systems can be deployed throughout the robot. Each motor requires high power density and precise control in a compact space. The motors are distributed through different parts of the robot\u2019s body, such as the neck, torso, arms, legs, toes and hands. To simulate the freedom of human hands alone requires the integration of more than a dozen motors.\n\nThe power requirements of these motors depend on the specific functions performed. For example, motors driving a robot's fingers possibly only require a few amps, while motors driving a hip or leg can require 100 amps or more.\n\nTo coordinate these motors in the robot body while maintaining the stability of the system, demands high requirements. These can be met by increasing the speed of the motor control loop and the PWM frequency. A high-resolution motor current waveform also improves the operating efficiency of the motor and reduces motor heating.\n\nFor MOSFET-based servo drivers, however, the increase in PWM switching frequency brings some losses. When the switching frequency increases from 10kHz to 20kHz, in a MOSFET-based driver the overall loss increases by 20% to 30%, which is unacceptable for humanoid robots. This shortcoming can be overcome via use of GaN (more on this shortly).\n\nBy leveraging TI\u2019s advanced gallium nitride (GaN), gate driver and precision sensing devices in your robot designs, you can increase productivity as well as enhance safety. To learn more read \u201cDesign safer, smarter and more compact humanoid robots with our system-level solutions.\u201d\n\nGaN Solutions\n\nGallium nitride (GaN) is a wide bandgap semiconductor that enables higher power density and more efficiency than traditional silicon metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). GaN processes power more efficiently than silicon-only solutions, reducing loss in power converters and minimizing the need for added cooling components.\n\nThanks to integrated drivers, GaN technology can reduce the size of the power stage by more than 50% compared to MOSFET alternatives. With its low switching losses, GaN enables high-frequency pulse-width-modulation control in the hundreds of kilohertz range. Its ability to maintain efficiency without excessive heat helps address the demands of humanoid robot systems.\n\nThe reason why GaN can achieve such low switching losses is due to the characteristics of the GaN device. GaN devices have smaller gate capacitance (Cg) and smaller output capacitance (Coss), which results in switching speeds 100 times faster than Si-MOSFET. As the turn-off and turn-on time is shortened, the dead time can be controlled within a shorter range, such as 10-20ns, while MOSFETs usually require dead time of about 1us. The reduction of dead time results in lower switching losses.\n\nOther improvements are needed to make it possible to create smaller, more flexible and energy efficient devices. Texas Instruments further reduces footprint area by integrating the FET and gate driver. This allows for a 4.4m\u2126 half-bridge + gate driver in a package of just 4.5 \u00d7 5.5mm. Integrating the GaN FET and driver in the same package also reduces parasitic inductances and optimizes switching performance.\n\nThe article \u201cApplication of GaN FET in Humanoid Robots\u201d explains the various advantages of GaN technology in motor drives and shows how GaN can help solve the challenges faced by servo systems in humanoid robots.\n\nRadar Sensing\n\nLong-range capabilities, high motion sensitivity and privacy features make radar-based sensor integrated circuits (IC) a popular technology for position and proximity sensing designs. 60-GHz and 77-GHz radar sensors are replacing 24-GHz radar sensors, delivering higher resolution, improved accuracy and a smaller form factor. The 60-GHz and 77-GHz radar bands enable new applications such as object presence detection in industrial robotics and mobile robotics applications found in factories or homes.\n\nA critical aspect of humanoid robots is the ability to detect and decipher a physical environment. The application brief \u201cmmWave Radar Sensing and Sensor Fusion in Humanoid Robots\u201d explores the benefits of millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensors for navigation, identification, and integrating radar with camera sensors to enable sensor fusion in humanoid robots.\n\nSummary\n\nTI\u2019s integrated circuits and reference designs help you create compact, efficient and fully protected systems for humanoid robots. Our analog and embedded processors enable improved motor-control performance and exceed IEC isolation and electromagnetic compatibility requirements.\n\nBy leveraging TI\u2019s advanced gallium nitride (GaN), gate driver and precision sensing devices in your robot designs, you can increase productivity, enhance safety, and meet your cost and performance requirements.\n\nSponsored Resources",

            "content": "Semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology, powering everything from smartphones and laptops to automobiles and advanced medical equipment. Recognizing their strategic importance, India has intensified efforts to establish a robust semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem. With increasing global demand, supply chain disruptions, and a growing dependence on imports, India is positioning itself as a key player in the semiconductor industry.\n\nWhy Semiconductors Matter for India\n\nIndia is one of the world\u2019s largest consumers of semiconductors, but it currently imports nearly 100% of its supply. The global semiconductor shortage, triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, exposed India\u2019s vulnerability in this critical sector. Establishing domestic manufacturing will reduce dependency on foreign suppliers, strengthen national security, and create jobs while boosting the country\u2019s technological self-reliance.\n\nGovernment Initiatives to Boost Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTo accelerate semiconductor production, the Indian government launched the Semicon India Program in 2021 with a budget of \u20b976,000 crore ($10 billion). This initiative aims to support chip fabrication (fabs), display manufacturing, and design innovation. Several key incentives have been introduced:\n\n1. Production-linked Incentive (Pli) Scheme\n\nUnder the PLI scheme, companies investing in semiconductor manufacturing receive financial support, tax benefits, and other incentives to make India a competitive hub for chip production.\n\n2. Strategic Partnerships with Global Players\n\nIndia has been engaging with global semiconductor giants such as Intel, TSMC, and Foxconn to establish local production units. In 2023, Vedanta and Foxconn announced a $19.5 billion joint venture to set up a semiconductor plant in Gujarat, marking a significant milestone.\n\n3. Focus on Design and R&D\n\nIndia already has a strong semiconductor design industry, with companies like Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, and AMD having R&D centers in the country. The government is now encouraging startups and domestic firms to develop indigenous chip designs through initiatives like the Design-Linked Incentive (DLI) Scheme.\n\n4. Skill Development and Workforce Training\n\nBuilding a semiconductor industry requires a highly skilled workforce. Programs like the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) are collaborating with universities to train engineers and technicians in chip design and fabrication.\n\nChallenges in India\u2019s Semiconductor Ambitions\n\nDespite strong government support, several challenges remain:\n\nHigh Capital Investment: Setting up semiconductor fabrication plants requires billions of dollars and advanced technology, making it a capital-intensive industry.\n\nInfrastructure and Supply Chain Gaps: Semiconductor fabs need uninterrupted power, ultra-pure water, and a stable logistics network, which India is still developing.\n\nGlobal Competition: Countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and China already dominate the semiconductor industry. Competing with these well-established players will take time.\n\nTechnology Transfer and Expertise: India lacks deep expertise in chip fabrication, which requires close partnerships with global leaders to transfer knowledge and technology.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nDespite the challenges, Indias push for semiconductor manufacturing is gaining momentum. With government incentives, global partnerships, and investments in R&D, the country is laying the foundation for a thriving semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nOver the next decade, India could become a key player in semiconductor manufacturing, reducing its dependence on imports and strengthening its position in the global technology supply chain. If successful, this initiative will not only boost the economy but also reinforce India\u2019s role as a global tech powerhouse. India\u2019s semiconductor ambitions are also fueling a rise in semiconductor-focused startups. Companies like Saankhya Labs and Signalchip are developing indigenous chipsets, reducing reliance on foreign technology. The government is encouraging such innovation through funding schemes and incubation programs.\n\nAdditionally, India is exploring emerging technologies like compound semiconductors and gallium nitride (GaN) chips, which have applications in defense, electric vehicles, and 5G networks. Strengthening collaborations between academia, industry, and government will be crucial in fostering innovation. If India continues on this trajectory, it has the potential to become a global hub for next-generation semiconductor technology.",

            "content": "- 4K-compatible model of ultra-short-throw projector equipped with industry's only \u201cfolded two-axial rotatable lens\u201d - Creating immersive visual space with excellent color reproduction and smooth gradation\n\n-- FUJIFILM Corporation announces the development of the \u201cFUJIFILM PROJECTOR ZUH6000\u201d (FP-ZUH6000), an ultra-short-throw projector capable of projecting 4K images and equipped with the industry's only*1 \u201cfolded two-axial rotatable lens.\u201d The FP-ZUH6000 is scheduled for release in the summer of 2025.\n\nThe FP-ZUH6000 is capable of projecting high-definition 4K images thanks to the latest DLP\u00ae*2 chip installed in the image processing unit. Furthermore, by enhancing Fujifilm\u2019s unique optical engine, the FP-ZUH6000 achieves color reproduction that is approximately 1.5 times better than that of the current model*3, as well as smoother gradation expression. Additionally, the unique \u201cfolded two-axial rotatable lens\u201d enables multi-directional image projection simply by rotating the lens, making it possible to project large screen images from very short distances. This flexibility makes it ideal for creating immersive spaces regardless of the installation environment.\n\nFujifilm will be showcasing the FP-ZUH6000 as a reference exhibit at the \u201cIntegrated Systems Europe 2025\u201d media event, to be held in Barcelona, Spain, from February 4 to 7, 2025.\n\nFP-ZUH6000 in black\n\nFP-ZUH6000 in white\n\nThese days, projectors are being used more and more for spatial design in commercial facilities, art galleries, museums, and other venues. In particular, there is a rapidly growing need to create immersive spaces by arranging multiple projectors in a single space and combining them to project 360-degree images. In spatial design using multiple projectors, there is a need for higher image quality in the projected images as well as for greater efficiency in image adjustment.\n\nIn 2019, Fujifilm launched the Z Series projectors, which were the world's first to feature a \u201cfolded two-axial rotatable lens\u201d. Since then, Fujifilm has expanded its lineup with the launch of the FUJIFILM PROJECTOR Z8000, which has a high luminance of 8000lm, in 2021, and the FUJIFILM PROJECTOR Z6000, which has a high luminance of 6000lm, in 2022. The Z Series has been highly praised by customers for its exceptional installation flexibility and its impressive range of spatial effects. It has the capability to project images in multiple directions and from very close distances, enabling the creation of large, immersive visuals in various locations.\n\nThe FP-Z5000 is used at the immersive natural space \u201cUralaa Park Urahoro\u201d in Japan\n\nThe newly developed FP-ZUH6000 is the first projector in the Z Series to support 4K high-definition projection, and it is a projector that effectively creates immersive spaces with its excellent color reproduction and smooth gradation expression. In addition to providing vivid images with a brightness of 6000lm using the latest laser light source technology, it has also been designed to be lightweight (approx. 17.5kg) and compact (486mm wide, 496mm deep, 175mm high). It also comes with a lens shift function that offers the highest level of performance in its class*4, with 82% vertical and 35% horizontal shift. This allows the position of the projected image to be moved over a wide area without changing the position of the projector itself or the direction of the lens, contributing to more efficient image adjustment work.\n\nFujifilm will continue to respond to diverse needs and expand the possibilities of spatial production through the development and provision of projectors that offer high installation flexibility, making the most of its unique optical technology.\n\n*1 In the projector industry. As of February 3, 2025. Based on our research.\n\n*2 DLP is a registered trademark of Texas Instruments.\n\n*3 Compared with our projector, the FUJIFILM PROJECTOR Z6000.\n\n*4 As an ultra-short-throw projector (TR value of 0.4 or less) that is equipped with a laser light source and can project 4K-equivalent images with a brightness of 6000lm or more. As of February 3, 2025. According to our research. The TR (Throw Ratio) value is calculated by dividing the projection distance by the screen width. The smaller the TR value, the closer the projector can be placed to the screen to project a larger image.\n\n1. Names of the developed product and color variations\n\n2. Main features of FP-ZUH6000\n\n(1) Capable of projecting high-definition 4K images with excellent color reproduction\n\nFor the first time in the Z Series, this projector is compatible with high-definition 4K (screen resolution 3840 x 2160) image projection.\n\nBy evolving Fujifilm\u2019s unique optical engine, the FP-ZUH6000 achieves excellent color reproduction and smooth gradation expression.

            "content": "Goertek Inc.'s ( ) price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 1x might make it look like a strong buy right now compared to the Electronic industry in China, where around half of the companies have P/S ratios above 4.4x and even P/S above 9x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Does Goertek's Recent Performance Look Like?\n\nGoertek hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining revenue compares poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth in their revenues on average. It seems that many are expecting the poor revenue performance to persist, which has repressed the P/S ratio. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price.\n\nHow Is Goertek's Revenue Growth Trending?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nIn order to justify its P/S ratio, Goertek would need to produce anemic growth that's substantially trailing the industry.\n\nIn reviewing the last year of financials, we were disheartened to see the company's revenues fell to the tune of 10.0%. This has soured the latest three-year period, which nevertheless managed to deliver a decent 24% overall rise in revenue. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing revenue over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 13% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 17% per annum, which is noticeably more attractive.\n\nWith this information, we can see why Goertek is trading at a P/S lower than the industry. It seems most investors are expecting to see limited future growth and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Goertek's P/S\n\nWhile the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations.\n\nAs we suspected, our examination of Goertek's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior revenue outlook is contributing to its low P/S. Shareholders' pessimism on the revenue prospects for the company seems to be the main contributor to the depressed P/S. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.\n\nBefore you take the next step, you should know about the that we have uncovered.\n\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

            "content": "More than protective tariffs, the U.S. needs a comprehensive industrial strategy that addresses the entire supply chain, writes Wharton\u2019s John Paul MacDuffie.\n\nThe following article was written by John Paul MacDuffie, Wharton management professor and director of the School\u2019s Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation.\n\nAs the U.S. imposes 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and Europe follows with its own barriers, we risk missing the bigger picture. China\u2019s automotive strategy extends far beyond EVs \u2014 in Mexico, Chinese manufacturers now account for 20% of new vehicle sales.\n\nThe U.S. needs more than protective tariffs. We need a comprehensive industrial strategy that addresses the entire supply chain. This means investing in processing and manufacturing capabilities, not just R&D. It means maintaining consistent policy support for emerging technologies rather than reversing course with each administration. And it means recognizing that in today\u2019s automotive industry, intellectual property and manufacturing expertise are inextricably linked.\n\nConsider the irony: The lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology that China\u2019s CATL has turned into a global competitive advantage was originally developed in the U.S. While we excel at innovation, we lack the patience and industrial strategy framework to develop these innovations into market-ready products. This pattern keeps repeating: American innovation, followed by overseas commercialization.\n\nIt\u2019s a pattern that has become painfully familiar. The U.S. pioneered not just LFP batteries but also lithium-ion technology itself at Texas Instruments and key elements of battery management systems at national laboratories. Yet today, China controls more than 75% of global battery production capacity and an even larger share of processing for critical materials. The story of American innovation lost to foreign commercialization extends to flat-panel displays, drones, and solar panels. Each time, we master the science but fumble the transition to manufacturing scale.\n\nA crucial and missing link, for EV batteries and beyond, is the processing and refining of critical minerals. Even if we secure supplies from friendly nations (an increasingly complex calculation in today\u2019s geopolitical environment), China dominates the crucial middle step of processing these materials. The Inflation Reduction Act made a promising start in addressing these supply chain vulnerabilities, but current congressional moves to roll back its provisions, coupled with potential emissions regulation reversals, risk putting us even further behind.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese manufacturers are executing a sophisticated regional manufacturing strategy. They are establishing production bases in Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico, and Eastern Europe, often in partnership with local firms. This means that attempting to block Chinese EVs through targeted tariffs is like playing whack-a-mole \u2014 we\u2019d need to impose barriers on virtually every manufacturing location to keep Chinese competitors at bay.\n\nA more nuanced approach could involve domestic content requirements, where tariff reductions are tied to the use of U.S.-made components up to certain value thresholds. This policy could be particularly effective for SUVs and pickup trucks manufactured in Mexico or Japan or elsewhere, which already face a 25% tariff. But even this strategy would require careful crafting to ensure meaningful integration with U.S. supply chains rather than token compliance.\n\nChina\u2019s regional manufacturing strategy is already bearing fruit. BYD\u2019s $1 billion investment in a Turkish factory gives it tariff-free access to the EU market, while its Hungarian plant leverages Eastern Europe\u2019s existing automotive supply chains. Similar patterns are emerging in Southeast Asia, where Chinese manufacturers are moving into facilities once operated by Japanese firms.\n\nIn Mexico, Chinese presence is growing through multiple channels: BYD\u2019s successful battery electric and hybrid vehicle sales, U.S. brands selling Chinese-made ICE vehicles, and a complex web of component supply that flows both directly from Chinese-owned plants (locally and globally) and through assembled vehicles. Indeed, half of the vehicles made in China and sold in Mexico were made by GM in their Chinese plants.\n\nRemember Japan\n\nThe Japanese auto industry\u2019s expansion in the 1980s offers an instructive but imperfect parallel. When faced with U.S. import restrictions, Japanese manufacturers built factories in America, creating jobs and transforming our automotive landscape \u2014 a pattern they continue today.\n\nChina presents unique challenges: Beyond its sophisticated regional manufacturing networks, concerns arise from state subsidies, military connections, and labor practices. Even if Chinese manufacturers invest in U.S. production with strong domestic content and fair labor standards (as some have, like Nexteer), national security considerations \u2014 particularly military ties \u2014 distinguish this situation from Japan\u2019s integration into the U.S. market.\n\nMore is at stake than economics. The global transition to electric vehicles represents a crucial step in retaining a domestic auto industry (which we need for national security reasons) and addressing climate change. China has made this transition a national priority, combining industrial strategy, infrastructure development, and market incentives. Their success is not only because of lower costs; it reflects a systematic approach to building industrial capabilities.\n\nThe reality is stark: Without a coordinated national strategy that combines R&D support, manufacturing policy, and supply chain development, the U.S. risks becoming a bystander in the greatest transformation of the auto industry since Henry Ford\u2019s assembly line. Carefully crafted tariffs could help build U.S. capabilities \u2014 as the Biden administration attempted by combining tariff protections with emissions regulations to accelerate domestic investments.\n\nSuch policies need dynamic adjustment: Subsidies and tariffs can be gradually reduced as market share grows and competition increases, but only after U.S. companies have had time to catch up to advantages built on China\u2019s massive government support, loan guarantees, and labor cost advantages from weak unions and concerning labor practices. While Congress debates rollbacks and restrictions, China is laying the groundwork for decades of industrial dominance. We should not just be protecting markets \u2014 we should be building them.\n\nAs one Chinese executive recently told me, \u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether to go global, but how to do it sustainably and successfully.\u201d It\u2019s a question American policymakers would do well to consider \u2014 while also examining how their actions might put U.S. automakers into a U.S.-shaped box that could tip them into a difficult-to-reverse decline.",

            "content": "On February 14, 2025, Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial), a leader in the semiconductor industry, filed its 10-K report, revealing a financial performance that reflects the company's robust market position. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, and operations in over 30 countries, TXN generated a revenue of $15.64 billion in 2024, primarily from its Analog and Embedded Processing segments. The company's commitment to maximizing long-term free cash flow per share growth is evident in its strategic focus on analog and embedded processing products, disciplined capital allocation, and continuous pursuit of operational efficiencies. As we dissect the 10-K filing, we will explore TXN's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape its competitive landscape and future prospects.\n\nStrengths\n\nManufacturing and Technology Leadership: Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial) has established a formidable competitive advantage through its in-house manufacturing capabilities and technology leadership. The company's strategic decision to invest in advanced 300mm wafer fabrication facilities, such as RFAB2 and LFAB1, has resulted in approximately 40% lower costs for unpackaged chips compared to those built on 200mm wafers. This cost advantage, coupled with greater control over the supply chain, positions TXN to offer geopolitically dependable capacity to its customers. Furthermore, the ongoing investments in new facilities, including SM1 and SM2 in Sherman, Texas, and LFAB2 in Lehi, Utah, underscore TXN's commitment to strengthening its manufacturing prowess and supporting long-term growth.\n\nBroad Product Portfolio and Market Reach: With a diverse product portfolio of over 80,000 items, TXN's Analog segment alone generated $12.16 billion in revenue in 2024, accounting for approximately 78% of the company's total revenue. The broad range of products, including power management and signal chain devices, caters to a variety of markets, particularly industrial, automotive, and personal electronics. TXN's extensive market channels and customer relationships further enhance its ability to reach a wide audience and participate in numerous design projects, leading to increased sales opportunities.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Global Operations: Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial)'s global footprint, while a strength in terms of market reach, also exposes the company to risks associated with international political, social, and economic conditions. With about 60% of revenue coming from customers outside the United States and significant revenue from China, TXN is vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, trade barriers, and other disruptions that could impact its ability to deliver products and support customers. The fluctuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies also poses a risk to the company's financial performance.\n\nIntense Competition: The semiconductor industry is characterized by fierce competition, with both large and emerging players, particularly from Asia. TXN faces pricing pressures and the need for rapid product development to stay ahead. The rise of China's domestic semiconductor industry and the potential for trade tensions could limit TXN's market access and competitiveness. Additionally, consolidation among competitors could lead to stronger rivals with enhanced capabilities.\n\nOpportunities\n\nGrowth in Industrial and Automotive Markets: The ongoing digitization of electronics continues to drive demand for analog chips, particularly in the industrial and automotive sectors. Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial) is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend with its extensive product offerings in power management and signal processing. The company's investments in manufacturing capacity are aligned with the expected long-term growth in these markets, providing an opportunity to increase revenue and market share.\n\nDirect Customer Relationships: TXN's strategy to build direct relationships with customers through investments in order fulfillment services, inventory programs, and e-commerce capabilities enhances its market channel advantage. By gaining deeper insights into customer needs and participating in more design projects, TXN has the opportunity to sell more products and strengthen its customer base, leading to potential revenue growth.\n\nThreats\n\nGlobal Supply Chain Risks: Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial)'s reliance on a global supply chain for raw materials, parts, and supplies introduces risks related to potential shortages, supplier performance, and geopolitical disruptions. While the company sources the majority of its wafer fabrication and assembly/test internally, any disruptions with external suppliers could impact production and lead times, affecting TXN's ability to meet customer demand and maintain its competitive lead times.\n\nCybersecurity Vulnerabilities: As a technology company, TXN is susceptible to cybersecurity threats that could compromise its information technology networks, disrupt manufacturing operations, and result in data breaches. Such incidents could lead to significant remediation costs, damage the company's reputation, and potentially result in lost business opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial) exhibits a strong competitive position with its manufacturing and technology leadership, broad product portfolio, and extensive market reach. However, the company must navigate the complexities of global operations, intense competition, and supply chain risks. Opportunities for growth in key markets and the potential to strengthen customer relationships present promising avenues for TXN to expand its influence. As TXN continues to invest in its competitive advantages and adapt to the dynamic semiconductor landscape, its strategic focus on long-term free cash flow per share growth remains central to its value proposition for shareholders.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

            "content": "Acconeer AB (publ) ( ) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Acconeer AB (publ) develops radar sensing solutions worldwide. The kr329m market-cap company announced a latest loss of kr31m on 31 December 2024 for its most recent financial year result. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Acconeer will turn a profit, with the big question being \u201cwhen will the company breakeven?\u201d Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts\u2019 expectations for the company.\n\nAcconeer is bordering on breakeven, according to some Swedish Electronic analysts. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2026, before turning a profit of kr54m in 2027. The company is therefore projected to breakeven around 2 years from today. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 94% is expected, which is extremely buoyant. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.\n\nGiven this is a high-level overview, we won\u2019t go into details of Acconeer's upcoming projects, but, take into account that by and large a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.\n\nBefore we wrap up, there\u2019s one aspect worth mentioning. Acconeer currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making growth company, which typically has high debt relative to its equity. This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext Steps:\n\nThere are key fundamentals of Acconeer which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

            "content": "Sensirion Holding AG ( ) shareholders would be excited to see that the share price has had a great month, posting a 26% gain and recovering from prior weakness. But the gains over the last month weren't enough to make shareholders whole, as the share price is still down 5.8% in the last twelve months.\n\nFollowing the firm bounce in price, given around half the companies in Switzerland's Electronic industry have price-to-sales ratios (or \"P/S\") below 1.1x, you may consider Sensirion Holding as a stock to avoid entirely with its 4.3x P/S ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/S at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Has Sensirion Holding Performed Recently?\n\nRecent times haven't been great for Sensirion Holding as its revenue has been falling quicker than most other companies. Perhaps the market is predicting a change in fortunes for the company and is expecting them to blow past the rest of the industry, elevating the P/S ratio. However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.\n\nIs There Enough Revenue Growth Forecasted For Sensirion Holding?\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think Sensirion Holding's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .\n\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as steep as Sensirion Holding's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the industry decidedly.\n\nTaking a look back first, the company's revenue growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 15%. As a result, revenue from three years ago have also fallen 16% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing revenue over that time.\n\nLooking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 17% per year during the coming three years according to the six analysts following the company. With the industry only predicted to deliver 14% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger revenue result.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Sensirion Holding's P/S sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Sensirion Holding's P/S\n\nShares in Sensirion Holding have seen a strong upwards swing lately, which has really helped boost its P/S figure. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\n\nOur look into Sensirion Holding shows that its P/S ratio remains high on the merit of its strong future revenues. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/S as they are quite confident future revenues aren't under threat. Unless the analysts have really missed the mark, these strong revenue forecasts should keep the share price buoyant.\n\nAnd what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nOf course, profitable companies with a history of great earnings growth are generally safer bets.

            "content": "On February 14, 2025, Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial), a leader in the semiconductor industry, filed its 10-K report, revealing a financial performance that reflects the company's robust market position. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, and operations in over 30 countries, TXN generated a revenue of $15.64 billion in 2024, primarily from its Analog and Embedded Processing segments. The company's commitment to maximizing long-term free cash flow per share growth is evident in its strategic focus on analog and embedded processing products, disciplined capital allocation, and continuous pursuit of operational efficiencies. As we dissect the 10-K filing, we will explore TXN's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape its competitive landscape and future prospects.\n\nStrengths\n\nManufacturing and Technology Leadership: Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial) has established a formidable competitive advantage through its in-house manufacturing capabilities and technology leadership. The company's strategic decision to invest in advanced 300mm wafer fabrication facilities, such as RFAB2 and LFAB1, has resulted in approximately 40% lower costs for unpackaged chips compared to those built on 200mm wafers. This cost advantage, coupled with greater control over the supply chain, positions TXN to offer geopolitically dependable capacity to its customers. Furthermore, the ongoing investments in new facilities, including SM1 and SM2 in Sherman, Texas, and LFAB2 in Lehi, Utah, underscore TXN's commitment to strengthening its manufacturing prowess and supporting long-term growth.\n\nBroad Product Portfolio and Market Reach: With a diverse product portfolio of over 80,000 items, TXN's Analog segment alone generated $12.16 billion in revenue in 2024, accounting for approximately 78% of the company's total revenue. The broad range of products, including power management and signal chain devices, caters to a variety of markets, particularly industrial, automotive, and personal electronics. TXN's extensive market channels and customer relationships further enhance its ability to reach a wide audience and participate in numerous design projects, leading to increased sales opportunities.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Global Operations: Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial)'s global footprint, while a strength in terms of market reach, also exposes the company to risks associated with international political, social, and economic conditions. With about 60% of revenue coming from customers outside the United States and significant revenue from China, TXN is vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, trade barriers, and other disruptions that could impact its ability to deliver products and support customers. The fluctuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies also poses a risk to the company's financial performance.\n\nIntense Competition: The semiconductor industry is characterized by fierce competition, with both large and emerging players, particularly from Asia. TXN faces pricing pressures and the need for rapid product development to stay ahead. The rise of China's domestic semiconductor industry and the potential for trade tensions could limit TXN's market access and competitiveness. Additionally, consolidation among competitors could lead to stronger rivals with enhanced capabilities.\n\nOpportunities\n\nGrowth in Industrial and Automotive Markets: The ongoing digitization of electronics continues to drive demand for analog chips, particularly in the industrial and automotive sectors. Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial) is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend with its extensive product offerings in power management and signal processing. The company's investments in manufacturing capacity are aligned with the expected long-term growth in these markets, providing an opportunity to increase revenue and market share.\n\nDirect Customer Relationships: TXN's strategy to build direct relationships with customers through investments in order fulfillment services, inventory programs, and e-commerce capabilities enhances its market channel advantage. By gaining deeper insights into customer needs and participating in more design projects, TXN has the opportunity to sell more products and strengthen its customer base, leading to potential revenue growth.\n\nThreats\n\nGlobal Supply Chain Risks: Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial)'s reliance on a global supply chain for raw materials, parts, and supplies introduces risks related to potential shortages, supplier performance, and geopolitical disruptions. While the company sources the majority of its wafer fabrication and assembly/test internally, any disruptions with external suppliers could impact production and lead times, affecting TXN's ability to meet customer demand and maintain its competitive lead times.\n\nCybersecurity Vulnerabilities: As a technology company, TXN is susceptible to cybersecurity threats that could compromise its information technology networks, disrupt manufacturing operations, and result in data breaches. Such incidents could lead to significant remediation costs, damage the company's reputation, and potentially result in lost business opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, Texas Instruments Inc (TXN, Financial) exhibits a strong competitive position with its manufacturing and technology leadership, broad product portfolio, and extensive market reach. However, the company must navigate the complexities of global operations, intense competition, and supply chain risks. Opportunities for growth in key markets and the potential to strengthen customer relationships present promising avenues for TXN to expand its influence. As TXN continues to invest in its competitive advantages and adapt to the dynamic semiconductor landscape, its strategic focus on long-term free cash flow per share growth remains central to its value proposition for shareholders.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

            "content": "Texas Instruments Inc. (TI), a leading semiconductor company specializing in analog and embedded processing products, has released its annual Form 10-K report. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces in the highly competitive semiconductor market.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nTexas Instruments reported a revenue of $15,641 million, a decrease of 10.7% from the previous year, primarily due to lower revenue from its Analog and Embedded Processing segments. The company's gross profit stood at $9,094 million, down 17.5%, mainly due to lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansions.\n\nOperating profit was $5,465 million, representing 34.9% of revenue, compared to $7,331 million, or 41.8% of revenue in the previous year. Net income for the year was $4,799 million, down from $6,510 million in the previous year, reflecting a decrease due to lower income before income taxes. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $5.20, compared to $7.07 in the previous year, indicating a decline in earnings per share.\n\nBusiness Highlights\n\nThe company's Analog segment generated $12.16 billion in revenue, accounting for approximately 78% of total revenue. The Embedded Processing segment contributed $2.53 billion, representing about 16% of total revenue. The Other segment, which includes DLP\u00ae products, calculators, and custom ASIC products, generated $947 million.\n\nGeographically, the United States was the largest market, contributing 38% of total revenue. China followed with 19%, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa accounted for 22%. Japan and the rest of Asia contributed 8% and 11%, respectively.\n\nTexas Instruments sells its products to over 100,000 customers, with about 80% of revenue derived from direct sales channels, including TI.com. The company is ramping up production in its 300mm wafer fabrication facilities, including RFAB2 in Richardson, Texas, and LFAB1 in Lehi, Utah. Construction continues on SM2 in Sherman, Texas, and LFAB2 in Lehi, Utah, to support future growth.\n\nLooking ahead, the company plans to continue investing in manufacturing and technology to strengthen its competitive advantage and support long-term growth. It expects to receive between $7.5 billion to $9.5 billion through 2034 from the CHIPS Act, which includes investment tax credits and direct funding for its wafer fabs.\n\nStrategic Initiatives\n\nTexas Instruments is focused on maximizing long-term free cash flow per share growth through a business model centered on analog and embedded processing products. This includes leveraging four sustainable competitive advantages: a strong manufacturing foundation, a broad product portfolio, extensive market channels, and product diversity. The company is also investing in long-term capacity planning, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing, supported by the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nIn 2024, the company returned $5.72 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It issued $3.00 billion in senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes and retired $600 million of maturing debt. The company also increased its dividend rate, paying $4.80 billion in dividends, and repurchased 4.7 million shares for $929 million. The company maintains a $1 billion revolving credit facility, which was undrawn as of December 31, 2024.\n\nLooking forward, Texas Instruments expects capital expenditures to remain elevated as it continues to invest in manufacturing and technology to strengthen its competitive advantages. It anticipates receiving between $7.5 billion to $9.5 billion through 2034 from the CHIPS Act, including direct funding for its wafer fabs under construction. The company plans to continue its disciplined capital allocation strategy, focusing on investments that enhance long-term shareholder value.\n\nChallenges and Risks\n\nTexas Instruments operates in a highly competitive semiconductor market, facing significant global competition from both large and small companies, including emerging companies in Asia. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, characterized by periods of tight supply and surplus inventory, poses a challenge. The company is also investing heavily in manufacturing technologies and capacity, which could impact financial performance if expected returns are not realized.\n\nGeopolitical tensions could affect global trade and macroeconomic conditions, potentially impacting operations and financial results. The semiconductor industry faces intense technological and pricing competition, with potential restrictions in the China market due to trade tensions. Changes in demand for products, cybersecurity threats, and supply chain disruptions are significant risks. The company also faces regulatory risks related to complex international laws and increased scrutiny on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters.\n\nTexas Instruments experienced a decrease in revenue and gross profit due to lower demand and higher manufacturing costs. The focus on analog and embedded processing products is strategic, but the company must manage capital expenditures and maintain efficiency to maximize free cash flow. The CHIPS Act provides some financial relief, but the company must navigate the challenges of maintaining competitive advantages and managing capital allocation.\n\nThe company is exposed to foreign exchange risk, with potential impacts on the effective tax rate due to exchange rate fluctuations. Interest rate changes could affect the fair value of investments and debt, although the cash flows associated with long-term debt are not impacted due to fixed interest rates.\n\nSEC Filing: TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC [ TXN ] - 10-K - Feb. 14, 2025",

            "content": "Semiconductor chip \u00a9Unsplash\n\n(The Center Square) \u2013 Another multi-million-dollar company has received millions in taxpayer dollars from a Texas CHIPS Act grant.\n\nThrough a bill passed by the Texas legislature and signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, the Texas CHIPS Act created the Texas Semiconductor Innovation Consortium and Texas Semiconducter Innovation Fund, among other provisions, to solidify Texas as the U.S. leader in the semiconductor industry.\n\nIn June 2023, the TSIF was established, with more than $698 million appropriated to create incentives to encourage semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing in Texas.\n\nBy November 2024, the first TSIF grant of $4.12 million was awarded to Intelligent Epitaxy Technology, Inc. (IntelliEPI) to expand operations at its 30,000 square-foot wafer production facility in Allen. IntelliEPI committed $41 million in capital investment to nearly triple its annual wafer production.\n\nIntelliEPI choosing the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex as its headquarters was important, it says, because it\u2019s \u201cone of the world's foremost regions for innovation and the production of electronic components, ever since the invention of the IC at Texas Instruments in 1958.\u201d\n\nIntelliEPI is the only domestic manufacturer of epitaxy-based compound wafers in the U.S. It first incorporated its technology in Texas. The wafers are used in telecommunications, photonics, radio frequency and microwave technologies and other high-performance applications.\n\nThe grant will enhance and accelerate construction of a new annex next to IntelliEPI\u2019s existing facility, increase manufacturing capacity and conduct further advanced research and development. Doing so is \u201ccritical to accelerate the production of high-performance epitaxy wafers and implement the next-generation semiconductor device manufacturing processes,\u201d IntelliEPI says. \u201cThese efforts are expected to have broad implications for industries ranging from aerospace and defense to telecommunications and automotive, all of which rely heavily on state-of-the-art compound semiconductor wafer technologies to drive innovation and maintain competitive advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis TSIF award underscores the critical importance of our advanced compound wafer technologies, along with TSIF\u2019s strategic goals for semiconductor innovation,\u201d IntelliEPI CEO Dr. Yung-Chung Kao said. \u201cThe funding will not only expand our production facilities but also solidify the State of Texas\u2019 position as a key hub for compound wafer manufacturing, a critical need for America\u2019s national and economic security.\u201d\n\nThis week, a $2.4 million TSIF grant was awarded to Dongjin Semichem Texas, Inc. (DST) for its specialty chemicals and materials facility in Killeen. The facility will manufacture ultra-high-purity photoresist thinners, which are critical for the photolithography process in semiconductor chip fabrication. They are used to produce leading-edge chips in high-performance computing, 5G, AI, automotive, aerospace, and defense applications.\n\nThe DST facility will replace foreign sources of the thinners producing them in Texas for the first time. DST has committed $110 million in capital investment and its Killeen facility is expected to create 24 new jobs.\n\n\u201cTexas is where the chip was born and where the future of the semiconductor industry is building,\u201d Abbott said. Chip technology manufacturing expansion efforts in Texas \u201cwill further secure the U.S. semiconductor supply chain.\u201d Thanks to companies like IntelliEPI and DST, \u201cTexas will continue to be No. 1 for semiconductors as we partner with businesses and entrepreneurs to develop innovative new technologies to build a stronger, more prosperous Texas than ever before,\u201d he said.\n\nThe grant and consortium are part of the Texas CHIPS Office, created to leverage Texas\u2019 investments in the semiconductor industry, encourage semiconductor-related companies to expand in Texas, foster expertise at higher education institutions and maintain Texas as the U.S. leader in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nThe Texas CHIPS Act is separate from the federal CHIPS Act, which appropriated nearly $6.5 billion to semiconductor manufacturing in Texas, The Center Square reported.\n\nIn response to supply chain failures during the Biden administration, Abbott and major companies prioritized expanding semiconductor manufacturing in Texas.\n\nIn 2022, Texas Instruments broke ground on a new semiconductor plant in Sherman, announcing a $30 billion investment to expand its manufacturing capability long term. It was the largest private-sector economic investment in Texas history.\n\nAlso in 2022, Taiwan-based GlobalWafers Co. announced it was building a 300-millimeter silicon wafer factory in Sherman to strengthen the domestic semiconductor supply chain.\n\nIn 2023, Texas ranked first for having the best business climate and first for semiconductor production, also leading the U.S. as the top exporter of semiconductors and other electronic components for 13 years, The Center Square reported. Texas leads the U.S. in new chip manufacturing; more than 43,000 currently work in the Texas semiconductor industry.",

During this period, the industry\u2019s current turnover of $ 40 billion is expected to exceed $ 400 billion. However, to make the most of this opportunity, we need to prioritize high-quality educators, research, and practical learning in our education system. The government must encourage research activities in educational institutions that focus on finding efficient solutions to national challenges.\u201d\n\nIndia is working towards becoming a $5 trillion economy in the coming years, of which $3 trillion is expected to come from the ESDM (Electronics System Design and Manufacturing) sector. However, these opportunities are not exclusive to India -- other nations are also competing. If India wants to take the lead, we must strengthen our quality education system, he emphasized.\n\nHe opined that quality education and research are key to India's semiconductor growth.\n\nJitendra Chadda Managing Director, Global Fab Engineering Solutions pointed out that while India contributes 25 per cent to global semiconductor chip design, we lag in manufacturing. In the next 5 to 10 years, artificial intelligence (AI) will dominate every industry, leading to a surge in personalized chip design expertise, which will require investments of $15 to $20 million.\n\nThe world's largest economies are now relying on the semiconductor industry. While Taiwan and Japan are currently at the forefront of chip manufacturing, India is yet to create a fully developed ecosystem that supports semiconductor growth, he observed.\n\nHitendra Garg Vice President, NXP Semiconductors shared an example, stating, \u201cTwenty years ago, when NFC (Near Field Communication) technology was introduced, there were hardly any users for it. We had to wait nearly a decade for widespread adoption. However, today, chip designs measured in nanometers are being developed right here in Bengaluru. This highlights the power of technology.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that Karnataka\u2019s universities, colleges, and startups hold tremendous potential for the semiconductor sector.\n\nIndia, and especially Karnataka, is already a global software hub, and Bengaluru is home to extensive electronics research and development. However, the lack of market-driven applications for these innovations is a major challenge. In addition, more collaborations and partnerships must be encouraged. Without this, industrial growth will remain stagnant, he cautioned.\n\nThe session was moderated by Rangesh, a senior executive at Lam Research.\n\nSource: IANS\n\nAbout Gopi Gopi Adusumilli is a Programmer.

The equipment on the balloon was capable of taking pictures and collecting intelligence data. Some of it came from Texas Instruments. It's technology aso matched a patent from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Aerospace Information Innovation Research Institute, which is linked to China's military.\n\nSo, the Chinese were capable of spying on the U.S. from our airspace using technology made in America.\n\n\"It's a huge problem for our national security if the Chinese are actively using American technology,\" Retired Army Captain Sean Timmons said.\n\nAt the time, President Biden initially did not want the balloon to be shot down over U.S. land and said that \"it was not a serious threat.\" Chinese officials claim that the balloon was a civilian weather-research airship that accidentally drifted into U.S. airspace.\n\nTimmons said it's the prior administration who's at fault for this.\n\n\"They didn't spend enough resources on actually protecting Americans and our national interests,\" Timmons said of the Biden administration. \"That's one of the things that the Trump administration is trying to crack down on.\"\n\nThere are a few theories as to how the Chinese were able to obtain American-made technology for the balloon. Timmons said it could've been routed through an American ally.\n\n\"Some of it may be purchase acquisition through shell companies of a third-party vendor,\" he explained.\n\nThere is a more malicious and concerning possibility too.\n\n\"People within our government have been taking bribes from the Chinese government,\" Timmons said.\n\nThe spy balloon started it's flight in Alaska and was eventually shot down over the South Carolina coast Feb. 4, 2023.",

            "content": "Shareholders might have noticed that Tower Semiconductor Ltd. ( ) filed its full-year result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 9.3% to US$45.53 in the past week. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$1.4b and statutory earnings per share of US$1.85. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.\n\nAfter the latest results, the six analysts covering Tower Semiconductor are now predicting revenues of US$1.57b in 2025. If met, this would reflect a notable 9.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to reduce 2.2% to US$1.82 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$1.58b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.04 in 2025. The analysts seem to have become more bearish following the latest results. While there were no changes to revenue forecasts, there was a real cut to EPS estimates.\n\nThe consensus price target held steady at US$56.77, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Tower Semiconductor analyst has a price target of US$60.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$48.10. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that Tower Semiconductor is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions.\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the itself. The analysts are definitely expecting Tower Semiconductor's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 9.2% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 3.4% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to see revenue growth of 17% annually. It seems obvious that, while the future growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, Tower Semiconductor is expected to grow slower than the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Tower Semiconductor. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$56.77, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have forecasts for Tower Semiconductor going out to 2026, and you can\n\nThat said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n\nClick here to find out which 9 other ETFs had notable inflows \u00bb\n\nAlso see:\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

During this period, the industry\u2019s current turnover of $ 40 billion is expected to exceed $ 400 billion. However, to make the most of this opportunity, we need to prioritize high-quality educators, research, and practical learning in our education system. The government must encourage research activities in educational institutions that focus on finding efficient solutions to national challenges.\u201d\n\nIndia is working towards becoming a $5 trillion economy in the coming years, of which $3 trillion is expected to come from the ESDM (Electronics System Design and Manufacturing) sector. However, these opportunities are not exclusive to India -- other nations are also competing. If India wants to take the lead, we must strengthen our quality education system, he emphasized.\n\nHe opined that quality education and research are key to India's semiconductor growth.\n\nJitendra Chadda Managing Director, Global Fab Engineering Solutions pointed out that while India contributes 25 per cent to global semiconductor chip design, we lag in manufacturing. In the next 5 to 10 years, artificial intelligence (AI) will dominate every industry, leading to a surge in personalized chip design expertise, which will require investments of $15 to $20 million.\n\nThe world's largest economies are now relying on the semiconductor industry. While Taiwan and Japan are currently at the forefront of chip manufacturing, India is yet to create a fully developed ecosystem that supports semiconductor growth, he observed.\n\nHitendra Garg Vice President, NXP Semiconductors shared an example, stating, \u201cTwenty years ago, when NFC (Near Field Communication) technology was introduced, there were hardly any users for it. We had to wait nearly a decade for widespread adoption. However, today, chip designs measured in nanometers are being developed right here in Bengaluru. This highlights the power of technology.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that Karnataka\u2019s universities, colleges, and startups hold tremendous potential for the semiconductor sector.\n\nIndia, and especially Karnataka, is already a global software hub, and Bengaluru is home to extensive electronics research and development. However, the lack of market-driven applications for these innovations is a major challenge. In addition, more collaborations and partnerships must be encouraged. Without this, industrial growth will remain stagnant, he cautioned.\n\nThe session was moderated by Rangesh, a senior executive at Lam Research.",

It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates and an improvement in its inventory levels.\n\nIs Himax a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Himax\u2019s revenue to decline 2.9% year on year to $221.1 million, improving from the 13.2% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.10 per share.\n\nHimax Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Himax has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Himax\u2019s peers in the analog semiconductors segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Power Integrations delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 17.6%, meeting analysts\u2019 expectations, and Texas Instruments reported a revenue decline of 1.7%, topping estimates by 3.3%. Power Integrations traded down 1.7% following the results while Texas Instruments was also down 7.5%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Power Integrations\u2019s results here and Texas Instruments\u2019s results here.\n\nInvestors in the analog semiconductors segment have had fairly steady hands going into earnings, with share prices down 1.6% on average over the last month. Himax is up 36.1% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $10.87 (compared to the current share price of $9.90).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

The full details can be found in the source. The company's non-GAAP profit also topped estimates by 1.4% at $0.76 per share, yet the projected revenue for the upcoming quarter fell short of analyst predictions by 1.7%, with guidance standing at $880 million.\n\nSensata Technologies, originally a temperature sensor control maker and previously a Texas Instruments subsidiary, has carved out a niche as a prominent supplier of analog sensors in industrial and transportation fields. Chief Executive Officer Stephan von Schuckmann pointed out the company's strong finish in fiscal year 2024, citing over 40% growth in full-year free cash flow and a consistent rise in adjusted operating margin over the past four quarters.\n\nDespite the strong quarterly results, long-term projections for Sensata remain muted, with a forecasted 5.6% decline in revenue over the next 12 months. This points to potential demand challenges ahead.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "Texas Instruments (TXN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -5.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Texas Instruments falls in, has lost 1.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Texas Instruments is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share, indicating a change of -11.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.35 points to a change of +2.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.44 indicates a change of +20.5% from what Texas Instruments is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Texas Instruments is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Texas Instruments, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $17.05 billion and $18.89 billion estimates indicate +9% and +10.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nTexas Instruments reported revenues of $4.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.7%. EPS of $1.30 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.86 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.87%. The EPS surprise was +9.24%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTexas Instruments is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Texas Instruments. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nOnly $1 to See All Zacks' Buys and Sells\n\nWe're not kidding.\n\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

The balloon, which was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on February 4, 2023, contained technology from at least five US companies, including satellite communication modules and sensors, as reported by Newsweek.\n\nThe balloon, approximately 200 feet tall, carried equipment capable of surveying, taking photographs, and collecting intelligence data. It even had launchable gliders for additional reconnaissance missions. The technology matched a patent from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Aerospace Information Innovation Research Institute, linked to China's military.\n\nThe balloon included a short-burst messaging module called Iridium 9602, along with technology from Iridium, Texas Instruments, Omega Engineering, Amphenol All Sensors Corporation, and onsemi.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly central to modern warfare. Yet, as the DeepSeek surprise reveals, American dominance in AI is not guaranteed. With technology determining battlefield outcomes, how can the U.S. government keep pace on AI innovation, and how does the tech industry align with national geopolitical priorities? In \u201cThe Technological Republic\u201d Palantir CEO Alex Karp and his colleague Nicholas Zamiska observe that, in recent decades, many people in tech have seen themselves as independent from or even in conflict with the national security establishment. Karp and Zamiska assert that the United States cannot maintain its military edge unless this view changes and Silicon Valley returns to supporting U.S. defense needs. Given that Palantir\u2019s operating model depends on government contracts, this argument might be self-serving, but that doesn\u2019t make it less true.\n\nEven as the world grows increasingly virtual, physical warfare remains a fundamental determinant of geopolitical outcomes. But the nature of fighting is shifting rapidly. Karp and Zamiska warn that AI weaponry, including drone swarms and robots, presents America\u2019s \u201cgeopolitical opponents with the most compelling opportunity since the last world war to challenge our global standing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink of the relationship between J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led a team of scientists in development of the atomic bomb, and Gen. Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, which was depicted in 2023\u2019s Christopher Nolan blockbuster. It wasn\u2019t always smooth, but the two men were fundamentally aligned. In a similar way, Silicon Valley was born with substantial government support, as federal funding proved crucial to the development of microchips, which rely on the material the area is now named after. Since then, many kinds of technology have proved to be pivotal for the military. In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, for example, laser-guided bombs, invented by Texas Instruments and the Air Force in the 1960s, established U.S. air superiority and made victory possible.\n\nSince the turn of this century, however, the tech industry has steadily distanced itself from its military origins. Its reluctance to collaborate with the Defense Department stems partly from moral objections to creating warfare technology, as reflected by some tech employees\u2019 protests against links to the defense industry. The divide further deepened with Washington\u2019s scrutiny of Big Tech on content moderation and alleged political bias.\n\nAnd tech innovators have found a seemingly superior and more reliable customer base in private consumers. The scale and flexibility of consumer markets have made them more appealing than government contracts. This is also in contrast with the Pentagon\u2019s cumbersome procurement process, which is not agile enough to keep up with improvements in semiconductors and other technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, recognizing the technology gap between America\u2019s military and those of its adversaries, set out to repair the Pentagon\u2019s relationship with Silicon Valley. In 2015, he established the Defense Innovation Unit (DIUx) to help maintain U.S. technological superiority in the face of evolving global threats. (Another excellent recent book, \u201cUnit X: How the Pentagon and Silicon Valley are Transforming the Future of War,\u201d by Raj Shah and Christopher Kirchhoff, tells the group\u2019s story.) While the unit has had many successes, the gap between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon persists, and both sides need to work to close it.\n\nOn the defense side, the procurement process remains misaligned with new technologies. The Defense Department requested up to $6.7 billion \u2014 only seven-tenths of a percent of this fiscal year\u2019s total defense budget \u2014 to fund artificial intelligence and autonomous systems research. Alongside funding shortfalls, obstacles within the procurement process need to be removed to enable government contracts to keep pace with Silicon Valley inventions. Many studies have also highlighted the need for a shift in the types of battlefield innovation that should be prioritized, namely unmanned equipment and designs for more effective modular systems (which allow components to be more easily substituted).\n\nOn the tech side, Karp and Zamiska call for a new moral code \u2014 or, rather, an old one that would return the industry to its roots. They write: \u201cWhile other countries press forward, many Silicon Valley engineers remain opposed to working on software projects that may have offensive military applications. \u2026 These engineers will, without hesitation, dedicate their working lives to building algorithms that optimize the placement of ads on social media platforms.\u201d",

            "content": "The global automotive industry now faces an oversupply of semiconductor chips after a period of shortage after the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts from chip manufacturer NXP Semiconductors predict a slowing demand from the industry as a whole.\n\nMARKET SITUATION\n\nNXP Semiconductors is a Dutch company that manufactures chips and manufacturing solutions for multiple sectors including the Internet of Things (IoT), telecommunications, and automotive. In a recently published sales report, the company disclosed a 6 per cent decrease on-year in semiconductor chip consumption by the auto industry.\n\nSimilarly, electronic companies such as Geneva\u2019s STMicroelectronics and the US\u2019 Texas Instruments both reported declines in for the 4th quarter of 2024. The former announced a 28 per cent decline in in revenue for \u201cdigital integrated circuits and radio frequency products\u201d due to a lack of demand for Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and infotainment. Meanwhile, the latter saw a slight shrinkage for the auto industry as a consequence of slowing global demand.\n\nFor companies like NXP, the automotive sector is one of its biggest markets. However, despite customers worldwide making the switch from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EV), potential buyers are discouraged due to higher price tags and interest rate schemes.\n\nPOST-SHORTAGE BOOM\n\nAutomakers are currently adjusting their inventories to shifting demands and trends. The global automotive sector is still reeling from a scarcity of semiconductor chips in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The shortage lasted from 2020 to 2023, where higher demand for electronic devices was necessitated by work and study-from-home adjustments. Furthermore, global events such as the rise of cryptocurrency, natural disasters, and the impact of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine on the neon industry contributed to the imbalance of demand and supply for semiconductor chips.\n\nIn response, manufacturers attempted to compensate for the shortage by producing more chips. However, demand has since weakened significantly, leading in a global oversupply of semiconductor chips.\n\nAn expert from Infineon Technologies India recently acknowledged the downturn of demand for chips from the automotive industry. \u201cWe can see that many customers are reducing their semiconductor inventories. At the same time, forecasts for global vehicle production are slightly down,\u201d said Vinay Balkrishna Shenoy, Infineon Techonlogies India\u2019s managing director.\n\nAn executive from the Nomura Research Institute (NRI), Ashim Sharma, made the same observation. \u201cGlobally, automakers accumulated significant inventory in anticipation of sustained demand post-Covid. However, sales have tapered off over the last three to four quarters,\u201d he said. \u201cThis mismatch between production and market demand has resulted in excess stock across the supply chain.\u201d\n\nWas this article informative?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 6 months ago during his show on July 29, 2024, and examine whether he was right or wrong about those stocks.\n\nBack then, Cramer was talking about the \u201cgreat broadening\u201d which he described as the event where every stock was rallying except for the large cap stocks. He said:\n\n\u201cThis market is not experiencing a small cap rally, it\u2019s experiencing a rally in everything else but the tech titans.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that many small-cap stocks were being bought indiscriminately through index funds like the Russell 2000, the S&P Small Cap 600, and the S&P Mid Cap 400.\n\n\u201cThe big institutions don\u2019t have time to examine all these different small-cap stocks, they just buy the index itself as an entity because it\u2019s still historically cheap, even after this rally.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the essence of the broadening\u2014some real treasures and some real trash getting scooped up together. He then explained:\n\n\u201cThe treasure being companies that do better when interest rates go down like when the Fed starts cutting.\u201d\n\nUnlike the cash-rich tech giants that don\u2019t need lower interest rates, small caps benefit tremendously from falling rates. That\u2019s why investors were selling their big-tech winners from earlier in the year and cycling into cheaper small-cap stocks.\n\nJim Cramer was particularly enthusiastic about this narrative back then and said that investors should \u201ccelebrate the market\u2019s good breadth\u201d.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on July 29, 2024. We then calculated their performance from July 29th, 2024, market close to February 4th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nNote: This article covers Jim Cramer\u2019s commentary from July 29, 2024, and does not account for any changes in his opinions regarding the stocks mentioned. Therefore, the commentary should not be mistaken for his latest opinions on any of the stocks that are mentioned.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 60\n\nA caller asked Cramer whether this was a good time to restart a position in Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) and Cramer didn\u2019t hesitate to say yes.\n\nHe suggested that Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN)is in a good position for a rebound. But what really caught his attention was the presence of activist investor Elliott Partners. He explained:\n\n\u201cThey reported good numbers, and you have an activist in there\u2014Elliott Partners\u2014that can make a lot of things happen. By the way, they\u2019re in Starbucks, and I think they can make a lot of things happen there and in Southwest too.\u201d\n\nCramer also spoke about the company\u2019s strategic meeting and viewed it as a catalyst, saying:\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to have a very big meeting that\u2019s going to lay out the strategy, and the stock\u2019s going to go up well in advance of that.\u201d\n\nHowever, the stock has dropped by more than 10% since the program aired in July.\n\nOverall, TXN ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 6 months ago. While we acknowledge the potential of TXN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TXN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "insights from industry Bob Gallagher Product Line Manager Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nWhat are the key components of the EU's new methane regulations for the energy sector?\n\nThe EU methane regulation, promulgated July 2024, aims to significantly cut methane emissions in the energy sector.\n\nWithin the EU, operators must monitor, report, and verify emissions, as well as conduct regular leak detection and repair (LDAR) surveys to identify and fix methane leaks.\n\nImporters are required to disclose methane emissions associated with the energy they bring into the EU. The regulation takes a comprehensive approach by covering domestic and imported operations, ensuring a coordinated effort to reduce emissions.\n\nImage Credit: Aunging/Shutterstock.com\n\nHow does the EU regulation define and apply Types 1 and 2 LDAR (Leak Detection and Repair)?\n\nType 1 LDAR focuses on detecting larger leaks using tools capable of measuring 7000 ppm (or approximately 17 grams per hour), such as optical gas imaging (OGI) cameras. Though conducted more frequently than smaller leak inspections, these surveys are crucial for identifying and addressing major leaks that contribute significantly to emissions.\n\nType 2 LDAR is used for detecting smaller leaks with high-precision instruments, such as flame ionization detectors (FIDs), which can detect leaks as small as 500 ppm (around 1 gram per hour). Though not as regularly deployed, these tools are valued for their accuracy and are typically used when rapid responses to minor leaks are required.\n\nWhat is the role of methane in global climate change efforts?\n\nMethane is the second-largest contributor to climate change after carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Over 20 years, methane has 84 times the global warming potential of CO\u2082. Since the Industrial Revolution, methane has been responsible for approximately 25\u201330% of global temperature increases.\n\nBecause methane has a shorter atmospheric lifespan than CO\u2082, reducing methane emissions can immediately impact slowing climate change. Addressing methane emissions is a crucial step in global efforts to mitigate temperature rise and its associated environmental impacts.\n\nHow does EU regulation affect energy imports and exporting countries?\n\nThe regulation imposes stringent requirements on imported energy, making the EU the first to enforce methane emission standards for imports. Importers must submit detailed methane emission reports and adhere to monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) requirements outlined in Article 12 or the OGMP 2.0 Level 5 framework. Emissions must be tracked and reported across the entire supply chain.\n\nCompliance deadlines begin in 2027, with full contract alignment required by 2030. Exporting countries and energy suppliers will face increased scrutiny as their emission reports must be auditable and transparent. While non-compliance does not result in outright bans, severe financial penalties may be imposed.\n\nWhat are the regulatory challenges and potential limitations?\n\nA major challenge is the administrative burden placed on EU member states. Each country must establish at least one competent authority, allocate necessary funding, and enforce compliance, including penalty mechanisms. Penalties also vary by country, leading to inconsistencies in enforcement.\n\nMeeting technical requirements\u2014such as deploying advanced monitoring technologies and maintaining compliance documentation\u2014can be resource-intensive for operators. There is also some uncertainty regarding how specific provisions will be interpreted and enforced, which may cause initial confusion.\n\nAccording to EU regulations, what technologies are used for LDAR, and are there any limitations on technology selection?\n\nThe regulation does not mandate specific technologies but focuses on achieving desired outcomes, allowing operators to choose appropriate tools. Type 1 LDAR surveys typically utilize OGI cameras, which can quickly scan large areas for leaks but are highly sensitive to weather conditions and require skilled operators.\n\nType 2 LDAR employs flame ionization detectors (FIDs), known for their precision in detecting very small leaks. However, these instruments require frequent calibration and must withstand harsh industrial environments.\n\nNew technologies, such as continuous monitoring systems, are also being explored. The regulation encourages innovation while ensuring compliance with emission reduction targets by allowing flexibility in technology selection.\n\nWhat are the penalties for noncompliance, and how are they determined?\n\nPenalties vary across member states, as each government sets its own enforcement mechanisms. Common violations include improper instrument calibration, inadequate monitoring, and inaccurate emissions reporting.\n\nConsequences may include fines, operational delays, and reputational damage. To avoid penalties, companies should establish robust LDAR programs, maintain accurate documentation, and invest in well-trained personnel and reliable technology.\n\nHow do global initiatives like OGMP 2.0 supplement the EU's methane regulations?\n\nOGMP 2.0 is a framework aligned with EU regulations, promoting standardized methane emission reporting. It aims to reduce methane emissions by 75% by 2030 and encourages best practices, including source-level quantification and independent verification.\n\nBy participating in OGMP 2.0, operators meet EU compliance requirements and contribute to broader global efforts to reduce methane emissions. The initiative provides a consistent approach to methane monitoring and mitigation across industries.\n\nWhat are the key timelines that operators and importers should be aware of?\n\nOperators within the 27 EU member states must complete their first Type 2 LDAR surveys by August 2025, while existing sites must submit their LDAR programs by May 2025. New sites must comply six months after becoming operational. Importers must submit data about methane emissions by April 2027, marking their initial reporting deadline.\n\nMethane intensity reporting will be required for new contracts by 2028 and all by 2030.\n\nThese deadlines provide operators and importers with a structured compliance and implementation planning timeline.\n\nHow can operators best prepare for these regulations?\n\nOperators should begin by updating or establishing their LDAR programs to align with the new regulations. Investing in technologies such as Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) cameras and Flame ionization Detectors (FID) will be essential. Equally important is ensuring personnel are trained to use these tools effectively and maintain accurate documentation.\n\nEngaging third-party verifiers for independent audits helps identify compliance gaps. Early preparation minimizes the risk of penalties and facilitates a smooth transition to the new regulatory framework.\n\nWhat are the regulation's key benefits and long-term implications?\n\nThe regulation creates a clear framework for reducing methane emissions and driving substantial improvements in the energy sector. It promotes the adoption of advanced monitoring technologies and enhances transparency throughout the supply chain.\n\nIn the long run, these efforts contribute to stabilizing global temperatures, improving environmental sustainability, and positioning businesses as leaders in climate responsibility. While initial implementation may be complex, the long-term environmental and industry benefits outweigh the challenges.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nBob Gallagher joined Thermo Fisher Scientific as the Product Line Manager for the Industrial Hygiene Strategy at the end of 2017.

The balloon, shot down off the South Carolina coast on Feb. 4, 2023, carried a satellite communication module and sensors from at least five U.S. companies.\n\nThe discovery has raised concerns about how sensitive American components ended up in foreign hands.\n\nDownload the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Facts\u2122. Point phone camera here\n\nHow did the US respond to the balloon?\n\nBeijing claimed the balloon was a civilian weather airship that had drifted off course.\n\nHowever, U.S. officials said China designed the balloon to collect and transmit data, with a payload that included a satellite transmission module for communications.\n\nMilitary analysts said the balloon may have also carried empty storage bays, possibly designed to house launchable gliders that could gather more detailed intelligence.\n\nThe National Air and Space Intelligence Center examined the recovered components, but the full extent of the balloon\u2019s surveillance capabilities has not been disclosed.\n\nWhat technology was inside the balloon?\n\nThe analysis revealed that the balloon\u2019s technology matched a 2022 Chinese patent from researchers with military ties.\n\nAmong the components was the Iridium 9602 short-burst messaging module, made by Iridium, a U.S.-based satellite communications provider.\n\nIridium, headquartered in Virginia, stated it was unaware its technology was used in the balloon. The company said its products are commercially available, making them difficult to track.\n\nOther U.S. companies linked to the balloon include Texas Instruments, Omega Engineering, Amphenol All Sensors Corporation, Onsemi and Swiss-based STMicroelectronics.\n\nSome firms stated they complied with export laws but had no control over their products were use.\n\nWhat does this mean for US export controls?\n\nThe Biden administration identified the balloon as part of a Chinese surveillance program, with similar incidents reported in other countries. The discovery has renewed scrutiny on export regulations and whether current laws effectively prevent American technology from being used in foreign military and intelligence operations.\n\nThe U.S. government is now reviewing its export control policies to strengthen restrictions on technology with potential military applications.\n\nGet up to speed on the stories leading the day every weekday morning.

            "content": "Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has had a rough three months with its share price down 17%. But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Texas Instruments is:\n\n28% = US$4.8b \u00f7 US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.28 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Texas Instruments' Earnings Growth And 28% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Texas Instruments has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 11% which is quite remarkable. Yet, Texas Instruments has posted measly growth of 2.0% over the past five years. This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate. A few likely reasons why this could happen is that the company could have a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Texas Instruments' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 17% in the same period.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Texas Instruments''s valuation, check out , as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Texas Instruments Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nTexas Instruments has a three-year median payout ratio of 58% (implying that it keeps only 42% of its profits), meaning that it pays out most of its profits to shareholders as dividends, and as a result, the company has seen low earnings growth.\n\nAdditionally, Texas Instruments has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 70% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Texas Instruments' future ROE will rise to 36% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, it does look like Texas Instruments has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return. Investors could have benefitted from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. As discussed earlier, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

            "content": "ETtech\n\nETtech\n\nETtech\n\nThe auto industry has hit the brakes on semiconductor consumption for the first time since the pandemic, when it had gone into an overdrive after facing massive disruptions in global supply chains.A massive chip shortage has now swung all the way to the other end of the spectrum, with automakers sitting on excess semiconductor stock, industry experts said.On February 3, Eindhoven-headquartered NXP Semiconductors reported a 6% year-on-year decrease in chip consumption by the automotive industry for the December quarter. Geneva-headquartered STMicroelectronics said its revenue in the digital integrated circuits and radio frequency products segment decreased by 22.8% in its Q4 results on January 30, mainly because of a decrease in automotive Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and infotainment.US firm Microchip reported growth in the latest quarter but said the industrial and automotive sectors are two major sectors going through a big change because of too much inventory and less demand . Another US firm, Texas Instruments (TI), saw mid-single digit automotive market decline due to more pronounced weakness outside China.\u201cSemiconductors are a cyclical industry,\u201d Hitesh Garg, vice-president and India managing director, NXP Semiconductors , told ET on January 2. \u201cPost-pandemic, there was an industry boom for six or nine quarters. However, for the last three to four quarters, it has been sliding down in minus percentage. At this moment, we are in the negative cycle\u2026 India is in the same boat. India is not a big consumer of chips.\u201dHe noted that the semiconductor industry is a feeder industry, or a horizontal industry which feeds various industries, like telecom and automobile. \u201cWe are working in automotive. If the demand for the number of cars is not going up, it will impact us,\u201d Garg said.This is indicative of a global trend, which ties back to companies getting jittery after the post-pandemic chip shortage. \u201cGlobally, automakers accumulated significant inventory in anticipation of sustained demand post-Covid. However, sales have tapered off over the last three to four quarters,\u201d said Ashim Sharma, senior partner and group head \u2013 business performance improvement consulting (auto, engineering, and logistics) at Nomura Research Institute (NRI).\u201cThis mismatch between production and market demand has resulted in excess stock across the supply chain,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cIn addition, the industrial automation sector has witnessed sluggish investment activity.\u201dAccording to the latest data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), domestic automobile dispatches from manufacturers to dealers increased by 11.6% in 2024, primarily driven by the two-wheeler segment.Vinay Balkrishna Shenoy, managing director, Infineon Technologies India, said the general mood in the automotive industry has deteriorated significantly.\u201cWe can see that many customers are reducing their semiconductor inventories. At the same time, forecasts for global vehicle production are slightly down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe share of electric cars is stagnating in many regions, which is unlikely to change in the first few months of 2025.\u201dInfineon, headquartered in Munich, Germany, is one of the global leaders in automotive, power, and security semiconductors.While Infineon\u2019s automotive revenue decreased 11% from Q4 FY24 to Q1 FY25, it reduced 8% from Q1 FY24 to Q1 FY25. Sharing the market outlook for CY25, the company, in its latest investor presentation, said, \u201cCar demand is expected to remain flat. Although macroeconomic conditions are improving, headwinds remain, including dealer inventory adjustments and cautious consumer demand. Key regions Europe, Japan, South Korea, and North America are expected to decline.\u201dChandler, Arizona-headquartered Microchip Technology saw a modest 1% year-on-year revenue growth from the automotive market \u2014 from 17% to 18% in the latest quarter.\u201cIndustrial and automotive are two major sectors going through a big change because of too much inventory and less demand from the market,\u201d said Srikanth Settikere, vice-president and managing director, India Development Centre at Microchip India.\u201cCustomers are replete with inventories,\u201d Settikere said. \u201cOver the next few months or quarters, true numbers will really show. Semiconductor companies are going through a cyclic situation. The supply-demand situation that we had during Covid has reversed now.\u201dSettikere said that ever since China started manufacturing more EVs, it has impacted competition from Europe. \u201cVolkswagen has moved out of the Chinese market. These are macroeconomic changes that are bringing the auto demand down,\u201d Settikere said.According to Sharma, another reason for the slump could be a significant shift in powertrain technologies across the globe, with modern vehicles increasingly relying on smaller, more efficient semiconductor chips. \u201cThis transition with a slower-than-expected adoption of EVs in regions like the EU may have created a mismatch between production and demand for specific chip types, thereby highlighting the challenges in aligning the chip supplies,\u201d he said.As per the International Energy Agency\u2019s \u2018Global EV Outlook 2024\u2019 report, electric car sales neared 14 million in 2023.EVs are gaining momentum globally but are mainly concentrated in China, Europe, and the US, which account for nearly 95% of global sales. In 2023, China accounted for just under 60% of new electric car registrations, Europe just under 25%, and the US 10%, it said.Within the automotive industry, passenger cars generally use the highest number of chips due to the growing integration of advanced features and technologies that rely heavily on specialised chips.\u201cGlobally, the automotive semiconductor segment grew by 3% in 2024 compared to 11% in 2023,\u201d Ashok Chandak, president of India Electronics and Semiconductor Association , said. \u201cExpectations of higher growth led suppliers to stockpile inventory, leading to increased stock levels in the latter half of the year.\u201dBut there is a global slowdown in certain segments. For instance, the global light vehicle production market has been experiencing a challenge in growth for the past few quarters, said Gaurav Vangaal, associate director, LVP forecasting at S&P Global Mobility. \u201cIn India, we project a flat to negative forecast for the January-March quarter, largely due to the high base effect from the previous year,\u201d he said.While the passenger vehicle industry in India saw over 25% growth in FY23, followed by an 8% growth in FY24, there are still challenges. \u201cWith the high base set by these exceptional growth years, the industry is expected to experience a more modest growth of lower single digit for the ongoing fiscal,\u201d said Hemal Thakkar, senior practice leader and director at Crisil Intelligence.Haviv Ilan, president and chief executive officer of Dallas-headquartered Texas Instruments (TI), during the earnings call of TI\u2019s Q3 results, had said the company saw a 7-8% growth in the automotive market, and that most of the growth came from its business in China because of the momentum for EVs.\u201cNow, the rest of the automotive market is different. We are seeing a continued weakness over there. That revenue peaked in the third quarter of \u201923, and in general trended down,\u201d Ilan had said. During the earnings call of TI\u2019s Q4 results on January 23, he said, \u201cThe automotive market was down mid-single digits...\u201d\u201c...on the automotive market, similar to Q3, we did see a pretty significant weakness, maybe outside of China. So it declined about mid-single digit, about 5% sequentially...the growth in China was less pronounced and the decline outside of China was more pronounced,\u201d Ilan said.TI India did not immediately respond to ET\u2019s queries.Shenoy said China has been a bright spot. \u201cEvery second new car sold in China is an EV, and the trend is rising. In the long term, we believe that the structural growth drivers around electromobility and software-defined vehicles are fully intact,\u201d he said.As the automotive industry undergoes a technological revolution, innovations such as ADAS, software-defined vehicles (SDVs), and AI are rapidly becoming standard features. This transformation requires OEMs to reconfigure their supply chains to accommodate a significantly larger volume of electronic components and chips.However, experts suggest that during periods of economic downturns, when price sensitivity among consumers is high, the adoption of modern technologies tends to plateau.In such times, consumers prioritise affordability over advanced features, leading to slower demand for premium technologies like autonomous driving systems or other high-tech automotive solutions. Meanwhile, in India, Thakkar expects ADAS penetration to \u201cimprove significantly\u201d in 2025.\u201c2024 turned out to be one of the worst years in many decades for the industries we serve, particularly industrial and automotive. It was characterised by unexpectedly weaker demand and higher level of inventories which significantly impacted ST,\u201d Jean-Marc Chery, president and CEO of STMicroelectronics, said during the Q4 results on January 30.Revenues on a year-on-year basis showed that automotive declined by about 20%. \u201cOur revenues, compared to our expectations, were higher in personal electronics, declined less in industrial and were lower in automotive,\u201d Chery said.As per its latest quarterly results, NXP Semiconductors saw a year-on-year 7% decrease in sales of chips to industrial and IoT, and a 19% decrease in demand for chips from communications infrastructure and others.NXP has microcontrollers, sensors, and products for battery management in cars. The industry is hopeful of a recovery in demand in the coming months.\u201cThere has been some softness in the global market for automotive semiconductors, but the most recent forecast projects a broad recovery in the market for automotive chips over the next few years,\u201d John Neuffer, president and CEO of Semiconductor Industry Association , said. \u201cThis recovery would likely be driven by demand for EVs, which are bristling with semiconductors,\u201d he told ET.The market growth is projected for automotive logic chips, which are used for infotainment and other systems, as well as automotive analogue chips, which are often used in power management systems and ADAS, among other automotive applications.",

            "content": "Anker Nebula Capsule Air Pocket Projector D4112 \u2013 the world\u2019s smallest Google TV (AV review)\n\nThe Anker Nebula Capsule Air is a 720p Coke-can-sized with features and performance exceeding Pico projectors several times its size.\n\nBefore the review, I want to position DLP-based Pico portable projectors.\n\nAlmost all are similar:\n\nMost use a Texas Instruments 720p or 1080p DLP chip.\n\nMost are 100-200 ANSI Lumens, which means they work best in darkened rooms\n\nThey will project up to a 100\u201d image out to about 2-3m, but the further the projection, the less brightness.\n\nThey usually have HDMI in, USB-C, and some have Wi-Fi.\n\n2-3 hours of battery life in eco mode is all you can expect\n\nA single mono speaker for personal use\n\nThe Anker Nebula Capsule Air Pocket Projector is different. It\u2019s small and uses the Google TV (Android TV 11) operating system (with GTV remote control). It has the most streaming apps of all current TV OS, including all Australian and digital TV streaming services. Chromecast makes it even easier to cast content. It also has the Nebula Connect App for easy setup.\n\nNote: This is not the Nebula Capsule 3 Laser, 1080p, 300 ANSI Lumens, with an RRP of $1799, nor the original Capsule (discontinued).\n\nAustralian Review: Anker Nebula Capsule Air Pocket Projector Model D4112 as at 10/2/25\n\nWebsite Nebula Australia\n\nNebula USA Product page (beware, this is US$ pricing)\n\nManual Price $795 from JB- Hi-Fi (pre-order for March launch) Colours: Grey or White From JB Hi-Fi is the authorised retailer. Other sources are on the grey market and are not covered by warranty. It may be available on Nebula\u2019s Official Amazon Store.

More CyberShack projector news and reviews\n\nWe use Fail (below expectations), Pass (meets expectations) and Exceed (surpasses expectations or is the class leader) against many of the items below. We occasionally give a Pass(able) rating that is not as good as it should be and a Pass \u2018+\u2019 rating to show it is good but does not quite make it to Exceed.\n\nFirst Impressions \u2013 small Coke-can size but punches above its weight\n\nAs a segue, back in 2022, I reviewed the Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K \u2013 finally, a mini-projector that sees the light, and I was impressed \u2013 that is not easy. This was a mini 4K projector capable of media room quality.\n\nThis time, it is a minuscule 140 x 68mm round x 650g, 720p, 150 ANSI Lumens pocket projector (must have wide pockets). I am impressed because it does things I have not seen in mini-pico-projectors. For example, a Time-of-Flight camera/sensor that projects a LED beam to measure real-time distance to the screen to provide fast autofocus and automatic keystone correction. Cheaper IR sensors don\u2019t work as well. It is fully Google TV licensed, so Netflix knows what it is and can stream accordingly.\n\nIt is well made with a metal unibody and perforated 360\u00b0 sound grill. Ports include HDMI 2.1 (1080p downscale to 720p), USB-C for charging and audio/video from compatible SSD/Flash drives, smartphones and PCs. You can use an external USB-C hub for passthrough charge, keyboard/mouse and playing content.\n\nThe top has a circular capacitive touch panel for navigation, volume control, and autofocus.\n\nIt has a handy \u00bc\u201d tripod socket under and a clip-on 90\u00b0 base to attach to a wall or ceiling. A range of accessories includes an RRP $120.99/109.00 battery bank tripod that adds two more viewing hours.\n\nRemote \u2013 Pass+\n\nIt has a standard Google TV IR remote, as well as YouTube, Netflix, and Prime presets. It is good to about 5m.\n\nIt is backlit (good) and can summon Google Assistant. Read voice commands for Google TV.\n\nApp \u2013 Pass\n\nYou can set the Anker Nebula Capsule Air to display a wall clock (with several design variations), snapshot backdrops or six videos to create an atmosphere wall (such as a repeating scene of an ocean shore).\n\nThe App does not do much other than power on/off, use the back arrow and D-Pad controller, and bring up an onscreen Google keyboard.\n\nPlacement and uses\n\nWhile we would all like a 4K or 1080p projector, this provides a great 720p image from a Coke-can-sized device at 1.3-2.6m.\n\nIt is perfect for individual use and can project onto the ceiling, be wall-mounted or sit on a desktop. But remember, it needs to be in a room with less ambient light than the projector light.\n\nTI DLP technology\n\nDLP Pico technology is a micro-optical-electro-mechanical system (MOEMS) that modulates light using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD). Each micro-mirror is a pixel on the screen and is independently modulated (moved). Pico DLP is not just for projectors \u2013 table lamps, lights, picture frames, displays, and more.\n\nIt uses a Texas Instruments 640 x 320 mirror array dithered to 1280 x 720p, DLP160CP DMD (Digital Micromirror Device). It is a good match for the projector\u2019s size and heat dissipation.\n\nUnlike most DLP Pico projectors, there is no rainbow effect.\n\nRainbow (right) is endemic in DLP projectors.\n\nLight source\n\nThe light source is an RGB LED, which outputs 150 ANSI Lumens\u2014the brightness of a 50\u201d diagonal screen (which reduces as the screen gets larger). This is not a BS marketing measurement, like 900 LED lumens and 375 Light Source lumens, which are quoted with impunity by less ethical makers.\n\nLamp life is up to 30,000 hours or 20 years at 4 hours a day. Of course, this is the maximum \u2018eco\u2019 life, and 10 years is more realistic.\n\n150 ANSI lumens is meant for rooms with <150 lumens,\n\nYou can read more about lumens measurement here.\n\nHow does it look?\n\nWe tested in low office light, 200 lux (typical office light is 400 Lux), and a darkened room <20 lux on a neutral screen. Images are shown at 20 lumens unless specified. Any keystone is more due to the camera or screen irregularities.\n\nWe cannot measure colour gamut or contrast for projectors (as the measuring probes need a backlit image like a TV), so this is a subjective appraisal.\n\n200 lumens\n\nColour accuracy\n\nIt is an 8-bit/16.7 million colour with 70% of the Rec.709 sRGB colour gamut, which is the standard colour gamut for SDR TV and provides lifelike colours for projectors.\n\nThere are four preset video modes \u2013 standard, movie, conference (brighter at the expense of colour accuracy) and custom (contrast, colour saturation, sharpness, colour temperature, wall colour, and gamma).\n\nGamut: The primary colours, Red, Green, and Blue, are accurate. The 70% sRGB gamut applies to secondary colours.\n\nUniformity\n\nUniformity is 27% across the nine measurement points (3 x 3 grid), and this is reasonable given that it does not exhibit any hotspots. Uniformity is best when the projector is at right angles to the screen. Below shows it a 45\u00b0 off centre that shows a brighter left side.\n\nGradient \u2013 Pass\n\nAny 8-bit device will have colour bands, This is acceptable.\n\nBrightness \u2013 Pass for dark rooms\n\nWe have seen many DLP projectors and know how these perform \u2013 what the upsides and downsides are. Upsides \u2013 allows for lower-cost, smaller projectors. Downsides \u2013 single-chip colours are never as good as 3LCD and washed out unless you have a darker room. That is all Pico projectors, so don\u2019t let marketing hype tell you otherwise. These should not put you off but make you aware of their limitations and best use. We will highlight these in the review.\n\nAccording to Texas Instruments, minimum ANSI image brightness (at the screen \u2013 not the LED or lens)\n\nDark Room Dim Room Lit Room Bright Room Outdoors Environment All lights turned off <40 lumens Soft lighting at night <300 lumens Office Light 400-800 lumens A well-lit room with windows and indirect daylight of 1000-1600 lumens Indirect sunlight (shade) 1800+ lumens Suggested image brightness at the screen 50 nits 100 nits 200 nits 300-400 nits 600+ nits\n\nThe Anker Nebula Capsule Air can defeat darkened 200 lux rooms.\n\nContrast \u2013 Passable\n\nContrast is the ratio of white to black \u2013 how much brighter white is than black. The ratio drops steeply if you don\u2019t have pure black (more of a grey). We can\u2019t recommend it for movies and TV with dark scenes.\n\nContrast: Approx. 1000:1 but washes out in higher light. There are no deep blacks \u2013 not expected.\n\nThrow: 1.2:1\n\nScreen Size diagonal Projector to screen 50\u201d 1.33m 60\u201d 1.60m 70\u201d 1.86m 80\u201d 2.13m 90\u201d 2.39m 100\u201d 2.65m\n\nWe tested at 50 to 100\u201d, and the sweet spot is 70-80\u201d.\n\nScreen Type\n\nYou need a 16:9 projection surface, which has the same aspect ratio as a TV. The screen type also impacts image brightness, as different surfaces have different reflective characteristics.\n\nMost wall surfaces (painted walls and cotton sheets) have negative gain (one lumen in results in <1 lumen out and sucks the life out of the image), so you need a neutral (1:1) or positive gain surface. Trust us when we say the better quality screens for media rooms cost several thousand dollars.\n\nSome projectors have settings for different wall colours\u2014this is in the Custom settings. If you want the best image, you need to buy at least a neutral gain screen. You can get a tripod screen at Officeworks.\n\nAutofocus and keystone correction \u2013 Pass+\n\nThe ToF sensor is fast and highly accurate able to correct up to 45\u00b0 off angle. I won\u2019t say it is 100% accurate all the time, but a quick press of the remote focus button gets it right.\n\nI love that you can have a 45\u00b0 angle offset, and the snap on base helps position it.\n\nHardware specs\n\nMediaTek MT7332 SoC 1.45GHz quad-core\n\nARM Mali-G52 MC1 800MHzGPU with Bifrost architecture\n\n1280 x 720p @60Hz 213dpi\n\n3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, game rotation vector, gravity sensor and linear acceleration sensor\n\n2GB RAM and 16GB eMMC storage for the OS and Google TV apps\n\nWi-Fi AC 2.4/5GHz\n\nBT 5.1 Tx/Rx (can be used as a BT speaker or add a keyboard/mouse)\n\nNoise: <30dB\n\nToF LED autofocus and keystone adjustment.\n\nBattery \u2013 Pass\n\nIt has a 34W battery and a 20V/2.25A/45W charger, which also does PD 3.0 5/9/12/15V at 3W. Charge time is <3 hours, and you can use it as you charge.\n\nThe maximum power draw was 37W, but we found it was around 24W for normal use.\n\nNebula claims up to 2 hours in Eco mode. We got about 1 hour and 20 minutes in standard mode.\n\nSound \u2013 Pass\n\nIt has a 5W, 360\u00b0 omnidirectional, up-firing speaker. It can decode and downmix to mono PCM and Dolby Audio up to 5.1 channels.\n\nIt has no low or mid bass and is slowly building high bass. It is flat from 200Hz to about 5kHz, so it\u2019s more for clear voice than music. It then dips, and the mid- and high-treble are quite harsh. That is all you can expect from a micro-speaker. It is fine for personal use, but you could add a Bluetooth speaker for more fidelity.\n\nWe tested audio/video over HDMI, USB-C and Bluetooth, but the sound signature remains constant at Mid: (bass recessed, mid boosted, treble recessed) \u2013 for clear voice.\n\nMaximum volume is 80dB, but back off to 75dB to reduce distortion.\n\nCyberShack\u2019s view: Anker Nebula Capsule Air Pocket Projector D4112 is perfect for what it is \u2013 the world\u2019s smallest Google TV Pico projector\n\nWhile we all want 4K and thousands of lumens, this is what it is \u2013 a Coke-can-sized, Google TV, 720p projector that punches above its weight for a reasonable price.\n\nIf you want 1080p, then be willing to spend much more and get the $1799 Laser Nebula Capsule 3 Laser with 300 ANSI Lumens and Google TV.\n\nAnker Nebula Capsule Air Pocket Projector D4112 ratings\n\nTo maintain fairness, this is rated as a 720p DLP Pico projector, as comparisons with 1080p or 4K are irrelevant.\n\nFeatures: 85 \u2013 Google TV in a can!

            "content": "Dividend-paying stocks offer more than just regular payouts\u2014they often provide a defensive edge, making them valuable during periods when preserving wealth and maintaining steady income are priorities. A report by Eagle Asset Management examined instances where the broader market declined by at least 15% before recovering to its previous high. The study used three dividend-focused benchmarks to emphasize the importance of not only investing in dividend-yielding companies but also prioritizing those with a track record of consistently increasing payouts. The findings revealed that indexes composed of dividend-paying companies tend to outperform the broader market, particularly during prolonged downturns. This highlights the resilience and potential outperformance of dividend-focused investments during turbulent market conditions.\n\nA report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently grown at an average annual rate of just over 7%. In strong market conditions, dividends have helped enhance total returns, while in difficult years\u2014such as 2020 and 2022, when market returns were weak or negative\u2014they played a crucial role in stabilizing returns and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nDividends have historically been a key component of total returns for US stocks, contributing nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market\u2019s returns. In a low-rate environment, dividends become even more valuable by ensuring a steady income stream when fixed-income investments provide lower yields. Companies that introduce dividends rarely discontinue them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.\n\nDividend stocks faced a tough year in 2024 as investor focus largely moved toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained just over 6% in 2024, falling well behind the broader market\u2019s nearly 25% return. This lagging performance isn\u2019t uncommon for dividend stocks, which often struggle to attract interest when more high-growth opportunities dominate the market. However, experienced investors may see the long-term value and stability that dividend stocks continue to offer.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Growth Stocks With 10%+ Yearly Increases . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividends play a significant role in global equity markets, contributing approximately 34% of the MSCI World Index\u2019s annual returns since February 1, 1970. Historically, holding shares in companies committed to dividend growth has provided several advantages, including strong absolute returns and superior risk-adjusted performance across full market cycles. These investments have also demonstrated lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, offering a level of capital preservation even in challenging market environments. In addition, they provide a diversified income stream with the potential for both steady income growth and capital appreciation.\n\nWithin the dividend space, companies that regularly raise their payouts are more favored among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks with over 10% dividend growth rate.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and picked dividend companies with positive dividend growth rates in the past five years. From that group, we picked 13 stocks that have raised their dividends at an annual average rate of over 10% in the past five years and ranked them according to their dividend growth rates. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) the Best Big Tech Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nA robotic arm in the process of assembling a complex circuit board - showing the industrial scale the company operates at.\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\n5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.7%\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is an American multinational semiconductor company that specializes in analog and embedded chips. As a cyclical business, the company continues to face challenges, with industrial sectors like automation and energy still in the process of recovery. The company has been scaling back factory utilization to manage inventory amid a prolonged downturn. While near-term headwinds persist, TXN\u2019s focus on expanding its manufacturing capacity remains a significant long-term advantage. With nearly 70% of its six-year capital expenditure cycle completed, the company is establishing a scalable and cost-efficient 300-millimeter production network. This strategic positioning ensures it can effectively meet future demand. Despite ongoing market volatility, these investments reinforce TXN\u2019s competitive edge, making it a strong long-term prospect even in an uncertain economic environment.\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) demonstrated a strong cash position in FY24. Its trailing twelve-month operating cash flow came in at $6.3 billion and free cash flow for the period amounted to $1.5 billion. Moreover, the company returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends in the fourth quarter of 2024. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.36 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.02%, as of February 8. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for 21 consecutive years.\n\nThe hedge fund sentiment around Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) remained positive as hedge fund positions in the company grew to 57 in Q3 2024, from 50 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey's database. The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth nearly $3 billion in total. With over 4.2 million shares, First Eagle Investment Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall TXN ranks 13th on our list of the best dividend stocks with dividend growth rates. While we acknowledge the potential for TXN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TXN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Use this link to claim yours! You\u2019ll find KPIs, Copilot (a ChatGPT focused on finance) and the best UX:\n\nThe indices were down again this week, with the drop probably related to what took them down last week: the increasing probability of a global trade war. I discuss this and the upside of long-term forecasts in the market overview.\n\nIn the news of the week I also share a significant insider purchase I had missed in one of the portfolio companies. The Chairman of the company bought $10 million worth of stock in the open market to up his stake to $100 million. This is a $500 million market cap company, by the way.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s get on with it.\n\nArticles of the week\n\nI published three articles this week. The first was Danaher\u2019s earnings digest. The company reported an okay quarter, but guidance was quite soft. I discuss three reasons why one could be optimistic about the future.\n\nThe second article was an update on Texas Instruments\u2019 capital management update. I discussed some highlights of the call and laid out my valuation scenarios.\n\nFinally, the third article of the week was a comprehensive report on Zoetis. I believe Zoetis is an outstanding company from a quality standpoint, and I explain why. I also discuss the valuation in depth and share my thoughts on the stock at current levels.\n\nNext week, I plan to bring my Amazon earnings digest and an article discussing what I will be selling one of my portfolio positions. I also thought about writing something about Nintendo, but the quarter changes absolutely nothing about the thesis, and I think it\u2019s much more noise than signal. I will, however, work on a valuation update on the company with a special guest (although I don\u2019t know how much time it will take us).\n\nMarket Overview\n\nThe Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were down again this week, albeit only slightly. Both dropped less than 0.3%. It\u2019s, however, the second consecutive negative week they\u2019ve suffered (this shouldn\u2019t be news, but based on what the market has done lately, it is):\n\nI can\u2019t fully explain the reason for the drop (as always), but it might be related to Trump\u2019s words about potential retaliatory tariffs. The Global Trade War continues in full force, and Trump announced that the US will make an announcement regarding retaliatory tariffs next week on Monday or Tuesday. I have no clue about the content of this announcement, and I will not make any sales in my portfolio based on this information (I will, however, publish an article next week announcing the sale of one of my positions but for different reasons).\n\nIn my view, making long-term decisions based on tariffs is a bit speculative for two reasons\u2026\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Trump\u2019s objective is with tariffs. Some people argue that the goal is just to negotiate, not implement them for long. I have absolutely no clue (and neither do those who claim to know) It\u2019s Trump\u2019s last mandate, and we don\u2019t know what will happen when a new President is elected in 4 years.\n\nI would evidently prefer to know what Trump is about to do and why (it would result in fewer uncertainties), but the reason I don\u2019t try to forecast it is that macro is highly complex, and envisioning what will happen even when you have almost perfect information at the start is nearly impossible. Let\u2019s take a look at an example.\n\nSome people claim that Tariffs are inflationary and that Trump\u2019s tone regarding workforce reduction across Government entities will create a recession. If these people are correct, the US could potentially enter a situation called stagflation, where you get rampant inflation combined with a weak economy. This is a challenging situation because if the Government or the Fed try to stimulate the economy to come out of the recession, they could be pushing an already-high inflation higher. The rationale makes sense, but the only problem is that the people who are calling stagflation today have been calling it since 2021. We did get inflation, but the economy did just fine over the period.\n\nI\u2019ve come to appreciate that saying things confidently in the investment world makes you look great at any given moment. This is until time goes by, and then you are likely to look like a fool more often than not (at least 50% of the time). Luckily for these people, attention spans have shortened so much that nobody is even likely to remember the forecast when it\u2019s proven wrong. I believe it was Goldman Sachs who said that the return of the S&P 500 will shrink to a 3% CAGR over the next decade. The strategy here is simple: if it doesn\u2019t happen, nobody will remember, but if it does happen, Goldman Sachs will market the hell out of it. There\u2019s only upside!\n\nThe industry map was mixed this week. Ironically, Nvidia was likely up significantly for the same reason that a good chunk of Big Tech companies were down: Capex. As discussed in my Deepseek article, Capex is an expense for Big Tech, but a revenue source for Nvidia and Capex guidance was\u2026extraordinary (let\u2019s leave it here):\n\nThe fear and greed index retraced to fear levels, but there\u2019s no denying that market levels are far from fear:",

            "content": "Alexander Kerr performed Bruch\u2019s Violin Concerto No. 1 with Fabio Luisi and the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. Photo: Sylvia Elzafon/DSO\n\nThe Dallas Symphony Orchestra toggles this weekend from the newest of the new to the most familiar of all.\n\nThe evening opened with a world premiere, Inscription for Orchestra by Raven Chacon. The Pulitzer Prize winning indigenous composer is known for unusual instrumentation; among his oeuvre is a piece for firearms and foghorns, for which he had to develop a notation system that non-musician shooters and sea captains could read.\n\nInscription uses only instruments found in the traditional orchestra. The 15-minute work begins with sustained microtonal notes in the bass clarinet, bass trombone, and muted trumpet that become pulses of sound. The piece explores the extreme ranges of many instruments\u2014the lowest notes on the double bass extensions and on the piano, the highest strings of the harp. Chacon also employs extended techniques (think Penderecki or Ligeti) such as, in the strings, left hand glissandos while making circles with the bow.\n\nFabio Luisi guided the Dallas musicians skillfully through this avant-garde journey, and the overall effect was a mesmerizing soundscape in this DSO co-commissioned debut.\n\nThe week has been a small Dallas celebration of Raven Chacon\u2019s work. On Tuesday evening, the DSO sponsored a concert featuring Chacon\u2019s Pulitzer-Prize-winning work, Voiceless Mass, performed by students from SMU, members of the Dallas Symphony Chorus, and DSO organist Bradley Hunter Welch, and conducted by principal percussionist George Nickson.\n\nThe remainder of the Dallas Symphony\u2019s program this weekend is far more conventional. Concertmaster Alexander Kerr\u2019s rendition of the Bruch Violin Concerto No. 1 highlighted the best things about his playing: precise technique, warm tone, and lush vibrato that is just right for a Romantic concerto.\n\nUnder Luisi\u2019s direction, the orchestra responded to Kerr\u2019s warmth in kind: this was a loving interpretation of a favorite concerto, beginning with that first, famous open G in the solo violin. Kerr kept tempos moving, including in the middle movement, never letting the music bog down. He has the technique to take even the brisk final movement at whatever pace he wishes, and he zipped along to a virtuosic exciting finish.\n\nWhile Kerr\u2019s playing was never too fast, the same cannot be said for Luisi\u2019s performance of Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 5, which was both too fast and too loud.\n\nIt is, of course, difficult for a conductor to say anything new in a performance of a piece as familiar as this one. The opening to the first movement is probably the best-known theme in all of orchestral music. But while \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cloud\u201d for their own sakes are admirable qualities in, say, a Lamborghini, they are not as desirable in Beethoven.\n\nFortes became fortissimos almost without trying, and true pianissimos were rarely in evidence. The symphony is invariably dramatic, so fudging dynamics a bit makes some sense and may be what many audience members want to hear. The tempos accelerated through each movement until by the finale it was astonishing that the musicians could continue to play cleanly\u2014but they did.\n\nThe audience seemed thrilled, including some folks in the balcony who were determined to applaud loudly between each movement, even over the beautiful viola and cello melody at the beginning of the second movement.\n\nAmid this dizzying land-speed record test, the Andante con moto was the highlight. When the second violins floated that glorious lush tune that is introduced by the violas and cellos, it provided a bright spot in an otherwise rushed interpretation of an iconic work.\n\nThe program will be repeated 7:30 p.m. Saturday and 3 p.m. Sunday. dallassymphony.org",

But at least the stock is up over the last five years. In that time, it is up 40%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 92%.\n\nAlthough Texas Instruments has shed US$5.5b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Texas Instruments actually saw its EPS drop 0.2% per year.\n\nSo it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.\n\nIn contrast revenue growth of 3.6% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Texas Instruments is growing, a real positive. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.\n\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Earnings and Revenue Growth February 4th 2025\n\nTexas Instruments is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Texas Instruments, it has a TSR of 60% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nTexas Instruments shareholders gained a total return of 17% during the year. But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 10% per year over five year. It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

            "content": "Big Tech comprises some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, recognized for their sheer size, extensive customer base, and financial strength. Leading this group are five major companies that have been at the forefront of the tech sector economy, driving innovation and shaping consumer behavior. Over the years, Big Tech firms have benefited from the widespread adoption of smartphones and high-speed internet, increased demand for digital services, the rise of social media, strong demand for cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising.\n\nHow Did the Big Tech Companies Become The Giants They are Today?\n\nBeyond technological advancements, these companies have also benefited from several phenomena. The first is network effects\u2014the more users a platform has, the more valuable it becomes. Other contributing factors include economies of scale as they expanded through acquisitions and the ease of scaling digital businesses globally; access to vast amounts of user data used to enhance products, target ads, and create highly personalized services; and their deep pockets (strong balance sheets) that enabled them to invest heavily in R&D, hire top talent, and operate during challenging times. This financial strength also allowed them to aggressively invest in AI and maintain a first-mover advantage. While challenges persist, we believe these companies will continue to innovate, expand their influence, and shape the future of technology.\n\nIn a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Wedbush Securities\u2019 Global Head of Technology Research, Dan Ives, expressed optimism about the future of Big Tech, stating:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s $80 billion investment announcement and then Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement that his company plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence is \u201cthe start of a massive build-out of AI Capex\u201d that I think the Street is massively underestimating. And it\u2019s the multiplier \u2013 every dollar spent on a NVIDIA chip, means $8 to $10 multiplier goes to the rest of tech \u2013 that\u2019s bullish for tech. Of course, with Trump and Stargate, it just shows that fourth industrial revolution is just starting.\u201d\n\nWhile Big Tech typically refers to the top five mega-cap companies, we have prepared an extended list of 15 stocks that have made a significant impact on the tech landscape and are equally innovative and transformative as the top five. With that, let\u2019s explore the 15 best Big Tech stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 15 best Big Tech stocks to buy according to analysts, we screened companies with market capitalization of at least $100 billion and potential upside of at least 15%. Ultimately, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their potential upside.\n\nNote: all pricing data is as of market close on February 3.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n15.

While most of the public\u2019s attention is focused on chatbots, AI\u2019s business use cases are quite diverse. One such use case is in the healthcare industry and another comes through the financial services sector. Cramer commented on both of these :\n\nSemiconductor stocks were once again at the forefront of media and investor attention this week during the stock market selloff triggered by investor apprehensions about lower AI development costs courtesy of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI models. Because AI has dominated headlines for more than a year now, most of Cramer\u2019s attention during his morning appearances focused on the technology whether it was before or after the selloff.\n\nWe recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 9 Semiconductor Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor semiconductor stocks, one AI-generate catalyst that did not materialize is the AI PC. These PCs use a special chip called a neural processing unit (NPU) along with CPUs and GPUs to run AI tasks. In an appearance before the DeepSeek selloff, Cramer mentioned a Morgan Stanley report that shared that 60% of people surveyed had accidentally bought an AI PC and more than 60% were uncomfortable paying extra for AI products. The report, which added that just 15% of the respondents had bought a new product because of AI was \u201cperhaps the most damming piece\u201d that Cramer had read.\n\nHe shared that \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever,\u201d and cycled back to enterprise AI use cases by stating \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say.\u201d\n\nCramer added that not only was he wrong about the AI PC cycle as the PC he \u201cthought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d but those who he knew had bought such a PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street after September 2024. Then, we picked out semiconductor stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN): \"I Like It Ahead of the Quarter,\" Says Jim Cramer\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 57\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 10-18-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: -6.7%\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is an American chip company that makes and sells embedded and analog chips for industrial, data center, and other use cases. The diversified product portfolio means that the firm is exposed to AI and non-AI spending. Since Cramer\u2019s remarks, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) shares have lost 6.7%. This is because a large portion of its revenue is dependent on industrial firms. In fact, during H1 2024, 76% of the revenue was through these companies. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\u2019s shares lost 7.4% in January after a weak earnings report and shed another 3.5% during the DeepSeek selloff. Here\u2019s what Cramer said in October:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we hear from Texas Instruments. We\u2019ve been hearing a lot about how semiconductor companies are in the doldrums, the ones without AI, that is. Tex Instruments falls into that category but this company\u2019s become much more focused. I like it ahead of the quarter, even though it has a little more cyclicality than most chip makers.\u201d\n\nOverall, TXN ranks 8th on our list of semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of TXN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TXN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While the tariffs may have a limited direct impact on the semiconductor industry, analysts warn that indirect effects and potential escalation could be a concern.\n\nAccording to five-star Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, the U.S. imports a significant amount of electronics and machinery containing semiconductors from China, Mexico, and Canada. For example, the U.S. imported $39 billion in data processing equipment, including PCs and servers, from China in 2023, and $28 billion from Mexico. As a result, Companies like Foxconn, which is building a massive AI server assembly site in Mexico, will need to adapt quickly to the changing tariff landscape.\n\nIs NVDA a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts remain bullish on NVDA stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months.

Here\u2019s what to look for.\n\nNXP Semiconductors met analysts\u2019 revenue expectations last quarter, reporting revenues of $3.25 billion, down 5.4% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a narrow beat of analysts\u2019 adjusted operating income estimates.\n\nIs NXP Semiconductors a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting NXP Semiconductors\u2019s revenue to decline 9.4% year on year to $3.1 billion, a reversal from the 3.3% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $3.13 per share.\n\nNXP Semiconductors Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. NXP Semiconductors has only missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 1.2% on average.\n\nLooking at NXP Semiconductors\u2019s peers in the semiconductors segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect.

Texas Instruments traded down 7.5% following the results while Teradyne was also down 5.7%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Texas Instruments\u2019s results here and Teradyne\u2019s results here.\n\nInflation has progressed towards the Fed\u2019s 2% goal as of late, leading to strong stock market performance. Recent rate cuts and the 2024 Presidential election's conclusion added further sparks to the market, and while some of the semiconductors stocks have shown solid performance, the group has generally underpeformed, with share prices down 3.2% on average over the last month. NXP Semiconductors is down 2.3% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $262.41 (compared to the current share price of $208.43).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

            "content": "Semiconductors are small chips used to manufacture nearly every consumer electronic. From computer chips to medical equipment, and smartphones to 5G mobile networks, our modern lives depend on these tiny silicon wafers. Most of them could easily fit on the tip of your finger.\n\nCanada\u2019s semiconductor industry isn\u2019t nearly as large as those of the United States or Taiwan. That said, the Canadian government did allocate $240 million for research and development in the field. This comes as global demand for semiconductors has surged at the same time supply has dwindled. Chip shortages have made semiconductor companies especially optimistic on production.\n\nDespite the recent slowdown in semiconductor growth stocks, which have been hurt lower consumer spending, these companies are still an investment you might want to consider. If you\u2019re looking to invest in future microchip technology, here\u2019s what you should know about investing in semiconductor stocks.\n\nWhat are semiconductor stocks?\n\nSemiconductor stocks can fall into a variety of market sectors, ranging from companies that mine silicon to chemical plants that turn it into materials. However, we typically associate them with the tech sector.\n\nAnd, like other tech stocks, semiconductor stocks can be especially volatile. Companies that perform well in this sector are those that can generate sustainable revenues, keep costs low, and reinvest capital in research and new technology.\n\nTop semiconductor stocks for Canadian investors\n\nMany of the largest semiconductor companies are headquartered in the United States. That said, Canada has some exciting growth stocks in this industry. It would be foolish to overlook up-and-coming tech companies trading on the Canadian stock market.\n\nFor diversity, let\u2019s look at three big U.S. semiconductor stocks and one growth Canadian company.\n\nSemiconductor Stock Description Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\n\n\n\nA leader in the development and design of GPUs Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)\n\nThe world\u2019s largest logic chipmaker and key developer of new technologies Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) The world\u2019s largest manufacturer of analog chips POET Technologies (TSXV: PTK)\n\nToronto-based company that\u2019s integrating photonics and electronic devices into one chip\n\nNvidia\n\nGamers across the world know Nvidia by its iconic memory chips and gaming cards. As such, Nvidia is a global leader in producing a certain kind of semiconductor, the \u201cgraphics processing unit\u201d or GPU.\n\nBut video game graphics is only one segment of Nvidia\u2019s semiconductor operations. The other segment, Compute & Networking, uses semiconductors for a mind-numbing amount of operations. For instance, it has developed a cloud computing platform that helps accelerate a number of data centre tasks, from artificial intelligence to high-performance computing (HPC). It also develops GPUs for high-level cryptocurrency mining.\n\nDuring the pandemic, consumers rushed to video games for entertainment, and Nvidia\u2019s market cap exploded and it has continued to surge. Nvidia is now neck and neck with Apple as the most valuable company in the world as of January 2025, with a valuable of almost $3.5 trillion.\n\nIntel\n\nIntel is one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturers. It is also a key developer in the x86 series of microprocessors, the central unit found in almost all personal computers.\n\nFor much of the early 2010s, Intel enjoyed an unrivalled position in the semiconductor industry. But Intel became relatively complacent, and did very little to beat back the competition that was gradually gaining momentum.\n\nWith the arrival of new chip-producing giants\u2014such as Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2014as well as manufacturing blunders, Intel fell behind. It has been struggling to keep up ever since.\n\nIn December 2024, Intel\u2019s CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted after the board lost confidence in his turnaround strategy, following a 33% decline in revenue and missed opportunities in chip manufacturing contracts with major clients like Microsoft and Amazon. Following Gelsinger\u2019s exit, Intel appointed David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs while searching for a permanent replacement.\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nTexas Instruments (TI) is well-known across the world for its high-computing calculators. It is also a major manufacturer and seller of semiconductors, especially analog chips.\n\nThough these chips aren\u2019t as powerful as GPUs, they\u2019re less expensive to produce. Not only that, but the automotive and industrial sector depend heavily on analog chips, which together make up around 62% of TI\u2019s revenue.\n\nTI is also an integrated device manufacturer (IDM), which means it makes most of its chips in-house. This has helped insulate TI from the global chip shortage, as it doesn\u2019t depend on a third-party for chip production.\n\nThat said, with the company\u2019s performance tied to the automotive and industrial sectors, it can be fairly cyclical. For instance, during the pandemic, TI struggled to grow, as low demand for cars and consumer electronics left it selling fewer chips.\n\nOver the past couple of years, Texas Instruments (TI) has faced a challenging financial landscape. In 2023, the company reported an annual revenue of $17.519 billion, marking a 12.53% decline from the $20.028 billion reported in 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2024, TI\u2019s revenue decreased by 2% year-over-year to $4.01 billion, with net income falling 12% to $1.21 billion.\n\nDespite these declines, the company anticipates a return to growth in the first quarter of 2025, projecting revenues between $3.74 billion and $4.06 billion, which would surpass the $3.66 billion from the same quarter the previous year.\n\nPOET Technologies\n\nPOET Technologies is a growth company based in Toronto. It designs and develops a special kind of semiconductor that integrates electronics and photonics into a wafer-level device.\n\nAccording to the company, this integrated chip will cut assembly and component costs for its clients. It will also provide them with a flexible platform that could have far-reaching applications from data centre solutions to consumer product development.\n\nSo far, the company has done surprisingly well. It has cash on hand and has managed to keep its operating costs low. As the Canadian government has recently allocated money for the development of the semiconductor sector, POET is certainly a growth stock to keep your eye on.\n\nAre semiconductor stocks right for you?\n\nThe semiconductor sector presents an enticing investment prospect in 2025, buoyed by technological advancements in fields such as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, and green energy solutions. This upsurge in demand, highlighted by AI-driven companies like Nvidia, accentuates the pivotal role of semiconductors in future technological progress.\n\nHowever, potential investors should recognize the sector\u2019s complexity, from the procurement of materials like silicon to the capital-heavy chip fabrication process. Additionally, the semiconductor industry is characterized by its cyclical nature, influenced by consumer demand and broader economic trends. For example, a dip in tech product sales during the 2022-2023 economic slump resulted in an oversupply, impacting giants such as Intel and AMD, though the market saw a resurgence in 2024 attributed to demands in data centers, AI, and automotive technologies.\n\nDespite these fluctuations, the long-term outlook for semiconductor stocks is promising, especially with global efforts like the U.S. CHIPS Act promoting domestic manufacturing and major firms investing in advanced 2nm and 3nm chip technologies.\n\nFor forward-looking investors, semiconductor stocks present a lucrative growth avenue, especially for those planning to maintain their portfolios over the next decade, given the industry\u2019s trajectory towards continuous technological innovation.",

Click the button below to subscribe today and elevate your investment journey!\n\n2025 started with turbulent times for the market as new tariffs from the US and sudden fears about Chinese LLM DeepSeek hit the market. Europe on the other hand has seen some great performances, which reflected into a great month for my portfolio.\n\nHeavy Moat Investments gained over 460 subscribers and almost 1,500 followers in January. I\u2019m happy with this growth and am looking to continue publishing high quality content. Next month I have planned to do a podcast with\n\nabout one of my holdings. I\u2019ll upload the podcast onto Substack as well, if that works smoothly.\n\nIn January, I pubished fundamental deep dives into Carlisle and Watsco. I posted about the problems at Hershey\u2019s and went over my semiconductor earnings reports. I pitched a new company and a European company I didn\u2019t buy. I published my three part portfolio 2024 review, but I was honestly disappointed with the lack of response to the post. In the future, I\u2019ll keep such posts shorter if my readers aren\u2019t very interested in it.

The company is shifting its revenue from hardware to software and services, making the businss more predictable and growing faster. You can my pitch here. I funded the purchase by selling Alimentation Couche-Tard. The company is still a great business, but it was my lowest conviction and I honestly wasn\u2019t comfortable with the large merger they tried to do with Seven & I Holdings. I much prefer bolt on deals to large mega mergers like that. I did not buy any other shares in January.\n\nAfter an underperformance in 2024, January started great: My portfolio gained 7.8% versus around 2-3% for the US Indizes. I\u2019m very happy to see the great results that came out of Europe: Nemetschek (up 22% in the month) raised its full year guidance, Pluxee (22%) reported great results, Eckert und Ziegler (22%) with great results, Frosta AG (18%) with higher than expected margins, Sartorius Stedim (17% with good earnings and Lifco (14%) with good Q4 earnings. It\u2019s great to see this rebound and let\u2019s see if it continues into the rest of the year. My other companies performed well across the board, with the only losers Texas Instruments (-1%) and Danaher (-2%) after bad earnings and Hermle (-1%) who just can\u2019t get any momentum in this downturn.\n\nMessage Heavy Moat Investments\n\nI hope to see you again next month. Investing is a journey, and I\u2019m eager to learn and share my experience with you. If you haven\u2019t already, consider subscribing, and let me know how your year went in the comments.\n\nAll the best,\n\nNiklas from Heavy Moat Investments.",

            "content": "Launched in December 2024, the iCar V23 from Chery is a compact all-electric SUV that combines retro off-road styling with modern EV technology. It is available in three trims, including rear-wheel drive (RWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) options, with a maximum CLTC range of 501 km. It allows for extensive customization, including detachable fenders and off-road bumpers. Priced starting at 13,700 USD, the iCar V23 targets urban and suburban drivers seeking a practical and stylish electric vehicle.\n\nExterior:\n\nThe iCar V23 features a retro-inspired off-road design, a smoked front grille, round headlights, and a squared-off silhouette. Practical elements like a roof luggage rack, hidden door handles, and an external rear storage container add functionality to its rugged appearance.\n\nMeasuring 4,220 mm in length, 1,915 mm in width, and 1,845 mm in height, with a 2,735 mm wheelbase, the iCar V23 is a compact SUV to rival the BYD Atto 3 (see specs) and the Geely Galaxy E5 (see specs). Its approach angle of 43\u00b0, departure angle of 41\u00b0, and minimum ground clearance of 210 mm (AWD) make it suitable for uneven terrain. The rear features a side-opening door with an integrated \u201cbackpack\u201d for emergency tools.\n\nInterior:\n\nThe interior of the iCar V23 is modern and functional, with a white and black color scheme, straight lines, and circular knobs. A 15.4-inch 2.5K central touchscreen, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip, is the primary interface for infotainment and supports CarPlay. The system is responsive but lacks advanced features like wireless charging or smartphone integration.\n\nThe seating arrangement is versatile, with foldable rear seats providing up to 744 liters of flat cargo space. Front seats are electrically adjustable, offering good support and comfort, though ventilation is unavailable. The seven-speaker audio system delivers clear sound quality. Additional storage options include under-seat compartments and a 90-liter underfloor trunk, enhancing practicality.\n\nDriving Experience:\n\nThe iCar V23 is designed for urban commuting and light off-road use. During the test drive, the vehicle provided a smooth and quiet ride. With a 55 kW (74 hp) front motor and a rear motor with 100 kW (134 hp) and 180 Nm torque, the AWD version delivers a combined output of 211 hp and 292 Nm torque, accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h in 7.5 seconds. This version feels confident and dynamic, especially on uneven surfaces.\n\nThe suspension is tuned for comfort, effectively absorbing road imperfections in urban settings. The ride can feel slightly firm on rougher terrains, which is expected given its off-road-inspired design. The steering is light and precise, making the vehicle easy to handle in tight spaces, but it lacks the feedback in sportier models.\n\nThe iCar V23\u2019s light off-road capabilities were tested on gravel and dirt roads, where it performed adequately. The high ground clearance and AWD system provide enough confidence for light trails but are not designed for extreme off-road conditions.\n\nThe iCar V23 has a suite of driver assistance systems powered by a Horizon Robotics J3 chip and Texas Instruments TDA4 chip. Features like high-speed navigation, emergency lane keeping, and traffic jam assistance worked reliably during the test drive. The automatic parking system, supported by an 8-megapixel front-view camera, a 3-megapixel surround-view camera, five millimeter-wave radars, and 12 ultrasonic radars, simplifies parking in tight spaces.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe iCar V23 is a practical and stylish electric SUV for urban commuting and light off-road adventures. Its retro-inspired design, modern interior, and 24 modular upgrade interfaces\u2014including detachable fenders and off-road bumpers\u2014allow for extensive customization, enhancing its versatility and appeal. While it offers driver assistance systems and competitive pricing, it lacks advanced technology and is unsuitable for long-distance travel or demanding off-road conditions. For buyers seeking an affordable electric vehicle with unique design and practical features, the iCar V23 is a compelling option.\n\nStay tuned for next week\u2019s Sunday China Drive at Car News China, where you can read more first-person evaluations of Chinese cars.",

Photo courtesy of the company.\n\nCountries that rise up\n\nIn the late 1970s, Narayana Murthy, an Indian software engineer, set out the aspiration to change the image of the country of flute players and snake charmers to the image of engineers providing 24-hour software services to the whole world, especially to the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMore than 40 years later, India has become the world's number one software services powerhouse, with more than 10 million software professionals, along with a series of the world's largest software services companies, including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech, and Tech Mahindra, which are giants with 138,000 to 612,000 employees.\n\nSurprisingly, the capitalization of TCS, India's largest software services company, is almost equal to that of Toyota and Samsung, the two largest technology giants in Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn addition, most of the CEOs of the world's largest technology companies in the U.S.'s Silicon Valley are Indians, such as giants Microsoft, Google, IBM, YouTube, Micron, Adobe, and Palo Alto Networks.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Taiwan had a strategy to transform from an agricultural production-based economy to a world-class telecommunications and information technology-based one.\n\nLee Kwok-ding, former Minister of Economy and former Minister of Finance, was trusted by the Taiwanese administration to be the \"chief architect\" of the economic transition. Lee sought out Taiwanese talents in the semiconductor field, and Morris Chang, former vice president of Texas Instruments, was entrusted with the responsibility of being chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC).\n\nForty years later, TSMC became the second largest semiconductor company in the world, and Taiwan became as rich as Japan and South Korea, in which the semiconductor industry has a very special position not only in the Taiwanese economy but also in the global economy.\n\nIn 2023, Taiwan's semiconductor exports reached $167 billion, accounting for 38.5% of its total goods export value. The capitalization of the 20 largest semiconductor companies in Taiwan reached $1,500 billion, twice as high as Taiwan's total GDP ($752 billion). Taiwan holds almost \"the throat\" of the world's semiconductor industry, making up more than 60% of the world's chip production and 90% of the global high-tech chip production.\n\nIllustration courtesy of the Trendforce.\n\nPillars that bring Vietnam into the era of national \"rising up\"\n\nSeeing India rise up based on software services and Taiwan grow to become a \u201cdragon\u201d based on semiconductor technology, the question is whether Vietnam can do the same as India and Taiwan, and if so, which industry and technology will be the fulcrum and growth driver for the whole country?\n\nLet\u2019s go back 25 years ago. At the end of 1998, FPT launched a software export strategy with the determination to \u201cexport or die.\u201d. At that time, FPT had no capital, no technology, no human resources, and no customers; neither FPT nor Vietnam had an international brand in software.\n\nNo one believed that FPT or Vietnam could make software; even the World Bank did not believe it. However, with a strong determination and a deep belief in itself and in the qualities of Vietnamese people, FPT started preparing human resources, bringing the Indian programmer training program into teaching, followed by opening FPT University to train human resources for itself.\n\nFPT went to Bangalore, the software capital of India, and then to Silicon Valley in the U.S. to open a company. When the $1 million fund for software export was exhausted, the Japanese market brought in quality contracts and customers.\n\nToday, Vietnam has become the second largest software-exporting country in Asia (after India), providing software services to more than 30 countries around the world, including the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nIn 2024, more than 1,500 software companies brought the country over $7 billion in foreign currency. This is a truly meaningful figure; it is a pity that the import-export statistics only take into account the goods passing through customs gates, while software is not considered goods and is not included in the statistics.\n\nRemember that $800 billion of goods import-export only brings a trade surplus of about $26.5 billion, while $7 billion of exported software brings a trade surplus of up to $5.5 billion. In addition, the labor productivity of software exports reaches about $40,000 per person per year, five to eight times higher than other industries.\n\nIf 25 years ago, we exported software with nothing, with many doubts, many difficulties, and countless challenges that seemed impossible to overcome, now with the existing foundation of the information technology and telecommunications industry, especially software export, along with the strong explosion of AI and global semiconductors, with the geopolitical position of the country, with the stature and potential of the nation, we can confidently say that software, AI, and semiconductors are the fulcrum, the driving force for growth, the pillars that bring Vietnam into the era of national \"rising up\".\n\nAI is the future of the world; the huge demand for AI resources globally in the next 30 years is indisputable. Doing AI requires two important qualities: mathematics and software. We Vietnamese have both of those qualities, and reality has proven that.\n\nAccording to statistics from the International Mathematical Olympiad, Vietnam ranked seventh in the world in the medal tally, just behind the U.S., Russia, China, South Korea, Hungary, and Romania. In the world's most prestigious Fields Mathematics Award, seven countries won from two to eight medals, 14 countries won one medal, and Vietnam was one of those 14 countries.\n\nIn terms of software services, Vietnam has truly become the fifth most powerful country in the world, with more than 500,000 software engineers providing software services to more than 30 countries around the world. These are very valuable resources for the transition to AI and semiconductors in the coming period.\n\nToday, chips (semiconductors) are not only found in computers, cars, rockets, airplanes, and ships, but also in all the devices around us, from mobile phones, televisions, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, gas stoves, induction cookers, and microwave ovens to vacuum cleaners, floor cleaners, irons, gate locks, and children's toys.\n\nIn 2023, the amount of money China spent on importing semiconductors was $349 billion, more than the amount of money they spent on importing crude oil ($338 billion). That is why people think that in the 21st century, semiconductors play an important role like oil in the 20th century. The shift of production out of China and, recently, the shift of part of semiconductor production out of Taiwan is a reality that happened and is happening.\n\nThere is a very thoughtful fact that Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and China account for more than 90% of global semiconductor foundry revenue. People are still trying to explain why East Asian countries, with chopstick cultures, are the countries with the most achievements in the field of semiconductors. Is there anything related to national character and culture?\n\nFew people know that the process of \"dragonization\" of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan was closely linked to the achievements of the semiconductor and electronics industries and, at the same time, possessed a particularly important factor: the support from Silicon Valley, that is, from the U.S.\n\nOur Vietnam is the only chopstick culture that has yet to become a semiconductor powerhouse, but now the opportunity to become a country with an important position in the global semiconductor and AI supply chain is coming very clearly. We definitely cannot miss it.\n\nThat is why I deeply believe that the establishment of the U.S.-Vietnam comprehensive strategic partnership, the trend of shifting the global semiconductor supply chain, Vietnam's geopolitical position, and the country's human resources of software and mathematics are the four fulcrums, the four pillars that will bring Vietnam into the era of national \"rising up\".",

            "content": "During his career at Texas Instruments (TI), Dr. Ted Moise and his team pioneered the development of a memory technology that made it possible for electronic devices to store data 100 times faster while using less power than conventional approaches.\n\nMoise (pronounced \u201cmo-EES\u201d), who now directs the North Texas Semiconductor Institute (NTxSI) at The University of Texas at Dallas, has been honored for his groundbreaking work at TI by being named a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI).\n\nThe award is the highest professional distinction bestowed upon academic inventors whose work has impacted quality of life, economic development and the welfare of society. Moise is one of 170 inventors who will be inducted into the 2024 Class of Fellows at the academy\u2019s annual meeting June 26 in Atlanta.\n\nAfter retiring from TI in 2021, Moise joined UT Dallas as director of the newly formed NTxSI, which works to accelerate semiconductor innovation, entrepreneurship and workforce development in North Texas. Moise also serves as a research professor of materials science and engineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science.\n\n\u201cUT Dallas is fortunate to have Dr. Ted Moise lead its efforts to support groundbreaking research and a vibrant North Texas semiconductor ecosystem,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Pancrazio, vice president for research and innovation and professor of bioengineering at UT Dallas. \u201cAs director of the North Texas Semiconductor Institute, Dr. Moise brings a wealth of expertise and accomplishments from his distinguished career at Texas Instruments, continuing longstanding ties between UT Dallas and TI. We could not be prouder of Dr. Moise\u2019s latest honor.\u201d\n\nBeginning in 1997, Moise led TI\u2019s efforts to develop ferroelectric random-access memory, or FRAM (pronounced \u201cF-RAM\u201d), a method for storing data on a chip using a class of crystals called ferroelectrics. FRAM is a type of nonvolatile memory that allows data to remain stored when power is removed from a device.\n\n\u201cUT Dallas is fortunate to have Dr. Ted Moise lead its efforts to support groundbreaking research and a vibrant North Texas semiconductor ecosystem. \u2026 We could not be prouder of Dr. Moise\u2019s latest honor.\u201d Dr. Joseph Pancrazio, vice president for research and innovation and professor of bioengineering at UT Dallas\n\nAdvancing FRAM technology from the early days in the research labs into high volume manufacturing in multiple wafer fabrication facilities within TI was a 20-year process. Development and manufacturing teams at TI overcame numerous technical challenges, Moise said. In 2007, TI qualified its first product, a 4 megabyte-embedded FRAM chip, which, along with scores of other FRAM-based devices, continues to be manufactured today. Moise credits a core team of strong innovators, including frequent co-inventor Dr. Scott Summerfelt, a TI Fellow, and support from TI management as keys to success.\n\nFRAM technology has applications across many industries, including ultra-low power microcontrollers, automotive data recorders and biomedical devices, such as glucose monitors. The technology is especially helpful in biomedical applications because it is not affected by radiation from scans such as X-rays. Several space-qualified FRAM products also have been released.\n\nMoise, who holds 51 patents, earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and engineering from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, and a PhD in electrical engineering from Yale University. Moise joined TI in 1992. He received the 2012 Edith and Peter O\u2019Donnell Award from the Texas Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science and is an IEEE Fellow.\n\nMoise said he is honored to be named an NAI fellow.\n\n\u201cBeing named a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors is recognition that FRAM developed by Texas Instruments was an important technology that changed the world in positive ways, which is the whole point of engineering,\u201d Moise said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s been a wonderful experience: To take a high-risk idea and make it work, and to have the technology still in production after nearly two decades is amazing.\u201d",

            "content": "The enhancement of edge computing with AI-enabled functionality promises to revolutionize the cloud and Internet of Things (IoT). Companies like Texas Instruments are beginning to offer advanced solutions that bring AI to the edge, like the C2000 series of real-time MCUs.\n\nFor example, in motion-control applications where you have motors that are spinning, real-time detection can help determine if there's a fault, or a bearing is performing badly, or other problems exist with the system. Such a system can also aid in predictive maintenance and fault recovery.\n\nDevices in the C2000 family integrate an edge AI accelerator to enable motor control while also detecting sensing inputs to see if there's a fault in the motor and how it's doing. The device can sense any change in the parameters to detect whether there's a fault in the motor or motors involved.\n\nC2000 MCUs offer low-latency, real-time control for a range of automotive and industrial applications. When used with wide-bandgap GaN and SiC power devices, they can enable higher switching frequencies, increase power density, and improve accuracy and efficiency.These are paired with a software ecosystem that includes advanced security and functional-safety features, especially useful in onboard charging and DC-DC conversion, energy infrastructure, motor-drive and body-control applications.\n\nThe MCUs can also be used in other demanding applications, such as identifying and de-energizing dangerous arcs. They achieve greater than 98% detection accuracy on bearing and load imbalance faults with on-chip learning options for anomaly detection. In this video, Texas Instruments' Vivek Singhal explains two demos that highlight these capabilities.",

According to Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally, the three big traditional car companies \u2014 General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., Stellantis NV \u2014 and their suppliers will remain volatile given the extreme risk. The analyst added that every 10% Mexico tariff translates to a 20% hit to GM\u2019s earnings per share and a 10% blow to Ford\u2019s.\n\n\u201cMexico tariffs would be highly disruptive and inflationary to the U.S. auto consumer,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan wrote in a note, adding that auto investors\u2019 sentiment on the Mexico tariff topic has worsened in recent days.\n\nThe S&P 500 Auto Parts & Equipment Index can move as auto suppliers\u2019 \u201cproduct ecosystem is already largely entrenched in Mexico,\u201d and they stand heavily exposed to the risk, Narayan said.\n\nElectric vehicle stocks that can be impacted include Tesla Inc., Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc., charging network operators such as ChargePoint Holdings Inc., Beam Global, Blink Charging Co.\n\nChina-Exposed Stocks\n\nStocks across sectors with high exposure to China will be most vulnerable, given Trump\u2019s especially tough stance on trade with the Asian nation.\n\nDavid Bell, CEO of CloneOps.ai, discusses the impact of AI on the trucking industry.

            "content": "Texas Instruments (TI) (TXN 1.62%) stock lost about 7.5% of its value in the trading session following its latest earnings report. While revenue exceeded expectations, a muted outlook for the upcoming quarter prompted investors to sell.\n\nThat situation may create a predicament for long-term shareholders. Is the lowered outlook a sign of more pain to come, or should investors treat the pullback as an opportunity to add shares?\n\nThe state of TI\n\nTI is a semiconductor stock that arguably does not get the attention it deserves from the market. Its analog and embedded chips do not grab the same interest as chips produced by an Nvidia or an Advanced Micro Devices, but they remain a critical part of the industry. Its chips translate analog signals into digital signals. Without that technology, the latest technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), would not be possible.\n\nAs a result, TI produces more than 80,000 products for over 100,000 customers. The majority of its business serves the industrial and automotive sectors, though its chips also appear in products such as enterprise systems, communications equipment, and personal electronics.\n\nTI also stands out in unique ways. During the tenure of former CEO Rich Templeton, TI became a dividend juggernaut, growing the payout at a compound annual rate of 24% between 2004 and 2023.\n\nUnder current CEO Haviv Ilan, the increases are more modest, as last year's increase was 5%. Still, it offers a dividend yield of 2.9%, far above the 1.2% average of the S&P 500. That makes it an excellent choice for income investors when one factors in the 21-year record of annual payout hikes.\n\nFurthermore, unlike most other chip companies today, it handles its own manufacturing, with 15 fabs operating globally. It has also begun to build two additional fabs in Sherman, Texas, and construction is ongoing amid an industry slowdown.\n\nTI's earnings\n\nFortunately, the financials show that that slowdown could soon end. In the fourth quarter of 2024, TI reported revenue of just over $4 billion, a pullback of less than 2% from year-ago levels. This beat the company's outlook in the third quarter, when it said that revenue would be no higher than $4 billion.\n\nIts performance may also point to signs of improvement. In 2024, revenue was just under $16 billion, an 11% pullback compared to 2023. Analog revenue was up 2%, but an 18% drop in embedded revenue weighed on its results.\n\nMoreover, the cost of revenue increased slightly during that time. Hence, the $4.8 billion net income during that time represents a 26% yearly decline.\n\nNonetheless, management forecasts revenue of $3.9 billion at the midpoint in first-quarter 2025. That level is still below Q1 2023 (when it came in at $4.4 billion), indicating that its recovery is not yet complete. This may explain why its stock rose by only 9% over the past year. Thanks to the recent sell-off, that lags the S&P 500's returns during the same timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at 36, a level near multi-year highs. The earnings multiple averaged 25 over the last five years, and with its tepid financial performance, investors may think twice about paying a premium in today's business environment.\n\nStand pat on TI stock\n\nUnder current conditions, TI stock looks like a hold. As previously mentioned, TI's chips help make today's cutting-edge technology possible. This factor makes TI an extremely safe long-term holding, and the rising dividend makes it an increasingly appealing income stock.\n\nUnfortunately, the chip industry is cyclical, and TI is still struggling to come out of a slowdown. Additionally, this comes at a time when its P/E ratio is near multi-year highs, which seems to bode poorly for the stock.\n\nNone of these challenges are likely to derail TI's long-term growth, and investors should consider the stock if its P/E ratio falls below 25. Still, for now, investors should probably refrain from adding shares.",

            "content": "ON VALENTINE\u2019S DAY in 1961, the winter of our senior year in high school, the U.S. figure skating team, headed for world championship competition in Prague, boarded Belgian Sabena Flight 548 at Idlewild Airport in New York. The plane crashed hours later, while circling the Brussels Airport. Everyone aboard died. (Photo, Washington Post, Matty Zimmerman/AP).\n\nFrom the Washington Post: \u201cOur country has sustained a great loss of talent and grace which had brought pleasure to people all over the world,\u201d President John F. Kennedy said in a statement issued from the White House. \u201cMrs. Kennedy and I extend our deepest sympathy to the families and friends of all the passengers and crew who died in this crash.\u201d\n\nAs a tribute to those athletes and their coaches, mourners established a memorial fund that was administered by the U.S. Figure Skating Association. In 2018, Kelyn Soong, a writer for the Washington Post, wrote a historical retrospective of this tragedy. In it, she noted, and quoted, many of figure-skating athletes who came to prominence in world competitions in the years following the tragedy and who credited that memorial fund for making it possible for them to participate in an expensive and life-consuming sport.\n\nWE HUMANS ARE WIRED FOR TOUCH and at no time are we more aware of it than during times of communal tragedies and suffering. Immediately, our clumsy, fumbling memories search for any stray piece, however brief or insignificant, that will bond us compassionately to our world family.\n\nFigure skating? Two fragments.\n\nOne: Fall of 1979, Lake Placid, New York. It was a figure-skating test event for the upcoming 1980 Winter Olympics Lake Placid was to host. I was there as a guest of a Texas Instruments\u2019s press junket. Before the first performer\u2014Scott Hamilton\u2014 I had never seen anyone at any level ice skate (other than on television).\n\nTwo: One of my dearest friends, Carl Sautter, a screenwriter who lived in Los Angeles, had become an avid ice-skating devotee. In the last weeks of his life, before he died of AIDS in 1993, his partner Paul Waigner arranged\u2014with astonishingly difficult logistics at an almost military level\u2014for Carl, then, very physically frail, to fly to Arizona to watch a high-level round of professional ice-skating competitions. At Carl\u2019s memorial service, held in a rink in Los Angeles, Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner danced to Bette Midler\u2019s Wind Beneath My Wings.\n\nFor my thoughts on today\u2019s tragedy, I choose the concluding words from Dylan Thomas\u2019s poem, \u201cA Refusal to Mourn the Death, By Fire, of A Child in London\u201d\u2014\n\nI shall not murder\n\nThe mankind of her going with a grave truth\n\nNor blaspheme down the stations of the breath\n\nWith any further\n\nElegy of innocence and youth.",

            "content": "Fruity cargo cult Apple chose to cosy up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) over Chipzilla for its custom silicon because \u201cIntel didn\u2019t know how to be a foundry.\u201d\n\nTSMC founder Morris Chang said that when Jobs\u2019 Mob began designing its processors for iPhones and iPads around 2009 and 2010, it initially relied on Samsung Foundry.\n\nHowever, as custom silicon became a defining advantage of Apple\u2019s products in the early 2010s, the company sought an alternative supplier, given that Samsung was its primary competitor.\n\nApple considered Intel Custom Foundry (ICF) and Texas Instruments but quickly determined that ICF was not designed for external customers and that Texas Instruments lacked advanced process technologies. As a result, Apple turned to TSMC as its exclusive supplier.\n\nChang explained that Intel\u2019s CEO, Paul Otellini, personally approached Apple CEO Tim Cook in early 2011 with an offer to manufacture Apple\u2019s chips. In response, Apple temporarily paused discussions with TSMC for two months to evaluate Intel\u2019s proposal.\n\nChang travelled to Apple\u2019s headquarters to assess the situation, concerned about this delay. In a private meeting, Cook reassured him that Apple would not choose Intel, reportedly stating: \u201cIntel just does not know how to be a foundry.\u201d\n\nThe differences between Intel and TSMC\u2019s business models highlight Intel\u2019s failure to accommodate customer demands.\n\nChang recalled. \u201cI knew a lot of Intel's customer customers in Taiwan \u2026 none of them liked Intel [as it] always acted like they were the only guy [with] microprocessors. The Foundry business where TSMC does not compete with customers, and even if Intel is trying to do business in good faith, they do have conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nUnlike Intel, which had long focused on designing and manufacturing its chips, TSMC was willing to tailor its processes to customer needs.\n\n\u201cWhen the customer asks a lot of things, we have learned to respond to every request,\u201d Chang said.\n\n\u201cSome of them were crazy, some were irrational, [but] we respond courteously to each request. Intel has never done that; I knew a lot of Intel customers here in Taiwan, and all [of them] wished that there was another supplier.\u201d\n\nIntel has since sought to address these shortcomings with its revamped Intel Foundry, which now supports industry-standard design tools. However, Apple\u2019s decision to work with TSMC fundamentally reshaped the industry, he added.",

            "content": "The semiconductor industry is expected to see continued demand for artificial intelligence chips in 2025, while legacy segments could stabilize after a period of oversupply, according to a report from VanEck.\n\nAccording to the research, Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Broadcom (AVGO, Financials), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM, Financials), and Marvell Technology (MRVL, Financials) are positioned in AI semiconductors; Nvidia maintains a dominating role. While demand for artificial intelligence processing is still high, VanEck believes that Nvidia's expansion could slow down from past years. The paper also notes that developers of hyperscale clouds such Amazon (AMZN, Financials) and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) are creating artificial intelligence chips, which may change the balance of power.\n\nAccording to VanEck's analysis, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is still a major AI provider. The paper also notes as possible substitutes in the AI semiconductor business Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials).\n\nAccording to VanEck, slower demand and surplus supply in non-AI semiconductor sectors cause difficulties in 2024. The research indicates that in 2025 automotive, analog, and smartphone processors might witness developments. VanEck said if demand for driver-assistance systems develops and electric car usage expands, automotive semiconductor demand may climb as well. Companies like Texas Instruments (TXN, Financials) and Analog Devices (ADI, Financials) might potentially gain from market stability in analog and IoT semiconductors, said the research. The research warns that demand for smartphone chips could take more time to revive.\n\nAccording to the research, semiconductor equipment firms and memory might provide prospects. VanEck notes firms that could gain from memory market stability like SK Hynix and Micron Technology (MU, Financials). The paper highlights that artificial intelligence uses are driving growing demand for high-bandwidth memory. According to the research, VanEck also names Lam Research and Applied Materials as businesses that may benefit from investment in semiconductor manufacture.\n\nVanEck says that the semiconductor sector is still cyclical, with changes in competitiveness and inventory swings. The paper warns that market concentration may change depending on the development of in-house artificial intelligence processors by hyperscale companies. According to the paper, investors should take into account balancing other areas with artificial intelligence chips.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn his recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the S&P's best eight-session rally since August. As most stock market gains by then had been due to mega-cap stocks, Cramer shared that \"I do like to see that this is a rally that's not led by\" either Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock that tumbled by 15% on Monday or by the firm responsible for designing the iPhone.\"\n\nIn fact, Cramer was happy that stocks were instead being led higher by sectors that had underperformed lately. One of these is healthcare, and the CNBC host shared his excitement by sharing \"Or how about the drugs? How about the drugs!\" He added \"I mean last week I was at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. And no one liked the drugs! They exploded yesterday!\"\n\nYet, even though the 'drugs were exploding,' Cramer also mentioned other sectors that were having bull markets. According to him \"So what I'm saying is that, many bull markets each day. Banks had a bull market. Drugs had a bull market. Rails had a bull market. I think I love it! . . .This is what I want! Not broad on one day, but broad over time.\"\n\nAs to the reason behind his optimism, Cramer outlined \"I just don't want it to be the same old, same old!\" He was irate over market and media sentiment indicating that multiples of the Magnificent 7 stocks were overstretched. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared \"Like yesterday there was a piece in the FT, I like the FT. But they were talking about how you know, now things are really stretched.\" He believes that the argument that the multiples are overstretched doesn't explain the S&P's rally as \"It's not a Mag 7 rally for heaven's sake. It's not!\"\n\nCramer added, \"Well I just think this is one of those markets where when you have a good quarter, bingo.\" When co-host David Faber asked him why he believed that non-tech sectors were driving the market since technology stocks had done well until that point, Cramer replied and stated \"I'm saying, this particular jaunt is not led by the usual suspects. I said all that stuff.\" He added \"But what I'm saying is that there are other stocks besides tech. That's all I'm saying. And that yesterday was about healthcare. It was about healthcare and it hasn't been about healthcare for a long time. The healthcare stocks, the HMOs were terrific.\"",

The team has developed a system that makes droplet microfluidics faster, lower cost, and more accurate.\n\nDr. Arum Han, the Texas Instruments Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and his lab associates created a technology named NOVAsort (Next-generation Opto-Volume-based Accurate droplet sorter), a system that allows high throughput screening of molecules and cells at significantly reduced error rates.\n\nWhereas previous research has focused on increasing the speed of assays (a type of laboratory test), the team's findings, which are published in Nature Communications, are among the first to significantly improve accuracy without compromising the speed of assays.\n\nIn the fields of biotechnology, health care and chemistry, there is a need to do a large number (millions and billions) of screening or testing of cells and molecules. However, one of droplet microfluidics' biggest limitations, despite its major advantages in rapid testing, is a high degree of error in multi-step droplet operations, which is why this powerful technology has not been widely adopted and commercialized beyond a few very simple assays.\n\n\"Let's say you're a drug developer in the pharmaceutical industry or developing new high-value molecules in the biotechnology industry,\" Han said.\n\n\"You have to test millions of different drug compounds to see whether they are effective against a particular cancer cell, or test millions of different cells one cell at a time to find the most productive cells to develop a good cell strain. In another example, there are countless microorganisms out in the environment, and to find out which one might be most useful, or which one is doing what functions, you have to test millions and millions of individual cells one at a time.\"\n\nConventionally, these experiments must be repeated via a time-consuming and costly process. With Han's error-free NOVAsort technology, droplet microfluidics is poised to become a far more valuable technique in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, in agricultural companies and in scientific research where conducting millions of experiments is crucial and often done manually.\n\n\"If you test ten thousand or a million assays, then a 5% error is a very large number. Our invention significantly reduces the error in this single cell or single molecule level screening in droplet microfluidics, so that\u2014for example\u2014from an error of 5%, now you have an error of 0.01%,\" Han said.\n\n\"Using this method, you can run millions of assays, and still the false positive or false negative is very small. With this new technology, droplet microfluidics becomes an extremely powerful tool.\"\n\nNOVAsort stems from a project Han began in 2019. The goal was to go out into the field and isolate and retrieve soil and water samples to quickly identify potentially harmful microorganisms in those samples. To achieve this, Han and his team developed a technology to test millions of individual bacteria samples.\n\n\"For that project, being fast and highly accurate was crucial because if you have a lot of error-prone results, you can incorrectly classify whether something is harmful or not,\" Han said. \"That was really driving our motivation to develop this technology: to reduce error so that when you go out and test millions and billions of microbes, the error rate is very, very low.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

For example, this technology can be developed to help doctors make the best and most timely intervention strategy against diseases.\n\n\"Let's say someone is infected by a pathogenic microorganism,\" Han said. \"Doctors try an antibiotic treatment, but the frontline of antibiotics don't work. They have to quickly find which drug might be the best antibiotic at what dose to use against difficult-to-treat infectious diseases.\"\n\nSince Han's new technology allows high throughput screening\u2014testing millions of samples in a short time\u2014this also means it can improve the speed and accuracy in the discovery of potential drug candidates with more precise results, including the next generation of cancer, anti-microbial and anti-fungal drugs.\n\nIn addition, this technology can find applications in biomanufacturing, which involves using biological systems to produce valuable products, chemicals and molecules. NOVAsort could accelerate the process of harnessing biological organisms that can produce highly useful molecules.\n\n\"We may be able to develop better drugs, better materials and better chemicals, potentially at a lower cost and that are more environmentally friendly and sustainable,\" Han said.\n\nWith growing interest in computer-aided work such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, NOVAsort could also be used to generate a large amount of high-quality, near-zero error data for researchers.\n\nNOVAsort is a collaboration between Han's NanoBio Systems Lab and medical science expert Dr. Paul de Figueiredo, formerly of the Texas A&M Health Science Center and currently the NextGen Precision Health Endowed Professor at the University of Missouri. They have spent years working together on developing microfluidic technology and applying it to medical and biotechnology research, with further advancements to come.\n\nAll of these microfluidic chips are being fabricated at the AggieFab Nanofabrication Facility, the state-of-the-art cleanroom facility of Texas A&M University.\n\n\"My lab has been working on technological innovation, and the application of this technology is where we collaborate broadly with medical school and biotechnology professionals,\" Han said. \"As for the future of this technology, the goal is to achieve 0% error.\"\n\n\"We are very proud of this work,\" Han added. \"We will continue to improve this technology by building microfluidic chips that can perform very complex experiments and apply this technology in broader ranges of applications to more rapidly conduct research and development, all while keeping error as low as possible. Our focus is innovating the next generation of microfluidic technology.\"\n\nMore information: Han Zhang et al, NOVAsort for error-free droplet microfluidics, Nature Communications (2024).

            "content": "by Steven Leibson\n\nStarting with the development of the world\u2019s first single-chip DSP, the Bell Labs DSP1, Jim Boddie devoted his long career to expanding the world of digital signal processing. His early work in developing signal-processing algorithms on minicomputers with attached array processors led him to cutting-edge signal-processing research at Bell Labs. That work resulted in the development of the DSP1, which AT&T successfully deployed in the 5ESS electronic switch. After the DSP1 project, Boddie held a variety of positions at Bell Labs, AT&T Microelectronics, Lucent Technologies, Agere Systems, and finally StarCore, where he directed the development of increasingly powerful DSP chips. Boddie passed away on December 2, 2024, nearly 20 years after he retired.\n\nBoddie grew up in Tallahassee, a small town in Alabama. He attended Auburn University and graduated in 1971 with a BSEE degree. He then received an MIT fellowship to study for his master\u2019s degree, which he earned in 1973. While at MIT, Boddie worked at the university\u2019s first interdepartmental academic research center, the Research Laboratory of Electronics. His research focused on the psychoacoustics associated with localizing sound sources in 3D space. Boddie then returned to Auburn University in 1973 to work on his PhD.\n\nDuring his PhD work, which focused on speech recognition, Boddie found that he enjoyed teaching at the university level, and he began preparing for a life in academia. Then, he got a phone call from Jim Flanagan, who was the head of the acoustics research department at Bell Labs. Flanagan offered Boddie a slot in the Bell Labs post-doc program, and he accepted the offer. After earning his PhD in 1976, Boddie started working for Bell Labs. His early work there focused on \u201cde-reverberation,\u201d which removed echoes from sound captured by microphones placed in non-ideal locations to make it sound more natural. Boddie developed the digital signal processing techniques needed to massage the reverberations out of the captured sound using a refrigerator-sized array processor controlled by a Data General Eclipse minicomputer, because single-chip DSPs did not yet exist.\n\nDuring this post-doc work, Boddie received an offer to join Bell Labs as a full-time member of the technical staff. He accepted the offer, forgot about his plans for a teaching career, and quickly decided to make a career at Bell Labs. At Bell Labs, Boddie soon met Dan Stanzione, who managed a microprocessor applications group at Bell Labs. He offered Boddie the opportunity to work on a new project that was just getting off the ground: a single-chip DSP.\n\nAT&T\u2019s need for a DSP chip grew out of the company\u2019s extensive use of passive analog filters in its telephone switching equipment. The analog filters were built with resistors, capacitors and inductors, and equipment designers were perpetually faced with the need to fit more filters on a board, to reduce the cost of the filters, and to make the filters more efficient. Switched-capacitor filtering technology grew out of this research.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 1970s, telecommunications was going digital. AT&T\u2019s 4ESS long distance switching system was already being deployed and there was an effort to move digital technology into local switching through the 5ESS switching system, which was under development. Bell Labs was already developing microprocessors during this period, but these early microprocessors did not have the throughput needed for digital signal processing. It was clear that a DSP could become a universal signal-processing element, capable of implementing a variety of filters, equalizers, tone generators, and tone decoders, if a suitable processor could be developed.\n\nAfter one memorable lunch with Dan Stanzione to discuss DSP challenges, Bell Labs research fellow John Thompson developed the architecture for a pipelined processor that would be fast enough to use as a DSP. Stanzione put together a DSP study group to develop a recommendation for the development of a single-chip DSP. The project was approved in 1977, and work on the chip design started in early 1978.\n\nThe DSP development work was done mostly by hand because AT&T had few EDA tools for chip design at the time. Boddie designed the DSP\u2019s ALU logic, including the all-important 16\u00d720-bit pipelined multiplier and 40-bit accumulator. The DSP was developed using 4.5\u03bcm design rules. Design rule checking was done by hand and by running a wafer through the fab to see if the chip worked. When laid out, the ALU consumed 25 percent of the DSP chip\u2019s real estate. The DSP wafer had 137 possible die and some early wafers produced zero usable devices.\n\nAT&T DSP1 die photo, designed using 4.55\u03bcm design rules. The ALU designed by Jim Boddie consumed 25 percent of the die. Image credit: Computer History Museum\n\nEventually the design problems were solved and the Bell Labs DSP1 was the result. Sampling of the DSP1 within AT&T started in 1979. The DSP1 was never offered commercially outside of AT&T. That same year, the DSP1 development team described their work in a paper presented at the 1980 International Solid State Circuits Conference. At that same conference, Takao Nishitani\u2019s DSP development team from NEC (now part of Renesas) delivered a paper describing the NEC \u03bcPD7720 DSP. The DSP era had begun.\n\nBoddie continued working on DSPs and DSP technology for another quarter century. Although he started that work at Bell Laboratories, his work moved to AT&T Microelectronics, then to Lucent Technologies, and finally to Agere Systems as Bell Labs itself moved. Along the way, Boddie became a Bell Labs fellow. During this time, Boddie oversaw the birth of six DSP architectural generations, including the follow-on DSP20 \u2013 a die-shrink version of the 20-bit DSP1 designed with 2.75\u03bcm design rules, the floating-point DSP32, and the fixed-point DSP16.\n\nIn 1998, Boddie became the founding Executive Director of the StarCore Joint Design Center in Atlanta, Georgia. StarCore started in 1998 as a joint venture between Lucent (later Agere) and Motorola. Its mission was to develop DSP IP cores that the partner companies could implement in chips. Infineon joined the StarCore venture in 2002. NXP eventually acquired the StarCore DSP line when it merged with Freescale in 2015. (Freescale was spun out of Motorola\u2019s Semiconductor Products Sector in 2004.) When the StarCore Design Center moved to Austin in 2006, Boddie retired with an immense DSP legacy.\n\nDSPs were once a hot commodity on the IC market. They rescued Texas Instruments from oblivion during the 1980s when the TTL market began to falter. However, single-chip DSPs are no longer the hot new thing, although the need for digital signal processing continues to grow. By the late 1990s, TI, Motorola, and Philips had developed monster DSP processors with VLIW architectures, multiple multiplier/accumulators, and additional function units for special operations such as bit swizzling. However, development of bigger and more powerful standalone DSP chips came to an abrupt halt when a competing chip technology veered out of nowhere and blindsided the DSP vendors. FPGAs crashed the single-chip DSP party at the turn of the millennium when they started to incorporate hardware multiplier/accumulators (MACs).\n\nMost DSP algorithms contain a lot of inherent parallelism that multiple MAC units can exploit. The first FPGA device family to incorporate fast hardware multipliers was the Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA family. In July, 2001, Xilinx announced that it had already shipped $1 million worth of Virtex-II XC2V6000 FPGAs, each with 144 hardened, on-chip 18\u00d718-bit multipliers. That FPGA, the first to incorporate hardware multipliers, could already outperform any single-chip DSP that existed at the time. Today, FPGAs incorporate as many as several thousand hardware multipliers in the form of DSP blocks embedded in the FPGA\u2019s programmable logic fabric. Although the era of single-chip DSPs may have ended, Boddie\u2019s DSP legacy is still in full use.\n\nReferences\n\nComputer History Museum, \u201cAT&T DSP1 Oral History Panel: Daniel Stanzione, Richard Pederson, and James Boddie,\u201d January 16, 2015\n\nJames Boddie, \u201cA Brief History of AT&T\u2019s First Digital Signal Processor,\u201d IEEE Solid State Circuits Magazine, Spring 2017, pp 14-18\n\nDan Stanzione, \u201cDSP Architecture Innovation,\u201d IEEE Solid State Circuits Magazine, Spring 2017, pp 19-20\n\nVictor B Lawrence and Bryan Ackland, \u201cJohn S Thompson,\u201d IEEE Solid State Circuits Magazine, Spring 2017, pp 21-24",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio. The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.",

            "content": "The fact that multiple Texas Instruments Incorporated ( ) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Texas Instruments\n\nThe Senior Vice President of Sales & Marketing, Mark Roberts, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$213 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$187. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.\n\nIn the last year Texas Instruments insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free\n\nTexas Instruments Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Texas Instruments shares. In total, insider Mark Gary sold US$940k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nDoes Texas Instruments Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Texas Instruments insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$212m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Texas Instruments Insiders?\n\nAn insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nOf course Texas Instruments may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -0.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Texas Instruments belongs, has lost 12.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Texas Instruments is expected to post earnings of $1.07 per share, indicating a change of -10.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.42 points to a change of +4.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.50 indicates a change of +19.8% from what Texas Instruments is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Texas Instruments is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).",

            "content": "What would a strategic bitcoin reserve look like in Texas? Two lawmakers have ideas.\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption What does the future of the cryptocurrency market look like under Trump 2.0? The president-elect promised to make America the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet.\u201d\n\nAs the Trump administration explores a U.S. cryptocurrency stockpile, two Texas bills filed this session are looking to be at the forefront of establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve for the state.\n\nThe two bills, one filed by state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, and the other by Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, seek to establish a strategic reserve for the cryptocurrency in the state, allowing corporations and individuals to donate or use bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nLast Thursday, President Donald Trump ordered the creation of a crypto task force to explore new regulations and what a U.S. cryptocurrency stockpile would look like. Instead of waiting on the federal government to establish a nationwide reserve, at least eight states, including Texas, have taken matters into their own hands.\n\nThrough the bills, the state wouldn\u2019t necessarily outright buy bitcoin using taxpayer funds. The bills would, however, create the reserve to be used in emergency situations, for government philanthropic spending and more at the discretion of the Legislature and comptroller.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of a Texas strategic bitcoin reserve (through these bills) is it's primarily driven by donations, and there's really no risk to the Texas taxpayer. It's only a net positive,\u201d said Lee Bratcher, founder and president of Texas Blockchain Council.\n\nWhat would Texas\u2019 bitcoin reserve bills do?\n\nWhile the two bills differ in practice, they both create a strategic reserve for the state to hold the cryptocurrency. They would also allow corporations and Texas residents to donate bitcoin to the state and possibly use it as a form of payment to state agencies.\n\nMajor takeaways from House Bill 1598, filed by Capriglione in December:\n\nEstablishes a strategic bitcoin reserve for Texas.\n\nAllows the state to accept bitcoin in the form of donations from corporations or Texas residents.\n\nWould be separate from the state\u2019s general fund and would be in the custody and discretion of the comptroller.\n\nMinimum five-year holding period for the funds.\n\nBans hostile foreign entities from donating.\n\nAllows the comptroller the option to tell some state agencies they can accept bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, there's no reason not to,\u201d Capriglione told the American-Statesman. \u201cBitcoin has shown that it is easy to use. It's become popular. It's become effective. It's a way to provide independence for individuals to be able to make payments, and it's successful. So why not? Why not allow individuals to have a state accept bitcoin as a form of payment?\u201d\n\nMajor takeaways from Senate Bill 778, filed by Schwertner in January:\n\nEstablishes a strategic bitcoin reserve for Texas.\n\nAllows the state to accept bitcoin in the form of donations from corporations or Texas residents.\n\nBans hostile foreign entities from donating.\n\nWould be separate from the state\u2019s general fund and would be in the custody of the comptroller.\n\nAllows the Legislature to direct the comptroller on how to use, access or report the funds.\n\nNo minimum holding period.\n\nAllows the Legislature to direct the purchasing of bitcoin up to 1% of the general fund.\n\nCreates an advisory oversight committee.\n\n\u201cIt's a well thought-out way of dipping our toe into digital assets and the digital economy,\u201d Schwertner said. \u201cFrom a state perspective, I think it sends a very important message that we support financial solvency and stewardship at the federal level, because we do it here in Texas regarding a balanced budget.\u201d\n\nAlan Orwick, co-founder of Quai Network and CEO of blockchain development company Dominant Strategies, told the American-Statesman he prefers Capriglione\u2019s bill, as he thinks outright purchasing bitcoin is risky.\n\nHe said a more gradual approach is needed. Schwertner\u2019s bill would allow the Legislature the option to purchase bitcoin but does not outright direct the purchase of the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIt could lead to that sort of rush on bitcoin and provide more scrutiny if we're outright buying bitcoin. \u2026 I'm not to say that the Senate approach is completely off the table in terms of the buying, but I do think more of a gradual change from the donations and fees compared to the outright buying,\u201d Orwick said.\n\nThe major differences that Bratcher noticed between the two bills is the minimum holding periods and whether the state would outright purchase bitcoin.\n\nBratcher said the council doesn\u2019t have a preference on the two bills but thinks the state needs to be at the forefront of establishing a bitcoin reserve to hedge inflation and support the state\u2019s economy.\n\nHe told the American-Statesman he likes to think of the cryptocurrency industry like the invention of the microchip by Texas Instruments in 1958.\n\n\u201cThe microchip was invented in Texas by engineers at Texas Instruments, but it was monetized in California,\u201d Bratcher said. \u201cWe want the economic benefit, the tax revenue, the job creation, the investment that will come with this, the digital asset and the wave of digital innovation that's coming through a digital asset reserve, to accrue and to benefit Texans. Not that we don't want that for the rest of the United States, but we want to primarily be working for the benefit of Texans.\u201d\n\nIs it risky? How does this differ from a federal stockpile?\n\nThe discussion of a federal crypto stockpile has been growing in recent years.\n\nThough once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, Trump outlined his intent to create a reserve on the campaign trail and fulfilled a piece of that promise by setting up the task force last week.\n\nHis administration argues that holding bitcoin could hedge against inflation and a weakening dollar. He said in July, \u201cFor too long, our government has violated the cardinal rule that every bitcoiner knows by heart: Never sell your bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMore: President Trump: Executive order part of plan to make U.S. 'crypto capital of the planet'\n\nAccording to crypto tracking firm Arkham Intelligence, the U.S. owns nearly $20 billion worth of bitcoin obtained through legal seizures.\n\nU.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, has argued heavily in favor of establishing a federal reserve, which would probably involve the federal government purchasing bitcoin, though an ideal amount is undetermined. She introduced a bill that would have acquired, over time, 1 million bitcoins to hold for at least 20 years.\n\nSome financial analysts have spoken against a federal cryptocurrency reserve, saying buying and stockpiling bitcoin and other crypto could be too risky or at the detriment of residents and taxpayers.\n\nOrwick said he thinks the state-by-state approach to building reserves is more beneficial because a national policy could cause a run on bitcoin and would make it more volatile.\n\nBratcher, however, said he believes a national reserve would be beneficial and is necessary going into the future. Many financial services institutions, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, have started getting involved in cryptocurrency trading, which he said de-risks it for states and the federal government.\n\nHe thinks states such as Texas filing bills like those from Capriglione and Schwertner would send a message to the federal government.\n\n\u201cNow that the industry is more well-known, more respected, there's policy and regulatory guardrails against things that happened in the past in the digital asset industry that consumers were injured by; those guardrails have come up in a stronger way,\u201d Bratcher said. \u201cI think it's very much de-risked for state governments and for the federal government to get involved and take advantage of this innovation.\u201d\n\nCapriglione said that since the state now has guardrails and safeguards surrounding cryptocurrency trading \u2014 thanks in part to a bill he authored that was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott in 2023 \u2014 the risks have decreased.\n\nHe said the time to establish a reserve for Texas is now.\n\n\u201cIt all has to go together. It has to be liquid, has to be safe, and it has to be valuable,\u201d Capriglione said. \u201cIt has to have some sort of regulation to make sure that the public feels confident in holding those assets, and it has to have sophisticated partners and individuals who see the value of it and have been allowing it to be used in really significant transactions.\u201d",

Also, Monday night\u2019s comments from President Trump that he wants to raise tariffs across the board at \u201cmuch bigger\u201d than 2.5% stoked inflation concerns and weighed on T-notes.

            "content": "The CBC is using a windfall from Google to hire reporters to service 'underserved communities' - but are going into direct competition with community news media publishers in the process.\n\nRecently, Brodie Fenlon general manager and editor in chief of CBC News announced that CBC will dedicate part of the new $7 million in annual funding it will receive from Google under the hiring of up to 30 local journalists in underserved communities, with a focus on Western Canada.\n\nWith newsrooms stretched and strained and others shuttered forever, we should celebrate when new journalism jobs are created. But Mr. Fenlon\u2019s announcement begs three simple questions.\n\nFirst, while I don\u2019t have an MBA, I know how to use a basic calculator, and the math simply doesn\u2019t make sense to me. If you take the $7 million the CBC is entitled to, half of which goes to English language services, and you deduct two per cent \u2013 the maximum administrative fees the Canadian Journalism Collective can deduct \u2013 that leaves $3,430,000. If you divide that number by 30 journalists, you get $114,333 per new journalist.\n\nWhen I saw that I said to myself: shut the front door Mr. Fenlon. You see, the median wage for a journalist in Canada is $31.25 per hour. In other words, that\u2019s about $65,000 a year. So, why is CBC offering nearly double the market rate? Either those journalists are way overpaid or that money is going somewhere else\u2026Sounds like \u2018fuzzy math\u2019, as George W. Bush once said of Al Gore\u2019s economic figures.\n\nSecond, his list of underserved communities includes markets that are getting local coverage from long-existing local media. They are not all news deserts. Banff/Canmore has been served for years with award winning journalism by the Rocky Mountain Outlook. Jasper has two local news outlets including Jasper Fitzhugh. There are dailies in Lethbridge and Medicine Hat. The Red Deer Advocate has been published in that city for more than 100 years. The Lloydminster Source is published by a second-generation publisher. I could go on with many more examples.\n\nWhy is the public broadcaster all of a sudden in expansion mode when the private sector has been serving these markets for generations? Local media is already struggling to compete with Google and Meta for advertising dollars (I literally walk up and down the streets of Blairmore and knock on doors selling ads), and now we have to compete with the CBC?\n\nThird, yes, we need more journalists in Canada, and we need to plug news deserts, but would that $7 million the CBC will receive from Google be better invested by the private sector. Again, I pulled out my trusty Texas Instruments calculator that my mom bought for me when I was in high school. For local community newspapers, that amount of money would allow us to hire more than 150 journalists. This shows how the private sector is much more efficient than the CBC.\n\nFor context, the CBC paid bonuses to 1,194 employees, including over $3.3 million to 45 executives \u2014 averaging more than $73,000 per executive. Those bonuses alone are more than what many of my hardworking readers would earn after an entire year of work.\n\nMy message to Pierre Poilievre and whoever wins the Liberal leadership is this: The Online News Act is desperately needed and it will make a big difference to community newspaper publishers like me who have been devastated by Google and Meta who are like omnivores gorging on every Canadian advertising dollar they can find, but the Act can be made even better by removing the $7 million earmark to the CBC and redirecting those funds to private sector news publishers and broadcasters, which would create even more jobs. Federal leaders need to tell the CBC: Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nLisa Sygutek is owner and publisher of the Crowsnest Pass Herald.",

The midpoint of that range, US$1.05 a share, was well below the US$1.17 that analysts projected on average.\n\nMuch of the electronics industry remains mired in a slump \u2014 contributing to nine consecutive quarters of sales declines at the company.\n\nTexas Instruments\u2019 headquarters in Texas is pictured on Jan. 17. Photo: Bloomberg\n\nManufacturing expenses also have affected profit, Texas Instruments executives said.\n\nTexas Instruments gets the biggest portion of its sales from manufacturers of industrial equipment and vehicles, making its projections a bellwether for much of the global economy.\n\nThree months ago, executives said some of the company\u2019s end markets were showing signs of emerging from an inventory glut, but the rebound has not come as quickly as some investors anticipated.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares fell 7.5 percent to US$185.52 in New York on Friday. That wiped out the stock\u2019s entire gain this year and marked the worst single-day rout since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.\n\nTexas Instruments CEO Haviv Ilan on a conference call with analysts on Thursday said that industrial demand remains slow.\n\n\u201cIndustrial automation and energy infrastructure still haven\u2019t found the bottom,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the automotive segment, growth in China was not as strong as it has been, meaning it cannot offset the expected weakness in other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the bottom yet \u2014 let me be clear,\u201d Ilan said, although the company is seeing \u201cpoints of strength.\u201d\n\nSales would be US$3.74 billion to US$4.06 billion in the first quarter, Texas Instruments said, compared with an estimate of US$3.86 billion.\n\nIn contrast with the disappointing forecast, December quarter results handily beat analysts\u2019 estimates. Although sales fell 1.7 percent to US$4.01 billion, analysts had projected US$3.86 billion. Profit was US$1.30 a share, compared with a prediction of US$1.21 per share.\n\nTexas Instruments is the biggest maker of chips that perform simple but vital functions in a broad range of electronic devices. It is also the first large US chipmaker to report numbers in the current earnings season.\n\nChipmakers in other parts of the world have offered a mixed picture of demand for their products. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (\u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb), Samsung Electronics Co and SK Hynix Inc have pointed to continuing strength in data center products \u2014 helped by the artificial intelligence boom. However, overall growth is still hampered by downturns in other markets, such as smartphones and personal computers.",

Revenues of $4.01 billion also topped consensus expectations by $136 million but fell 1.7% year over year.\n\nThis decline was largely attributed to a significant weakness in the Embedded Processing segment, which accounted for 15.3% of total revenues. While Embedded Processing revenues of $613 million beat estimates of $576 million, they declined a sharp 18% year over year, highlighting ongoing softness in demand.\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Texas Instruments Incorporated Quote\n\nEmbedded Processing: A Drag on TXN\u2019s Growth\n\nTexas Instruments Embedded Processing performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 reflects several underlying challenges. This segment faced a cyclical downturn exacerbated by weakened demand across key end markets, particularly in industrial applications.\n\nOne significant factor was the underutilization of the Lehi factory, which supports a large portion of the Embedded Processing business. Reduced factory loadings, aimed at managing inventory levels, put downward pressure on revenues and margins. Management confirmed that lower capacity utilization disproportionately impacted the profitability of Embedded Processing, further underscoring operational inefficiencies during the quarter.\n\nAdditionally, broader macroeconomic challenges contributed to weaker customer demand. Industrial automation and energy infrastructure markets, key consumers of embedded technologies, struggled to find a bottom, impacting revenue visibility. The slow recovery in global demand for electronics and embedded systems weighed heavily on this segment.\n\nWhile Texas Instruments continues to invest in expanding its Embedded portfolio and transitioning manufacturing operations to in-house facilities, these efforts are still in progress. As a result, the Embedded Processing segment remains in a transitional phase, making it particularly vulnerable to cyclical pressures and operational constraints in the near term.",

            "content": "President Trump must focus on CHIPS act for Texas, U.S. manufacturing success | Opinion\n\nAs President Donald Trump retakes the White House alongside Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress, the roadmap of policy priorities is quickly taking shape. One of his golden opportunities is to strengthen and reclaim the successful CHIPS program, a brainchild of his first administration that has transformed Texas and our national security posture.\n\nWe were proud to lead the Chips for America Act, which was signed into law as part of the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation created programs to bring the production of advanced semiconductors back to American soil after decades of decline. In 2022, we successfully secured funding for the programs in the larger CHIPS & Science Act. Since then, Texas cities, colleges, and universities and companies, including Texas Instruments, Samsung, GlobalWafers, X Fab, IntelliEPI and Sumika, along with thousands of Texas workers, have seen immense benefits.\n\nThe economic rewards from this law were so profound that the Texas Legislature followed suit. In 2023, Gov. Greg Abbott signed the Texas CHIPS Act, which builds on the law to further invest in semiconductor manufacturing capacity and expertise in the Lone Star State. This state law established the Texas Semiconductor Innovation Consortium (TSIC) and the Texas Semiconductor Innovation Fund (TSIF), important, complementary programs that incentivize Texas investment in the semiconductor industry. A recent study indicates the technology industry contributes more than $469 billion to the Texas economy. Today, Texas has the second largest semiconductor workforce in the nation totaling more than 42,000 Texans with more to come thanks to our joint efforts.\n\nAs we see Texas companies, workers and communities benefit from this program, it would be a mistake to forget the impetus for this critical initiative. The vision for these successful programs originated in President Trump\u2019s White House, and it was President Trump\u2019s own national security team that first identified semiconductor chips as a vulnerability in American supply chains. Approximately 92% of the most advanced semiconductors are currently manufactured in Taiwan. Back in 1990, the United States produced nearly 40% of the world\u2019s semiconductors. But by 2021, this figure decreased to 12%, and in 2024, our share represented only 8%. As demand for electronic goods dramatically increased during the pandemic, our supply chain vulnerabilities became more apparent.\n\nIn response to the threat of the Chinese Communist Party, and to address vulnerabilities in U.S. supply chains, the first Trump administration asked Congress to address the chips issue with legislation and we took up this mantle. As part of this effort, President Trump\u2019s team successfully persuaded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to bring their major operations back to the U.S.\n\nFour years later, with President Trump back in the White House and with Republicans in control of Congress, we have an opportunity to refocus the implementation of CHIPS and reclaim rightful credit for its successes. President Biden prioritized partisanship at every turn at the expense of national security during the law\u2019s implementation, from divisive DEI requirements for grant recipients to endless red tape on environmental impact requirements for new projects. The Trump administration can roll back criteria for grant recipients and reprioritize funding for the best and most efficient manufacturing facilities, many of which are in Texas. In addition, by streamlining the stringent regulatory requirements on new projects, America will be better positioned to increase our production capacity for semiconductors at an even faster speed, making sure this critical supply chain is not subject to the whims of our adversaries overseas.\n\nWe cannot let this program that has been so revolutionary for Texas job creators fall by the wayside. While President Biden\u2019s misguided approach to implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act fell short of everything the law could be, we are optimistic that with President Trump back at the helm, Republicans can Make America Great Again by continuing to strengthen our investments in CHIPS.\n\nBy reclaiming CHIPS, President Trump has an opportunity to fulfill a core campaign promise: increase domestic manufacturing and decrease our reliance on China. By continuing to prioritize domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, we can increase manufacturing jobs in the United States and strengthen America\u2019s edge in our strategic competition with China.",

Lonnie attended public schools in the Dallas Independent School District and graduated from North Dallas High in 1956 with honors. He attended Ross Avenue Baptist Church where he participated in many youth activities. Lonnie was an exceptional athlete. He played football and ran track while attending North Dallas High School. He was chosen as the Dallas Morning News High School Football player of the year in 1956. He gained 1105 yards on 141 carries and led the city by scoring 80 points that year. Also in 1956, Lonnie qualified for the State High School Track Meet in both the 180 yard low hurdles and the 120 yard high hurdles. He finished fourth overall in the State High Hurdles that year and played in the 1957 Texas North-South High School Allstar football game. Lonnie received a four-year football scholarship to Rice University in the fall of 1957. He would earn three letters in athletics during his career at Rice and was drafted in the 1961 AFL football draft by the Dallas Texans.\n\nLonnie graduated from Rice University in 1962 with a degree in accounting. He decided to start his business career rather than try to play football in the Pros. He went to work in Houston for a seismic oil exploration manufacturing company as an accountant. While in Houston, Lonnie met Elda Elois (Lois) Clement, a legal secretary at a small Houston law firm. They were married on May 4, 1963, not long after Lonnie graduated. Lois and Lonnie continued to work in their chosen professions in Houston through the birth of their first son, Lyle, in November 1964. In 1966, Lois and Lonnie moved to a suburb of Dallas, where Lonnie took employment as an accountant at Texas Instruments (TI). In May 1970, they welcomed their second son, Lance. This began Lonnie\u2019s fatherly roll as personal coach to his sons in all things athletic, with the occasional assist from his brother Ronnie. In March 1974, Lois and Lonnie welcomed their third child, Leith, fulfilling a need for a plethora of training regimens that would cover football, soccer, baseball and track. In 1977, TI relocated Lonnie to their Houston office. In December 1982, Lonnie\u2019s work returned the family to the Dallas suburb of Rowlett. That is where Lois and Lonnie would complete their earthly service to the Lord and their family. In a house with cranberry knobs on the kitchen cabinetry. Lonnie started teaching at Sunday school at Lake Pointe Church in Rockwall. This solidified his last training regimen for his sons: imparting his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. In June 1990, Lois and Lonnie became grandparents for the first time. In February 2015, they became Great Grandparents for the first time. Their role as intercessory prayer warriors would double and triple and remained that way even through the insidious Alzheimer\u2019s disease that would claim Lois\u2019s earthly life in November 2020. Lonnie is survived by his brother Ronald J. Caddell and his wife Betsy, son Lyle J. Caddell and his wife Cathy, son Lance J. Caddell and his wife Stephanie, son Leith J. Caddell and his wife Angi, and sister-in-law Phyllis Crews. Lonnie has eight grandsons and two granddaughters and two great grandsons and one great granddaughter.",

            "content": "It looks like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Texas Instruments' shares on or after the 31st of January, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 11th of February.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$1.36 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.44 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Texas Instruments has a trailing yield of 2.9% on the current stock price of US$185.52. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Texas Instruments's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Last year Texas Instruments paid out 100% of its profits as dividends to shareholders, suggesting the dividend is not well covered by earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out an unsustainably high 320% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months, which is worrying. Unless there were something in the business we're not grasping, this could signal a risk that the dividend may have to be cut in the future.\n\nCash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Texas Instruments's payments were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we are concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNasdaqGS:TXN Historic Dividend January 26th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's not encouraging to see that Texas Instruments's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share.",

            "content": "High energy costs in the European Union are probably among the main reasons behind the bloc's deindustrialization. Many power-hungry production facilities relocate to Asia because it has become nearly impossible for them to stay competitive with current energy prices. Ireland is not an exception, and this makes Intel very concerned (according to RTE) as it runs its major Fab 34 near Leixlip and has to make sure that the fab produces products at competitive costs. But should Intel really be worried?\n\nIntel's Fab 34 in Ireland is the first production facility in Europe to use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography to make chips in high volumes. The fab is capable of producing microelectronics using Intel 4 (previously known as 7nm) and Intel 3 (formerly known as 5nm) process technologies and currently produces compute tiles for Intel's Core Ultra 1-series (Meteor Lake on Intel 4) and Xeon 6 processors (Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest on Intel 3). These are premium products.\n\nEnergy prices are rising across the world, in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. However, energy prices are considerably higher in Europe when compared to Asia and the U.S. For example, rates per kWh in the U.S. range from 8.57\u00a2 in Texas to 11.41\u00a2 in Oregon to 12.31\u00a2 in Arizona. By contrast, electricity costs in Ireland vary from 15\u00a2 (night rate) to 26\u00a2 (day rate) for commercial customers. In South Korea and Taiwan, electricity for large commercial users costs 13\u00a2 after increases in late 2024. Therefore, it is more expensive to make chips in Ireland than in the U.S. or Taiwan, at least with respect to energy costs.\n\nEnergy Costs\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Arizona Ireland Ohio Oregon South Korea Taiwan Texas kWh rate 12.31 \u00a2 15 \u00a2 - 26 \u00a2 10.94 \u00a2 11.41\u00a2 13 \u00a2 13 \u00a2 8.57\u00a2\n\nElectricity cost source links: Arizona, Ireland, South Korea, Taiwan\n\nWhen it comes to multibillion-dollar semiconductor fabrication facilities, the vast majority of their costs are represented by capital expenditures, depreciation, materials, and labor. Utilities, such as electricity, water, and cooling, account for a relatively small \u2014 single-digit to low double-digit percentage \u2014 of microelectronics production costs, according to some industry estimates.\n\nFor example, Intel consumed around 9.1 billion kWh of electricity in 2023, according to the company's Corporate Responsibility Report (CSR). Intel uses green energy across all of its facilities in the U.S., Europe, Israel, and Asia, so its energy prices are a bit higher than those of average businesses. But if we assume that Intel paid 13\u00a2 per kWh on average, then the company paid approximately $1.183 billion for electricity in 2023. Meanwhile, Intel's total revenue in 2023 was $54.2 billion and its total costs were around $32.5 billion (that includes R&D, CapEx, SG&A, depreciation, etc.).\n\nTherefore, energy accounted for 3.64% of Intel's costs and 2.18% of Intel's product revenue. It is plausible to assume that energy costs account for approximately 5% of Intel's product costs, but that probably depends on actual products. For products like Intel's Xeon 6980P, which sells for over $12,000, the contribution of energy costs is probably negligible.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

In fact, a 'senior source' in Davos told RTE that lower labor costs in Ireland are offset by high energy costs. These high costs stem from delays in renewable energy infrastructure and the fixed expenses of offshore wind farms, which are often passed on to customers, RTE claims. To address this, Intel is advocating for the state to assume part of these costs during the development phase to ease the financial burden on manufacturers like itself, the report says.",

The low-distortion switching from the GaN device reduces torque ripple and motor noise.\n\n\u201cHumanoid robots demand motors with precision and compactness, and the EPC91104 is specifically designed to meet those needs for applications like small joint actuation,\u201d said Alex Lidow, CEO of EPC.\n\nThe design has an optimized PCB layout with a wide input voltage range of 14 V and 80 V to support different battery packs. It is also compatible with microcontroller boards from Microchip, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics and Renesas.\n\nThe board uses the EPC23104 ePower Stage GaN transistor that has a maximum RDS(on) of 11 m\u03a9 and supporting DC bus voltages up to 80 V. The design supports peak currents of up to 14 A steady-state and 20 A pulsed current, ensuring reliable performance for humanoid robot applications that require fine motor control and precision.\n\nThe protection in the design includes overcurrent and input undervoltage protection, ensuring reliability in demanding applications.\n\nFor higher-current requirements, such as elbow and knee motors in humanoid robots, EPC offers the EPC9176 board in the same family. With enhanced current capacity, the EPC9176 complements the EPC91104 to cover a full range of motor drive applications in humanoid robotics. It is equipped with comprehensive sensing and protection features, ensuring rapid prototyping and testing.\n\nThe EPC91104 reference design boards are priced at $780.00. The EPC23104 is priced at $2.50/ea in 3Ku reels.\n\nReference design boards and devices are available for immediate delivery from Digi-Key.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : If you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : eeNews on Google News\n\nShare:",

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street\u2019s superstars tumbled Monday as a competitor from China threatens to upend the artificial-intelligence frenzy they\u2019ve been feasting on.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.5%, dragged down in large part by a 16.9% fall for Nvidia. Other Big Tech stocks also took heavy losses, and they pulled the Nasdaq composite down 3.1% for its worst loss in more than a month.\n\nThe damage was focused on AI-related stocks, while the rest of the market held up much better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289 points, or 0.7%, and the majority of U.S. stocks climbed. But anyone holding an S&P 500 index fund, which are found in many 401(k) accounts, felt the pain because of how influential those tech giants have become on indexes.\n\nThe shock to financial markets came from China, where a company called DeepSeek unveiled a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at potentially a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple\u2019s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat would be particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips.\n\nSkepticism, though, remains about how much DeepSeek\u2019s announcement will ultimately shake the economy that\u2019s built around the AI industry, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centers gobbling up computing power.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,\u201d according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide.\n\nIn Amsterdam, Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML slid 7%. In Tokyo, Japan\u2019s Softbank Group Corp. lost 8.3% to pull closer to where it was before leaping on an announcement trumpeted by the White House that it was joining a partnership to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure.\n\nAnd on Wall Street, Constellation Energy lost more than a fifth of its value, 20.8%. The company has said it would restart the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to supply power for data centers for Microsoft.\n\nAll the worries sent investors toward bonds, which can be safer investments than any stock. The rush pushed the yield of the 10-year Treasury down to 4.52% from 4.62% late Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast.\n\nBefore Monday\u2019s drop, which was its worst since the 2020 COVID crash, Nvidia\u2019s stock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example.\n\nIt was just on Friday that Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg was saying he expects his company to invest up to $65 billion this year and grow its AI teams significantly, while talking up a data center in Louisiana that will be so large it could cover a significant part of Manhattan.\n\nA small group of seven such companies has become so dominant that they alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500\u2019s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. They include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nTheir immense sizes give them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. That\u2019s why many 401(k) holders felt the pain of Nvidia\u2019s drop, even if they didn\u2019t know they owned any Nvidia, so long as they owned a fund that tracks the S&P 500.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 88.96 points to 6,012.28. The Nasdaq composite dropped 612.47 to 19,341.83, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 to 44,713.58.\n\nBrian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, suggested not overreacting to Monday\u2019s sharp swings.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that the news out of China could be overstated and then we could see a reversal of the recent market moves,\u201d Jacobsen said. \u201cIt is also possible that the news is true, but then that would present new investment opportunities.\u201d\n\nMore big swings may be ahead. Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla are all on the schedule this upcoming week to report how much profit they made at the end of 2024.\n\nThe pressure is on companies to keep delivering strong profits, particularly after a recent jump in Treasury yields. When bonds are paying more in interest, they put downward pressure on stock prices. Yields have been on the rise amid a solid U.S. economy and worries about possibly higher inflation coming from tariffs and other policies favored by President Donald Trump.\n\nSo far, big U.S. companies have been reporting better results than analysts expected. AT&T became the latest on Monday, and its stock rose 6.3%.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, movements for broad indexes across Europe and Asia weren\u2019t as forceful as for the big U.S. tech stocks. Stocks edged 0.1% lower in Shanghai after a survey of manufacturers showed export orders in China dropping to a five-month low.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected.

The S&P 500 fell 0.3% on Friday, a day after setting a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%. Worries about profitability at Texas Instruments hurt stocks across the semiconductor industry. But trading was largely quiet through the day, aided by steadiness in the bond market, which has been driving much of the action on Wall Street lately. Treasury yields eased a bit following some worse-than-expected reports on the economy.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 U.S. stocks are edging back from their all-time high on Friday as they close out a second straight winning week.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4% in late trading, a day after setting a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 165 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% lower with a little less than an hour remaining in trading.\n\nTrading remained relatively quiet through the day, aided by steadiness in the bond market, which has been driving much of the action on Wall Street lately. When worries about inflation and the U.S. government\u2019s swelling debt have been on the rise, Treasury yields have climbed and helped knock down stock prices. When concerns ebb, such as after last week\u2019s encouraging update on inflation, yields have eased and helped stocks rise.\n\nA mostly encouraging start to the earnings reporting season for big U.S. companies has also helped prop up the stock market. Even if higher Treasury yields are pushing downward on stock prices, companies can make up for it by delivering bigger profits.\n\n\u201cIf 2024 was the year of the election, 2025 is the year of earnings,\u201d according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \u201cEarnings have been fundamentally improving, but how long can that last and how much can they rise?\u201d\n\nTexas Instruments fell 6.4% despite reporting profit for the latest quarter that topped analysts\u2019 expectations. Showing how much pressure is on companies to keep growing, analysts focused on discouraging signals of how much profit the company is making from each $1 of revenue. That helped drag down stocks across the semiconductor industry.\n\nCSX sank 3.2% even though the railroad delivered a profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts\u2019 expectations. Its revenue for the last three months of 2024 just missed analysts\u2019 forecasts as it dealt with the effects of hurricanes.\n\nOn the winning side of Wall Street were Novo Nordisk\u2019s U.S.-listed shares, which jumped 8.2%. The Danish company reported results from a clinical trial of a treatment for people who are overweight or obese, which could mean bigger profits in the future.\n\nNextEra Energy climbed 6.7% after the owner of the Florida Power & Light utility reported profit for the latest quarter that was slightly above expectations. CEO John Ketchum said his company is benefiting from increased demand for electricity and \u201cwe will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 20277, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.\u201d\n\nVerizon Communications rose 1.2%. It delivered results for the latest quarter that edged past analysts\u2019 expectations, benefiting in part from price increases imposed in recent quarters, and unveiled a strategy to help businesses use artificial intelligence.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.62% from 4.65% late Thursday. Other yields also pulled lower following a couple reports on the U.S. economy that came in worse than expected.\n\nOne said sentiment among U.S. consumers is weaker than economists had forecast and fell in January for the first time in six months. The drops were widespread, carrying across incomes, wealth and age groups, according to Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan.\n\nA separate preliminary report suggested U.S. business activity is also weaker than expected, with its growth slowing. A third, potentially more encouraging report said sales of previously occupied homes were slightly stronger last month than expected. That capped the weakest year for such sales since 1995.\n\nTraders don\u2019t expect the weak data to push the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate at its meeting next week. They\u2019re virtually certain it will hold steady, according to data from CME Group.\n\nIf they\u2019re correct, it would be the first meeting the Fed has done so since it began lowering the federal funds rate in September to take pressure off the U.S. economy. Lower rates can goose prices for investments, but they can also give inflation more fuel. And worries have been rising about stubborn inflation, as well as the effects of potential tariffs and other policies championed by President Donald Trump.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia.\n\nTokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 edged down by 0.1% after the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate to about 0.5% from 0.25%, as widely expected. It is the highest level for the rate since 2008, as the Bank of Japan shifts out of a long spell of extreme low interest rates meant to spur more borrowing and spending.\n\nStocks jumped 1.9% in Hong Kong and 0.7% in Shanghai for some of the bigger moves in global markets.",

The gains stood at 1.7% for the week ended January 24, making it the best first after a President's inauguration since 1985 when Ronald Reagan took over the Oval Office at the White House.\n\n2 / 6\n\nThe dollar wrapped up its worst week in 14 months as currency traders grapple with lots of tariff talk, with no real action, from President Donald Trump. \"The dollar is rich, interest rates are high and both are ripe for a correction,\u201d Matthew Hornbach, Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of macro strategy, said Friday on Bloomberg Television. The CME Fedwatch Tool shows that markets are expecting a 99% chance of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in February 2025. The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.62%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.5%.\n\n3 / 6\n\nCrude oil prices posted their first weekly decline this year after President Donald Trump threatened trade wars and demanded OPEC+ lower crude prices. West Texas Intermediate settled little changed above $74 a barrel. Earlier on Friday, crude extended losses after Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated he\u2019s open to discussing Ukraine and oil prices after Trump had threatened more penalties on Moscow if Putin doesn\u2019t \u201cmake a deal\u201d to end the prolonged war in Ukraine. In his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said Saudi Arabia bringing prices down would force Putin to withdraw from the Ukraine war.\n\n4 / 6\n\nSix of the 11 S&P500 industry sectors rose, with utilities up 1.05% and leading gains. The sector's biggest advancer, NextEra Energy Inc, rose about 6%, the S&P 500's biggest gainer on the day. Tech was the biggest sector loser, down 1.33%, led by chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc which put out a disappointing forecast, which fell 7.1%. Meta Platforms Inc. climbed on plans to invest as much as $65 billion on AI projects in 2025. Cryptocurrency-linked firms rallied following Trump\u2019s executive order favoring the industry. Nvidia Corp. led losses in big tech. Boeing shares fell 1.4% after the plane maker warned of another quarterly loss ahead of its earnings on Tuesday (Jan 28).\n\n5 / 6\n\nWall Street also waded through a slew of economic data on Friday, with the highlight being a drop in US consumer sentiment for the first time in six months. Consumers expect prices will climb at an annual rate of 3.2% over the next five to 10 years. They see costs rising 3.3% over the next year, the highest since May. Meanwhile, an S&P Global survey showed business activity slowing to a ninth-month low in January as prices rose. FILE PHOTO: REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo\n\n6 / 6",

The move came a day after the company\u2019s disappointing profit forecast stoked concerns that the analog chip market could face a slower recovery than anticipated.\n\nShares of Microchip Technology (MCHP), Analog Devices (ADI), Onsemi (ON) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), also lost ground, with the tech sector dragging the benchmark index lower. The S&P 500 was down 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.5%.\n\nJefferies analysts said Texas Instruments' outlook dashed hopes it would signal a recovery and indicated the cycle may not have reached a bottom, with the auto segment \"still correcting further and no signs of Industrial recovery yet.\u201d Over 70% of Texas Instruments\u2019 products are sold into auto and industrial end markets, according to Jefferies.\n\nThe analysts suggested a recovery for the analog segment could still come later this year or next, but warned Texas Instruments\u2019 spending and growing inventories could prove more significant headwinds than anticipated, pressuring margins. Jefferies maintained a \u201chold\u201d rating and $185 price target for the stock.\n\nMorningstar Strategist Brian Colello, who raised his price target to $185 from $175, called it \u201ca bit of a near-term reckoning\u201d for Texas Instruments after several quarters of inventory buildup, but said he remains confident in the company\u2019s trajectory, adding that its investments in higher-margin chips could pay off in the longer term.\n\nSeven of the 12 analysts polled by Visible Alpha gave the stock a \u201chold\u201d rating as of Friday, while three gave it a \u201cbuy\u201d and two held \u201csell\u201d ratings.

The midpoint of that range, $1.05 a share, was well below the $1.17 that analysts projected on average.\n\nMuch of the electronics industry remains mired in a slump \u2014 contributing to nine straight quarters of sales declines at the company. Manufacturing expenses also have affected profit, Texas Instruments executives said.\n\nTexas Instruments gets the biggest portion of its sales from manufacturers of industrial equipment and vehicles, making its projections a bellwether for much of the global economy. Three months ago, executives said some of the company\u2019s end markets were showing signs of emerging from an inventory glut, but the rebound hasn\u2019t come as quickly as some investors anticipated.\n\n\u201cWhile industrial was better than our expectation, management refused to call the bottom as they continue to note an uneven recovery across different subsegments,\u201d Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a note.\n\nThe shares fell 7.5% to $185.52 in New York on Friday. That wiped out the stock\u2019s entire 2025 gain and marked the worst single-day rout since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020. Texas Instruments had increased about 7% this year through Thursday\u2019s close.\n\nChief Executive Officer Haviv Ilan said Thursday that industrial demand remains slow. \u201cIndustrial automation and energy infrastructure still haven\u2019t found the bottom,\u201d he said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nIn the automotive segment, growth in China wasn\u2019t as strong as it has been, meaning it can\u2019t offset the expected weakness in other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the bottom yet \u2014 let me be clear,\u201d Ilan said, though the company is seeing \u201cpoints of strength.\u201d\n\nSales will be $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion in the first quarter, Texas Instruments said, compared with an estimate of $3.86 billion.\n\nIn contrast with the disappointing forecast, fourth-quarter results handily beat analysts\u2019 estimates. Though sales fell 1.7% to $4.01 billion, analysts had projected $3.86 billion. Profit was $1.30 a share, compared with a prediction of $1.21 per share.",

But it won't,\" he said. \"It's content to remain as it is. It's just not content with the critics.\"\n\nDespite beating on earnings and revenue, Texas Instruments failed to impress when it reported Thursday, with Wall Street disappointed by its earnings forecast for the current quarter. The chip maker predicted 94 cents to $1.16 a share, compared with an average estimate of $1.17 per share, according to LSEG. By Friday's close, the stock was down more than 7%.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAccording to Cramer, Texas Instruments \"feels like a relic,\" as it makes great industrial and auto chips, which account for 70% of its revenue, according to Bloomberg. Both of those markets are currently in a slump, and while Cramer said they could see a boost if the Federal Reserve cuts rates, that's not a guarantee. He argued that the company makes the best of chips in its targeted markets, but said that's not enough for investors.\n\nIf Texas Instruments were a private company, this focus on autos and industrials might not be an issue, Cramer continued. But right now, the company isn't serving shareholders as they expect it to do, he said. He compared Texas Instruments to peer Micron, saying that company was able to successfully expand its focus from commodity chips to high bandwidth memory chips for the data center.\n\n\"Texas Instruments \u2026 doesn't' seem to care if you don't like them,\" Cramer said. \"So, there's no reason to own the stock, unless you think that the company's really going to take itself private or put itself up for sale, and I don't think they're going to do that.\"\n\nTexas Instruments did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nClick here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.\n\nSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations).\n\nWe believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.\n\nReconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Years Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nChange Cash flow from operations (GAAP)*\n\n$ 6,318\n\n$ 6,420\n\n(2) % Capital expenditures\n\n\n\n(4,820)\n\n\n\n(5,071)\n\n\n\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)\n\n$ 1,498\n\n$ 1,349\n\n11 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n$ 15,641\n\n$ 17,519\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue (GAAP)\n\n\n\n40.4 %\n\n\n\n36.6 %\n\n\n\nFree cash flow as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP)\n\n\n\n9.6 %\n\n\n\n7.7 %\n\n\n\n\n\n* Includes a cash benefit of $588 million from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act ITC used to reduce income taxes payable for 2024.\n\nThis release also includes references to operating taxes, a non-GAAP term we use to describe taxes calculated using the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term operating taxes helps to differentiate from effective taxes, which include discrete tax items.\n\nNotice regarding forward-looking statements\n\nThis release includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as TI or its management \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"foresees,\" \"forecasts,\" \"estimates\" or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements herein that describe TI's business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements.

            "content": "Texas Instruments announced fourth-quarter earnings above expectations, but highlighted challenges with declining revenues year-over-year.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN 1.62%), a leading semiconductor company known for its Analog and Embedded Processing products, unveiled its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results on January 23.\n\nThe company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.21. Revenue was $4.01 billion, beating expectations of $3.88 billion.\n\nDespite exceeding projections, year-over-year comparisons show a revenue decline of 1.7%, which indicates a challenging quarter.\n\nMetric Q4 2024 Q4 Estimate Q4 2023 Y/Y Change EPS $1.30 $1.21 $1.49 (12.8%) Revenue $4.01B $3.88B $4.08B (1.7%) Operating Profit $1.38B - $1.53B (10.2%) Net Income $1.21B - $1.37B (12.1%) Free Cash Flow $806M - $1.35B (40.3%)\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nFounded in 1930, Texas Instruments (TI) is a major player in the semiconductor industry. It primarily generates revenue from two segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. The Analog segment contributed 77% of its full-year revenue in 2024, leveraging an advanced 300mm wafer fabrication process to reduce production costs by around 40% compared to older technology. Strategic advantages like the in-house manufacturing facilities have helped TI maintain strong manufacturing capabilities and manage supply chain controls.\n\nOver the last year, TI has concentrated on capital allocation to ensure steady free cash flow. This focus includes investments in research and development (R&D) and the growth of manufacturing capacity. Additionally, the company emphasizes maintaining strong direct customer relationships, supported by its online platform, TI.com. Its commitment to sustainable practices aligns with regulatory standards and benefits both the environment and its reputation.\n\nQuarterly Highlights\n\nThe fourth quarter posed notable challenges for Texas Instruments, particularly with its Embedded Processing segment, which saw a significant 18% revenue decline to $613 million. Despite this, the Analog segment saw modest growth of 2%, providing some stability amidst difficulties. Additionally, revenue from the \"Other\" category grew by 7%, indicating areas of resilience.\n\nThe company's earnings release noted solid demand in China for automotive electronics, hinting at pockets of market strength. Nevertheless, TI grappled with operational challenges, such as managing increased inventory levels, currently at $4.5 billion. That's 244 days of inventory, up from 225 days in the year-ago quarter, possibly reflecting demand forecasting issues. Operating profit decreased by 10% year-over-year, consistent with pressures on the bottom line in a competitive market.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, TI continued to prioritize shareholder returns. Over the past year, it distributed $5.7 billion through dividends and share buybacks. Dividends saw a 5% increase, marking the 21st consecutive year of rises. These capital returns are a tribute to its focus on optimizing long-term financial performance.\n\nOne-time events that influenced financials include benefits from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which provided free cash flow support and reflected financially in the shareholder returns. The company's capital allocation strategy further underscores its commitment to maintaining a competitive position in an evolving industry landscape.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nLooking ahead to the first quarter of 2025, Texas Instruments anticipates revenue between $3.74 billion and $4.06 billion, with EPS expected to range from $0.94 to $1.16. Management maintains a projected effective tax rate around 12%. While this outlook suggests an understanding of market conditions, it highlights anticipated softening in the short term, aligned with previous challenges in the Embedded Processing segment.\n\nInvestors should observe TI's ongoing efforts to leverage its competitive manufacturing advantages and commitment to sustainability and technology advancement. Its focus on strengthening customer channels and managing costs could be pivotal in navigating the current market dynamics. As the company implements its strategic plan, the potential recovery in target markets like automotive and industrial could play a critical role in shaping future performance.",

Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was better than expected at $3.9 billion at the midpoint, 1.3% above analysts\u2019 estimates.

Find out in our full research report.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Q4 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $4.01 billion vs analyst estimates of $3.87 billion (1.7% year-on-year decline, 3.5% beat)\n\nAdjusted EPS: $1.30 vs analyst estimates of $1.20 (8.3% beat)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: $1.87 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.76 billion (46.7% margin, 6.5% beat)\n\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2025 is $3.9 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $3.85 billion\n\nEPS (GAAP) guidance for Q1 CY2025 is $1.05 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 10%\n\nOperating Margin: 34.4%, down from 37.6% in the same quarter last year\n\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 20.1%, up from 19% in the same quarter last year\n\nInventory Days Outstanding: 243, up from 233 in the previous quarter\n\nMarket Capitalization: $179.8 billion\n\nCompany Overview\n\nHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas since the 1950s, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the world\u2019s largest producer of analog semiconductors.\n\nAnalog Semiconductors\n\nDemand for analog chips is generally linked to the overall level of economic growth, as analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment. Unlike digital chip designers, analog chip makers tend to produce the majority of their own chips, as analog chip production does not require expensive leading edge nodes. Less dependent on major secular growth drivers, analog product cycles are much longer, often 5-7 years.\n\nSales Growth\n\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Unfortunately, Texas Instruments\u2019s 1.7% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This was below our standards and is a tough starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n\nTexas Instruments Quarterly Revenue\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Texas Instruments\u2019s history shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 11.6% annually.",

TXN stock, at $195.23, just shy of its 50-day SMA of $196.34 and its 200-day SMA of $195.40.\n\nWhile the stock has shown slight buying pressure, its MACD indicator at a negative 0.32 suggests weakening momentum. If the technicals align post-earnings, the Death Cross could confirm a longer-term downtrend.\n\nQ4 Earnings: A Make-Or-Break Moment\n\nWall Street expects fourth quarter EPS of $1.20 on revenue of $3.87 billion, per Benzinga Pro data.\n\nWith semiconductor peers showing mixed results, investors will be watching closely for any forward guidance that might sway sentiment.\n\nA strong report could invalidate bearish technical signals, but any disappointment may reinforce the downward trajectory.\n\nStrategic Strength Vs. Market Weakness\n\nDespite near-term uncertainty, Texas Instruments's long-term fundamentals remain solid. The company's push into 300mm manufacturing expansion aims to drive efficiency and cost competitiveness.\n\nMeanwhile, strength in its automotive segment, particularly in China's EV market, has helped cushion industrial sector weakness. But with peak-to-trough industrial declines exceeding 30%, the earnings call must address whether automotive strength is enough to offset broader demand concerns.\n\nInvestor Outlook: Volatility Ahead?\n\nFor now, TXN stock remains at a technical tipping point. If earnings surprise to the upside, the stock could shake off Death Cross fears.\n\nBut if guidance disappoints, the bearish setup could accelerate selling pressure. Traders may find opportunities in the volatility, while long-term investors might wait for a clearer technical confirmation before making a move.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

Mary's journey, which began in Los Angeles, California on June 20th, 1939, was marked by boundless enthusiasm and a zest for life that inspired all who knew her.\n\nIn the 1960's, she was the Leader of troops of both Blue Birds and CampFire Girls, all while continuing her college studies and riding to her classes on a motorcycle. Graduating with a degree in Computer Science from UTD in 1978, Mary pursued her career with intelligence and resilience. Her hardworking spirit and optimistic outlook endeared her to colleagues and friends alike. Mary retired in 91\u2019 from Texas Instruments.\n\nShe was a member of the First United Methodist Church of Richardson for 53 years, singing in the Chancel Choir the last 23 years. The Choir sang in many cathedrals in Europe, including St Peter's in Rome, the cathedral in Charts, France, St Mary's in Dublin, Ireland, and Cologne cathedral in Germany.\n\nMary's passion for Travel and Outdoor Activities took her around the globe. She relished running marathons worldwide and completed over 50 of them including the Boston Marathon five times, Paris (France) Marathon twice and the Jackson 50 (50 miles) Marathon, often accompanied by her loving family, creating unforgettable memories cherished by all. Her adventurous spirit and kind nature made every journey a joyful experience.\n\nMary was the heart of her family, deeply loved by her spouse Earl Kennard, and her children Marie Kennard, Chris Kennard (Annette), Lyndel Vargas, and stepson Rick Schmitt. She was a proud grandmother to Shelby (Brian), Jamie, and Blayne, and a doting great-grandmother to Kai and Koa. Mary's warm and generous spirit touched each member of her family, creating bonds that would last a lifetime.\n\nHer vibrant personality was marked by her key traits: Resilient, Intelligent, Hardworking, Optimistic, and Kind. These qualities not only defined her life but also served as a beacon to those around her, inspiring many to pursue their dreams with courage and joy.\n\nMary's legacy is one of love, adventure, and unwavering optimism. Though she passed away in Allen, Texas on January 22nd, 2025, her spirit lives on in the hearts of all who knew her.\n\nWe invite friends and family to join us in celebrating her extraordinary life.\n\nThe service will be on February 13th at 4pm. Location is the First United Methodist Church of Richardson.",

Specifically, the CHIPS Act allotted at least $2 billion in funding for legacy semiconductors.\n\nWhile the Trump administration will likely focus on investments aimed at piercing the moat of Taiwan\u2019s dominance in chip manufacturing, the $2 billion in funding for companies like TXN will remain in place via the legislation. This funding will likely continue to benefit TXN over at least the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do analysts expect?\n\nAnalysts, according to TradingView, anticipate TXN will report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.21 on $3.9 billion in revenue. That would put EPS below last year\u2019s $1.49 per share, and revenue below last year\u2019s $4.08 billion.\n\nLast quarter, TXN reported EPS of $1.47 on $4.15 billion in revenue. Notably, TXN has beaten EPS estimates in four of the last four quarters, while missing revenue expectations just once.\n\nCurrently, 38 analysts offering a rating on TXN, with 10 holding a strong buy rating, two offering a buy rating, 22 with a hold rating, one with a sell rating and three with a strong sell rating. The consensus among these 38 ratings is neutral, according to TradingView.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading TXN earnings\n\nFrom Jan. 1, TXN stock has risen nearly 5%, which compares to the S&P 500\u2019s gain of 2.8% over the same time frame. That said, it appears TXN has some positive momentum in 2025 so far. A broader rally in stocks after President Trump\u2019s inauguration could help to bolster TXN higher via broader bullish vibes in market sentiment.\n\nStill, the stock is trading about 10% below its swing high of 220.39 from Nov. 8. It would need to rally nearly 13% to recapture that high.\n\nThe expected move for TXN\u2019s earnings per the options market stands at +/- 12 points, or 6.1% of today\u2019s 196.41 stock price. If the company delivers a positive earnings report, it could close the gap to the November high by about half and put it on track to retest those levels over the next few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. @fxwestwater\n\nFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\n\nTrade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive, Inc. and tastytrade, Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.",

            "content": "China countermeasures target US mature process chips, TI underfire\n\nIn response to US sanctions and subsidies benefiting American chipmakers, China has announced countermeasures targeting the industry. Among the few American companies dominating this space, Texas Instruments (TI) stands at the forefront of China's investigation.\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce claims US imports are undermining China's mature process chip industry. It particularly focuses on companies gaining an \"unfair competitive advantage\" through subsidies and government support, hindering the growth of domestic manufacturers.\n\nTI's strong domestic manufacturing footprint\n\nTI is one of the few American companies with robust domestic manufacturing capabilities. Having secured support from the CHIPS Act, the company has become a prime candidate for scrutiny under China's Ministry of Commerce. This positions TI firmly in the subsidized US mature process chip manufacturers category that the ministry claims is gaining an \"unfair competitive advantage\" through US government support.\n\nMarket dominance through strategic pricing\n\nTI has built its reputation on strategic pricing approaches, particularly in the analog integrated circuit (IC) market. While the industry witnessed widespread price reductions on analog ICs in recent years, TI demonstrated remarkable resilience, maintaining a strong market position despite intense competition. Industry experts note that TI has consistently outperformed many local manufacturers in China's highly competitive semiconductor market.\n\nScope of China's investigation remains unclear\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce has launched an investigation into US mature process chips, though specific regulations or restrictions remain unannounced. The investigation's precise focus and potential policy implications are still developing. This probe could significantly influence future trade dynamics between the two nations.\n\nPotential impact on TI's operations\n\nIf China implements restrictions targeting TI, their effectiveness will face scrutiny. Industry experts emphasize that TI's analog ICs command market preference due to their reliable supply chains, technical superiority, and comprehensive after-sales support. Consequently, Chinese automakers and industrial sectors may struggle to reduce their dependence on TI's products.\n\nEvolving market dynamics\n\nWhile European and Japanese IDM giants have established substantial local production capacity in the Chinese market, TI's position remains vulnerable. Nevertheless, TI continues to pursue expansion in China despite the challenging business environment.\n\nGrowth sectors drive demand\n\nChina's electric vehicle, energy storage, and industrial sectors, coupled with emerging AIoT applications, continue to generate strong demand for IDM products. However, these foreign IDMs create significant competition for local Chinese analog IC manufacturers, intensifying market pressures.\n\nNew battleground in US-China tech rivalry\n\nThe semiconductor competition between China and the US has expanded beyond advanced processes to encompass mature technologies, creating more complex dynamics than previous confrontations. Chinese mature process products will likely encounter barriers entering the US market, while the impact of countermeasures on American IDMs operating in China remains a critical development to watch in 2025.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Undervalued Chip Stocks Near 52-Week Lows. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against the other undervalued chip stocks.\n\nEnergy and EV stocks continue to be in focus as Donald Trump signs a bunch of executive orders that will have far-reaching impacts on many industries. He even revoked an executive order related to AI, though it addresses a matter that may not directly impact a company\u2019s sales in the near term. AI stocks are going under the radar for a few weeks but with earnings season about to get into full gear, we may not have the same opportunities in a couple of weeks that we have now.\n\nMany of the chip stocks continue to stay undervalued. The main reason is the lack of demand in the niche industries that these companies serve. But this demand will eventually shift at some point in 2025, which is what makes them so attractive to consider at this point.\n\nWe came up with 10 stocks that we believe are undervalued, near their 52-week lows, and present good investment opportunities. To come up with the 10 undervalued chip stocks that are near 52-week lows, we only considered stocks with a market cap of between $10 billion and $200 billion that hit their 52-week lows recently.\n\nClose-up of Silicon Die are being Extracted from Semiconductor Wafer and Attached to Substrate by Pick and Place Machine. Computer Chip Manufacturing at Fab. Semiconductor Packaging Process.\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nWhen the CHIPS ACT was introduced by the Biden government in Aug 2022, Texas Instruments was considered one of the biggest beneficiaries. The company doubled down on expansions on the back of this government support and built capacity it wouldn\u2019t even need in the next 5 years. This didn\u2019t sit well with some investors and the company even had to deal with an activist investor along the way. More than two years later, the company\u2019s stock price stands exactly where it was when the legislation was introduced.\n\nThe stock\u2019s returns since 2021 are dismal. The company\u2019s management has to take part of the blame, as it prioritized expansions at the expense of shareholder value. The long-term value generated by the company\u2019s plans is clearly not being respected by the shareholders. This could change soon though. Donald Trump\u2019s Secretary of Commerce pick has made clear that the CHIPS ACT will continue during the Trump government. There is a concern that the scheme may be paused for reconsideration. Intel and Samsung are two companies that have fared even worse than TXN and don\u2019t have a very optimistic outlook. So the money may be diverted to companies that can use it better.\n\nTXN has so far received $1.6 billion under the CHIPS ACT and if that continues, the company won\u2019t have any issue materializing its grand expansion plans. The company is building 4 fabs in Sherman Texas, the first of which will be production-ready this year. When the effects of that trickle down to the bottom line, investors will be happy to price in the next 3 fabs as well, and with it, a sizable chunk of the future growth too, making it an attractive buy at these levels.\n\nOverall TXN ranks 9th on our list of the undervalued chip stocks near 52-week lows. While we acknowledge the potential of TXN as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as TXN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI \u2014 Buy rating with a price target of $255.\n\n\u2014 Buy rating with a price target of $255.

Analog Devices Inc ADI \u2014 Buy rating with a price target of $265.\n\nArya noted that sentiment is slightly negative compared to last quarter. He added that short-term turbulence can be supplanted by a \u201crotation into cyclicals\u201d during the second half of 2025.\n\nArya is still concerned about trade relations between the U.S. and China.\n\n\u201cChina is also an emerging risk, where growing trailing-edge capability means intensifying competition in low-end/non-core markets for vendors which could drive pricing down,\u201d Arya wrote. \u201cFallout from any trade war retaliation could force a reset of estimates.\u201d\n\nSee Also: The \u2018Witch of Wall Street\u2019s\u2019 Timeless Investment Wisdom\n\nTexas Instruments: The analyst\u2019s Neutral rating for Texas Instruments is linked to another possible cut to estimates in the short term. Arya expects a business \u201ctrough\u201d during the year\u2019s first half based on waning automotive demand. The analyst also noted the company\u2019s business in China.\n\n\u201cTXN is the largest vendor among diversified peers and has relatively high China exposure (20% of sales vs. 10-\n\n35% for peers). Both the company and our checks suggest TXN is using aggressive pricing as a lever to preserve share.\u201d\n\nBank of America\u2019s expectations for fourth-quarter earnings are in line with consensus.\n\nNXP: Arya cited strong margins, relatively low market valuation, fast growth and an \u201cinevitable\u201d automotive recovery as the rationale for his Buy rating for NXP.\n\nAmid expectations for underperformance in the first half of the year, Arya expects NXP to endure a \u201cshallower\u201d downcycle than its peers.\n\nON: The analyst\u2019s revenue expectations for ON in the fourth quarter fall slightly below Wall Street consensus estimates.\n\nStill, Arya is optimistic for the year\u2019s second half, citing the company\u2019s advantage in electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cIn Auto, recent China strength may be reflecting pull-in ahead of tariffs while 2H\u201924 EV ramps in Europe fell below expected volumes. Industrial faces headwinds from worsening macros in Europe/China and may have not corrected enough (-30% peak-to-trough decline to date vs. at least -40% for peers),\u201d the analyst said.\n\nMicrochip: Arya cites CEO uncertainty, inventory pile-up, and operational restructuring efforts as reasons for his pessimism in Microchip Technology. The analyst expects revenue and pro forma earnings-per-share to fall below consensus expectations in the fourth quarter.\n\nArya says that shares look expensive at current valuations with possibly significant downside in the long run.\n\nAnalog Devices: The analyst expects Analog Devices to report revenue and pro forma earnings-per-share around Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\n\nArya cited the company\u2019s differentiated precision analog portfolio as support for a possible turnaround in the second half of the year.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pinned at $1.19 per share, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 20.1%.\n\n\n\nThe company anticipates revenues between $3.70 billion and $4 billion for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.86 billion, suggesting a drop of 5.4% from the year-ago period's reported figure.\n\n\n\nTXN\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 7.1%.\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Texas Instruments Incorporated Quote\n\nFactors to Consider for TXN\n\nTexas Instruments' rising manufacturing costs due to planned capacity expansions and decreased factory loadings are likely to have been a major headwind for the company\u2019s business in the quarter-to-be reported.\n\n\n\nIt is anticipated that a declining demand environment, mostly brought on by customers cutting back on inventory, is likely to have a detrimental effect on the Analog and Embedded Processing segments' performance during the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog revenues is pegged at $3.05 billion, suggesting a decline of 2.2% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for Embedded Processing revenues is pinned at $576 million, indicating a fall of 23.4% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s actual.\n\n\n\nAlso, the automotive segment is likely to suffer in the fourth quarter. Strength in China is persistent and visible from the adoption of electric vehicles, which won\u2019t suffice the segment's performance across regions and markets. Nonetheless, the top-line growth was probably aided by the recovery of communication equipment, the strength of personal electronics and enterprise systems.\n\n\n\nIt is anticipated that Texas Instruments' performance during the to-be-reported quarter was significantly influenced by its robust investments in growth avenues, such as manufacturing, technology and product portfolio expansion.\n\nWhat Our Proven Model Says for TXN\u2019s Q4 Earnings\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Texas Instruments this time. According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that\u2019s not the case here.",

Along with this, the market size has been validated using both top-down and bottom-up approaches.\n\nMarket Definition A retimer is a specialized electronic device that regenerates digital signals by extracting the embedded clock, recovering the data, and retransmitting a fresh copy with a clean clock. It amplifies the signal, reshapes it, and ensures data integrity over long distances or through channels with high attenuation. A retimer extracts the embedded clock from the incoming data stream, which allows it to synchronize the timing of the data signals accurately. They enhance the quality of the signal by compensating for losses and distortions that occur during transmission. This includes equalization functions that help restore the amplitude and clarity of the signal, making it suitable for high-speed applications. They are designed to be aware of the communication protocols they are handling, enabling them to adapt to various standards such as PCIe, USB4, and others. This feature allows for automatic configuration and optimization of the signal transmission without manual tuning, simplifying system integration. Unlike simple redrivers that amplify signals (including noise), they recreate the original signal by generating a clean copy, which helps maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio. This process is crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially at higher data rates where noise can significantly impact performance.

            "content": "Donald Trump and his backers were hardly fans of the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act during the election campaign, yet the next U.S. government does not plan to reverse it. At least, that's the impression the next U.S. Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, gave to outgoing Secretary Gina Raimondo, Bloomberg reports.\n\nBefore the election, Trump criticized the CHIPS Act, labeling it highly flawed and proposing tariffs as an alternative. But Lutnick, his chosen appointee for the position who will inherit program management from Raimondo, has indicated that he plans to continue with its implementation.\n\nIn a recent meeting with Raimondo, Lutnick expressed his commitment to the CHIPS and Science initiative, according to remarks Raimondo shared during a staff gathering last week, published by Bloomberg. Neither the Commerce Department nor Trump's transition team, responded when asked for clarification.\n\nThe $52 billion CHIPS and Science Act, launched under President Joe Biden to revitalize U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, is now transitioning to Donald Trump's administration. With $39 billion in grants already allocated and over $450 billion in private investments spurred, the program does not seem like a failure. Indeed, its progress is evident: Intel, GlobalFoundries, TSMC, Texas Instruments, and Samsung Foundry are building massive fabs in the U.S. While both Intel and Samsung faced some setbacks, both are committed to invest in America.\n\nBut while the new Commerce Secretary reportedly plans to continue the CHIPS and Science program, other people in Trump's team are not very fond of the initiative.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who is going to co-lead Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) presidential advisory commission with Elon Musk next year, criticized the Biden administration's approach to distributing multi-billion grants to semiconductor manufacturers weeks before Biden's tenancy is over, reports Politico. He called the action 'inappropriate' ahead of the power transition and threatened DOGE review of the funding contracts as well as other initiatives of the current administration.\n\n\"Wasteful subsidies under the IRA and CHIPS Act are being rapidly pushed out before January 20,\" Ramaswamy wrote in an X post a couple of months ago. \"DOGE will review every one of these 11th-hour gambits and recommend that Inspectors General scrutinize these last-minute contracts. Political appointees who go on to work for beneficiaries of this midnight spending spree should be exposed unsparingly.\"\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Before the election, the administration had awarded just one major contract, totaling $123 million, to Polar Semiconductor in Minnesota.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has defended the timeline, asserting it was part of the original plan under the CHIPS and Science Act. Moreover, she has denied that the timeline has been influenced by any potential policy reversals under the next administration.",

Ellis\u2019 fascination with the instrument started decades ago.\n\n\u201cWhen I picked up a mandolin that a friend of mine had, I really loved it, so I decided to get myself a mandolin. This was in 1972. As soon as I did that, I built a copy of it. I had always liked building models when I was a kid; building all sorts of stuff. My dad had a workshop,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nHe started his company, Ellis Mandolins, back in the 1970s. These days his wife runs the company, but Ellis still keeps a close eye on every detail.\n\n\u201cThe popularity of the mandolin has exploded unbelievably from a microscopic niche to a really tiny niche. It\u2019s a wonderful instrument for playing any kind of music,\u201d said Ellis.\n\nThere\u2019s a year-long waiting list for a custom-made mandolin. Ellis used to make them completely by hand, but it wasn\u2019t cost effective. Now he gets some help from machines to streamline the process.\n\n\u201cOnce the parts are made, building a mandolin is still all by hand,\u201d said Ellis.\n\nHis mandolins don\u2019t come cheap. Some sell anywhere from $16,000 to nearly $20,000 each. Country singer Ricky Skaggs has performed using Ellis\u2019 mandolins. Ellis says has plans to retire one day but has plenty of wood left to make even more beautiful instruments.",

            "content": "When Ms Jessica Tan was growing up, money was tight and the whole family including her two sisters slept on a queen-sized bed in their Ang Mo Kio two-room flat.\n\nShe could hardly have imagined back then that one day, she would be the head honcho of a major financial services company, living in a swanky apartment overlooking the Toronto city skyline in Canada.\n\nAfter years of hard work climbing the corporate ladder, with a long stint in China, the recently installed president of insurance and investment firm Sun Life Canada was listed as one of the World\u2019s 50 Greatest Leaders by Fortune Magazine in 2021.\n\nTo reflect on this stellar rise, Ms Tan joined me on a Zoom call at 9am her time recently, with a red-patterned scarf draped over her neck to keep out the Canadian chill, nails painted red and wearing other scarlet accessories.\n\nAs I took in her appearance, with hair in a neatly combed bob and wearing light makeup, I was immediately struck by one quality that she exuded above all else: Power.\n\n\u201cI have to leave promptly at 10, so I can only do an hour maximum,\u201d the busy 48-year-old Singaporean said.\n\nI expected nothing less from the woman who previously called the shots of China\u2019s largest insurance company Ping An Group, which has a market capitalisation of S$152.07 billion (US$111.14 billion).\n\nNow over at Sun Life Canada, the company serves 12 million clients, which is more than a quarter of the country's overall population.\n\nMs Tan graduated from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning two Bachelor of Science degrees and a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and computer science with a perfect grade point average.\n\nSoon after graduating, she remained in the United States to launch her career at the consulting giant McKinsey & Company in 2000. Then, she spent 11 years leading Ping An Group in China and moved on to Sun Life Canada just three months ago.\n\nMs Tan said that this was meant to be \u201cchapter three\u201d of her professional and personal life.\n\nShe wanted to explore the large North American market and dedicate more time to her two teenage daughters who will soon both be on the continent to further their studies.\n\nThe move to Sun Life Canada came after more than a decade of living apart from her family. With her husband and children back in Singapore, she flew back every weekend from China to spend time with them.\n\nWhile her husband will be remaining in Singapore, her younger daughter is now studying at a Canadian high school. Her older daughter will also soon be flying over to begin college in Canada or the US this year.\n\nA SINGAPOREAN CHILDHOOD\n\nMs Tan's wild success belies her humble roots back in Ang Mo Kio. She studied at the now-defunct Kebun Baru Primary School, before her excellent grades took her to CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School and then Hwa Chong Junior College.\n\nThe junior college has since been renamed to Hwa Chong Institution.\n\nHer parents were Malaysians who came from big families and did not have a lot of money. And yet, they made sure that she secured the best opportunities.\n\n\u201cMy father had the opportunity to go to the US for his work attachment as a semiconductor engineer with Texas Instruments. He saw that the US was very different, very entrepreneurial. And so he wanted us to experience that working culture,\u201d she said, speaking with an American twang.\n\nHe encouraged her to reject a scholarship in Singapore so that she could have the option to work in the US upon graduating. The scholarship would have obliged her to work here.\n\nHowever, this meant that the family had to find ways to fund her expensive tertiary studies.\n\nHer father renounced his Singapore permanent residency and quit his job so that he could withdraw money from his savings account with the national Central Provident Fund to pay for her school fees and living expenses.\n\n\u201cIt was a great personal sacrifice,\" she said. \"It was hard for me, too, because I had to take odd jobs while on campus such as working at the computing help desk and library.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ms Tan emphasised that she is grateful she followed her dad's advice to pass on the scholarship because she enjoyed studying and working in the US, and the experience shaped who she is today.\n\nHer parents also did the same for her two sisters who later went to the US as well. The need to constantly support one another meant that her family is extremely close despite being spread out across different countries.\n\nShe said: \u201cThese are strong familial bonds. I also teach my daughters in the fourth generation that this is what you have to do to look after the whole family.\u201d\n\nMs Tan\u2019s experience made me reflect on how I took it for granted that my parents paid for my university education and I made a mental note to thank them after my interview.",

Today, I'm going to expand on that by discussing the only ASX exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that I own at the start of this year.\n\nAs I went through last weekend, although ASX shares and ETFs were my first and, for a long time, only investments, my portfolio now contains more US shares and ETFs than ASX ones.\n\nBut even so, there are several ASX ETFs that I currently own now.\n\nThe index funds\n\nFirst and foremost amongst these is the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS).\n\nVAS is the quintessential ASX index fund. It represents an investment in the largest 300 Australian shares listed on the ASX. That's everything from BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) and National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX: NAB) to Ampol Ltd (ASX: ALD) and Aussie Broadband Ltd (ASX: ABB).\n\nI like VAS for its simple and cheap exposure to the Australian stock market.

Given its decent long-term historical return of 9.15% per annum (as of 31 December) and the hefty dividends this ETF habitually pays out, I am happy to hold this position for the long term, just in case my individual share choices don't end up being market-beaters.\n\nIn addition to VAS, I also own the Vanguard MSCI Australian Small Companies Index ETF (ASX: VSO). This ASX ETF complements the Vanguard Australian Shares ETF with its portfolio of around 180 smaller companies on the ASX. Instead of BHP and NAB, VSO's largest holdings are stocks like JB Hi-Fi Ltd (ASX: JBH) and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd (ASX: BEN).\n\nI think this ETF nicely balances out VAS. Together, these two funds offer a more well-rounded exposure to the Australian markets than either one individually.\n\nThe other index fund in my portfolio is the BetaShares Nasdaq 100 Currency Hedged ETF (ASX: HNDQ).\n\nThis ETF covers the largest 100 non-financial shares listed on the tech-heavy NASDAQ-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX) Index. It's a great way to easily add exposure to American tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Tesla and NVIDIA, as well as other tech heavyweights like Airbnb, Netflix, PayPal and Texas Instruments.\n\nOther ASX ETFs\n\nThere are another two ASX ETFs in my portfolio that are worth mentioning. Neither are the broad-based market index funds that we see above.\n\nFirstly, there's the iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (ASX: IXI). I love consumer staples shares for their defensive nature and ability to ring in profits during all kinds of economic weather. The ASX doesn't have too many global consumer staples companies, so this ETF is a great way to get exposure to the likes of Walmart, Costco, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Coca-Cola.\n\nI like the defensiveness and stability that this ETF adds to my portfolio.\n\nSecondly, there's the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (ASX: MOAT). This is a peculiar ETF in that it holds an actively managed portfolio of US shares selected based on business characteristics. In this case, those characteristics are the perceived possession of a wide economic moat.\n\nThis Warren Buffett term refers to a company's inbuilt competitive advantage over its competition. Buffett himself has said he likes to look for it in a new investment.\n\nMOAT has been an exceptional performer in my portfolio for a number of years. Since this ETF's inception in 2015, it has managed an average performance of 16.16% per annum (as of 31 December). As long as this ASX ETF is bringing home those kinds of returns, it has a place in my investing house.",

Today we just instinctively tap an app on our phone for some quick multiplication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the early 1950s, calculators were room-sized precursors to computers, but the technology developed stunningly quickly, from 1961\u2019s bulky desktops to 1967\u2019s first handheld bricks, to Texas Instruments\u2019 chunky Datamath of 1972 \u2013 every pocket-protected engineer\u2019s first crush, and one of the first with a mini screen with glowing red LED numbers.

To compensate for its lack of screen, it had a built-in mini thermal printer (like those used in Hong Kong taxis for receipts) that would print and scroll out from a little roll whatever you typed onto its keypad.

If you foresaw a brand that\u2019s not even four years old picking up the slack left in the wake of Sonos\u2019 self-immolation last year, congratulations\u2014your powers of prescience are considerably better than mine.\n\nThis Amp Pro is the company\u2019s latest demonstration of its entry-level prowess. A mere $379 buys a compact (2.6 x 7.5 x 8.5in, HxWxD), tidily constructed aluminum box that\u2019s equipped to power a single pair of passive loudspeakers and provide a gateway to network music streaming.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nIt\u2019s ready to become part of a multiroom and/or smart home system in conjunction with Amazon Echo, Google Nest, Linkplay and WiiM devices. And it can be controlled using voice assistants, a remote control handset or a control app. If you're after a simple box to plug speakers into and stream away your tunes, this is probably the perfect place to start.\n\nSmall and Mighty\n\nNot much on the outside gives the game away. The Amp Pro is very nearly featureless; the fascia features a volume control and a few LEDs confirming its power status, the input you\u2019ve selected, and the volume level. Around the back are posts for connecting speaker cable, an Ethernet socket, digital optical input, and HDMI ARC and stereo RCA line-level connections, along with outputs for a subwoofer and a USB-A slot.\n\nOn the inside, the WiiM is similarly focused. Amplification is via the well-regarded Texas Instruments TPA3255, and here it twists out 60 watts of power per channel into an 8-ohm load. It uses a correspondingly credible ESS ES9038 Q2M digital-to-analog converter to take care of the other most critical business. Wi-Fi 6 (with a promised upgrade to 6E) gets you a wireless network connection, and there\u2019s also Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity with LE Audio codec compatibility\u2014pretty much every worthwhile audio format is supported.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- China will investigate allegations that the US dumps lower-end chips and unfairly subsidizes its own chipmakers, in potentially one of Beijing\u2019s strongest retaliatory moves against American technology sanctions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe government will look into the question of whether the US is giving its chipmakers an unfair advantage through incentives and grants, or illegally undercutting Chinese products, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement Thursday. The probe was begun in response to protests from local industry players, the agency said.\n\nChinese chipmakers have complained about the US Chips Act, which provides funding of some $39 billion to entice firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to build high-end chipmaking capacity in America. On Thursday, China\u2019s chip industry body took aim at a cornerstone of the Biden administration\u2019s policy.\n\n\u201cThe US Chips and Science Act violates the fundamental principles of a market economy and caused profound and significant impact on the global semiconductor supply chain,\u201d the China Semiconductor Industry Association said in a WeChat statement.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry didn\u2019t name any company, but several US firms including Texas Instruments Inc. and Analog Devices Inc. rank among the leaders in lower-end products such as power and analog chips. Those are ubiquitous in modern devices from cars to appliances, helping regulate power flows or translate digital signals.\n\nBeijing\u2019s investigation echoes a longstanding US complaint, that China\u2019s government openly bankrolls its domestic firms in contravention of global trade agreements. US and European officials have also warned of the risk that Chinese companies, which\u2019re building capacity in mature nodes at a rapid clip, could eventually flood global markets with cheap chips.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the consequences could be for any company found violating antitrust or anti-dumping regulations. The government could impose higher or company-specific tariffs, depending on its findings. Beijing has also in the past threatened US companies with either product bans or hefty fines.\n\nQualcomm Inc. a decade ago changed some of its key business and licensing practices and paid up a 6 billion yuan ($975 million) fine to put an end to a yearlong antitrust case. Micron Technology Inc. warned in 2023 that about half of its sales tied to China-headquartered clients may be affected by a cybersecurity probe being carried out by the Chinese government.",

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +2.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.5% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Texas Instruments belongs, has lost 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Texas Instruments is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share, indicating a change of -20.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.07 points to a change of -28.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.72 indicates a change of +12.9% from what Texas Instruments is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Texas Instruments is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).",

The unmanned spacecraft will attempt to land on the moon\u2019s surface with precious cargo \u2013 10 science and technology instruments that will carry out operations on behalf of NASA for a complete lunar day (equal to about 14 Earth days).\n\nBlue Ghost\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually a camera pointed back, looking across the top of the lander,\u201d Joe explained. \u201cDepending on where the lander is pointed, we\u2019ll be able to see views of the Earth with the lander in the foreground. To see a picture of something I designed, built and installed looking back at the Earth, will be really, really wild.\u201d\n\nThis out-of-world experience is one Joe never would have expected as a high schooler in Bolton, Massachusetts, who created a robotics program and (ironically) designed a robot that could play on a simulated lunar field. Nor as a mechanical engineering undergraduate at Texas Tech University from 2010 to 2014, helping his solid mechanics professor design a microrobot that could climb walls using microstructural biometric fibrillar adhesives that mimicked a gecko\u2019s suction pads.\n\nWhat he knew even back then \u2013 what attracted him to his out-of-state college in the first place \u2013 is he wanted to get his hands dirty and use engineering skills to make a difference.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re doing actual engineering and hardware projects, it really teaches you how to do problem-solving and troubleshooting and is the best way to gain practical engineering experience,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat got me hooked. I thought, \u2018OK, yeah. This is what I want to do \u2013 build things.\u2019\u201d\n\nJoe with his future wife.\n\nAfter his graduation from the Edward E. Whitacre Jr. College of Engineering, Joe was hired as an aerospace engineer for L-3 Communications in Dallas, where he designed hardware and installed it on jets for the U.S. Air Force. He enjoyed the role but was looking to move closer to his soon-to-be wife in Austin, Texas.\n\nWhen he saw a job posting from an aerospace rocket company located near Austin in Cedar Park, he wasted no time submitting his application. After a couple of interviews, he was hired in 2018 as one of 80 employees at Firefly, which has grown to nearly 700 during the course of the Blue Ghost mission.\n\n\u201cThe timing kind of worked out,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, I did not expect that to happen\u2026moving from Dallas to join a rocket company.\u2019\u201d\n\nJoe first began to work on multi-mission orbital vehicles through CAD, which he describes as putting Lego blocks together virtually to build assemblies of structures in the correct scales and dimensions. Afterwards, that design can translate into engineering drawings and solid bodies (3D digital representations).\n\nDuring that process for the Blue Ghost, Joe was wearing what the profession jokingly refers to as CAD goggles \u2013 fully concentrated on moving the digital image virtually and altering it as needed.\n\nRemoving those lenses and seeing the lunar lander in person three years later, in 2023, took his breath away.\n\nJoe at work.\n\n\u201cI went, \u2018Oh, wow, that looks much bigger than it did on my computer,\u2019\u201d Joe mused. \u201cIt makes you realize that the little changes you make here and there in CAD can have big impacts on how it works in real life.\u201d\n\nAfter helping assemble and care for the six-foot-tall spacecraft mindfully \u2013 wiping it spotless with a cloth, over and over \u2013 he brimmed with anxiety late last year when he attended an environmental testing in which the lander was brutally shaken and vibrated to test its durability.\n\nTo his relief, the Blue Ghost withstood the artificial storm, giving Firefly the green light required before carrying out NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative. This mission will help NASA collect data needed to send astronauts back to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years under the Artemis campaign.\n\nOne of the 10 payloads onboard is the Lunar Instrumentation for Subsurface Thermal Exploration with Rapidity (LISTER) that will measure the flow of heat from the moon\u2019s interior through a pneumatic drill that will penetrate three meters into the ground.\n\nEvery half meter it descends, the drilling system will pause and extend a custom-built thermal probe into the surrounding rocks, dusts and pebbles. LISTER will measure two different aspects of heat flow: thermal gradient, or the changes in temperature at various depths, and thermal conductivity, or the subsurface material\u2019s ability to let heat pass through it.\n\nBelieve it or not, LISTER became Joe\u2019s personal favorite payload before he even knew its principal investigator hailed from his alma mater.\n\nA Professor\u0092s Payload\n\nJoe first met Texas Tech\u2019s Seiichi Nagihara, a geophysics professor, several years ago when learning more about the Blue Ghost payload requirements.\n\n\u201cHe introduced himself as a Texas Tech professor and I was like, \u2018Oh, wow! Really good to see you,\u2019\u201d Joe remembered.\n\nNagihara felt likewise to know a Red Raider was entrusted with the design of the spacecraft that would finally give his instrument the chance to perform. His work with LISTER began a couple years before Joe started college, in 2008, when he began publishing research about the creation of a heat-flow probe that could sit on the surface of the moon and accurately measure the amount of heat coming from its interior.\n\nIn 2019, he was delighted NASA selected his design to fly on a future lunar mission.\n\n\u201cThis will put Texas Tech on the map in terms of planetary science,\u201d he assured.\n\nNagihara has spent the last several years flying between Lubbock and Honeybee Robotics in Altadena, California as the company helped design and test the instrument. Once complete, Nagihara delivered LISTER to Firefly and began another exciting collaborative process.\n\nBlue Ghost Mission 1 - LISTER Payload Team (Nagihara, 4th from right)\n\n\u201cFrom Firefly\u2019s point of view, they had to develop their spacecraft to meet the needs of the instruments they\u2019re carrying, but at the same time, they had limitations for the payload because everything had to be very light,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe spacecraft itself is not very big, so my team worked with Firefly to meet all of their constraints.\u201d\n\nLISTER was successfully integrated onto the Blue Ghost near its left foot pad and features a prominent white Double T. It will begin drilling in the first five days of the 14-day lunar surface operations, remotely controlled by Nagihara and his team from their mission operation center at Honeybee Robotics. They will stay in constant communication with NASA and Firefly throughout the mission.\n\n(LEFT) \"This photo from Firefly shows the Blue Ghost lander being encapsulated in the payload faring of the Falcon 9 rocket of SpaceX,\" Nagihara said. \"Blue Ghost (in gold) sits on top of a little rocket. Hopefully you can recognize two of the lander's legs. (RIGHT) If you zoom in closely near the left foot pad, you may see the Texas Tech logo in white. That little black thing with the logo is LISTER.\"\n\nNagihara highly anticipates his instrument\u2019s findings since such data cannot be collected from the sky through NASA\u2019s various probes and satellites.\n\n\u201cHeat-flow data are very important in understanding the geologic history of any rocky planet and moon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the moon, there have been only two heat-flow data collections so far and both were done by the Apollo astronauts in the 1970s. Because humans have not returned to the moon since, there has been no additional data collected there or on any other moon or planet for that matter.\u201d\n\nLISTER\u2019s legacy will be the first time heat-flow data were collected on the moon solely by remote, robotic operation \u2013 but there are a lot of \u201cifs\u201d standing between Nagihara and this triumph.\n\nStick the Landing\n\nNeither Joe nor Nagihara slept much before Blue Ghost entered the atmosphere, and they don\u2019t believe that will improve much post launch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting, but I\u2019ve also been constantly worried for the last couple months,\u201d Nagihara admitted. \u201cEverybody\u2019s really keeping their fingers crossed.\u201d\n\nLanding on moon.\n\nOnce Blue Ghost makes its 45-day trip to the moon, it will face a gymnast\u2019s challenge of sticking the landing through its shock-absorbing feet, a low center of mass and wide footprint.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to not just land, but soft land on the moon upright to be able to operate all of the instruments,\u201d Nagihara said. \u201cSo, if they can do that, that\u2019s a major feat and we should just be happy about that.\u201d\n\nJoe in clean room.\n\nJoe clings to the confidence instilled in him by various tests the Blue Ghost persevered through. He also is assured by the spacecraft\u2019s white-glove treatment to alleviate Firefly\u2019s concerns such as foreign object debris contamination on precision optical sensors, cameras and other lenses that are sensitive to dust.\n\nHe and his teammates have come to learn even a little debris accumulation could lead to astronomical issues, like the explosion of the propulsion system.\n\n\u201cSome of this stuff is routine, best aerospace practice in general,\u201d he noted, \u201cbut when you\u2019re building a lunar lander, you ratchet that up to the to the highest extent you can to really make sure you\u2019re not taking any chances.\u201d\n\nJoe\u2019s parents, who don\u2019t necessarily understand the technicalities of his position, eagerly watched the livestream of the launch. As did his wife, who was even more excited about the potential of his upcoming free time.\n\nJoe Quirk\n\nJoe felt further humbled by the support of fellow robotics classmates from Texas Tech he has kept in touch with, who ensured him they will be rooting for his success.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re super excited,\u201d Joe said, later reflecting that his younger self would have felt the same.\n\n\u201cTeenage Joe would be like, \u2018That\u2019s not true; you\u2019re not doing that.\u2019 But I\u2019ve worked hard for it, and I\u2019m very proud of the work we\u2019ve done as a team.\u201d\n\nOnce the Blue Ghost blasted into the sky, Joe waved a final goodbye to the spacecraft to which he dedicated so much time.\n\nFollowing payload operations, Blue Ghost will perform its final task to capture imagery of the lunar sunset that will provide critical data the scientific community needs. The lander will then operate for several hours into the night until the brutal cold and lack of solar power drain its battery.\n\nFrom that point on, indefinitely, Joe will have the privilege to look up most every night and intimately know a piece of the moon\u2019s surface.\n\n\u201cI keep daydreaming maybe one day we will have a true permanent moon base where there are humans living on the moon, and one of those astronauts will walk over to our Blue Ghost landing site and see a plaque on the lander with all the names of the people who worked on it,\u201d he shared. \u201cPeople 50 to 100 years from now seeing my name on there and having some remnants of the work we did would be incredible.\u201d",

            "content": "Manufacturing keeps evolving\u2014and the facilities that house manufacturing in the U.S. are also changing and innovating. Given that 54% of domestic R&D occurred in manufacturing in 2021, according to the National Science Foundation, it makes sense for industrial facilities to be the places that enable experimentation and encourage product development.\n\nThere also are collaborative efforts underway to remove barriers and create ecosystems to build stronger supply chains and provide an entry for the commercialization of emerging technologies at next-generation manufacturing facilities.\n\nPodcast: Insights from our team of editors on how 2024 transformed manufacturing (Part 1)\n\nPodcast: Insights from our team of editors on how 2024 transformed manufacturing (Part 2)\n\nCollaborative facilities devoted to innovation have been working on initiatives that include:\n\nUtilization of advanced fiber technology to make programmable backpacks that use no wires or batteries, but they still connect to the digital world.\n\nUsing light instead of electronics to power cloud-based data centers, drastically increasing the speed of transfer tenfold, while reducing cost and energy consumption.\n\nExtending the range of electric vehicles by reducing weight and mitigating energy loss during transfers.\n\nHere is a snapshot of some of the next-generation manufacturing facilities within the Manufacturing USA network that are shaping the future of U.S. advanced manufacturing:\n\nA silicon carbide foundry\n\nLocated in Lubbock, Texas, is the world\u2019s first open silicon carbide foundry. The facility was a former Texas Instruments facility that made traditional silicon wafers. The goal of the facility is to remove barriers of entry and help commercialize wide bandgap (WBG) power electronics technologies, which increase the energy efficiency and reliability of power electronics.\n\nSee also: New report reflects optimism among manufacturers mixed with some caution\n\nWide bandgap technologies, including both silicon-carbide and gallium-nitride power semiconductors, have implications for legacy power electronics applications such as industrial motor systems, consumer electronics, and data systems. These technologies meet the needs of next-generation high-voltage applications such as grid modernization, manufacturing plant power systems, offshore wind, and multi-megawatt motor drives.\n\nThis foundry employs a collaborative model, which provides companies that lack their own silicon carbide fabrication capabilities with access to a shared production and R&D facility. Up to 20 American companies of all sizes can use the production equipment at various times.\n\nA test, assembly and packaging facility\n\nThis collaboration between the American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics and the Defense Department is situated in Rochester, N.Y. Integrated photonics involve using light for applications traditionally addressed through electronics. It\u2019s also used in communications as well as laser-based radar and sensing because it provides improved performance and reliability of electronic integrated circuits while significantly reducing size, weight, and energy consumption.\n\nCrystal Ball 2025: The rise of resilient manufacturing\n\nThis facility is a key component as it provides a connection point within the photonics supply chain. It is the world\u2019s first open-access Photonic Integrated (PIC) Test, Assembly and Packaging Facility and provides development and production process capabilities that enable small and medium-sized businesses to bring integrated photonic chip technologies through the product development cycle\u2014something they otherwise might not be able to afford.\n\nThe facility has advanced photonic sensors using light as radar (LIDAR). These tiny LIDAR sensors provide real-time 3D mapping for driverless cars, manage database systems for cloud computing, detect sarin gases in national security environments, and enhance medical imaging as well as rate food safety by measuring the interactivity of chemicals.

These science payloads and technology demonstrations will help advance our understanding of the Moon and planetary processes, while paving the way for future crewed missions on the Moon and beyond, for the benefit of all.\n\nFirefly\u2019s lunar lander, named Blue Ghost, is scheduled to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Wednesday, Jan.15, from Launch Complex 39A at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a 45-day cruise phase, Blue Ghost is targeted to land near a volcanic feature called Mons Latreille within Mare Crisium, a basin approximately 340 miles wide (550 kilometers) located in the northeast quadrant of the Moon\u2019s near side.\n\nHow can we enable more precise navigation on the Moon? How do spacecraft interact with the lunar surface? How does Earth\u2019s magnetic field influence the effects of space weather on our home planet? NASA\u2019s instruments on this flight will conduct first-of-their-kind demonstrations to help answer these questions and more, including testing regolith sampling technologies, lunar subsurface drilling capabilities, increasing precision of positioning and navigation abilities, testing radiation tolerant computing, and learning how to mitigate lunar dust during lunar landings.\n\nThe ten NASA payloads aboard Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost lander include:\n\nLunar Instrumentation for Subsurface Thermal Exploration with Rapidity (LISTER) will measure heat flow from the Moon\u2019s interior by measuring the thermal gradient, or changes in temperature at various depths, and thermal conductivity, or the subsurface material\u2019s ability to let heat pass through it.

What is wrong?\n\nAre these Ohio engineering graduates not good enough?\n\nEvery time a company passes over an American engineer and hires an immigrant with an H-1B visa at a small fraction of the cost, they lower the entry wages for all engineers. The irony that Vivek misses is that depressing wages discourages American students from going into engineering.\n\nWhy H-1B workers are in demand, endanger?\n\nWhat is not to love about hiring an H-1B immigrant engineer?\n\nThey are indentured and shackled to their sponsoring USA company for three years (renewable to six years) and then they must go home.\n\nIf they complain \u2014 they are sent home.\n\nIf they won\u2019t work 70 hours a week without overtime \u2014 they are sent home. If the sponsor doesn\u2019t like the way they dress, talk or act \u2014 they are sent home. For female H-1B immigrant workers, the risks are even higher.\n\nOpinion: Ramaswamy is right, America's culture puts jocks, prom queens over academics\n\nIn April 2024, Ramaswamy's buddy Elon Musk laid off 14,000 Tesla employees including many experienced and highly skilled senior engineers.\n\nA recent Electrek article showed that some of these were replaced with low-wage H-1B immigrant engineers.\n\nIf the article is correct that some are being replaced, then it is clear the engineering skills are needed, and this is just a greedy money grab to replace Americans with low-wage immigrant engineers. All this is being done under the guise of H-1B work visas.\n\nVivek and Elon's favorite immigrants\n\nWhen Vivek and Elon speak of mass deportation of immigrants, they are speaking about the ones that don\u2019t look like, sound like or are not educated like them. Send the Haitian machinists and Hispanic carpenters home, but don\u2019t touch our H-1B engineers.\n\nI guess this viewpoint isn\u2019t racist, it's just a classist view of the value of white-collar versus blue-collar workers. Elon\u2019s cries of racism also ring hollow.\n\nSince when are Americans going to take racism advice from a rich, white, South African Afrikaner like Elon who grew up benefiting from the remnants of an apartheid culture?\n\nElon\u2019s brother Kimbal has described the two of them as immigrants working illegally in America early in their careers and speaks of sneaking in illegally from Canada after U.S. immigration stopped him at the border because he had no work visa.\n\nIt certainly strikes a tone of, \"do as I say and not as I have done, for the rules don\u2019t apply to me.\"\n\nA challenge for Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nVivek, I think it is time that you quit whining about culture and take action to improve mathematic meritocracy in America.\n\nI chaired the MATHCOUNTS program in Cincinnati for 30 years, which included when you were a mathlete at our local Princeton Junior High School.\n\nYou have accomplished a lot since those formative years.\n\nI challenge you to put some of that success to better use and emulate what Texas Instruments has done in Texas, where they are a sponsor of both the Texas and the national MATHCOUNTS competition. Put your money into action in Ohio to drive American mathematics meritocracy and success.\n\nJohn Molander is a licensed professional engineer and prolific inventor who retired after working 34 years for Procter & Gamble while volunteering as the Cincinnati MATHCOUNTS program chair for 30 years.",

            "content": "Members can download this article in PDF format.\n\nConnected devices aren\u2019t necessarily intelligent devices. However, by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with edge computing, data can be processed and analyzed directly on devices at the \"edge\" of a network\u2014at the point where a device connects to the internet, such as sensors.\n\nIn this way, edge AI brings computational power closer to the data source. Decisions can be made on the periphery of the device instead of in the cloud, enabling faster real-time decision-making, lower latency, higher power efficiency, and improved robustness and data security.\n\nSponsored Resources\n\nEngineers today are challenged to design systems that can make accurate, intelligent decisions in real-time. One example is the smart-home security camera. To detect whether an object in your backyard is a dog or a stranger using cloud AI may require sending the data up to the cloud, processing it, and then sending it back down so that a decision can be made. This would not only take too long, but it would require a great deal of power to accomplish.\n\nWhen making decisions at the edge, highly integrated embedded devices run neural networks locally, requiring less power and allowing for improved security and privacy.\n\nHigher-Precision Fault Detection\n\nLots of data can be utilized by edge AI. For instance, an OEM building a car will have a large amount of sensor-obtained data on how the car will behave. Edge AI allows you to take this data and create a function that will detect a potential fault or do preemptive maintenance. It can boost fault-detection precision by processing this data locally and in real-time, reducing latency and increasing responsiveness.\n\nIn applications such as motor drives and solar-energy systems, real-time fault detection ensures both operational safety and long-term reliability.\n\nEdge AI-enabled MCUs can monitor two types of faults:\n\nA motor-bearing fault occurs when there are abnormal conditions or deterioration in the bearings of an electric motor. Detecting these faults is vital to prevent unexpected failures, reduce downtime, and reduce maintenance costs.\n\nAn arc fault is a discharge that occurs when electricity flows through an unintended path. These are often caused by insulation breakdowns, loose connections, or other faults in the system. The discharge can generate intense heat, leading to fires or damage to the electrical system. Arc-fault detection will prevent fires and ensure safety.\n\nEmbedded Processors Increase Intelligence at the Edge\n\nTexas Instruments offers a range of processors with varying processing capabilities, enabling developers to choose the right level of AI performance for their application while maintaining low power consumption. Integrated edge-AI based fault detection in a real-time MCU such as the TI TMS320F28P550SJ can help avoid false alarms while providing better predictive maintenance (Fig. 1).",

            "content": "\u201cThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world.\u201d - Nvidia Annual Report, 2023\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the counterculture was in full swing, politics was realigning, and big business was undergoing a shift to a different type of leader. And Wall Street, which had been considered a disreputable area of society since the crash of 1929, had seized on something called \u201cpersonal finance\u201d to restore its pre-Depression luster. Conglomerates, an early version of private equity, were all the rage. Well-branded firms like IBM, American Express, Sears, and Texas Instruments comprised something called the \u201cNifty Fifty,\u201d named for 50 stocks selling at rich valuations who were considered to be stable sure bets.\n\nAs with all sure things, these stocks did terribly when they ran into a bear market. But at the time, you looked foolish, musty and dusty, for urging caution. And with that, let\u2019s talk artificial intelligence. I don\u2019t write that much about AI, but if you watch CNBC, it\u2019s just the endless background noise of investing, not just on the main shows, but in the commercials pushing different stocks. It\u2019s just kind of understood that this technology method - of mashing large amounts of data into neural networks who then become compendiums of knowledge based on what they\u2019ve been trained on - is just going to be as big as the invention of electricity. In November of 2022, we had our ChatGPT moment, and were told that AI would change everything, and soon. Yet it\u2019s been a few years, and while AI has changed customer service, filled Facebook with slop, and helped a lot of students cheat on their homework, it hasn\u2019t written a hit song or created a new movie.\n\nToday, there isn\u2019t the Nifty Fifty, but instead a smaller set of magnificent stocks - the \u201cMag 7 \u201c These are Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla; Broadcom is another trillion dollar chip company sometimes lumped in with them. The Mag 7 are all AI or AI-adjacent companies; Microsoft, for instance, is spending about $20 billion a quarter on capital equipment, like data centers, chips, and electric power.\n\nAs Skanda Amarnath notes, the level of investment in AI is starting to become macro-economically significant, almost as important as housing during the subprime crisis. The Mag 7, plus the information technology sector, comprise 46% of the S&P, which is shockingly high.\n\nIf you focus on the expenditures for software, technology hardware, industrial equipment and data center structures at the heart of the AI boom, you\u2019re looking at nearly 6% of US GDP as of the third quarter of 2024. That number is likely to rise further in the coming quarters. If so, we would surpass the share of GDP that the tech-industrial-telecom boom of the late 1990s reached at its peak back in 2000:\n\nDoes that mean AI is a bubble? Some people do think that, like Ed Zitron, who I find compelling. Zitron\u2019s argument is that we are rewiring the nation\u2019s electric grid for an unproven technology that just isn\u2019t producing the revenue required to justify the investments. My view is closer to that of conservative populist Oren Cass, who sees AI as a set of incremental improvements that will likely add up to something meaningful, but not up to the level of hype we\u2019re hearing about.\n\nLast week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gave an hour and a half long presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), in which he laid out his company\u2019s product roadmap. Nvidia isn\u2019t just any company, it\u2019s the second most valuable company in the world, at $3.4 trillion, just behind Apple. Originally a company focused on making graphics processing units for gamers, today Nvidia makes its money largely by selling AI chips to data centers run by hyperscalers, big tech firms like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon, along with a few large Chinese corporations.\n\nWhen your company is as big as Nvidia, whatever vision you put forward for your own firm is as much a prediction for how you intend to shape society as it is where there are economic opportunities. Huang is living the expression, which likely came from Peter Drucker, that \"the best way to predict the future is to create it.\" So what is this vision?\n\nThe idea from Huang is that we are moving to something called \u201cAgentic AI,\u201d which allows computer systems to \u201cautonomously solve complex, multi-step problems.\u201d The first places Agentic AI are showing up in corporate America are customer service, content creation, software engineering, human resources, and design, places where the infrastructure of screens is already pervasive. But in that presentation, Huang laid out how everything from cars \u201csurgical rooms to data centers, warehouses to factories, even traffic control systems or entire smart cities will transform from static, manually operated systems to autonomous, interactive systems embodied by physical AI.\u201d It will be a world of robots, from humanoid-looking creatures to industrial systems to autonomous vehicles.\n\nTo build such a system requires three separate computers, which I\u2019ll try to explain as best as a non-expert can. The first computer is a foundational model that is trained with large amounts of data in a data center run by Nvidia chips. This model is a bit like raw clay, it can be used for an infinite number of shapes, but it must be molded.\n\nThe second computer is a simulation environment. You tailor that foundational model to the required parameters. For autonomous cars, for instance, you would take that model and feed billions of miles of actual auto trips into a data center with lots of Nvidia chips, and that produces a sort of digital engine. You then take that engine and run simulations in all the different weather conditions and driving scenarios (construction, traffic, road closures, et al.), making sure it works and doesn\u2019t cause car accidents and can get you places. The engine learns to \u201creason\u201d and make decisions on the fly. Finally, you stick that engine into a car\u2019s computer, again via Nvidia chips, and you have an autonomous car. Or so goes the theory.\n\nThis image is from the Huang\u2019s presentation, it\u2019s part of an explanation of how three computers are the essence of autonomous systems, in this case cars.\n\nFrom that presentation, it seems like Nvidia is doing partnerships with every big company on the planet, from car companies like Tesla to supply chain firm KION GROUP to Accenture. They have \u201chave partnerships in automotive, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and retail among others\u201d with the goal of \u201caccelerat[ing] the adoption of AI.\u201d I imagine they have a big build-out with defense contractors as well, since the applications of this kind of technology to war are likely consequential.\n\nThe hope, for Nvidia, is that AI will spread throughout the economy, and quickly. Nvidia is a big venture investor, cutting checks to its own customers. (Investments include taking stakes in OpenAI, xAI, Inflection, Wayve, Scale AI, Crusoe, Figure AI, Perplexity, CoreWeave, Poolside, Cohere, Sakana AI, Imbue, et al.) Cynics might suggest that Nvidia is giving money to customers who then buy Nvidia products, but it\u2019s just as likely the company is trying to build systems that push AI into the rest of the economy.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to really know, because the truth is that Nvidia has a business of selling chips to Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, and has a side hustle in everything else. Through the first nine months of 2024, Nvidia had about $91B of revenue, and $79B of that was in sales to data centers. Just one customer is responsible for 19% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, and just four customers \u201caccounted for 18%, 13%, 11% and 11% of [Nvidia\u2019s] accounts receivable balance as of October 27, 2024.\u201d\n\nNvidia is also not really a chip company. \u201cMore than half of our engineers work on software,\u201d it puts in its annual reports. Though it does buy some raw materials, its physical chips are fabricated by third party contract manufacturers, most notably Taiwan Semiconductor. Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantages are in its Compute Unified Architecture (CUDA) software layer, on which most AI engineers are trained, as well as its chips being able to integrate more easily into a data center than those of rivals.\n\nAll that said, Nvidia, while engineering extremely impressive technology, isn\u2019t very good at predicting the future. Take 2022, when two things happened that would have seemed to harm the business. Nvidia tried to buy chip IP licensor Arm, before being blocked by FTC Chair Lina Khan. That same year, the Biden administration imposed export controls on AI chips sold to China, including Nvidia\u2019s sales of top tier chips to Chinese customers.\n\nBoth actions angered Huang. The merger was blocked because the whole industry, from Google onward, licensed Arm chip blueprints, and Nvidia was thwarted. But no corporations wanted the export controls, so Huang led the way in trying to roll back those rules, arguing that the U.S. semiconductor industry was doomed if it didn\u2019t get access to the Chinese market. The next year, Nvidia even tried to fire the Biden officials who crafted the regulations.\n\nYou would think, if Huang were right, that Nvidia would be in trouble. But today Nvidia stock is up by ten times or so, and demand in non-Chinese markets is so high that it can\u2019t deliver enough products. Still, Nvidia is pulling the same stunt again today, trying to roll back newer export controls designed to prevent leakage of chips to China. Nvidia used its trade group, the Information Technology Industry Council, as well as supportive politicians such as Ted Cruz, though many important thinkers in industry and on both sides of the aisle are supportive of stronger controls.\n\nAnyway, all of this is a way of saying that there\u2019s a future out there that Nvidia, and the Mag 7 in general, want to paint as inevitable. And any attempt to govern their activities frustrates not just their ambitions, but that very futuristic vision.\n\nThat vision suggests there\u2019s a world of autonomous cars, perhaps purchased by consumers but possibly rented out by services on demand. We might need 5% of the number of cars we have today, which after all sit in our garages unused most of the time. It\u2019s a world of factories, ports, and warehouses with fleets of self-driving machines overseen by just a few humans, a world of restaurants and retails outlets staffed by humanoid robots, and one where entertainment, communications, and even emotional connection, often delivered through virtual or augmented reality or even directly hacking into our brains, is supplemented by artificial agents helping us with most of our tasks. Everything, from war to love to childhood to law to medicine to the nation-state to the study of every major discipline, will change radically.\n\nSuch a world will require trillions in investment, as well as dedicated government policies to make happen. That world may be one in which just a few entities have power or control, over the chips, the data sets, and the electricity that powers how we will live. So for the CEOs of any trillion dollar firm competing to build this possible future, it\u2019s worth investing whatever you need to invest, to break any law you need to break, to do whatever you have to do, to make sure that you get a piece of that future.\n\nThis world, however, is not an inevitability. It may not even be a possibility, simply a mirage spun by public relations types. It\u2019s not that AI is fake; the machine learning technology being rolled out is cool, and does have practical applications. Jensen Huang has impressive chops, and many of his shareholders have done quite well. More broadly, many of our financial elite buys into this vision; hedge fund guys park their money in the Mag 7. But as much as these powerful people wish otherwise, Huang doesn\u2019t know the future any more than anyone else. But we\u2019re going to keep hearing about the promise of this world, until it comes true, or there\u2019s some sort of crash.\n\nRemember, at one point, the Nifty Fifty were a sure thing.",

Yet those close to the projects, and even some former critics, say there is plenty of opportunity for everyone.\n\nCourtesy of Gensler\n\nIn addition to the Margaritaville Beach Resort Galveston, seen here, and the planned Margaritaville Resort at Lake Texoma, the company also has a location at Lake Conroe in the Houston area.\n\n\u201cThe area is just going to explode \u2013 it\u2019s the next big thing,\u201d said Horizon Capital Managing Director Dave Johnson, a partner in the Preston Harbor project with McKinney developer David Craig of Craig International.\n\nDevelopers and community leaders say Lake Texoma and the surrounding area is up to the challenge of supporting these multibillion-dollar projects, but existing residents and businesses aren\u2019t as sure.\n\nFollowing Denison\u2019s announcement of the 2,700-acre Pointe Vista master-planned development, upset residents flooded comment sections to complain the project would ruin a peaceful area, destroy Lake Texoma's original charm and native prairie as well as run off wildlife.\n\nThe 28,000-resident town of Dennison is already seeing a housing boom and could grow even faster thanks to the opening of a new private hospital and a pair of semiconductor plants coming to nearby Sherman, bringing thousands of jobs.\n\n\u201cWe had no say,\u201d wrote one local commenter. \u201cIt is unaffordable for 99% of us and it is destroying one of the most beautiful areas of Lake Texoma. This will not bring in more to support the tax base, actually will cost the city and county tax payers more.\u201d\n\nConcerns about the local impacts of large resort project are common, and they were initially shared by Lake Texoma Association Executive President Brandi Burkhalter.\n\nBurkhalter worried the huge projects could negatively affect existing hospitality-based businesses like the Tanglewood Resort in Pottsboro. She ultimately concluded a rush of new interest would be a net benefit to other hotels and businesses.\n\n\u201cThere's going to be an influx of visitors at some point that want to try [the new resorts] out, but then they're either going to figure out they can afford to go there or they can't,\u201d Burkhalter said. \u201cIt may just be an opportunity for [existing attractions] to \u2026 add some additional things that could help their business.\u201d\n\nAn economic impact study conducted by Hotel & Leisure Advisors for Kalahari Resorts & Conventions supports that theory. H&LA sifted through two decades of data on impacts to surrounding hotels after the water park resort chain opened locations in Round Rock, Texas, Sandusky, Ohio, and the Pennsylvania Poconos. The study showed huge hospitality projects increased market occupancy levels across the board, even at competing hotels, over a 20-year span.\n\nMore full-time residents and more visitors in hotel rooms is an exciting prospect for all the communities neighboring Lake Texoma in both states, said Janet Reed, Chamber of Commerce Executive Director for Durant, Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cAny type of resort like this, in any community, has to be looked at as a very positive thing,\u201d Reed said. \u201cYou're bringing in tourists, which brings in new money.\u201d\n\nConstruction is already underway on the Hard Rock Hotel, which will be on the Oklahoma side of the lake in the Pointe Vista development, west of Durant. It will eventually offer more than 19 miles of shoreline, multiple hotels, a casino, a golf course, an enclosed waterpark and 2,100 homes.\n\nCourtesy of Pointe Vista\n\nThe Hard Rock Hotel and casino will be part of the $2B Pointe Vista development on the Oklahoma side of Lake Texoma.\n\nThe Hard Rock Hotel Lake Texoma resort is slated to open in summer 2027, while the buildout of the full Pointe Vista development could take up to 15 years.\n\nThe 3,100-acre Preston Harbor development on the Texas side of the lake will have 7,500 homes, including single-family, multifamily and active-adult communities. Its calling card will be the $100M Margaritaville resort as well as retail elements and an upscale marina.\n\nInfrastructure construction for the development is underway, with the project\u2019s official groundbreaking likely to occur sometime next year.\n\nMargaritaville has two other Texas resorts built or in development, but the North Texas area was the company's most desired location, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cThey've really created, I think the best term is \u2018a lifestyle,\u2019 because as we did our research, it just really fits,\u201d Johnson said of the pairing of Margaritaville and Lake Texoma. \u201cThe more people we talked to, a Margaritaville resort just made perfect sense.\u201d\n\nJohnson expects Preston Harbor to be a haven for empty nesters looking to be close to grandkids in DFW and those wanting a second home near the lake. Its multifamily component will also be a viable option for workers at the planned semiconductor chip plants coming to Sherman, he said.\n\nPreston Harbor could attract 20,000 new residents to Denison, nearly doubling the size of the Grayson County city.\n\nThat could be life-changing growth for the city. Denison Development Alliance President Tony Kaai said the only thing comparable to it is the nearly $30B that Texas Instruments and GlobiTech said they will invest in semiconductor chip plants in Sherman.\n\nKaai was initially surprised by the announcement of the competing Hard Rock Resort, but he said he trusts the developers know what they\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cI'm sure they've done their due diligence,\u201d Kaai said. \u201cThey had to sell somebody [that] the thing is going to make money.\u201d\n\nThe developments are set to further the already-accelerated growth of Grayson County, which saw a 13% population increase from 2010 to 2020, according to census data. The Texas Water Development Board predicts the county could grow by nearly 9% from its 2020 total of 136,212 residents to more than 148,000 in 2030, per the Texas Council of Governments.\n\nProjections place the county north of 250,000 residents by 2060.\n\nCourtesy of Visit Frisco\n\nThe planned resorts at Lake Texoma will feature golf courses like this one at Fields Ranch at the Omni PGA Frisco Resort.\n\nAll that growth has made the remaining land in Grayson County more attractive to investors. Developers have scooped up 1,500 acres of land between Preston Harbor and U.S. Highway 75 despite there being very limited existing infrastructure in that area, Kaai said.\n\n\u201cThese developers are gamblers,\u201d Kaai said. \u201cSo now we're taking the water and sewer [lines] out there, so they will have water and sewer for this other several hundred acres.\u201d\n\nGetting to the Lake Texoma area is also likely to get easier as an extension of the Dallas North Tollway could make the trip up from Dallas much quicker.\n\nConstruction is currently underway on the extension of the DNT from U.S. Highway 380 to FM 428. Design of the next phase of the project, which will extend the tollway from FM 428 to the Grayson County line, is scheduled to start in 2027. The Grayson County Regional Mobility Authority is looking at a project that would then extend the toll road farther north as the Grayson County Tollway.\n\nMcKinney city officials are moving forward with a $70M expansion plan for McKinney National Airport that would bring a commercial passenger terminal. Airports in the Durant area are also working to extend their runways and bring in commercial flights, Reed said.\n\nThese could service visitors to the upcoming attractions at Lake Texoma or things like the planned $200M surf and adventure resort development in McKinney and the \u201cgolf nirvana\u201d of the Omni PGA Frisco Resort, as Johnson called it.\n\nFrisco saw a boom in luxury hotels following the announcement of the PGA\u2019s plan to move to the suburb. Growth is likely to drive the same phenomenon across the region, adding rooms, increasing occupancy rates and boosting the average revenue hotels earn from occupied rooms, according to Frisco Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Christal Howard.\n\n\u201cEven with all the growth and additional hotels coming into the area, those metrics remain strong, and that's an indication of how desirable Frisco and the surrounding areas remain as a destination,\u201d Howard said. \u201cIt's great that there are so many opportunities to bring different types of people and audiences to the area and give them something that they're looking for.\u201d",

            "content": "Research and Development Feed Innovation in Mathematics\n\nWhile innovation may be said to be the watchword for CRDG in general, no section exemplified this approach more in 2008 than mathematics. From the teaching of mathematics through inquiry, to placing all students in a rigorous program that presents algebra in eighth grade and includes mathematics in every grade throughout high school, to continuing to develop the Measure Up program, which uses measurement experiences to help students develop ideas about equality and inequality that are key to continued success in developing mathematical thinking, the work of the CRDG Mathematics section has truly been ground-breaking. Their research in 2008 continued work on curriculum development and added an emphasis on technology in the classroom as a way of deepening understanding and improving student achievement.\n\nThe Mathematics section engaged in a National Science Foundation-funded research project to study the effects of formative assessment in a networked classroom on student learning of algebraic concepts in grade seven. Using the TI-Navigator system to create networked classrooms, this project aimed to advance mathematics learning for all students by researching ways for teachers to employ formative assessment strategies efficiently and effectively.\n\nTechnology in the classroom was also the focus of a project funded by the Texas Instruments Company to study applications of the TI-NSpire technology to improve learning of twelfth grade pre-calculus concepts.\n\nA second National Science Foundation grant funded a study of the role of gender in language used by children and their parents working on mathematical tasks. In addition to students in the Laboratory School, this research included student and parent teams from six public elementary schools in Hawai\u2018i. Researchers Judith and Melfreid Olson were interviewed for a feature story that was part of \u201cThe Sounds of Progress: The Changing Role of Girls and Women in Science and Engineering,\u201d an award-winning National Public Radio series.\n\nIn 2008, the Mathematics section also continued to provide professional development throughout the state, working with schools, complexes, or districts depending on the need. This year they worked with Lanakila Elementary, Blanche Pope Elementary, and Stevenson Middle schools; the Nanakuli, Pearl City, Waipahu Complex; and the Honolulu District.\n\nMeasure Up\n\nBased on a program created in Russia, Measure Up dates to 2000 when mathematics researchers at CRDG began adapting the concepts of the program for a contemporary audience. Measure Up\u2019s unique approach to learning mathematics not only includes reading, writing, speaking, and critical thinking, but also stresses multiple representations and connectivity. Dr. Barbara Dougherty, a member of the original Measure Up team, believes that, because of the unique way mathematics is taught in the program, by the end of sixth grade students will have completed the equivalent of a rigorous algebra course.\n\nFour characteristics guide the work in Measure Up to help young children become mathematical thinkers:\n\n1. Students\u2019 experiences with continuous quantities of volume, mass, length, and area introduce them to mathematical ideas, laying the foundation for algebraic thinking.\n\n2. An emphasis on communication engages students in talking about, listening to, and writing about mathematical ideas.\n\n3. Students represent the mathematics with continuous quantities pictorially and symbolically. These representations are used interchangeably rather than sequentially.\n\n4. Physical actions with continuous quantities allow students to make links to mathematical concepts being investigated.",

The stock's fantastic run is driven by powerful demand for the company's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips and related technology to enable artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe AI revolution had been gaining steam for several years but hit a big inflection point in late 2022 with OpenAI's launch of its ChatGPT chatbot. This event showcased generative AI technology, which opened up many more use cases for AI.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.

This equates to an almost 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Moreover, AI is poised for robust growth over the longer term.\n\nNvidia stock is still a great way to invest in AI. However, some investors might prefer to gain exposure to the AI space by buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds are bought and sold like stocks, but their diversification makes them less risky than individual stocks.\n\nOf course, it's not an either-or thing. Buying an AI stock or two and an AI-focused ETF can make good sense.\n\nThe best AI-focused ETF, in my opinion, is not one with artificial intelligence or AI in its name; it's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). Semiconductors, or chips, are the building blocks of AI infrastructure, such as servers in data centers and the electronic items AI is \"smartening\" up, from smartphones to cars.\n\nETF/Index 1-Year Return 3-Year Return 5-Year Return 10-Year Return VanEck Semiconductor ETF 43.9% 70% 258% 922% S&P 500 23.5% 30.7% 93.1% 242%\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF: Overview\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF, which began trading in 2011, is an index fund designed to track the performance of the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 index.

TheStreet\n\nHedge fund manager looks back to the Seventies\n\nLong-time money manager Doug Kass is seeing intriguing parallels between the state of the current market and the Wall Street of yesteryear\n\n\"With the 10-year Treasury yield reaching multi-month highs, my baseline expectation is that January 2025 could represent an important top in stocks \u2014 much like it did 53 years ago in 1972,\" the veteran hedge fund manager said.\n\nMore 2025 stock market forecasts\n\nIn 1972, Richard Nixon was president, a gallon of gas cost 36 cents, the median family income in the U.S. was $11,120, and the average individual income was over $6,000.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola's The Godfather was the highest-grossing film that year, and Roberta Flack's \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" was the top song.\n\n\"My theory has been that the December 2024/January 2025 market may resemble an important top similar to December 1972/January 1973,\" Kass said in a post on TheStreet Pro.\n\nHe noted that both periods featured combative presidents\u2014Richard Nixon in the past and incoming President-elect Donald Trump in the present.\n\nKass said that in both periods, interest rates and inflation increased from the prior few decades, and public sector debt was climbing rapidly.\n\n\"Like in 1972, we lack visibility today and a sense of fiscal responsibility on the part of our political leaders with regard to future fiscal policy,\" he said.\n\nKass said the forward P/E [price to earnings ratio] was extremely elevated in both periods. The market advance was not broadening out, and \u201canimal spirits\u201d took stock prices higher without a commensurate change in future profit forecasts, and the equity risk premium was paper thin.\n\n\"An epic market top was completed in January 1973 \u2014 leading to a poor year for the S&P Index, which marked the beginning of the end of the Nifty Fifty and several years of weak performance in the Indices,\" Kass said.\n\nKass expects something similar to that this month: \"an important market top, a down year for the averages and marked by the beginning of the end of the Mag 7, which could extend multiple years.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 was up more than 23% in 2024, and Wall Street analysts expect the bull market to continue for another year of double-digit performance.\n\nWarnings from the dot.com era\n\n\"The advent of Trump 2.0 is boosting the velocity of money since uncertainty has ended with his 'drill baby drill' and other pro-business policies,\" said Louis Navellier, chairman and Founder of Navellier & Associates.\n\nRelated: Veteran trader who correctly picked Palantir as top stock in 2024 reveals best stock for 2025\n\n\"For 2025, the companies I like most will be helping to expand the utility grid and cloud computing,\" he added.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Kass included in his column a March 3, 2000 memo about the end of the Nifty Fifty era written by legendary technical analyst Walter Deemer, with whom he worked nearly 50 years ago at Putnam Investments.\n\nDuring the dot.com tech bubble, people talked about the \"New Economy,\" a shift from a manufacturing and commodity-based economy to one that used technology to create new products and services.\n\n\"I've never seen anything even remotely comparable to the current chasm in the stock market between New Economy and Old Economy stocks,\" Deemer wrote in 2000.\n\nAt the time, Deemer wrote, \"The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which rose 85% in 1999, has risen another 16% so far this year,\u201c while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (whose 30 components happen to earn more than all of the NASDAQ stocks combined do) was recently off more than 14%.\u201d\n\nDeemer acknowledged the differences between the New Economy and the Nifty Fifty era but noted, \"the arrogance on the part of all too many money managers was disturbingly similar.\"\n\nThe prevailing attitude was that the Nifty Fifty stocks were the ones people had to own at any price, he said, and relative valuations were not even considered.\n\n\"The really tragic part of the Nifty Fifty story, though, was not what happened to the stocks during the 1974 bear market,\" he said. \"The really tragic part of the Nifty Fifty story was what happened to them in the months and years afterwards.\"\n\nDeemer said stocks underperformed throughout 1975, 1976, and 1977, and \"following a brief rally in 1978, the underperformance resurfaced and lingered on for another couple of years.\"\n\nOnly time will tell if 2025 mirrors 2000 and 1973. However, Kass thinks that possibility is far more likely than most investors think.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager issues dire S&P 500 warning for 2025",

            "content": "Building a portfolio capable of paying tens of thousands in dividends doesn't have to be complicated\n\nBuilding a portfolio full of high-quality dividend stocks that pay enough to cover your essential living expenses in retirement is a big goal for many investors.\n\nQuality dividend payers also tend to raise their dividend each year, more than offsetting inflation most of the time. That means if you can build an annual income big enough to retire on using dividends alone, you may be able to avoid selling any of your shares. Your heirs will certainly thank you for a very generous income-generating portfolio when you eventually pass it on to them.\n\nFortunately, you don't have to spend hours researching dividend stocks to pick out one or two quality companies to buy each month. Consistently investing in a simple exchange-traded fund (ETF) and reinvesting the dividends could result in a massive portfolio over time that pays you tens of thousands of dollars each year. This simple strategy could turn a $200 monthly investment into $25,000 in annual dividend income for patient investors.\n\nThe best dividend ETF you can buy\n\nGreat dividend stocks have a relatively long track record of payment, consistently raise their dividend, and have the financial wherewithal to keep raising it for years to come. That's why the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD 1.28%) is such an attractive fund for investors looking for dividend growth stocks.\n\nThe fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which selects 100 stocks issued by U.S. companies with a 10-year track record of paying dividends. On top of that, each company produces strong cash flow that more than covers debt and payments to shareholders, ensuring they can continue raising payments. Those criteria differentiate it from other dividend ETFs, which might select stocks based purely on yield or dividend growth without concern for potential payout cuts in the near future.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is full of great companies. Its top 10 holdings (and their forward dividend yields) are:\n\nPfizer (6.4%) Abbvie (3.6%) Coca-Cola (3.2%) Cisco Systems (2.7%) BlackRock (2%) Bristol Myers Squibb (4.4%) Texas Instruments (2.8%) Verizon Communications (6.8%) Amgen (3.7%) PepsiCo (3.7%)\n\nA few high-yield dividend stocks make it into the ETF's top holdings, but yield is far from the most important metric for weighting in the fund. Most of the top holdings have yields well below what you could get from Treasury bonds, but they hold a lot of potential to raise those payments over time. A great dividend growth stock could pay off much more in the long run than simply selecting investments with the highest yield today.\n\nThe Schwab fund has an expense ratio of just 0.06%, making it one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to invest in a variety of great dividend growth stocks.\n\nHow to turn $200 per month into $25,000 in annual dividends\n\nIf you consistently buy $200 worth of the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF each month, you'll eventually have a sizable portfolio. And if you automatically reinvest the dividends until you're ready to start living off your portfolio, you should see excellent returns.\n\nThe ETF has a 13.6% annual return since its inception in 2011. That's unlikely to continue; the last 13 years have been some of the best in stock market history.\n\nThe S&P 500 historically returns around 10% per year. Big mature dividend-paying stocks might return slightly less, on average. Investors will also have to account for the above-average tax drag on dividend stocks, so the fund might grow about 9% per year (when reinvesting dividends).\n\nThe ETF also has a 3.3% distribution yield over the trailing 12 months. That, too, may come down over time. That's because the Federal Reserve is currently looking to lower interest rates over the next few years, which could carry over to dividend yields (as a result of more investors moving capital to stocks and sending share prices higher). A 3% dividend yield may be a conservative long-term estimate.\n\nInvesting $200 per month based on the assumptions noted above (including the reinvestment of dividends) will lead to the following theoretical returns over time:\n\nAt the End of Year... Portfolio Value Annual Dividends 1 $2,499 $75 5 $14,948 $448 10 $37,946 $1,138 15 $73,331 $2,200 20 $127,776 $3,833 25 $211,546 $6,346 30 $340,436 $10,213 35 $538,749 $16,162 40 $843,879 $25,316\n\nThe above table is merely hypothetical. Anyone with even a little bit of experience with stocks knows they don't go up in a straight line every month. As a result, actual returns will look much different from the above table. That said, the longer your investment horizon is, the more likely real-world results will look similar to theoretical results.\n\nAnother consideration is that $25,000 won't be worth nearly as much in 40 years as it's worth today. Inflation will eat into the value of the dollar over time.\n\nEven with a modest 2% average annual inflation, $25,000 in 40 years won't be worth half as much as it's worth today. If your goal is $25,000 in today's dollars, you'll need to double your investment.\n\nYou'll find those challenges in any long-term investment planning exercise. It's important to remain flexible and adjust your strategy over time to ensure you reach your goals.\n\nBut by starting today, you can build a strong foundation for massive dividend payments in the future by consistently investing in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF each month.",

This chip, introduced with the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro, represents a significant leap in USB-C technology, handling power delivery and acting as a sophisticated microcontroller with access to critical internal systems.\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s enhanced security measures, researchers employed advanced techniques to bypass its defenses, raising questions about device security and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThe ACE3 controller, manufactured by Texas Instruments for Apple, is far more than a standard USB-C chip. It runs a complete USB stack and connects to internal device buses, such as the JTAG application processor and SPMI bus.\n\nThese capabilities make it an integral part of Apple\u2019s ecosystem but also an attractive target for security researchers.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the ACE2, which was relatively easier to exploit using software vulnerabilities and debugging interfaces, the ACE3 features personalized firmware updates, disabled debug interfaces, and cryptographically validated external flash memory.\n\nHacking Apple\u2019s New USB-C Controller\n\nResearchers began their investigation by analyzing the ACE2 to understand its architecture and vulnerabilities. Using hardware exploits on MacBooks and custom macOS kernel modules; they managed to backdoor the ACE2 persistently.\n\nHowever, the ACE3 posed a more formidable challenge due to its robust security enhancements.\n\nTo overcome these barriers, the team employed a combination of reverse engineering, RF side-channel analysis, and electromagnetic fault injection.\n\nThese techniques allowed them to gain code execution on the ACE3 chip. By carefully measuring electromagnetic signals during the chip\u2019s startup process, they identified the precise moment when firmware validation occurred.\n\nUsing electromagnetic fault injection at this critical juncture, they successfully bypassed the validation checks and booted a modified firmware patch into the chip\u2019s CPU.\n\nThis breakthrough has significant implications for device security. The ACE3\u2019s integration with internal systems means that compromising it could potentially lead to untethered jailbreaks or persistent firmware implants capable of compromising the main operating system.\n\nMalicious actors could exploit such vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or control over devices.\n\nThe research also highlights the evolving sophistication of hardware hacking techniques. Traditional software-based attacks are becoming less effective as companies like Apple implement more stringent security measures.\n\nAdvanced physical attacks like side-channel analysis and fault injection demonstrate how determined attackers can still find ways to exploit even highly secure systems.\n\nWhile this hack underscores potential vulnerabilities in Apple\u2019s hardware design, it also opens avenues for further research into securing custom chips like the ACE3.\n\nApple may need to explore additional countermeasures against physical attacks, such as improved shielding or more robust fault detection mechanisms.\n\nFor now, this development serves as a reminder that no system is entirely immune to exploitation. As technology advances, so too must our approaches to security\u2014both in terms of defense mechanisms and ethical considerations surrounding vulnerability disclosures.",

            "content": "STEM Focus Benefits Teachers and Students in Mathematics\n\nLesson Study Approach Brings New Insights to Teachers\n\nA request from the principal of Stevenson Middle School to expand on previous professional development work CRDG had conducted at his school has resulted in another partnership funded by the HIDOE Math Science Partnership program. The project, conducted by CRDG\u2019s Hannah Slovin and Melfried Olson, goes beyond the whole-school approach to involve all of the mathematics teachers at the middle school plus teachers at two of its feeder elementary schools.\n\nThe project, now in its second year, uses a professional development approach known as lesson study, a model first developed in Japan, that guides teachers in planning lessons with a focus on students and their understanding of a lesson. From a teacher\u2019s point of view, this is a very different approach from looking at a lesson primarily in terms of what the teacher does to teach the mathematics. In lesson study, a group of teachers collaborate to plan a \u201cresearch lesson\u201d that becomes the basis for inquiry about their practice.\n\nIn creating a lesson, teachers use a planning framework that guides them in formulating specific goals, anticipating student responses including misunderstandings, preparing strategies for addressing student reactions, and formatively assessing learning. This process encourages teachers to continually ask, \u201cwhy am I doing this\u2014what am I expecting students to do as a consequence of this?\u201d One teacher from the group teaches the new lesson as the others observe, focusing on students\u2019 learning, engagement, and reactions to the lesson activities. The group then discusses and revises the lesson for others to teach based on the observations. Thus, the lesson-study process enables teachers to reflect on teaching and learning and the connections between them. Slovin commented that \u201cthis approach works well with CRDG\u2019s philosophy of teaching and learning because we are not merely teaching teachers about an inquiry approach to learning, but giving them opportunities to use it in their own learning.\u201d\n\nCombining Learning with Teaching in Algebra Classrooms\n\nBuilding on CRDG\u2019s many years of research, teaching, and professional development work in algebra, Mike Gilbert is taking the opportunity of revising CRDG\u2019s algebra curriculum materials to expand into new areas of research that focus on measuring and improving teachers\u2019 content knowledge for teaching mathematics. While many studies say that teachers need to continually learn mathematics content, few programs provide teacher support materials that allow teachers to learn as they teach. Gilbert is involved in two projects in Hawai\u2019i schools that both use this approach.\n\nThe Designing Algebra Resources for Teaching (DART) project works with thirty teachers from Moanalua, Mililani, and Washington middle schools. Monthly full-day professional development sessions model mathematical tasks the teachers might use in their classrooms, demonstrating multiple entry points for problems and solutions that may be algebraic, graphical, numeric, visual, and contextual.\n\nAs Gilbert puts it, \u201d We do the math then unpack the math, tying it back to teaching practice.\u201d Following these discussions, teachers work in groups using the lesson study model to create new lessons.\n\nThe College Algebra Readiness for Every Student (CARES) project also uses an educative curriculum approach in working with high school students and their teachers. The goal of the project, which is working with teachers and students in three Hawai\u2019i high schools, is to prepare every student to enter college ready to take credit-bearing courses in mathematics. In addition to direct interventions such as providing students with access to online placement tests, the project works with teachers to increase their content knowledge for teaching.\n\nResearch Serves Schools in the Community\n\nThe story of the Measure Up project demonstrates how CRDG\u2019s research touches the community and has a direct impact on schools and students in Hawai\u2019i. Based on a program created in Russia, the Measure Up project started in 2001 when mathematics researchers at CRDG began adapting the translated materials for a contemporary audience and researching its development of algebraic thinking in children as young as first grade. Measure Up\u2019s unique approach to learning mathematics not only includes reading, writing, speaking, and critical thinking, but also stresses multiple representations and connectivity.\n\nIn 2004, the CRDG mathematics faculty was tapped by the Hawai\u2019i Department of Education to do a series of professional development sessions for all the schools in the Honolulu District, and much of what they did in these sessions came out of the research they were doing in Measure Up. These sessions resulted in a number of ongoing relationships that have led to a robust program of professional development for HIDOE teachers.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, CRDG\u2019s Maria DaSilva and a teacher from Kap\u0101lama Elementary School team-taught a two-week summer class for students based on the Measure Up curriculum, while CRDG\u2019s Claire Okazaki and Fay Zenigami taught a course for teachers. This course included Measure Up early grades mathematics content and incorporated observations of learning in the Measure Up class being taught to the Kap\u0101lama students.\n\nThe success of this approach resulted in yet another request from Kap\u0101lama that led Melfried Olson to apply for federal funds through the HIDOE Math Science Partnership program. The Kap\u0101lama Algebra Readiness in the Elementary School (KARES), a three-year project for the entire faculty of Kap\u0101lama Elementary School, is intended to improve teacher content knowledge in mathematics and the process standards.\n\nIn addition to serving in-service teachers directly through professional development that brings the latest research into their classrooms, the Measure Up project also helps preservice teachers understand how research impacts student learning. Students in the Math 112 classes at UH M\u0101noa, a required course for all applicants to the College of Education, are now a familiar sight in the Measure Up elementary classrooms at ULS. What began as an informal arrangement when UHM mathematics professor Joel Weiner learned about Measure Up and wanted his students to see the parallels between what they were learning and how math was being taught to these young children, has grown into a more formal ar\n\nrangement wherein all Math 112 students are required to visit a Measure Up classroom. It is clear that the visits are an \u201ceye opener,\u201d as one student put it, when we see some of their comments:\n\nI believe the most interesting thing about my visit was seeing how enthused the children were. It seemed as if every student was motivated to learn.\n\nI was surprised to see how capable these students were in learning what seemed \u201cadvanced\u201d to me. I was shocked when I first heard one of the students using the word supplement. I questioned if they actually knew what that meant, but after much observation it was clear that they did.\n\nI think the Measure Up program is very similar to our Math 112 class in that we are learning to explain and think about math concepts. It was interesting to see an elementary program so similar to a college program.\n\nAnother outcome of the Measure Up research is the publication this year of A Unit Story: Dr. Pill\u2019s Amazing Vitamin in print and DVD versions. This fanciful tale about a town of shrimp citizens and their problem-solving doctors helps students develop a conceptual understanding of the number line. Since many elementary textbook series present the number line as a \u201cgiven,\u201d this storybook is a unique resource on the construction of a number line that can be used to supplement any elementary mathematics curriculum.\n\nNSF, TI Continue to Support Mathematics Work\n\nAn ongoing relationship with Texas Instruments (TI) became formalized when CRDG\u2019s Judy Olson, Melfried Olson, and Hannah Slovin received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to investigate the use of formative assessment practices in mathematics to determine if networked calculator technology created by TI has a positive effect on student achievement. The Formative Assessment in a Networked Classroom (FANC) project, in its third year, involves thirty-one teachers in fifteen middle schools in Hawai\u2019i with a specific focus on algebraic concepts, the use of formative assessment, and the use of the TI-Navigator system and TI 73 calculators in networked classrooms.\n\nThe TI-Navigator system allows the teacher to view every student\u2019s progress on the calculator in real time. There are many advantages to this system as a formative assessment tool: information can be transferred between the teacher\u2019s computer and students\u2019 calculators instantly, students\u2019 work can be assessed and displayed for classroom discussion, and teachers can pre-store formative assessment questions and send them to students at the appropriate moment.\n\nFANC research questions address students\u2019 growth in achievement, teacher and student opinions and attitudes, and teachers\u2019 effectiveness in implementing formative assessment and the TI-Navigator system. This is a departure from the bulk of the research on technology systems that focuses primarily on the technology, and much less on the formative assessment strategies it allows to go on in the classroom.\n\nAs the FANC project was ending, Melfied Olson applied for and received funding from the HIDOE\u2019s Math Science Partnership program to continue working with teachers at Kal\u0101kaua Elementary School. The new project, which leverages the four TI-Navigatorequipped classrooms provided by the FANC project, provides professional development to all mathematics, special education, and English language learner teachers over a full school year.\n\nA second NSF-funded project that was completed this year studied the role of gender in language used by parents and children working on mathematical tasks. Funded by the NSF\u2019s Gender in Science and Engineering program, the three-year study investigated genderrelated differences in language and actions of one hundred third- and fourth-grade childparent dyads working on mathematical tasks, asking to what extent gender-related differences informed children\u2019s self-efficacy in mathematics and parents\u2019 competence beliefs for their children\u2019s success in mathematics.",

            "content": "Future Market Insights expects the industrial IoT (IIoT) segment alone to grow at a 12.1% CAGR between 2023 and 2033. Gartner says that by 2025, 25% of industrial companies will either acquire or invest in an industrial IoT platform. According to McKinsey, global IIoT spending will jump from $290 billion in 2024 to $500 billion in 2025.\n\nGartner, too, sees a 13.8% increase in semiconductor sales this year coming on top of a 18.8% increase in 2024. The research firm says that the strength is coming off the continued surge in AI-related semiconductor demand and recovery in electronic production, as offset by weakness in automotive and industrial markets. As far as end markets are concerned, PC growth will also be driven by AI and the end of support for Windows 10. Both commercial and enterprise deployment should increase. Driven by Internet connectivity across the developed and developing worlds and supportive technology such as sensor networks and AI adoption, the IoT market should also grow steadily over the next few years.\n\nAdvanced nodes (below 20nm) capacity is expected to increase by 12%, with utilization remaining above 90%. Most of the action is expected to be in Taiwan, the U.S. and Korea. Mature nodes utilization is expected to go from 70% in 2024 to above 75% this year. Wafer production is expected to increase 7%.\n\nThe latest data coming out of WSTS, which is also typically quoted by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), has global semiconductor sales growing 11.2% this year, on top of a 19% increase in 2024. The IDC also expects double-digit growth, with AI workloads driving demand for high-end logic process chips and high-bandwidth memory (HBM).\n\nGiven the strong growth outlook, share prices continue to soar, leading to rich valuations. Despite concerns about a possible recession, 2024 turned out better than expected. Part of the reason is of course the fact that semiconductors and technology in general constitute one of the pillars balancing out any moderation in the economy.\n\nCompanies in the Semiconductor \u2013 General industry are at the forefront of the ongoing technological revolution based on HPC, AI, electrified and automated driving, IoT, etc. The semiconductors they produce enable the cloud to function and help analyze data into actionable insights that can be used by companies to operate more efficiently.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAI and IoT will together continue to revolutionize industrial operations. AI will continue to drive major shifts in auto electrification, industrial automation, data center efficiency and more. The sky seems to be the limit for semiconductor growth.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government's target of reducing dependence on China, and onshoring projects with national security implications will shape the future of this industry.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe companies grouped under the Semiconductor \u2013 General category produce a broad range of semiconductor devices, both integrated and discrete, like microprocessors, graphics processors, embedded processors, chipsets, motherboards, wireless and wired connectivity products, DLPs and analog, serving multiple end markets. It includes companies like NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Intel and STMicroelectronics.\n\nMajor Themes Shaping the Industry\n\nArtificial intelligence is the single largest driver of the industry because of the transformation it is bringing in efficiency, cost-effectiveness, automation, safety, environmental benefits and so forth. AI has become an imperative for effective competition, irrespective of the industry. Technology companies are building their own where possible and buying where it makes sense. For everybody else, this is an investment they have to make. Moreover, the more companies use it, the more necessary it becomes. In this backdrop, data-intensive applications, advancements in machine learning algorithms and increasing urbanization, as well as dynamics in the auto and financial services markets are major drivers. The growth this is spurring in the semiconductor industry is likely to continue for years to come.\n\nMacroeconomic and geopolitical factors support growth. With interest rates coming down and demand side factors such as inflation also coming under control, we can finally focus on industry specific issues. These too are looking up, with the inventory imbalance now limited to pockets. Geopolitical tensions are adding a dimension to this demand, as countries increasingly adopt the latest technology in defense, infrastructure and other critical applications. As weapon sales accelerate the world over, demand for the most sophisticated underlying electronics will only go up.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the long-term prospects are extremely bright because the industry is on the building-block side of technology, making it crucial for the proliferation of the Internet and the ongoing broad-based digitization, there are some near-term concerns . The automotive electronics segment for instance is an area of evolving needs, as the world continues to move toward EVs and hybrids. However, some recent trends indicate that customers are moving away from premium offerings. ADAS, infotainment and electronic control units (ECUs) remain attractive, with safety and fuel efficiency being top concerns. Automation and robotics, with increasing adoption across industrial operations, are other promising areas but the recovery is slow as of now.\n\nSemiconductor supply chains are adjusting. Semiconductor supply chains have become increasingly efficient over the years. While this has brought down cost, the just-in-time model has made the supply chains relatively unreliable in case of external disruptions, as happened during the pandemic, or when China imposed its zero tolerance COVID shutdowns. This, along with other factors, such as the U.S.-imposed restraints on dealing with China is leading semiconductor companies to diversify their supply chains and reduce their dependence on the country. This is an ongoing process that will take several years. In the meantime, there is a growing concern that all the most important leading-edge chips are currently made in Taiwan, a country that China has threatened to annex. Since this has national security implications, there is an ongoing drive to onshore manufacturing. The CHIPS Act is facilitating the process.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Risks Despite Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductor-General Industry is a stock group within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #195, which places it in the bottom 22% of the 250+ Zacks-classified industries.\n\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates that near-term prospects are weakening. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nAn industry's positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is normally because the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate is relatively strong. The opposite is true for stocks in the bottom 50% of industries. In this case, the aggregate earnings estimate for 2024 is down 45.5% from the year-ago level, while the aggregate earnings estimate for 2025 is up 62.6% from last year. Big players like Intel, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments are seeing their 2024 estimates declining, and this has affected the industry's performance.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nStock Market Performance Remains Strong\n\nTracking the performance of the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General Industry over the past year shows that the industry has traded at a premium to both the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector and the S&P 500 index throughout the year, steadily widening its lead.\n\nThe industry has gained 118.4% over the past year. The broader technology sector gained 35.1% while the S&P 500 index gained 25.5%.\n\nCurrent Valuation Is Rich\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, we see that the industry is currently trading at a 36.51X multiple, which is below its median value of 37.87X over the past year. However, since the S&P 500 trades at 22.11X and the sector trades at 27.22X, the industry appears significantly overvalued.\n\nIt's worth noting that the industry has traded much closer to the sector in the last 10 years, trailing it at first, then slightly beating it. But it has really pulled ahead from the middle of 2022, most likely because companies are scrambling to acquire the basic building blocks for AI, autonomous driving, defense and other mega trends driving the market today.\n\n2 Stocks to Consider\n\nThe industry continues to look good and it will benefit from further interest cuts this year, which typically drives more money into risky assets. Several of the technology heavyweights in this industry are the backbone of how computing is done these days, so we remain optimistic over the long run. The only stumbling block is the valuation. We continue to like NVIDIA and think that SUMCO is worth keeping an eye on:\n\nNVIDIA Corp.: Santa Clara, CA-based NVIDIA provides graphics, and compute and networking solutions in the U.S., Taiwan, China and other markets. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most popular in the gaming segment. NVIDIA is also at the leading edge of enterprise, data center, cloud and automotive deployments today.\n\nGenerative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements. Because NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, energy-efficient and has low total cost of ownership, companies are rapidly transitioning to its products to train and deploy AI. NVIDIA GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software are all growth engines. They are opening up opportunities and leading to broad-based growth across geographies and markets.\n\nThe automotive, financial services, healthcare and telecom verticals are particularly strong, as AI and accelerated computing are quickly becoming integral to customers' innovation road maps and competitive positioning. The data center business is the strongest right now, driven by demand for data processing, training and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies.\n\nNVIDIA is also seeing momentum across professional visualization and automotive (recent collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi). The company also gives away billions to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.\n\nIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2025 moved up 12 cents (4.3%) and for the following year up 38 cents (10%).\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rated stock is up 163.7% in the past year.\n\nSUMCO Corp.\n\nTokyo, Japan-based SUMCO (formerly Sumitomo Mitsubishi Silicon Corp.) manufactures and sells silicon wafers for semiconductor manufacturers in Japan, the U.S., China, Taiwan and Korea. The company offers polished, annealed, epitaxial, junction isolated, silicon-on-insulator and reclaimed polished wafers, as well as monocrystalline ingots. It counts both TSMC and Samsung, the leading semiconductor foundries, as its customers.\n\nIn the last-reported quarter, Sumco continued to see a moderate recovery in demand for its 300mm wafers for both logic and memory chips, as demand for AI-driven computing continued to accelerate. The softness at 200mm continued however, reflecting industrywide weakness because the recovery in consumer, industrial and automotive markets remained sluggish.\n\nThe company continued to harness AI to improve its own productivity and investing in R&D to maintain its share at the leading edge of chip manufacturing.\n\nIn the last 7 days, analysts have raised their 2024 estimates by 7 cents (6.5%) and their 2025 estimates by 73 cents (41.2%).\n\nIn the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated stock has slumped 47.5%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nJoin us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\n\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

After retiring in Chappell Hill, he and his wife, Jody, became members of St. Peter\u2019s Episcopal Church in Brenham for twenty years and later became members of First Baptist Church Chappell Hill.\n\nAfter attending public school in Orange, Texas he began his studies at Southwest Texas State Teachers College in San Marcos, followed by a nine month study at U.S. Army Technical School at Ft. Bliss, Texas. He completed Electrical Engineering studies at The University of Texas at Austin in 1958.\n\nAfter graduating from University of Texas, Mr. Clough worked at Texas Instruments in Dallas, Texas where he was assigned to find applications for the then-new transistor. Later he was responsible for the integration and testing of the Lunar Landing system for NASA\u2019s project Apollo leading to a successful soft landing on the moon in 1969. He often mused about his finger prints being on the moon. Afterwards he was cited by the U.S. Navy for his contributions in adapting the lunar landing technology to helicopters allowing all weather rescue operations. His early work in this area was significant in the development of terrain following radar, which is used in military aircraft today. He ended his career with Stewart and Stevenson Services in Houston, Texas in 1997 and moved to Chappell Hill. After retirement, he conducted Electric Power System lectures for Stewart and Stevenson, GE and other electric power generation companies in more than twenty countries. In 2013 he authored a text book titled: \u201cElectric Power System Fundamentals\u201d published by Chain Bridges Press which was used in many colleges across the United States. He was also a guest columnist for the Brenham Banner Press where he wrote about world history.\n\nBob was very involved in the community of Chappell Hill. He was a member of the Chappell Hill Historical Society and gave tours of the town during the Bluebonnet Festival and Scarecrow Festival. He also was a charter member and a Paul Harris fellow in the Rotary Club of Washington County.\n\nHe had a lifelong enjoyment of writing both fiction and nonfiction. His other activities were serving his church, including bringing meals to shut ins, music, flying airplanes, playing golf at the Brenham Country Club, reading history and assembling a collection of his favorite books. He loved meeting new people and making new friends. He will be missed by his family and friends.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 44 years, Joann \u201cJody\u201d Clough; daughter Sandra Zoppe; son, James F. Clough; step children: Robin and Scott Harris, Steven Johnson, Pamela and George Waldren; and many grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\nPallbearers will be Rick Mitchell, Phil Bartlet, Larry Miller, Bill Lane, George Waldren, Lazlo Zoppe, Eric Johnson and Kyle King. With Honorary Pallbearers Daivid Toalson, Chuck West and Richard Waldren.\n\nFuneral services will be held at First Baptist Church in Chappell Hill on Thursday, January 16 at 11 am.

It also features \u2018filled via\u2019 technology for higher native contrast, resulting in unmatched image clarity, brightness and efficiency. Digital Projection\u2019s unique ColorBoost + Red Laser technology improves the E-Vision 16000i\u2019s visual capabilities even more by producing reds and a colour gamut greatly exceeding REC709 standards.\n\nDigital Projection E-Vision 16000i\n\nThe new E-Vision RGB offers a significant advancement in 1-chip projection technology, attaining the full REC 2020 colour space at 4K+ resolution. This results in cinematic-grade visuals without the artefacts associated with traditional 1-Chip DLP projectors with colour wheels. With 10,000 lumens and HDR compatibility, the RGB laser-illuminated E-Vision RGB produces amazingly realistic visuals with dynamic contrast ratios of up to 10,000:1.\n\nStand #3K700 will also feature the M-Vision 30000 WU, the brightest 1-chip DLP projector on the market with 30,000 lumens, and the E-Vision 15000i 4K+, which has the same 0.8\u2033 HEP DMD as the 16000i, excels in multi-channel set-ups thanks to its Nexus electronics platform, and is ideal for blending due to the extra pixels the 4K+ resolution provides.\n\nAhead of ISE, the company reaffirmed its \u201cperformance guaranteed\u201d promise with a market-leading five-year warranty, demonstrating its dedication to its customers and its confidence in the quality of its products.\n\nNew possibilities in projection\n\nWhereas complex installations requiring advanced warp and blend were previously reliant on costly third-party applications, Digital Projection\u2019s recently released software tech stack, powered by its next-generation electronics platform, Nexus, enables users to design and implement an entire installation entirely within the projector ecosystem.\n\nSeveral Nexus-powered tools, such as Advanced Align, Projector Controller II, and Multi Projection Simulator Pro, will be on show at ISE, and visitors to the Digital Projection stand will be able to demo them in a dedicated software area. Attendees will see how the tech stack allows for automatic projector calibration, including advanced align, warp, and blend, directly in the projector hardware. This greatly simplifies the configuration process and saves AV professionals time, money, and unnecessary problems.\n\nAlong with a hands-on demo area and immersive room, both of which have been created to show the power of the advanced warp and blend at the heart of the Nexus tech stack, stand #3K700 will feature a tunnel installation with end-to-end projection mapping via a single Digital Projection projector. Visitors to the tunnel experience will discover how to quickly and simply build immersive spaces in curved or dome surroundings by combining an affordable E-Vision projector and a hemispherical lens.\n\nMark Wadsworth, vice president of global marketing at Digital Projection, says: \u201cFor ISE 2025, Digital Projection is excited to demonstrate how our latest innovations are redefining what\u2019s possible in projection.\n\n\u201cIn addition to delivering world-beating colour accuracy and performance, our latest projectors mark a huge step forward when it comes to energy efficiency, using only half the power of comparable models from just three years ago. Our commitment to efficiency and quality \u2013 underlined by our five-year warranty \u2013 ensures that our products not only meet the needs of AV professionals but also align with a more sustainable future.\u201d\n\nFor more information, ISE 2025 attendees are invited to visit Digital Projection in Hall 3 at stand #3K700. ISE returns to the Fira de Barcelona from 4 to 7 February 2025.\n\nDigital Projection recently revealed that its M-Vision projectors were chosen by CS Prod, a French projection mapping expert, for its project celebrating the history of King Louis XIII.",

Its AWRL6844 60GHz mmWave radar sensor supports occupancy monitoring for seat belt reminder systems, child presence detection and intrusion detection with a single chip running edge AI algorithms, facilitating a safer driving environment. With its next-generation audio DSP core, the AM275x-Q1 MCUs and AM62D-Q1 processors make premium audio features more affordable. Together with the company's latest analogue products, including the TAS6754-Q1 Class-D audio amplifier, engineers can take advantage of a complete audio amplifier system offering.\n\n\"Today's drivers expect any car \u2013 entry-level to luxury, combustion to electric \u2013 to have enhanced in-cabin experiences,\" said Amichai Ron, senior vice president, TI Embedded Processing. \"TI continues to provide innovative technologies to enable the future of the automotive driving experience. Our edge AI-enabled radar sensors allow automakers to make vehicles safer and more responsive to the driver, while our audio systems-on-chip elevate the drive through more immersive audio. Together, they create a whole new level of in-cabin experiences.\"\n\nOEMs are gradually designing in more sensors to improve the in-vehicle experience and fulfil evolving safety standards. The company's edge AI-enabled AWRL6844 60GHz mmWave radar sensor allows engineers to include three in-cabin sensing features to replace multiple sensor technologies, such as in-seat weight mats and ultrasonic sensors, lowering total implementation costs.\n\nThe AWRL6844 integrates four transmitters and four receivers, allowing high-resolution sensing data at an optimised cost for OEMs. This data feeds into application-specific AI-driven algorithms on a customisable on-chip hardware accelerator and DSP, enhancing decision-making accuracy and reducing processing time.\n\nAs driver expectations grow for elevated in-cabin experiences across vehicle models, OEMs aim to deliver premium audio while minimising design complexity and system cost. AM275x-Q1 MCUs and AM62D-Q1 processors decrease the number of components needed for an automotive audio amplifier system by integrating the company's vector-based C7x DSP core, Arm cores, memory, audio networking and hardware security module into a single, functional safety-capable SoC. The C7x core and a matrix multiply accelerator form a neural processing unit that processes traditional and edge AI-based audio algorithms. These scalable automotive audio SoCs allow designers to meet memory and performance needs, from entry-level to high-end systems, with minimal redesign and investment.\n\nThe company's next-generation C7x DSP core achieves more than four times the processing performance of other audio DSPs, allowing audio engineers to manage multiple features within a single core. AM275x-Q1 MCUs and AM62D-Q1 processors enable immersive audio inside the cabin with spatial audio, active noise cancellation, sound synthesis and advanced vehicle networking, including Audio Video Bridging over Ethernet.\n\n\"Dolby's longtime collaboration with Texas Instruments has enabled incredible audio experiences in the home, which we're now bringing into the car,\" said Andreas Ehret, senior director of Automotive Business at Dolby Laboratories. \"With TI's C7x DSP core, we can now deliver the latest Dolby Atmos capabilities more efficiently, including support for even smaller form factor audio systems so nearly all vehicles can have Dolby Atmos. Together, these products can help turn every car ride into an immersive entertainment experience.\"\n\nTo further optimise their automotive audio designs, engineers can use the company's TAS6754-Q1 audio amplifier with innovative 1L modulation technology to deliver class-leading audio performance and power consumption, with half the number of inductors compared to existing Class-D amplifiers. The TAS67xx-Q1 family of devices, which integrates real-time load diagnostics required by OEMs, enables engineers to simplify designs, decrease costs, and improve efficiency without sacrificing audio quality.\n\nVisit Texas Instruments at CES 2025 from Tuesday, Jan. 7 through Friday, Jan 10 in the Las Vegas Convention Center North Hall, meeting room No. N116; and Thursday, Jan 9 at 4 p.m. Pacific Standard time: Fern Yoon will participate in 'The Road Ahead: Software Defined Vehicles'.\n\n\n\n",

The company said she\u2019ll transition to senior marketing advisor until her retirement.\n\nShuffling legal and administrative roles\n\nBill Van Asselt has been promoted to chief legal officer, succeeding Abby Diaz, who has been elevated to the newly created position of chief administrative officer.\n\nVan Asselt, who will assume direct leadership of the legal team, joined Tyler through the acquisition of NIC Inc., in 2021, where he worked for nearly 11 years. Before NIC, where he served as general counsel for five years, Van Asselt practiced law at Lathrop & Gage LLP in Kansas City, Missouri. Since joining Tyler, Van Asselt has served as deputy chief legal officer.\n\nDiaz, in her expanded role as chief administrative officer, will continue to oversee Tyler\u2019s legal team and adds responsibility for Internal Audit, Data Privacy, Corporate Governance and Responsibility, as well as Corporate Communications, the company said.\n\nTyler said this move strengthens alignment across these critical functions, supporting Tyler\u2019s long-term growth and enabling an integrated approach to governance, compliance, and communications.\n\nDiaz will also continue as Tyler\u2019s corporate secretary, the company said.\n\n\u2018A more formal approach\u2019 to client experiences\n\nThe company also announced the appointment of Andrew Kahl as the company\u2019s first-ever chief client officer.\n\nKahl will be responsible for overseeing and continuing to enhance the experience of Tyler\u2019s thousands of public sector clients from more than 13,000 locations, the company said.\n\n\u201cThe key to Tyler\u2019s ongoing success is the trust our clients place in our organization and our teams, and it\u2019s something we steward carefully,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAndrew\u2019s leadership and expertise will allow us to execute a more formal approach to the client experience that will serve Tyler and our clients for years to come.\u201d\n\nBefore joining Tyler, Kahl was CEO and board member of BackBox Software, a global software category leader in the network security automation market. While at Plano-based BackBox, he led the strategic transformation of a native SaaS and cloud-hosted product, enhanced services offerings, and transitioned the go-to-market motion from a perpetual to a subscription revenue model. Under his leadership, the company achieved significant year-over-year revenue growth and doubled its North American customer base.\n\nBefore BackBox, Kahl served as chief customer officer at SailPoint, and as vice president of customer success delivery at NetApp. He co-founded Credant Technologies, a leader in data encryption security software, which was acquired by Dell Technologies in 2012.\n\nTyler said it has more than 44,000 successful installations and clients in all 50 states, Canada, the Caribbean, Australia, and other international locations.\n\nGet on the list.\n\nDallas Innovates, every day.\n\nSign up to keep your eye on what\u2019s new and next in Dallas-Fort Worth, every day.",

            "content": "CES 2025 has been a mixed bag for humanoid robots. The form factor had a watershed moment, as images of the top players flanked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his Monday keynote.\n\nOf these, Agility\u2019s Digit also showed up alongside a miniature conveyer belt at a closed-access Nvidia booth. It was a nice return for the bipedal robot, an older form of which appeared at CES 2020 as part of Ford\u2019s showcase.\n\nBeyond this, humanoid representation has largely been limited to smaller companies, with the exception of Apptronik. The Austin firm\u2019s Apollo robot made an appearance as part of Texas Instruments\u2019 presence at the show. The humanoid utilizes some of the Dallas-based semiconductor giant\u2019s modules internally.\n\nImage Credits:Apptronik\n\nAfter a few near misses, this was the first time I\u2019ve seen Apollo in-person. When Apptronik showed TechCrunch the first footage of the robot in 2023, I had to double check that it wasn\u2019t an animated render. There\u2019s something other-worldly about the robot. It\u2019s honestly refreshing, as so much of the competition has offered similar aesthetic visions for humanoids: dark, sterile, even apocalyptic.\n\nApollo is bright and almost cartoony, with a pair of big eyes and a head shape that brings back warm memories of early iMacs. Like other first-gen humanoids, Apollo will largely focus on factory work, but just because it\u2019s destined for an industrial setting doesn\u2019t mean it has to be unwelcoming and cold.\n\nImage Credits:Brian Heater\n\nApollo\u2019s movements were smooth, and the robot even hammed it up for the camera as I snapped some photos. It should be noted, however, that this was an extremely limited pick-and-place demo that exists for demonstration purposes only. This was not the intelligent, autonomous version of the robot set to be deployed in factories.\n\nNotably, Apptronik began factory pilots with Mercedes in March, following the announcement of similar deals between Figure and BMW and Agility and Amazon.",

            "content": "Dallas, Texas-based Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN) designs, manufactures and sells semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers. Valued at a market cap of $175.3 billion, the company is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. It is expected to announce its fiscal Q4 earnings results after the market closes on Thursday, Jan. 23.\n\nPrior to this event, analysts expect the semiconductor company to report a profit of $1.19 per share, down 20.1% from $1.49 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has a solid track record of consistently beating Wall Street's bottom-line estimates in the last four quarters. Its earnings of $1.47 per share in the previous quarter outpaced the forecasted figure by a notable margin of 8.1%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect TXN to report an EPS of $5.08, down 27.6% from $7.02 in fiscal 2023. Nonetheless, in fiscal 2025, EPS is expected to grow 12.6% year-over-year to $5.72.\n\nShares of TXN have gained 16.4% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming both the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 25.8% rise and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLK) 27.1% return over the same time frame.\n\nTXN\u2019s shares soared 4% in the subsequent trading session after its Q3 earnings release on Oct. 22. The company\u2019s revenue decreased 8.4% year-over-year to $4.2 billion but surpassed the Wall Street estimates of $4.1 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings of $1.47 per share fell 20.5% from the year-ago quarter but exceeded the consensus estimate by a significant margin of 8%.\n\nRobust growth in its Personal Electronics, Enterprise Systems, and Communication Equipment markets primarily contributed to its better-than-expected performance. Moreover, the top and bottom-line figures came at the higher end of the management\u2019s guidance. This might have further bolstered investor confidence.\n\nWall Street analysts are moderately optimistic about Texas Instruments\u2019 stock, with a \"Moderate Buy\" rating overall. Among 30 analysts covering the stock, 10 recommend \"Strong Buy,\" 16 suggest \u201cHold,\u201d one indicates a \u201cModerate Sell,\u201d and three suggest \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d This configuration is slightly more bullish than three months ago, with nine analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating\n\nThe average analyst price target for TXN is $211.33, indicating a modest 9.9% potential upside from the current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Biomedical engineering in the late 1980s operated like the small steam engine that possibly could. But with subsequent advances in nanotechnology and cost reduction due to scaling, the discipline now looks more like a bullet train ever accelerating.\n\n\u201cThe technology that cost tens of thousands a few decades ago now costs a few dollars,\u201d said Ahmad Bahai, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at Texas Instruments, who presented the keynote lecture during the 2024 North Texas Biomedical Engineering Symposium at UT Southwestern. \u201cThe beauty of many of these technologies is that they are scalable.\u201d\n\nKeynote lecturer Ahmad Bahai, Ph.D.\n\nThe inaugural symposium, held on the UTSW campus and sponsored by UT Southwestern\u2019s Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) in collaboration with UT Dallas, UT Arlington, the University of North Texas, and Southern Methodist University, took place Nov. 14-15 and drew hundreds of scientists and students from this increasingly important field. The regional symposium is the first to bring together all five engineering programs in North Texas, inspired by the success in 2023 of a UTSW-sponsored symposium.\n\nDr. Bahai\u2019s presentation, \u201cBridging Health Science and Semiconductor Technology: Challenges and Opportunities,\u201d included some of the potential pathways to address and improve personalized health care, which now accounts for 20% of the gross domestic product. \u201cThat balloon is getting bigger and bigger, but is it getting more efficient?\u201d Dr. Bahai rhetorically asked.\n\nDr. Bahai presented three railways upon which biomedical potential has the opportunity to become expansive biomedical reality. These paths \u2013 semiconductors and nanotechnology, biology and biochemistry advances, and artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2013 have the ability and opportunity to reshape personalized medicine.\n\nOther emerging BME applications include ultrasonic blood pressure monitors, microneedles for drug delivery, and even smart fabrics with sleeves that will include technology driving information-gathering data.\n\nSamir Mitragotri, Ph.D., receives a plaque from Samuel Achilefu, Ph.D., Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, for presenting the Kam Family Lectureship in Biomedical Engineering.\n\nSamir Mitragotri, Ph.D., Professor of Bioengineering at Harvard University, presented the Kam Family Lectureship in Biomedical Engineering. His talk, \u201cA Hitchhiker\u2019s and Backpacker\u2019s Approach to Drug Delivery,\u201d outlined some of his lab\u2019s advancements in understanding and overcoming the biology of the body\u2019s natural metabolic processes and transport barriers to more effectively diagnose and treat ailments including diabetes, cancer, arthritis, hemorrhage, and infections.\n\nThese barriers, he said, are in the brain, skin, liver, and intestines, all working to protect the body from foreign invaders. Unfortunately, today\u2019s pharmaceuticals and therapies often are identified by the body as \u201cinvaders,\u201d thereby limiting delivery and absorption to 1% or less of dosage, he said. Dr. Mitragotri\u2019s team has developed novel technologies to overcome these natural defense barriers, including:\n\nCell-adhered \u201cbackpacks\u201d that attach to monocytes, circulate in tandem, and target delivery to inflamed skin, lungs, or the brain in response to natural biological cues\n\nNanoparticles that can hitch a ride on red blood cells, allowing them to evade immune clearance and target organs such as lungs and the spleen\n\nSalt-based ionic liquids that have highly tunable natures and wide-ranging physiochemical properties for various applications, including transdermal drug delivery of proteins and siRNAs, oral delivery of proteins including antibodies, treatment of skin and ocular infections, vaccine adjuvants and mucosal delivery agents, among others\n\nAll these advances, he said, were driven to reality by following a long-standing bioengineering dogma. \u201cUnderstand what you can, approximate what you don\u2019t understand, and appreciate how things are connected,\u201d Dr. Mitragotri said. \u201cIt often isn\u2019t what you know, it\u2019s how you use what you know that makes the difference.\u201d\n\nIn another presentation, Nicole Small, President of Lyda Hill Philanthropies, explained how philanthropic support can be approached in addition to state- or federal-generated grants in her talk, \u201cSupporting Biomedical Engineering in North Texas.\u201d Ms. Small said budding hypotheses are as valued as research ideas that are close to commercial or biomedical success. \u201cWe are not afraid of high-risk, high-reward projects,\u201d she said. \u201cLyda Hill (founder of Lyda Hill Philanthropies) has always approached modern issues with a singular belief: \u2018Science is the answer.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the symposium\u2019s second day, top leaders from some of North Texas\u2019 educational campuses \u2013 UTSW, UTD, UTA, UNT, and SMU \u2013 discussed their common experiences and some of the emerging strategies and plans for trans-institutional collaborations. Although their educational specialties and interests varied from biomedical engineering, bioengineering, or chemical engineering, all agreed that North Texas institutions operating within the nation\u2019s fourth largest population center need to be the matchmakers that connect effective and efficient tech teams with timely, far-reaching challenges.\n\nDr. Achilefu speaks about the opportunities to collaborate with other institutions during a panel discussion.\n\nIn support of these emerging coalition opportunities, Samuel Achilefu, Ph.D., Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and W. P. Andrew Lee, M.D., Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, Provost, and Dean of UT Southwestern Medical School, announced the formation of the North Texas Network of Biomedical Engineers, a virtual clearinghouse for collaboration, discussion, and sharing of ideas, projects, and opportunities across institutions. The network dovetails into the symposium\u2019s goals of fostering collaboration, stimulating creativity, embracing innovation, engaging stakeholders, and expanding trainees\u2019 networking, Dr. Achilefu said.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky at UT Southwestern, as biomedical engineers are not seen as outsiders. Here, we don\u2019t have to negotiate to gain access,\u201d Dr. Achilefu said. \u201cBME typically has to go to clinicians and ask what they need. We are trying to change that paradigm, as the network will allow clinicians to present their challenges and for us to then share those for consideration across multiple institutions.\u201d\n\nThe symposium\u2019s second day took place on North Campus, while the first day\u2019s events occurred in the Texas Instruments Biomedical Engineering and Sciences Building on East Campus (see related story on Symposium Healthcare Challenge).

            "content": "Provizio taps TI for single-chip 4D Imaging radar Business news | January 8, 2025 By Nick Flaherty\n\n\n\nIrish radar developer Provizio has shown a software-defined antenna reference board built with the AWR2944 sensor from Texas Instruments.\n\nThe software-defined antenna increases the radar resolution by more than 20x, balancing the cost and performance challenges of imaging radar.\n\nAt the heart of the imaging radar system is the integration of Provizio\u2019s MIMSO software-defined antenna reference design with the TI 77GHz 4D imaging radar chip. This uses the single radar SoC for 48 virtual receiver channels, achieving sub 0.5\u00b0 angular resolution and enabling precise detection and tracking of objects, including pedestrians, cars, and trucks. Last year TI showed a radar sensor with a new architecture for lower cost implementations.\n\nThe reference design is on display at CES 2025 in Las Vegas with a live vehicle demonstration (above).\n\nThe MIMSO Software-Defined Antenna Reference Design for Single Chip 77GHz 4D/Imaging Radar is aimed at automotive & industrial OEMs and Tier 1s. By delivering precise, real-time detection and tracking of objects such as pedestrians and vehicles, it enhances a vehicle\u2019s ability to respond to potential hazards. The company has a manufacturing deal with Tier One supplier Mergon.\n\n\u201cWe have known for some time that 4D Imaging radar is key to unlocking safer driving and next generation ADAS, however cost has been a key challenge that has held back rollout across all vehicles. This work between Provizio and TI balances the perception and system cost challenges of high-performance imaging radar,\u201d said Barry Lunn, CEO & Co-Founder of Provizio in Shannon.\n\n\u201cTo achieve 0.5deg angular resolution using just a single TI radar chip is a testament to the proprietary antenna innovation of the Provizio development team and also the embedded power of the TI radar SoC.\u201d\n\nwww.provizio.ai\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : If you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : eeNews on Google News\n\nShare:",

            "content": "Investors in Texas Instruments Inc. (Symbol: TXN) saw new options begin trading today, for the February 28th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the TXN options chain for the new February 28th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $170.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.06. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $170.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $167.94 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of TXN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $190.46/share today.\n\nBecause the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 11% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 83%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.21% return on the cash commitment, or 8.67% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Texas Instruments Inc., and highlighting in green where the $170.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $195.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of TXN stock at the current price level of $190.46/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $195.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.59% if the stock gets called away at the February 28th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if TXN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Texas Instruments Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing TXN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $195.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $195.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.20% boost of extra return to the investor, or 22.92% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 35%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $190.46) to be 27%.

The question of the future of traditional PLCs is complex, and it is evolving.\n\nTraditional PLCs still play a critical role in many industrial automation systems. They were built for deterministic, high-performance control in environments that demand high reliability. For many industrial applications, this remains the core strength of PLCs. They are optimized for tasks like discrete logic control, safety-critical operations and simple motion commands, where performance, uptime and safety are paramount.\n\nThey have historically been very robust, built to withstand extreme temperatures, vibration and other harsh industrial conditions. This makes them suitable for applications like heavy machinery, mining, oil and gas, and other rugged environments. They also offer a straightforward programming environment\u2014often in ladder logic, function block diagrams or structured text\u2014 which is simpler for engineers and technicians to learn and troubleshoot. This simplicity is still a significant advantage in many industries.\n\nPLCs have been the backbone of industrial automation for decades, and many factories still rely on them because they integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, provide strong vendor support and conform to industry standards.\n\nIn niche applications where determinism, simplicity, reliability and certification are critical, PLCs will likely continue to dominate. These applications include safety, smaller control systems and legacy systems.\n\nPLCs may not evolve dramatically, but they will likely integrate more closely with industrial PCs (IPCs) and soft PLCs in hybrid systems\u2014PLCs can handle simple tasks, while IPCs handle complex, data-driven tasks.\n\nWe\u2019re likely to see more of this hybrid approach in the future. PLCs will coexist with IPCs in many industrial settings. PLCs will handle straightforward control tasks, and industrial PCs will manage the more complex and interconnected systems.",

            "content": "The BDN Opinion section operates independently and does not set news policies or contribute to reporting or editing articles elsewhere in the newspaper or on bangordailynews.com\n\nKelsi G Hobbs is an assistant professor of economics at the University of Maine. She is a member of the Maine chapter of the national Scholars Strategy Network, which brings together scholars across the country to address public challenges and their policy implications. Members\u2019 columns appear in the BDN every other week.\n\nIn his 1954 text, \u201cHow to Lie with Statistics,\u201d Darrel Huff wrote: \u201cThe secret language of statistics, so appealing in a fact-minded culture, is employed to sensationalize, inflate, confuse, and oversimplify.\u201d Although the text\u2019s examples are now dated, the concepts remain useful. I want to discuss one of these concepts: the sample.\n\nA sample is a subset of observations from a population that is used to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. A sample is useful, because it allows us to gain an understanding of the population without having to survey the entire population. However, the way a sample is chosen is important.\n\nFor example, according to a 2024 survey from the Pew Research Center, three in 10 Americans reported making at least one resolution last year. Did Pew ask every American whether they made a New Year\u2019s resolution or not? No, of course not. I was never asked this question, and you probably were not asked either. Instead of asking every American about their New Year\u2019s resolution, which would be logistically impossible, Pew used a sample. Their data came from a survey that was sent to 5,140 adults, who were chosen through a national random sample.\n\nAlthough a \u201csmall\u201d number of adults were surveyed at a certain point in time, which may contribute to the results, the individuals surveyed were selected from a random sample. Those of us who deal with statistics love random sampling, because it is often the best way to estimate the characteristics of the whole population.\n\nAs an economics professor, I have a lot of students that tell me that they \u201cdo not like math.\u201d Can I assume that all students dislike math? Well, according to a 2018 survey commissioned by Texas Instruments (TI) and conducted by Research Now Group, Inc., 46 percent of students report that they like or love math. The data came from a survey that was sent out by an independent survey research firm to 1,007 students, who were between the ages of 13 and 18.\n\nMy initial conclusion was derived from a very specific sample: students taking my Principles of Microeconomics course at the University of Maine who are willing to tell me directly that they \u201cdo not like math.\u201d I used a convenience sample, a group that was easy to access. There may be times when convenience sampling may be effective, but in this situation, my sampling technique was more likely than not flawed.\n\nTexas Instruments did not run the survey themselves, instead they used an independent survey research firm. Why? Because TI has a reason for students to like math \u2014 they sell calculators! If the survey was done internally, we may be concerned that the results were biased. Do students really like math, or did TI just send out a survey to students who were likely to say they liked math? The fact that they did not run the survey themselves makes their results more credible.\n\nHowever, unlike the Pew data, it is unclear if the Texas Instruments data came from students who were randomly sampled. This matters, because it is not clear who was surveyed. Maybe the research firm wanted to make sure their client, TI, got a positive result, so they only surveyed students who own TI calculators. Just as I should take my conclusion with a grain of salt, maybe we should also be wary of these results.\n\nAs we begin a new year, I want to encourage all of us to think critically about the statistics we are presented. Statistics are powerful, they help us to understand trends and make decisions. Numbers do not lie, but the people who use them may be trying to spin the results to their benefit. I challenge you to find the context of the numbers you read, hear, or use this year. It is important that we understand the context of the statistics we are presented, so that we are not fooled or misled by the data.",

(TI) has launched new integrated automotive chips to enable safer, more immersive driving experiences at any vehicle price point. The AWRL6844 60GHz mmWave radar sensor supports occupancy monitoring for seat belt reminder systems, child presence detection and intrusion detection with a single chip running edge AI algorithms, enabling a safer driving environment.\n\nWith TI\u2019s next-generation audio DSP core, the AM275x-Q1 MCUs and AM62D-Q1 processors make premium audio features more affordable. Paired with TI\u2019s latest analog products, including the TAS6754-Q1 Class-D audio amplifier, engineers can take advantage of a complete audio amplifier system offering. TI is showcasing these devices at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), happening this week in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nOriginal equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are gradually designing in more sensors to enhance the in-vehicle experience and meet evolving safety standards. TI\u2019s edge AI-enabled AWRL6844 60GHz mmWave radar sensor enables engineers to incorporate three in-cabin sensing features to replace multiple sensor technologies, such as in-seat weight mats and ultrasonic sensors, lowering total implementation costs by an average of US$20 per vehicle.\n\nThe AWRL6844 integrates four transmitters and four receivers, enabling high-resolution sensing data at an optimized cost for OEMs. This data feeds into application-specific AI-driven algorithms on a customizable on-chip hardware accelerator and DSP, improving decision-making accuracy and reducing processing time. The edge intelligence capabilities of the AWRL6844 sensor that help improve the driving experience include these examples:\n\nWhile driving, it supports occupant detection and localization with 98% accuracy to enable seat belt reminders.\n\nAfter parking, it monitors for unattended children in the vehicle, using neural networks that detect micromovements in real time with over 90% classification accuracy. This direct sensing capability enables OEMs to meet 2025 European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) design requirements.\n\nWhen parked, it adapts to different environments through intelligent scanning, reducing false intrusion detection alerts caused by car shaking and external movement.\n\nAs driver expectations grow for elevated in-cabin experiences across vehicle models, OEMs aim to offer premium audio while minimizing design complexity and system cost. AM275x-Q1 MCUs and AM62D-Q1 processors reduce the number of components required for an automotive audio amplifier system by integrating TI\u2019s vector-based C7x DSP core, Arm cores, memory, audio networking and a hardware security module into a single, functional safety-capable SoC. The C7x core, coupled with a matrix multiply accelerator, together form a neural processing unit that processes both traditional and edge AI-based audio algorithms. These automotive audio SoCs are scalable, allowing designers to meet memory and performance needs, from entry-level to high-end systems, with minimal redesign and investment.\n\nTI\u2019s next-generation C7x DSP core achieves more than four times the processing performance of other audio DSPs, allowing audio engineers to manage multiple features within a single core. AM275x-Q1 MCUs and AM62D-Q1 processors enable immersive audio inside the cabin with features such as spatial audio, active noise cancellation, sound synthesis and advanced vehicle networking, including Audio Video Bridging over Ethernet.\n\nTo further optimize their automotive audio designs, engineers can use TI\u2019s TAS6754-Q1 audio amplifier with innovative 1L modulation technology to deliver class-leading audio performance and power consumption, with half the number of inductors compared to existing Class-D amplifiers. The TAS67xx-Q1 family of devices, which integrates real-time load diagnostics required by OEMs, helps engineers simplify designs, decrease costs, and increase efficiency without sacrificing audio quality.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against the other stocks.\n\nAs retirement approaches, ensuring financial stability becomes increasingly important for investors. Among the available investment options, consistent dividend payments are especially attractive due to their dependability and security. Dividends, which represent a portion of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, provide a reliable income stream.\n\nDividend stocks are well-suited for retirees because they also offer protection during challenging times. A report by Morningstar highlighted that dividend-stock funds were well-prepared to endure the tech stock crash from 2000 to 2002, as they had minimal exposure to the sector. During that period, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index suffered a cumulative loss of nearly 44%, largely due to significant declines in its growth stocks, whereas dividend stock funds experienced only about a third of that loss.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Best January Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nDue to their solid long-term performance in the past, dividend stocks are becoming a vital part of a well-rounded retirement portfolio for many investors. Strategically chosen dividend-paying stocks can offer stability during market declines and enhance gains during upswings by providing regular income that helps mitigate losses and amplify returns. In addition, they offer a hedge against inflation, which has become a growing concern due to rising costs of essentials like food and energy. Several top-performing companies have consistently increased their dividend payouts over decades. David Giroux, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price who oversees the firm's capital appreciation strategy, shared insights on dividend stocks in an interview with Barron\u2019s. Below are some of his remarks:\n\n\u201cTo have a retirement portfolio that has a significant component of stocks with attractive dividends makes a tremendous amount of sense. If the average company in the market can grow its earnings at 7% to 8% a year, your dividends should be growing at a similar rate.\u201d\n\nAnalysts point out that while income and growth are crucial for retirees to maintain financial stability during a potentially long retirement, this approach has its limitations and may not be suitable for everyone. They advise building a portfolio that is diversified across various sectors and includes companies with strong cash reserves to support stock buybacks. Dave King, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, stressed the importance of straightforward diversification in an interview with Barron\u2019s. He recommended holding at least eight stocks from different sectors, suggesting that while diversification doesn\u2019t need to be overly extensive, it should include more than just a few stocks\u2014ideally more than five, with representation from each major sector. King also advised that when selecting stocks, investors should not rely too heavily on Wall Street research. Instead, they should prioritize fundamental, time-tested factors like a company\u2019s credit rating or the reputation of its management, which can provide key insights into the stability of its dividend payments.",

            "content": "Software-defined vehicles (SDVs) are a big theme at CES this year, shifting vehicles from hardware-centric upgrades to over the air (OTA) software upgrades. In order to do this, vehicle subsystems must rely on a, more or less, generic processing platform that can perform a wide variety of functions to serve the various aspects of a car.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, TI\u2019s approach to this is shifting from a \u201cdomain\u201d architecture to a \u201czonal\u201d one where ECUs that were once custom-tailored to specific domains\u2014for example, powertrain, ADAS, infotainment, body electronic and lighting, passive safety\u2014are now more location, or zone-, -based to reduce weighty wire harnessing and improve processor speeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFigure 1 Traditional domain versus zone architecture. Source: Texas Instruments\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPartner Content\n\nTI\u2019s radar sensor, audio processors, Class-D amplifier\n\nTI\u2019s automotive innovations are currently focused in powertrain systems; ADAS; in-vehicle infotainment (IVI); and body electronics and lighting. The recent announcements fall into the ADAS with the AWRL6844 radar sensor as well as IVI with the AM275 and AM62D processors and the class-D audio amplifier.\n\nADAS: passenger safety solution\n\nThe AWRL6844 radar sensor uses 60-GHz millimeter-wave (mm-wave) with a 4\u00d74 antenna array and edge AI models running on an on-chip TI-specific accelerator and DSP to support several in-vehicle safety measures including occupancy monitoring for seat belt reminders, child presence detection, and intrusion (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 A block diagram of TI\u2019s AWRL6844 radar sensor and the three vehicle modes that the sensor can assist with (seat belt reminder, child presence detection, and intrusion detection). Source: Texas Instruments\n\nPresently, OEMs resort to a combination of in-seat weight sensors, two UWB sensors for front-row and back-row child presence detection, and an ultrasonic intrusion module for the same direct-sensing safety measures, directly tracking human activity such as respiration, heartbeat, and movement.\n\nThe technology is designed to assist OEMs in meeting evolving regulatory safety requirements such as the Euro new car assessment program (NCAP) advanced that offers rewards to manufacturers for implementing advanced safety technologies as a means to complement its established star rating system.\n\nYariv Raveh, VP of business unit management of radar stated, \u201cIn 2025 the Euro NCAP requirement for child presence detection will only award points for a direct sensing system and in the near future, the in-cabin sensing system must accurately distinguish between a child and an adult in order to provide a good user experience.\u201d\n\nIVI: Premium audio solution\n\nSome of the features of the new AM275x-Q1 and AM62D-Q1 processors are the integration of two vector-based C7x DSP cores, multiple Arm cores, on-chip memory, an NPU accelerator, and audio networking with Ethernet AVB. The differences between the processors is highlighted in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3 The AM275x DDR-less MCU and AM62D DDR-based process for premium audio in IVI applications. Source: Texas Instruments\n\n\u201cTier 1 suppliers must elect the appropriate processing components to meet all of their customer needs across their fleets. So, our answer is to provide two different architectures to give engineers the flexibility to choose across the range of use cases, all using the same audio processing family where engineers can design standalone and integrated premium audio systems across a range of performance levels with minimal additional hardware and software investment,\u201d said Sonia Ghelani, TI\u2019s product line manager for signal processing MCUs.\n\nThe company is actively working with customers to incorporate AI into the audio signal chain for unique solutions in applications such as active noise cancellation (ANC) and road noise cancellation (RNC).\n\nIVI: Class-D audio amplifier\n\nThe TAS6754-Q1 class-D amplifier (Figure 4) is meant to assist engineers with implementing TI\u2019s \u201c1L\u201d modulation scheme, a technology that lowers the inductor count per audio channel to one (hence the phrase \u201c1L\u201d).\n\nFigure 4 Sample vehicle speaker and mic distribution as well as a sample block diagram of an audio signal chain including TI\u2019s class-D amplifier. Source: Texas Instruments\n\nModern vehicles can embed well over 20 speakers and, in an effort to reduce size, weight, and cost, class-D amplifiers are being used for their higher power efficiency and lower thermal dissipation. However, these amplifiers generally require two LC filters per audio channel to attenuate high frequency noise. \u201c1L maintains class-D performance while reducing component count and cost, allowing the premium audio system to grow in terms of speakers and mics,\u201d added Sonia Ghelani.\n\nBlurring the lines between IVI and ADAS\n\nOne major discussion during the press briefing involved the industry trend of integrating ADAS and IVI functions on a single SoC. \u201cSo today we see that they\u2019re in two separate boards, however, more and more we\u2019re seeing that they end up being in the same board,\u201d said Mark Ng, TI\u2019s director of automotive systems.\n\nSonia Ghelani added with an example of an overlap between ADAS and IVI functions, \u201cthese chimes and seat belt reminders are ADAS requirements that fall into the audio domain. As we move into a world of software-defined cars with more zonal architectures, you\u2019ll continue to see an overlap between the two.\u201d She continued, \u201cFor TI it\u2019s important that we understand exactly what the customer is trying to build so that we don\u2019t silo these systems in one bucket or another, but rather understand what problems the customer is trying to solve.\u201d\n\nAalyia Shaukat, associate editor at EDN, has worked in the design publishing industry for six years.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks Targeted By Activist Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against the other stocks targeted by activist hedge funds.\n\nShareholder activism continued at a record pace in 2024 as activist hedge funds pushed for strategic changes in various companies to unlock hidden value. In the first nine months of the year, 184 activist hedge fund campaigns were up and running, 26% above the four-year average. The surge came as new activists joined the fray and spearheaded 22% of the campaigns.\n\nWhy Was Shareholder Activism on The Rise?\n\nA number of factors can be emphasized. One is the global economy cooling down. Although the US economy appeared to be on track to a soft landing, as many experts had predicted, economic growth remained timid, and other nations like Germany were on the verge of going into recession.\n\nThe rise of so-called ESG investing is another factor contributing to increased shareholder activism. Environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, is a relatively recent trend in which investors purchase stock in a company for its intrinsic value and because it performs well on ESG metrics. Some activist investors have positioned themselves as ESG-focused in the midst of this trend.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Penny Stocks to Buy for 2025 and 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire D.E. Shaw.\n\nNevertheless, only 30% of the top ten activist investors accounted for the total campaigns in 2024, down from 46% in the same period in 2023. On the other hand, most of the campaigns were less successful in breaking into company boardrooms as management fought back.\n\nManagement pushed back on several campaigns even as activist hedge funds were forced to settle on management changes. Additionally, as investors\u2019 newfound freedom to choose between management and dissident slates makes it easier to get representation on boards, the universal proxy card continues to lead to more settlements between activists and businesses.\n\nEven though winning board seats isn\u2019t the main goal of every campaign, the quantity of victories indicates how well businesses are defending themselves. Dissidents won 74 seats in the first half, compared to 93 in the same period in 2023. Activists only secured 11% of the seats they were vying for in US proxy elections, compared to 65% in 2023.\n\nSimilarly, a push for company sales by activist hedge funds hit a snag as buyouts throughout the year were scarce owing to the high interest rate environment. High interest rates made it difficult for companies to access cheap capital that they could use to complete acquisitions.\n\nAccording to Jim Rossman, head of the Barclays advisory group, there hasn\u2019t been much merger and acquisition activity in the past two years. The activists\u2019 preferred method of obtaining value from a company\u2019s stock is weakened as a result. The most frequent demand of activists is still M&A, but they are now more focused on altering a company\u2019s board and management.\n\n\u201cActivism has become increasingly sophisticated as a tactic,\u201d says Rossman, who sees firms hiring bankers, lawyers and private equity veterans. \u201cThere\u2019s a greater depth of understanding on how to unlock value in companies.\u201d\n\nAs corporate board nominations open in the new year, the pace of activism is expected to increase in the upcoming months. According to Rossman, activist demands for M&A may resurface in 2025 as private equity firms look to use their growing cash and their current holdings.\n\nActivist hedge funds typically have minority, long interests in underperforming businesses that have significant potential for value development. Since value investors make up the majority of activist investors, they must first find undervalued companies.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of stocks targeted by activist hedge funds, we looked for companies that made the headlines in the context of renowned activist investors taking a position. We then ranked these companies based on their latest market capitalization.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nCompany Market Cap as of December 31: $171.1 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers. It offers power products to manage power requirements across various voltage levels. The stock was up by 10% in 2024, rallying to record highs as investors reacted to the company\u2019s strategic positioning amid growing demand for chip technology.\n\nActivist hedge fund Elliott Investment Management took a $2.5 billion position in the chip technology company. With the positioning, the hedge fund started agitating for the company to consider adopting a dynamic capacity management strategy. It also urged management to focus on achieving a free cash flow per share target of $9 a share by 2026.\n\nElliott claims that Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) free cash flow has decreased by over 75% since the company began a significant capacity ramp-up in 2022 and that shareholders have received little information about when free cash flow per share will return to its historical average.\n\nAccording to the activist investor, the company has expanded its capacity beyond the anticipated demand. Consequently, it is calling for the company to adopt a dynamic capacity management strategy to bolster per-share free cash flow.\n\nDespite a poorer performance in Europe, Texas Instruments Incorporated\u2019s (NASDAQ:TXN) automotive revenues have grown significantly, with strength in China making the difference. The company\u2019s auto revenue growth from quarter to quarter was higher than anticipated. Furthermore, TXN has observed a broader cyclical recovery, with notable expansion in the fields of communications equipment, enterprise systems, and personal electronics, all of which are still below their prior peak levels.\n\nThe Diamond Hill Select Strategy likes Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\u2019s long-term outlook, as revealed in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) and Mr. Cooper Group. Shares of semiconductor manufacturing company Texas Instruments rose in Q2 as demand in several of the company\u2019s end markets show signs of recovering. Given the company\u2019s long-term prospects, competitive positioning and scale advantages, we believe the outlook for the company from here is strong.\u201d\n\nOverall TXN ranks 1st on our list of the stocks targeted by activist hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of TXN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TXN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

In March 2024, Californian technology corporation Nvidia unveiled an AI chip that can complete tasks 30 times faster than its predecessor.\n\nAnd now Google has built a \"mindboggling\" chip that takes just five minutes to complete tasks that would take the world's fastest computers 10 septillion years, reports The Guardian.\n\nIt's the latest quantum computing breakthrough and will take us one step closer to a 'quantum economy', which by 2035 could have an value of up to $2 trillion, according to analysis from McKinsey. Currently, more than $40 billion of public sector investments are being ploughed into the technology, according to the World Economic Forum's Quantum Economy Blueprint report.\n\nSo, what are microchips and how have they changed our world?\n\nAdvances in microchip technology are contributing to a quantum economy that could be worth $2 trillion by 2035. Image: McKinsey & Company\n\nWhat are microchips?\n\nA microchip is a set of electronic circuits on a small, flat silicon wafer, explains semiconductor specialist ASML.\n\nSilicon is hard and brittle, like crystal, and is the second most abundant chemical element on Earth after oxygen. It is made from sand and has unique electrical and thermal properties for chip manufacture.\n\nLoading...\n\nA brief history of microchips\n\nAn important date in the history of the microchip is 1947, when the transistor, a key precursor to the microchip, was invented at Bell Labs, an American telecoms research and development company known for its pioneering innovations.\n\nTransistors are essentially tiny switches that turn electrical currents on or off. Today, a tiny chip can hold many billions of transistors, explains the BBC\u2019s Made on Earth series.\n\nThen in 1958, an electrical engineer at electronics company Texas Instruments, Jack Kilby, created the first integrated circuit. This was a foundational breakthrough for modern microchips, according to electronics news site, Electropages.\n\nIntegrated circuits are small electronic chips made up of interconnected components, including transistors.\n\nAnother critical innovation followed in 1959 when physicist Robert Noyce developed the first practical integrated circuit, made in one piece, that could be mass-produced.\n\nIn the early 1960s, NASA helped to drive the development of microchip technology as an early adopter.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe different types of microchips\n\nThey may all be small, but microchips come in a variety of guises.\n\nGeneral-purpose chips are the workhorses of modern computing, designed to handle a wide range of tasks efficiently. These integrated circuits, such as central processing units (CPUs), contain millions or billions of transistors that can perform various calculations and operations. They are found in devices like personal computers, smartphones and servers.\n\nThe evolution of purpose-built chips has led to specialized processors optimized for specific tasks, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) for rendering images and video.\n\nQuantum chips, like Google's Willow, represent the cutting edge of computing technology, harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that regular computers can either not do, or would take eons to complete.\n\nNeuromorphic chips, also known as brain-inspired chips, aim to mimic the structure and function of biological neural networks. These chips use artificial neurons and synapses to process information in a way that resembles the human brain, often incorporating features like parallel processing, low power consumption, and on-chip memory.\n\nDiscover How is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show more In response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum\u2019s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. This includes the workstreams part of the AI Transformation of Industries initiative, in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.\n\nHow have microchips changed the world?\n\nWithout microchips, everyday technology \u2013 from the internet to handheld calculators \u2013 would be the stuff of science fiction, suggests news site Slate.\n\nMicrochips have brought increasingly smaller, more powerful and more efficient electronic devices.\n\nFor example, ultrasound scanners are typically large machines wheeled around on trolleys in hospitals and clinics. Shrinking microchip technology means they\u2019re now available as pocket-sized mobile devices.\n\nLoading...\n\nA new dawn for microchips\n\nScientists are unlocking next-generation advances in microchip technology by using particles of light to carry data \u2013 instead of electricity.\n\nBoston-based startup Lightmatter, for example, is using light to multiply the processing power and cut the huge energy demand of chips used in AI technologies.\n\nLight is way more energy efficient in transmitting information than electrical signals travelling over wires, the company tells Reuters.\n\nGerman start-up, Semron, is developing a chip to run AI programs locally on smartphones, earbuds, virtual reality headsets and other mobile devices, explains news site TechCrunch.\n\nInstead of electrical currents to perform calculations \u2013 the conventional way that computer chips have worked \u2013 Semron\u2019s chips use electrical fields. This cuts the manufacturing cost of the chips and improves their energy efficiency, the company says.\n\nAs chips advance, the search for a greener computing paradigm continues to occupy scientists across the globe. An analysis by the Quantum Energy Institute found that quantum computers could provide an advantage when it comes to computing's energy and water use.\n\nThe Quantum for Society Challenge seeks to accelerate quantum start-ups creating sustainable impact aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Launched by UpLink, the Quantum Economy Network, and the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Saudi Arabia, it focuses on quantum solutions for climate, healthcare, food systems and more, supporting innovation with funding, ecosystem connections, and product-market fit.",

Donna Whitehead forged her own path, opening doors, minds, and hearts through joyous enthusiasm, inclusive love, and a passionate pursuit of personal growth resources.\n\nShe was among the first women ordained in the North Texas Conference of the United Methodist Church, the first woman to join the staff Highland Park UMC \u2014 doing so as an intern \u2013 and the first woman pastor to help launch what is today one of the largest churches in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nWhitehead, the associate pastor of Lovers Lane United Methodist Church, explores her faith journey in I Am Enough: A Memoir for Spiritual Seekers, which was released this fall.\n\n\u201cIn her memoir, Rev. Whitehead courageously and boldly proclaims, \u2018I Am Enough!\u2019 \u2014 three of the most important words a clergy woman can hear,\u201d said Bishop Cynthia Harvey of the Texas Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church. \u201cIn a real, vulnerable, and humble spirit, Donna helps us join hands as we travel the journey together and proclaim along the way that \u2018We Are Enough!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Stan Copeland, senior pastor of Lovers Lane United Methodist Church in Dallas, has worked alongside Whitehead for nearly 25 years.\n\n\u201cI am but one who could say I have never witnessed anyone who joyfully experiences ministry more than Donna Whitehead,\u201d he said.\n\nIn her memoir, Whitehead takes readers from her upbringing in an idyllic but confining small town in Louisiana to her highly desired role \u2014 she thought \u2014 as a homemaker and mother in the 1960s in suburban Dallas where her engineer husband took a job at Texas Instruments.\n\nBut her life took a dramatic turn after a Jewish rabbi\u2019s class set her on a spiritual path that continues 50 years later.\n\nWhitehead, who has a Master of Divinity degree from Perkins School of Theology at SMU, has made a career of defying expectations and endured her share of hardships, from people who didn\u2019t believe women should be ministers, to her internal struggles with her faith.\n\nYet she pushed on \u2014 from helping build Custer Road UMC in Plano from the ground up, to helping anchor an established church at Lovers Lane UMC, and in recent years to witnessing the ordination of one of the UMC\u2019s first ministers from the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cThrough trials and tribulations, connecting with God\u2019s love became the one constant in my life, and it can be for you, too,\u201d Whitehead said.\n\nShe hopes her memoir will empower readers to discover their faith anew and examine the biases and blind spots that keep them separated from God and from others.\n\n\u201cYou have no worth to prove because you are already enough,\u201d she said. \u201cTogether, we are enough!\u201d",

All CHIPS Act funding agreements come with the same caveat.\n\nElsewhere, Texas Instruments will use its $1.61 billion to support its proposed $18 billion investment project that will see the company build two fabs in Sherman, Texas, and one in Lehi, Utah. The Sherman facilities are expected to produce 65nm - 130nm essential chips while the Lehi site will produce 28nm - 65nm analog and embedded processing chips.\n\nThe $407m that Amkor is set to receive - a $7 million increase on its preliminary funding agreement from July 2024 - will be used to support the company\u2019s $2 billion investment for an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test company (OSAT) plant in Peoria, Arizona.\n\nIn October 2024, Amkor announced it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TSMC which will see Amkor provide the chipmaker with with turnkey advanced packaging and test services at its planned outsourced semiconductor assembly and test plant in Peoria.\n\nTSMC concluded its CHIPS Act funding negotiations with the government in November 2024 and will receive $6.6 billion to support the construction of three fabs in Phoenix, Arizona, two of which will produce 4nm and 3nm semiconductors, and a third will manufacture 2nm chips.\n\nCommenting on the agreement with Samsung, US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said: \u201cWith this investment in Samsung, the US is now officially the only country on the planet that is home to all five leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers. This is an extraordinary achievement, which will ensure we have a steady, domestic supply of the most advanced semiconductors that are essential to AI and national security, while also creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and transforming communities across the country.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Commerce has also finalized CHIPS Act funding agreements with SK Hynix, GlobalFoundries, Intel, Micron, and GlobalWafers. President Biden has been attempting to secure these deals in his administration's dying days, with the CHIPS Act facing an uncertain future under a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, President-elect Trump, who takes office this month, criticized the CHIPS and Science Act, saying that the government should have levied tariffs on the semiconductor industry instead of handing out grants and loans to chip companies.",

Tune in to this episode of the LeddarTech Labs and hear directly from the President and CEO of LeddarTech, Frantz Saintellemy, on the agreement between the two companies.\n\nPodcast Transcript\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to the LeddarTech Lab podcast, where we explore groundbreaking advancements in automotive technology that are reshaping our roads, cities, and lifestyles. I\u2019m your host, Michelle Dawn Mooney, and today we have a special Driving the Future episode that is sure to interest investors, tech enthusiasts, and the automotive community alike. We\u2019re joined by Frantz Saintellemy, the President and CEO of LeddarTech, to discuss an exciting new collaboration between LeddarTech and Texas Instruments. Together, these two industry leaders are working to deliver scalable advanced driving assistance systems, ADAS, and autonomous driving solutions. Frantz, it is wonderful to have you with us. Great to see you again. Thanks for being here.\n\nFrantz: Great to see you, and thank you for having me.\n\nMichelle: Absolutely. And as I said, some exciting things coming our way. Frantz, before we dive into the details, can you start by giving us an overview of what this strategic collaboration with Texas Instruments means for LeddarTech, and why it\u2019s so significant?\n\nFrantz: You know, from where we are, this collaboration, from our view, is a major milestone for LeddarTech as we partner with a company that is a leader in their space, one of the largest and biggest, most influential names in the semiconductor industry, Texas Instruments. You know, our goal is to develop and bring a scalable solution for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving to market. This partnership not only accelerates our products, but as well as reinforces the value of the LeddarVision, which is our AI-based fusion and perception software stack, which is now pre-integrated and validated on TI\u2019s TDA4 system on chips. And for us, we think that creates a comprehensive solution which brings superior performance, flexibility, and cost efficiency to the entire automotive ecosystem. So with this agreement, our software will be commercialized by TI\u2019s global automotive salesforce to all their OEMs and Tier 1s across the globe. So we think this is a major, major milestone.\n\nMichelle: So besides the strategic alignment, TI has made a significant financial commitment, an advanced royalty payment of nearly $10 million. Can you discuss what this investment means and how it is expected to impact your commercialization plans as you kind of alluded to there?\n\nFrantz: I mean, just for sake of clarification, this $10 million is non-dilutive money. This is basically advanced payments on the license. So it\u2019s a commitment that underscores their confidence in our technology, which is something we\u2019re incredibly proud of. This $10 million in advanced royalty payment is a strong signal to the market that TI and LeddarTech are fully committed to making a meaningful long-term impact in the ADAS and AD space together. We believe this collaboration creates a best-in-class software and SoC bundle. And we think that we have not only a solution that we believe is an industry marker, but we\u2019ve also validated this with customers. We received positive reactions from various customers on the current offering, as well as on our roadmap together. So we think that this is going to lead to a lot of market traction.\n\nMichelle: So when it comes to technology, because of course that is the key piece here that we\u2019re talking about, the LeddarVision platform has a lot of unique capabilities. So can you explain how it is being integrated with TI\u2019s products? And then what kind of advantages this integration brings to automotive manufacturers?\n\nFrantz: Right. The LeddarVision software is an AI-based data fusion that delivers exceptional accuracy and performance, even with fewer number of sensors, as well as a lower computing SoC architecture. This reduces overall system cost, as well as development complexity. By integrating our software with TI\u2019s SoC platform, we\u2019re creating a bundled solution that really simplifies the development process for OEMs and Tier 1s, because from the get-go, they have a software that is fully available, ported to the processor, that allows them to immediately start developing ADAS systems, or even AD solutions, which typically requires significant porting and integration efforts, which increases complexity, increases development cost, increases risks, as well as increases the risk of failure when it comes to validation. So this pre-ported, fully validated solution addresses a plethora of challenges, but most important, it delivers better performance over existing solutions today.\n\nMichelle: You have been working closely with Texas Instruments on this integration and have presented the solution to various OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. What kind of feedback have you received from the industry so far?\n\nFrantz: As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve had various types of feedbacks, but let me give you some statistics. Since September, we have done over 50 in-vehicle, on-the-road demonstrations. We\u2019ve talked to over 100 different types of people across the industry, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers have shown significant interest in our combined solution. They appreciate the advanced features and performance we deliver, especially with the LeddarVision already running real-time on TI\u2019s TDA4 processors. Together, we have been able to not only present a compelling solution, but also demonstrate the potential for faster time-to-market, lower-cost solutions, as well as demonstrating higher performance than what is currently available to customers. It\u2019s a transformative solution that really resonates well with automotive manufacturers looking for reliable and future-proof ADAS and AD technology. May I also add, Michel, that this solution not only resonates with customers, but it addresses significant pain points, such as it\u2019s a single software stack that is ported across the platform of processors from TI, which means that they can start with a lower-performing, low-cost solution. If they need to move up and add more features and go to a different tier, they can actually cut across the different processor families within TI, and the software is fully compatible. And so this is a breakthrough, and it has never been done until today.\n\nMichelle: And you addressed some pain points. You touched on that this is really helping get through or provide solutions for those pain points. But let\u2019s talk about some of the specific benefits that investors and the automotive industry can now expect from this collaboration. What makes this solution so unique?\n\nFrantz: This collaboration brings a range of unique benefits. First, it\u2019s an open bundle of hardware and software solution. So again, we\u2019re coming from an industry that basically has a black box approach. We are offering a white or gray box solutions, meaning that OEMs and Tier 1 customers can integrate their own application software, giving them a level of flexibility that doesn\u2019t exist today. Our combined solution delivers best-in class performance while reducing costs without compromising safety and quality.\n\nSecond, the software architecture allows for flexibility and scalability. So it\u2019s adaptable to various levels of ADAS and autonomous driving applications, from simple driver assistance to more advanced driving and autonomy functionality, such as parking functions, automated parking, highway pilots, or city pilots. We can also offer advanced virtualization tools, extensive datasets, and simulation capabilities which are vital for efficient development and high-performance outcomes.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s a comprehensive package with robust customer support at every phase, from innovation and pre-development all the way to deployment and post deployment support.\n\nMichelle: You mentioned adaptability, and it sounds like this platform solution has a lot of flexibility. So can you discuss how it may support future applications beyond ADAS, possibly in areas like driver monitoring or even infotainment?\n\nFrantz: Yes, exactly. Our solution is optimized to the point where we\u2019re freeing up compute resources on the ISOC to support additional application functions. This opens the door for an OEM or Tier 1 to integrate other functionalities, such as driver monitoring systems, in-vehicle infotainment, all within a single platform. As we continue to refine and improve our technology offering with TI, we are also looking at how it could further expand to support even more automotive applications, making it truly holistic and future-ready.\n\nMichelle: What would you say to the investor community who may be watching this collaboration very closely and considering its impact on LeddarTech\u2019s growth trajectory?\n\nFrantz: To our investors, I would say that this partnership is a strategic milestone. It\u2019s a strong market and commercial validation that our technology is best in class, and it has the potential to be the industry-leading solution across the globe. Our vision is that the LeddarVision will be the most deployed software stack for ADAS and autonomous driving in the future. So having Texas Instruments, one of the largest semiconductor suppliers and one of the most successful companies in the world, on board as a strategic partner and go-to market collaborator is a significant achievement and an endorsement that accelerates our market penetration and revenue generation. This collaboration fast-tracks our platform\u2019s adoption and deployment in various different applications across the globe. We are very, very well positioned to make an impactful contribution. And as you know, with anything, as you start deploying to more and more customers, we are confident that this will generate value not just in the near term, but establish the foundation for LeddarTech to be one of the most valuable software companies in the world.\n\nMichelle: I\u2019m sure many of our listeners are eager to know, here\u2019s the big burning question, when can we expect to see this product on the market? What is the timeline for availability?\n\nFrantz: I am excited to say that with our collaboration with TI, we\u2019re not talking about something that we\u2019re going to do in the future. We have been working with TI for close to two years in order to get ourselves to the moment where we can announce our collaboration to the world, but also where we can demonstrate that the solution is working real-time in a vehicle. So we\u2019ve already done that since September. That was the first implementation. We have been working to optimize our solution even further and demonstrate an even better solution. So at CES this year, we will actually demonstrate what we call the LeddarVision Surround, which is integrated into Texas Instruments\u2019 TDA4H, which is a 32-TOPS processor that allows us to showcase a premium surround solution for level 2-plus applications. And we\u2019ll be able to demonstrate that at our booth, but also on the TI booth. And then shortly after that, in March, all our customers will be able to experience in a vehicle.\n\nMichelle: A big 2025 ahead. Thank you so much, Frantz, for sharing this exciting development with us. It is clear that LeddarTech\u2019s vision for a scalable, accessible, and high-performance ADAS and autonomous driving platform is not only a reality now, but one that is set to reshape the industry alongside Texas Instruments. For those tuning in, remember that LeddarTech is working hard to bring this future to life, backed by strong technology, partnerships, and of course, a commitment to innovation. Frantz, thank you so much for being here. Appreciate your time and congratulations.\n\nFrantz: Thank you, Michelle. It\u2019s been a pleasure to be here. We are definitely looking forward to an incredible journey ahead with Texas Instruments and for the impact we can have together. We believe that safety is fundamental and regulators across the globe are working really hard to make safety a base requirement for all vehicles. And together, LeddarTech and Texas Instruments, for the first time, can really democratize access to safety to everyone on any budget.\n\nMichelle: Big milestone and congratulations once again. With that, I want to thank all of you for listening to this podcast of LeddarTech Labs. Stay tuned for more updates on how industry leaders like LeddarTech are driving change and innovation in the automotive world.

            "content": "Origins\n\nIf you're looking for a classic Silicon Valley origin story \u2013 brilliant founders in a garage dreaming of disruption \u2013 you've come to the wrong semiconductor fab. X-FAB's tale begins in 1992 among the industrial ruins of East Germany, where a Belgian entrepreneur with a penchant for football clubs and basic income philosophy acquired a communist-era chip factory during Germany's post-reunification fire sale.\n\nThat entrepreneur, Roland Duch\u00e2telet, wasn't interested in competing with Intel or chasing Moore's Law into the nanosphere. Instead, he saw something the market had overlooked: while everyone else raced to make chips smaller and faster, entire industries still needed reliable, specialized chips for cars, factories, and medical devices.\n\nThe early DNA of X-FAB was shaped by two crucial factors. First, their inherited East German workforce brought deep technical expertise in analog and mixed-signal processes \u2013 unfashionable but essential technologies that would become X-FAB's bread and butter. Second, Duch\u00e2telet's other company, Melexis, provided a ready-made customer for their chips. It was capitalism with training wheels, allowing X-FAB to develop capabilities without the typical startup death march for customers.\n\nWhat followed was a methodical expansion that looked more like a game of Risk than a tech startup playbook. They acquired a Texas Instruments facility in Lubbock (1999), added Malaysian capacity through a merger with 1st Silicon (2006), and picked up a MEMS specialist in Germany (2012). Each move added specific capabilities while staying true to their focus on specialty processes.\n\nThe genius \u2013 or luck \u2013 of X-FAB's evolution was in recognizing that not every chip needs to be cutting edge. While titans like TSMC and Samsung fought for supremacy in the single-digit nanometer realm, X-FAB happily operated in the comfortable mid-range of 130nm to 1\u00b5m processes, where margins were healthy and competition was limited. It's the semiconductor equivalent of finding a profitable niche selling vintage vinyl in the age of digital streaming.\n\nBy 2024, that former communist factory had transformed into a global specialty foundry with six manufacturing sites across three continents. They never became a household name like Intel, but they did become something possibly more valuable: a crucial supplier of specialized chips that make modern cars, factories, and medical devices possible. It's proof that in technology, sometimes the best strategy isn't to chase the bleeding edge, but to perfect the overlooked middle ground.\n\nThe irony of a communist factory becoming a master of market segmentation isn't lost on us. But perhaps that's the perfect metaphor for X-FAB's pragmatic approach: they succeeded not by revolutionizing semiconductor technology, but by carefully choosing which semiconductor revolution to sit out.\n\nHow The Money Actually Works\n\nHere's how X-FAB actually makes money: They take a dinner plate-sized silicon wafer worth about $50, add about $300 in processing costs across 400 steps, and sell it for $500 to automotive companies who will use it to make chips that control your car's brakes. They'll repeat this process about 600,000 times this year. What makes this profitable isn't technological wizardry \u2013 it's their willingness to keep running processes that bigger manufacturers consider pass\u00e9, but carmakers consider essential. Think of it as a semiconductor version of the guy who maintains vintage Porsche engines: not the most advanced technology, but try finding someone else who can do it reliably.\n\nTheir 2023 revenue of $907 million flows primarily from three sources:\n\nAutomotive chips (59% of revenue) - everything from brake controls to power management Industrial applications (23%) - factory automation and power systems Medical devices (7%) - where reliability matters more than speed\n\nThe simple truth about X-FAB's business: They make chips using older technology that nobody else wants to maintain anymore,\n\nbut that cars, factories, and medical devices still desperately need.\n\nThe cost structure follows the remorseless logic of semiconductor manufacturing: high fixed costs in equipment and facilities, significant energy consumption (those plasma etchers don't run on goodwill), and the constant need for skilled labor. Yet X-FAB achieves 28.5% gross margins by focusing on mature processes where the equipment is largely depreciated and the yields are predictably high. Their Texas facility still produces profitable chips on 150mm wafers, a format TSMC relegated to museums sometime during the Clinton administration.\n\nThe sustainability of this model depends on X-FAB maintaining their position in specialized analog and mixed-signal processes. Their customers commit to long-term agreements not out of loyalty, but because redesigning a power management chip for a different manufacturing process costs more than several years' worth of wafer purchases. When your product controls the braking system in a luxury car, price sensitivity becomes a theoretical concept.\n\nThis explains why X-FAB can generate consistent cash flow from technology nodes that leading-edge manufacturers discarded years ago. They're not selling commoditized manufacturing capacity; they're selling the certainty that comes from decades of process refinement.\n\nThe Numbers That Tell The Story\n\nForget nanometers. X-FAB's story boils down to three numbers that actually matter.\n\nFirst, there's the tale of two production lines. Their newer factories process 200mm wafers - discs of silicon that pack in more chips per production run and use more modern equipment. These lines are running flat out because they're perfect for today's automotive and industrial chips - modern enough to handle complex designs, but mature enough to be reliable and cost-effective. Meanwhile, their older facilities work with 150mm wafers - an aging format that's like the floppy disk of semiconductor manufacturing. These lines sit half-empty because, while some legacy customers still need them, most new designs target the more efficient 200mm format. The industry moved on, but X-FAB keeps these older lines running because some loyal customers still depend on them, and redesigning old chips for newer processes would cost more than several German luxury cars.\n\nThen there's the number that would give any MBA professor heartburn: 45% of X-FAB's revenue comes from a single customer, Melexis. Having nearly half your business depend on one customer is typically a recipe for disaster \u2013 it gives that customer enormous pricing power and leaves you vulnerable if they switch suppliers or face difficulties of their own. But as we said, Melexis and X-FAB share the same major shareholder. It's less a supplier-customer relationship and more a carefully orchestrated industrial partnership, though one that leaves minority shareholders hoping the family stays happy.\n\nFinally, there's the metric that shows who's actually buying what X-FAB is selling. The \"book-to-bill ratio\" \u2013 simply the ratio of new orders to actual sales \u2013 tells a fascinating story. For their traditional business, they're getting $1.05 in new orders for every $1 of current sales. But in their new silicon carbide chip business (crucial for electric vehicles), they're only getting 38 cents in new orders for every dollar of sales. It's a number that suggests their core business remains robust while their venture into next-generation technology faces headwinds.\n\nTogether, these numbers paint a picture of a company that's both incredibly stable and surprisingly precarious. Their $481 million backlog (plus $114 million in unscheduled orders) shows sustained demand for their traditional offerings. But the real question is whether they can maintain their position as the master of mature technology while successfully expanding into new territories.\n\nSome context on silicon carbide: It's the semiconductor industry's equivalent of a better battery \u2013 chips that can handle higher voltages and temperatures than traditional silicon, perfect for electric vehicles. X-FAB bet they could master this complex process and ride the EV wave. They've made technical progress (their new process offers 30% more chips per wafer), but they're caught in a classic semiconductor trap: They need large volumes to make the economics work, but customers won't commit volumes until they see better economics. That's why they just abandoned their target of $300-350M in silicon carbide revenue by 2026 \u2013 being pretty good at an emerging technology isn't enough when giants like Infineon are pouring billions into the same space.\n\nA few telling metrics that round out the X-FAB story:\n\nA $1 billion capacity expansion program for 2023-2025, roughly equal to their entire market cap. It's like betting the farm, if the farm produced silicon wafers and had a German accent.\n\n4,500 employees representing 45 nationalities, which for a company based in Erfurt, Germany (population 213,000) suggests they've managed to make eastern Germany surprisingly cosmopolitan.\n\nRevenue per employee of $201,511 (2023), significantly lower than TSMC's $730,000 but logical for a specialty manufacturer focusing on complex, lower-volume runs. Sometimes being artisanal means being less efficient.\n\n458 patents in their portfolio - modest by semiconductor standards, but focused almost entirely on analog and mixed-signal processes. It's not how many patents you have, it's whether they cover the things your customers can't live without.\n\nZero memory or digital logic products. While their competitors play Moore's Law limbo, X-FAB has thrived by simply refusing to join the race.\n\nThe Moat (if any)\n\nTo understand X-FAB's competitive position, forget everything you know about the semiconductor industry's relentless race to the bleeding edge. X-FAB operates in a different world entirely \u2013 one where stability trumps speed, and being boring is actually a competitive advantage.\n\nWhile competitors could technically manufacture similar chips, X-FAB has built quite the moat: As CEO Rudi De Winter noted in their Q3 2024 earnings call, they are \"the sole supplier for >90% of products manufactured.\" Their customers are so focused on securing this capacity that they've paid $275.9M in advance deposits \u2013 essentially lending X-FAB money for free just to guarantee their spot in line.\n\nWho are they really competing with?\n\nOn paper, X-FAB competes with GlobalFoundries, Tower Semiconductor (now part of Intel), and UMC in the specialty foundry space. But that's like saying a craft bourbon distillery competes with Diageo. For 90% of their products, X-FAB faces no direct competition at all. They're not competing with other manufacturers; they're competing with their customers' fear of obsolescence.\n\nIn semiconductor manufacturing, switching suppliers isn't just expensive \u2013 it requires completely redesigning the product, requalifying it for automotive or medical use (a multi-year process), and betting your company that nothing goes wrong. Most customers would rather pay a premium than take that risk.\n\nX-FAB has built their moat not through technological superiority, but through mastery of processes others consider obsolete. They still run 150mm wafer lines (ancient by industry standards) because some customers' products depend on them. More importantly, they've perfected the art of analog and mixed-signal manufacturing \u2013 the black magic of turning real-world signals into digital data and back again.\n\nCustomers stay for three reasons:\n\nSupply security (they don't abandon old processes) Automotive/medical qualifications (which take years to obtain) Process stability (crucial for analog chips)\n\nDespite their strong position, X-FAB faces real risks:\n\nCustomer concentration (45% of revenue from one customer)\n\nHigh fixed costs requiring constant high utilization\n\nThe transition to new technologies (their silicon carbide struggles)\n\nChinese competition in more commoditized processes\n\nThe moat appears remarkably durable. Their customers have essentially locked themselves into X-FAB's manufacturing processes through their own product designs. As long as cars need power management chips and medical devices need precise analog sensors, X-FAB's position looks secure.\n\nThe real question isn't whether X-FAB can maintain their current position \u2013 it's whether they can replicate their specialty manufacturing success in new technologies like silicon carbide. Their recent struggles in this area suggest that building new moats may be harder than maintaining old ones.\n\nWhile TSMC and Samsung race to build tomorrow's chips, X-FAB profits by keeping yesterday's cars running. X-FAB has turned that unglamorous role into a profitable niche, proving that in technology, sometimes the best position isn't at the cutting edge, but at the reliable center.\n\nThe World vs. X-FAB\n\nX-FAB's world is splitting into three competing realities.\n\nIn China, aggressive EV adoption drives 55% year-over-year growth in their automotive business. In Europe, their traditional customers want them to keep running decades-old processes that control luxury car brakes. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions turn their global manufacturing footprint from an efficiency play into a strategic imperative.\n\nTheir Q3 2024 results read like a geopolitical briefing. Chinese automotive revenue surges while European and American orders weaken. Their Malaysian fab becomes not just a cost advantage but a hedge against European energy prices. Even their struggles in silicon carbide (revenue down 60% year-over-year) tell a larger story about betting on global transitions that move at regional speeds.\n\nX-FAB faces a \u20ac550M question: how much to invest in new technologies when their competitive advantage lies in mastering mature ones. Their traditional automotive and industrial customers want stability and continuity \u2013 keep those proven processes running, don't change what works. Meanwhile, the electric vehicle transition demands new technologies and massive capital investment, just as geopolitical tensions make such investments riskier.\n\nIn Eastern Germany, where their headquarters sit, X-FAB faces another macro challenge: competing for semiconductor talent in a region not exactly known as a tech hub. They've managed to attract 4,500 employees from 45 nationalities to places like Erfurt (population 213,000), suggesting they've found ways to turn geographical challenges into recruitment advantages.\n\nHere's the macro reality for X-FAB: They're a European company with American and Asian operations, making chips for Chinese EVs and German luxury cars, using processes that are simultaneously obsolete and irreplaceable. They need to maintain expensive fabs in high-energy-cost regions while competing with Chinese manufacturers in lower-cost regions.\n\nYet this seemingly awkward position might be exactly where you want to be in a fragmenting world. When automotive and industrial customers worry about supply chain security, X-FAB's mastery of mature processes becomes strategically valuable. When governments push for regional semiconductor capacity, X-FAB's existing geographic footprint becomes a competitive advantage.\n\nThe world seems to be moving away from the type of globalization that produced semiconductor giants like TSMC. In a world of friend-shoring and regional manufacturing priorities, being a medium-sized specialty manufacturer with fabs in three continents might be the new smart play. Sometimes, the macro forces that look most threatening on paper create the most interesting opportunities in practice.\n\nFor X-FAB, the challenge isn't surviving in a hostile macro environment \u2013 it's managing the contradictions of a world that simultaneously wants the stability of the old and the promises of the new. Their ability to balance these opposing forces while maintaining their special sauce in analog and mixed-signal manufacturing will determine whether they emerge stronger from this period of global transformation.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Why Smart Money Worries\n\nIf semiconductor manufacturing were a game of chess, X-FAB has been playing a clever gambit: sacrificing the pursuit of cutting-edge nodes to dominate the mature technology middlegame. But their Q3 2024 earnings call reads less like a grandmaster's triumph and more like someone realizing they've run out of safe moves.\n\nLet's start with the elephant in the clean room: X-FAB's silicon carbide business just posted a 60% year-over-year revenue decline and a book-to-bill ratio of 0.38 (Q3 2024 earnings). Management has officially abandoned their 2026 target of $300-350M in SiC revenue \u2013 a target that, until recently, was their key growth narrative.\n\nThe problem isn't just cyclical. As CEO Rudi De Winter explained in Q3:\n\n\"The silicon carbide capacity expansions at our Texas fab, which has been slowed in line with current market demand, will be resumed as soon as the silicon market recovers.\"\n\nTranslation: We're caught in semiconductor manufacturing's version of a catch-22 \u2013 we need scale to be competitive, but we can't achieve scale without being competitive first.\n\nWhile every other semiconductor manufacturer is battening down the hatches \u2013 even TSMC cut their capex \u2013 X-FAB is doubling down with a \u20ac550M spending spree for 2024. Two-thirds of Q3's \u20ac150M went into their Malaysian expansion, prompting Deutsche Bank's Robert Sanders to ask the question on everyone's mind: \"Why are you not slamming on the brakes? Every one of your peers is slamming on the brakes on CapEx, but you continue to have the same plan, which is very strange.\"\n\nThe answer? They're \"really pushing the throttle\" for 180nm capacity. It's either brilliant contrarian thinking or the semiconductor equivalent of building luxury hotels in 2007.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: Their 200mm lines are running at 100% utilization (Q1 2024 transcript), while their 150mm lines languish at 50%. This isn't just inefficient \u2013 it's a structural problem masquerading as a cyclical one. As CEO De Winter admitted in Q1: \"The 150-millimeter lines are relatively -- I think the loading is in the range of 50%. So it's really low.\"\n\nRemember when having one customer provide 34% of your revenue was concerning? Well, Melexis now accounts for 45% of revenue (FY 2023 report). Yes, they share a major shareholder, which is either comforting or concerning depending on how you feel about Belgian family business dynamics.\n\nThe regional numbers tell a story that would make a geopolitical strategist wince:\n\nChina automotive revenue: +55% YoY\n\nEU/US automotive: \"weakening\" (Q3 2024)\n\nMalaysian fab: Three-day production slowdown due to \"an impurity in a chemical system\"\n\nThey're increasingly dependent on Chinese growth just as the world is rethinking semiconductor supply chains.\n\nThe numbers folks should be losing sleep over:\n\nInventory days increased to 136 from 128 (FY 2023)\n\nCash conversion cycle stretched to 143 days\n\nReceivables up 101.2% YoY\n\nThink of receivables as IOUs from customers. When they double in a year, it's like your salary doubled but your employer started paying you two months late instead of one. In X-FAB's case, they went from \u20ac73.12M to \u20ac147M in receivables (FY2023 report). Industry standard is to get paid in 45-60 days.\n\nWorking capital efficiency deteriorating\n\nX-FAB's bear case isn't about imminent doom \u2013 it's about death by a thousand cuts:\n\nTheir silicon carbide pivot is faltering just as mature technologies face pricing pressure They're spending like it's 2021 while their peers prepare for winter Their geographic diversification is becoming a liability rather than an asset High-energy-cost fabs in Germany (where electricity prices tripled post-Ukraine war) A Malaysian fab that just had a three-day shutdown over chemical impurities A Texas fab running at 50% utilization Growing dependence on Chinese automotive customers (+55% YoY) just as the U.S. and EU impose restrictions on semiconductor trade with China Their customer concentration risk is increasing, not decreasing\n\nOr as Michael Roeg from Degroof Petercam delicately asked in Q3: \"Do you think that some of these customers are holding off on ordering, especially because they think that next year they can get lower prices than in Q4?\".\n\nHe was politely pointing out a nasty trap:\n\nQ4 is traditionally when semiconductor companies do inventory corrections\n\nCustomers know silicon carbide wafer prices have fallen\n\nX-FAB's 150mm lines are running at 50% utilization\n\nTheir major expansion won't be ready until Q1 2025\n\nThe market's -50% YTD verdict suggests investors are starting to wonder if X-FAB's clever middle-market strategy has an expiration date. In semiconductors, being stuck in the middle was profitable when the industry was expanding in both directions. But in a world of friend-shoring, EV transitions, and regional semiconductor strategies, the middle might be exactly where you don't want to be.\n\nAs one analyst summarized in the Q3 call: \"You're the only company I covered that is spending more CapEx this year than last in your end markets.\" Sometimes the bear case writes itself.\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Why Smart Money Buys\n\nSometimes the most interesting investments are found in the gap between what the market thinks it sees and what's actually happening.\n\nX-FAB's stock price has been cut in half this year, suggesting investors see a company trapped in the semiconductor industry's awkward middle age. But what if being stuck in the middle is actually the point?\n\nLet's start with a heretical thought: What if not chasing Moore's Law is actually the smart play? While TSMC spends $32 billion on 2nm technology and Intel burns cash trying to catch up, X-FAB's customers are paying them $275.9 million in advance deposits just to guarantee access to technology nodes that were considered mature when Friends was still running new episodes.\n\nThis isn't just customer loyalty \u2013 it's customer captivity. CEO Rudi De Winter casually dropped a bomb in their 2023 report: they're \"the sole supplier for >90% of products manufactured.\"\n\nYes, they're spending \u20ac550M on capex while everyone else retreats. But here's the thing: their 200mm lines are running at 100% utilization (Q1 2024 transcript). When Deutsche Bank's Robert Sanders asked why they weren't \"slamming on the brakes\" like everyone else, he might have been asking exactly the wrong question.\n\nConsider:\n\nTheir 180nm technology is in allocation (demand exceeds supply)\n\nThe Malaysian expansion comes online in Q1 2025\n\nCustomers are literally paying them in advance to build this capacity\n\nThe market sees their 55% YoY growth in Chinese automotive as a risk. But flip the script: What if it's actually evidence they're on the right side of the biggest transformation in automotive history? China's EV transition isn't just about Tesla knockoffs \u2013 it's about a fundamental shift in semiconductor demand.\n\nTheir Q3 transcript reveals something fascinating:\n\n\"China automotive business has grown with 55% year-on-year and 38% quarter-on-quarter while EU and US automotive bookings weakened.\"\n\nThat's not a bug \u2013 it's a feature. They're growing fastest in precisely the market that's leading the electric vehicle revolution.\n\nYes, their silicon carbide revenue dropped 60% YoY. But buried in the Q3 transcript is this little gem: their next-generation technology offers \"improved design performance and a 30% increase in dice per wafer.\" Combined with cratering substrate prices, they're looking at a \"potential of 40% cost improvement for the final silicon carbide devices.\"\n\nTranslation: They're using the downturn to perfect a technology that could be 40% cheaper just as the market recovers. That's not a failed pivot \u2013 that's playing the long game.\n\nThe bear case sees the 45% revenue concentration in Melexis as a risk. But this Belgian family business arrangement might actually be brilliant: They've turned their biggest customer into their biggest advocate. Melexis has every incentive to help X-FAB succeed, and their shared ownership means their interests are perfectly aligned.\n\nWhile everyone fixates on the -50% YTD stock performance, consider:\n\n28.5% gross margins (FY2023)\n\n$907M revenue (22.6% growth)\n\nTrading at 6.28x earnings\n\n$405.7M cash position\n\nFor a company that's supposedly in strategic trouble, those numbers look suspiciously healthy.\n\nThe smart money bet on X-FAB isn't about believing they'll suddenly become TSMC. It's about understanding that in a world obsessed with semiconductor sovereignty and supply chain security, being a Western-owned specialty foundry with:\n\nFabs in three continents\n\n90% sole-source products\n\nDeep automotive/industrial relationships\n\nProven ability to run mature nodes profitably\n\n...might actually be exactly what the next decade needs.\n\nThe bear case sees a company caught in the middle. The bull case sees a company that's built an entire business model around being precisely where their customers need them to be. In a world where semiconductor manufacturing is becoming as much about geopolitics as technology, X-FAB's \"mature technology + global footprint + automotive/industrial focus\" might be the new clever play.\n\nAs their CEO noted in Q3:\n\n\"The fundamental drives for X-FAB business remain intact. These include the growth of semiconductor content in cars and the electrification of everything to drive the decarbonization of our world.\"\n\nAt 6.28x earnings, you're not paying for that thesis to be perfect. You're just paying for it to be less wrong than the market thinks.\n\nLife Cycle Reality Check\n\nIf X-FAB were a restaurant, it would be that impossibly old bistro that somehow survives downtown's trendiest district \u2013 not because it chases the latest food fads, but because it's mastered the art of serving comfort food to regulars who've long forgotten they have other options.\n\nTheir core business shows all the classic marks of maturity: 90% sole-supplier status, customers paying $275.9M in advance deposits just to guarantee capacity, and the kind of steady margins (28.5%) that make private equity folks salivate. This is a business that's achieved what Damodaran calls \"competitive equilibrium\" \u2013 they've found their niche and fortified it with moats made of customer switching costs.\n\nYet their financials tell a split story. That 22.6% revenue growth and \u20ac550M capex splurge (60.6% of revenue) are straight from the growth stage playbook. Their 200mm production lines are running at 100% capacity while they're pouring money into Malaysian expansion \u2013 hardly the moves of a company settling into comfortable maturity.\n\nThe lifecycle truth? X-FAB is actually two companies. Their mature analog/mixed-signal business generates the cash, while their attempts at silicon carbide and EV chips burn it in pursuit of growth. It's like watching a sensible banker moonlight as a venture capitalist.\n\nFor investors, this dual lifecycle position creates both opportunity and risk.\n\nThe next stage isn't about choosing between maturity and growth \u2013 it's about managing their Jekyll-and-Hyde reality. Can they maintain their profitable maturity while funding their growth ambitions? At 6.28x earnings, the market's betting they'll trip on this tightrope. But then again, the market once thought selling vintage vinyl was a dead business too.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nX-FAB embodies the quiet genius of mastering the mundane. They've built a billion-dollar business by perfecting semiconductor processes others consider pass\u00e9, turning \"mature technology\" from a polite industry dismissal into a \u20ac907M revenue stream.\n\n\"Sometimes the best position isn't at the cutting edge, but at the reliable center.\"\n\n- Rudi De Winter, CEO\n\nThe core reality packs a beautiful irony: Their 28.5% margins flow from manufacturing chips that control luxury car brakes using processes that predate the iPhone. This isn't nostalgia \u2013 it's monopoly by museology, and their customers are paying \u20ac275.9M in advance deposits for the privilege.\n\nThe opportunity lurks in semiconductor manufacturing's blind spot. While TSMC and Samsung wage nanometer wars, X-FAB quietly collects toll payments on technological bridges that can't be demolished \u2013 the automotive designs, industrial controls, and medical devices that keep our current world humming.\n\nThe risk? Physics doesn't care about profit margins. Eventually, even German engineering will bow to the economics of newer processes. X-FAB's \u20ac550M expansion bet assumes their customers' fear of change will outlast their desire for efficiency.\n\nWhat has to go right? Their Malaysian expansion needs to deliver. Their silicon carbide pivot needs to find its footing. Most crucially, they need to keep proving that in semiconductors, like in fine wine, age can command a premium.\n\nFor investors, X-FAB presents a semiconductor thesis wrapped in a behavioral economics puzzle: At 6.28x earnings, you're buying their ability to keep turning technological inertia into economic moats. It's a bet that in our rush to build tomorrow's world, we'll still need someone to maintain today's.\n\nThink of X-FAB as semiconductor craftsmen in an industry of mass producers. While others chase the bleeding edge, they're banking on the fact that bleeding edges eventually need bandages \u2013 preferably ones controlled by trusted, time-tested chips.\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER AND DISCLOSURE\n\n\u00a9 2025 Silba.

            "content": "Everyone wants to get rich with technology growth stocks. While others play checkers, consider playing chess with this dividend ETF.\n\nVirtually every investor wants to build wealth, but there are countless roads to this destination. When discussing potential millionaire-making investments, it often boils down to how likely they are to get you where you want to go and how long it will take.\n\nNaturally, individual stocks usually represent the home-run investment. On the other hand, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are generally about the underlying strategy because they represent many stocks (sometimes hundreds) lumped together and traded under one ticker symbol.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD 1.28%) is a popular dividend stock ETF. However, investors frequently debate whether it has enough growth and upside for wealth-seeking long-term investors. I investigated the ETF's long-term potential and the best way for investors to maximize it.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nHere is what investing in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF gets you\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF includes 103 dividend stocks, so buying a share of the ETF gives investors a sliver of ownership in over a hundred companies. Therefore, investors are highly diversified out of the gate. The fund follows the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index.\n\nAt the current share price, investors receive a 3.3% distribution (dividend) yield, far exceeding the S&P 500's 1.3%.\n\nNow, let's talk strategy. The ETF features mature, blue chip companies with a track record of paying and increasing dividends. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's top 10 positions are:\n\nPfizer : 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases\n\n: 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases BlackRock : 15 years\n\n: 15 years AbbVie : 52 years (including as part of Abbott Labs )\n\n: 52 years (including as part of ) Cisco Systems : 14 years\n\n: 14 years Coca-Cola : 62 years\n\n: 62 years Bristol Myers Squibb : 18 years\n\n: 18 years Texas Instruments : 21 years\n\n: 21 years PepsiCo : 52 years\n\n: 52 years Lockheed Martin : 22 years\n\n: 22 years Amgen: 13 years\n\nPeople focus on dividends as earnings a company could have retained and reinvested but instead gave to shareholders. That's technically true, and it's also true these mature companies aren't among the market's fastest growers.\n\nHowever, dividends also represent a litmus test. Only a high-quality and growing company can pay a dividend (a cash expense for the business) and raise it yearly. Building substantial stock market wealth requires time in most cases, and high-quality dividend stocks offer consistency for what they lack in growth.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has generated nearly 400% in total returns since late 2011. That makes the ETF a multibagger. This blue chip dividend stock strategy can enrich investors when you give it sufficient time for compounding to work its magic.\n\nThe ETF has lagged the S&P 500, but there's more to the story\n\nIn my experience, the most common argument against the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is that it lags the S&P 500, so people would be better off simply buying and holding an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nI'll never dismiss investing in the S&P 500, but it's not as strong an argument as it seems. If you look at the historical performance of the two below, you can see they were pretty close until the past five years:\n\nThe S&P 500 has become increasingly technology-weighted (33%) due to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, which currently represent 32% of its value. In other words, the S&P 500 isn't as diversified as its name implies. One could argue that a downturn in the technology sector would hurt the S&P 500 more than the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, which only has 8.8% exposure to technology.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Don't let recency bias and a technology stock boom prevent you from appreciating how effectively the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has generated wealth for investors over the past 14 years.\n\nHow to get the most out of the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF\n\nWant to invest in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF? Reinvest your dividends.\n\nThe companies in the ETF are generally growing, but they aren't growth stocks. Reinvesting the dividends means your dividends buy more ETF shares, which also pay dividends. It's an additional layer of compounding that helps supercharge your investment returns.\n\nYou're also building a dividend snowball that pays you more income as it grows. The cool part is that you can eventually keep your dividends instead of reinvesting them, meaning you're getting cash flow from your investment without selling shares. Theoretically, your portfolio could pay you forever, whereas someone who must sell their stocks for cash could run into trouble if they sell too much or the market crashes.\n\nAfter all, becoming a millionaire isn't just about labels -- it's about lifetime wealth.",

            "content": "\u201cUneasy lies the head that wears the crown\u201d \u2013 Founder of TSMC\n\nMorris Chang is both proud and uneasy about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the company he founded in 1987 that has become the undisputed world leader.\n\nTo describe his feelings, he likes to quote a phrase from \u201cKing Henry the Fourth\u201d by William Shakespeare, one of his favourite authors -- \u201cUneasy lies the head that wears the crown\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo become the leader is not easy to do. As Shakespeare says, the crown is very heavy,\u201d he said at the publication of the second half of his autobiography in Taipei last month. \u201c(Donald) Trump did not name TSMC directly, but said that Taiwan companies stole the chip business from the U.S.\u201d\n\nIn his desire to bring the chip industry back to the U.S., what measures would Trump take against producers in Taiwan and other foreign countries?\n\nThe Commonwealth magazine of Taiwan published the autobiography. Chang released the first part 27 years ago, recounting his early career with Texas Instruments and the foundation of TSMC. The second part traces his leadership of TSMC to its current global prominence until his retirement in 2018, after 31 years as its head. In the initial run, Commonwealth printed 140,000 copies, compared to the average initial printing of a book of 3,000 copies.\n\nIn 1993, TSMC was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In 1997, it become the first Taiwan company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nOn December 10, it released net revenue for the first 11 months of 2024 -- NT$2,616.15 billion, an increase of 31.8 percent compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nThe book revealed that, in 2013, Chang invited Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to join TSMC. After the 2008 financial crisis, Nvidia\u2019s market value had fallen to US$9 billion and its stock price to US$1.55 due to weak demand for personal computers. Huang was so dejected that he did not want to get out of bed or leave his house.\n\nHuang declined the invitation, saying that he already had a job and that his ownership of 7.5 per cent in Nvidia would pose a conflict of interest. \u201cI admire Huang\u2019s visionary leadership and professionalism,\u201d said Chang. \u201cHe is one of the second generation of semiconductor leaders who prioritise design and computer science over manufacturing.\u201d\n\nSince then, Nvidia has never looked back. It is one of the world\u2019s leading suppliers of AI software and hardware. In one day in June 2024, it overtook Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalisation of more than US$3.3 trillion.\n\nThe book describes Chang\u2019s relationship with his two biggest rivals \u2013 Intel and Samsung \u2013 whom it has defeated in the market.\n\nHe said that he had a good relationship with the three founders of Intel \u2013 Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore and Andy Grove but not with Pat Gelsinger, who took over as CEO in 2021. \u201cHis communication skills outweighed his strategic vision. He was hostile to TSMC.\n\n\u201cIntel\u2019s Achilles heel is the lack of a new strategy and a problematic switch a wafer foundry services. This is leading the company to miss out on AI business opportunities. It has not developed a new strategy and is searching for yet another CEO,\u201d he said. Trump wants Intel to the U.S. national champion in the field of semiconductors, and one other major American firm in this sector.\n\nOn Samsung, Chang said that its strategic flaw was technology rather than leadership or administration. \u201cSouth Korea\u2019s recent political instability is a further impediment to its operations.\u201d\n\nChris Miller, author of \u201cChip War\u201d said that, despite its poor performance, Samsung remained committed to its foundry operation. Given the influence of the founding family and the company\u2019s complexity, Samsung was likely to continue investing in foundry, even it was not immediately profitable, he said.\n\nHe said Intel was likely to receive future U.S. support, such as it has already received through the CHIPS Act and the \u201cSecure Enclave\u201d programme.\n\nOne possible threat to TSMC is an anti-trust investigation because of its dominant market position, Miller said. \u201cIt is hard to find a trillion-dollar technology that has not faced anti-trust scrutiny, such as companies like Microsoft, Google and Nvidia, We should not be surprised if TSMC faced a similar set of questions.\u201d\n\nTSMC has taken a giant step to meeting the nationalist demands of Trump by a planned investment of US$65 billion in three semiconductor plants in Phoenix, Arizona. Of this, the U.S. government is providing US$6.6 billion in grants and US$5 billion in loans.\n\nThis should make Chang\u2019s crown a little lighter.",

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Texas Instruments implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n\n51% of the business is held by the top 20 shareholders\n\n\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Texas Instruments Incorporated ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Texas Instruments.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that Texas Instruments does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Texas Instruments' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Texas Instruments is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.1% of common stock, and Capital Research and Management Company holds about 4.7% of the company stock.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Texas Instruments\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that Texas Instruments Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$216m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it. Discover if Texas Instruments might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.

Today we are looking at Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) and the best and worst performers in the analog semiconductors industry.\n\nDemand for analog chips is generally linked to the overall level of economic growth, as analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment. Unlike digital chip designers, analog chip makers tend to produce the majority of their own chips, as analog chip production does not require expensive leading edge nodes. Less dependent on major secular growth drivers, analog product cycles are much longer, often 5-7 years.\n\nThe 15 analog semiconductors stocks we track reported a mixed Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 0.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 3.2% below.\n\nAmidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 10.1% since the latest earnings results.\n\nBest Q3: Impinj (NASDAQ:PI)\n\nFounded by Caltech professor Carver Mead and one of his students Chris Diorio, Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) is a maker of radio-frequency identification (RFID) hardware and software.\n\nImpinj reported revenues of $95.2 million, up 46.4% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.5%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 adjusted operating income estimates.\n\n\u201cOur third-quarter results were strong, with revenue and profitability well above our guidance,\u201d said Chris Diorio, Impinj co-founder and CEO.\n\nImpinj Total Revenue\n\nImpinj achieved the fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street\u2019s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts\u2019 consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 34% since reporting and currently trades at $145.99.\n\nWe think Impinj is a good business, but is it a buy today? Read our full report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nHimax (NASDAQ:HIMX)\n\nTaiwan-based Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a leading manufacturer of display driver chips and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, and mobile phones.\n\nHimax reported revenues of $222.4 million, down 6.8% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.1%.

            "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Tower Semiconductor's (NASDAQ:TSEM) stock increased significantly by 21% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tower Semiconductor is:\n\n7.9% = US$206m \u00f7 US$2.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nTower Semiconductor's Earnings Growth And 7.9% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Tower Semiconductor's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 11%. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Tower Semiconductor grew its net income at a significant rate of 38% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Tower Semiconductor's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 21% in the same period, which is great to see.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to , relative to its industry.\n\nIs Tower Semiconductor Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nTower Semiconductor doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we do feel that Tower Semiconductor has some positive attributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said there was evidence China used \u201cextensive anticompetitive and non-market means\" to achieve self-sufficiency, and the Commerce Department has said subsidized low-cost Chinese chip makers might flood the global market and drive down prices.\n\nBeijing is making little secret of its industrial policy, reasoning that controlling the brains inside the world\u2019s most important consumer product is too important to be left to market forces. It is setting targets for homegrown chips and supporting domestic chip makers through state semiconductor funds including a $47 billion one started in May.\n\nForeign companies in the car-chip business, which has annual revenue of more than $80 billion, face a choice of producing more in China or losing sales. Many are choosing the former, upending the lean and efficient global supply chain for chips.\n\n\u201cIf the world wants to decouple, you can do China for China and non-China for non-China,\" said Texas Instruments\u2019 chief executive, Haviv Ilan, at a December investor briefing. \u201cIf the world stays open, and I hope it will, you can continue to have this diverse supply chain.\"\n\nThe U.S. and Europe are also promoting domestic semiconductor production. A 2022 U.S. law passed under President Biden is funding tens of billions of dollars in subsidies.\n\nIndustry executives said many of the integrated circuits China produces for vehicles are low-end commodity chips, and it is years away from complete self-sufficiency. Even so, China\u2019s progress shows how it can make strides in producing items for which it previously relied on the U.S., Europe and Japan.\n\n\u201cIt is very foolish to underestimate the ability of the Chinese to be competitive,\" said Handel Jones, founder of consulting firm International Business Strategies, who has worked with Chinese chip companies. \u201cTo get the automotive market in China, the strategy has to be: designed and made in China for the China market.\"\n\nSemiconductors have become one of the main battlegrounds in the U.S.-China tech rivalry, for both commercial and national-security reasons. In recent weeks, the two nations have engaged in a tit-for-tat bout of sanctions over high-end chips and raw materials.\n\nThe rise of Chinese auto chips doesn\u2019t stem solely from government fiat. The concentration of the world\u2019s biggest EV-manufacturing industry in China acts as a gravitational force for anyone who makes EV parts.\n\nToday\u2019s gasoline-engine cars often contain more than 700 chips to power automatic doors, run entertainment systems and control the brakes, among many other tasks, and EVs need more than twice that number. Typically those chips use mature or \u201clegacy\" technology.\n\nSemiconductors used in automotive applications accounted for about 15% of the $530 billion semiconductor market in 2023, up from 8% in 2020, according to researcher Gartner. In addition to longstanding U.S., European and Japanese makers, Qualcomm and Nvidia have entered the market with an eye on autonomous driving systems.\n\nU.S. curbs on exports of chips to China generally don\u2019t hit legacy chips. But Beijing still prefers self-sufficiency. China was the world\u2019s biggest buyer of semiconductor-making equipment in 2024, snapping up machines able to produce these commodity chips.\n\nChina\u2019s state-backed automobile association earlier this month cautioned companies against buying American processors, calling them unsafe and unreliable, the first time it had issued such a message publicly.\n\nEarlier in 2024, officials from China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology asked major carmakers to report every quarter how many locally made chips they bought, according to people briefed on the matter.\n\nChina leads the world in the rollout of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. About half of the 20 million vehicles sold in China in 2024 through November fell into one of those two categories.\n\nThat gives local semiconductor makers an opportunity. A government-backed automotive chip association, founded in 2020, took out a booth at China\u2019s premier car exhibition in April for the first time and showcased dozens of China-made processors.\n\nChinese automakers say they prefer to source locally to ensure steady supply. Some also find it easier to work with chip designers at home who can move quickly and are more willing to make customized products. This is critical because Chinese carmakers are accustomed to refreshing their EV lineups frequently like smartphones, rather than like gasoline cars updated every five years or so.\n\nThe first Chinese chips to gain share are analog and power semiconductors controlling simpler parts such as windshield wipers. As more advanced locally produced semiconductors are tested and qualified, analysts say Western rivals will begin to feel the squeeze.\n\nBeijing-based Horizon Robotics, a rival to Nvidia and Qualcomm in car chips, said it had 25 automaker customers as of June 2024, up from 14 in 2021. Horizon said domestic suppliers could \u201cbetter cater to the demand and preference of the Chinese customers.\"\n\nA teardown by researchers at UBS in 2023 found that all of the power semiconductors in the BYD Seal, a popular sedan in China, came from Chinese suppliers.\n\nIn September, Wilmington, Mass.-based Analog Devices said it lost some market share in 2023 owing to China\u2019s push for indigenous chips but conditions stabilized in 2024. \u201cIt is still a growth market, but we\u2019re unsure if it\u2019s the fastest growth market going forward,\" said Michael Lucarelli, the company\u2019s vice president for investor relations.\n\nFor now, Western players are trying to keep their edge in China. Switzerland-based STMicroelectronics formed a joint venture to produce chips for cars and industrial power sectors with a state-linked company in 2023, while Dutch chip maker NXP said in November it wanted to localize production of processors for Chinese automakers.\n\nChief Executive Kurt Sievers said the market has turned upside down from the days when Western carmakers were NXP\u2019s lead customers and the company would sell the resulting products to Chinese customers.\n\nNow, with Chinese carmakers leading in self-driving vehicles and electrification, \u201cwe start to use them and leverage them as lead customers and eventually sell them to the West,\" Sievers said.\n\nWrite to Liza Lin at liza.lin@wsj.com and Raffaele Huang at raffaele.huang@wsj.com",

            "content": "Texas Instruments (TXN) closed the latest trading day at $187.96, indicating a -1.68% change from the previous session's end. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 1.07% for the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.97%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 1.19%.\n\nThe the stock of chipmaker has fallen by 4.9% in the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.8% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.36%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Texas Instruments will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.19, indicating a 20.13% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $3.86 billion, reflecting a 5.38% fall from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nTXN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.08 per share and revenue of $15.5 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -28.15% and -11.52%, respectively.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Texas Instruments. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. At present, Texas Instruments boasts a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Texas Instruments has a Forward P/E ratio of 37.63 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 31.69, which means Texas Instruments is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nIt is also worth noting that TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 4.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 3.1 as of yesterday's close.",

            "content": "It\u2019s tough to be an American worker.\n\nYou\u2019re a victim of collusion between the government and big business to suppress your wages through imported foreign labor, and when you object to losing your job to a foreigner you\u2019re deemed a racist or lazy \u2013 or both.\n\nCredit, I guess, to Vivek Ramaswamy for setting off the dispute about American talent and the real \u201creason\u201d top tech companies hire foreign engineers. Perhaps you\u2019ve seen his tweet, and if you haven\u2019t it\u2019s worth a hate read. It\u2019s supposedly about culture: that we celebrate mediocrity, that we need less sleepovers and more math tutoring, more extracurriculars and less \u201changing out at the mall.\u201d That we celebrate \u201cZach & Slater over Screech in Saved by the Bell.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, what the hell is this about Screech? We were raised on Saved by the Bell. Call us subject matter experts. America doesn\u2019t achieve because it doesn\u2019t venerate Screech, the smart kid who lacked common sense and social intelligence? That Screech?\n\nAnd is this the way to build well-rounded adults or to ensure STEM dominance? To deny them bonds with their friends (sleepovers) and the freedom of leisure (\u201changing out at the mall\u201d) and what they learn through high school sports (discipline and teamwork), and to instead replace it with forced science camp and Saturday mornings doing long subtraction and a regiment to make them the most capable of increasing shareholder value in the future? What a miserable existence.\n\nWe dare think of what Vivek might of other activities that are undisputedly worthwhile for the development of the young, whether they be hiking or fishing or simply exploring the outside world. You have your whole life to be a corporate drone \u2013 let them enjoy their youth while they can. It can make a better person in the long run.\n\nNot that America doesn\u2019t have its educational or cultural problems, and the lowering of standards has certainly undercut the development of our brightest, but we still produce the best STEM talent out there. It\u2019s also worth noting that many of the brilliant engineers and scientists and entrepreneurs that built America and American technology didn\u2019t have the upbringing or grades that Vivek demands.\n\nSteve Jobs was a mischievous kid who who dropped out of college after a semester. Steve Wozniak, who co-founded Apple with Jobs, was an electronics prodigy who was self-taught. Wozniak left the University of Colorado after running up a $50,000 bill (measured in today\u2019s dollars) in computing time.\n\nOr consider Jack Kilby, who was from small-town Kansas and had a variety of interests as a young man: sports, photography, radio, and especially electronics \u2013 an endeavor he had the freedom and time to explore. He failed the MIT entrance exam and enrolled at the University of Illinois to Electrical Engineering. Kilby had average grades as an undergraduate and later received an MS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin. He went on to invent the integrated circuit (microchip) during his time at Texas Instruments (independently and concurrently with Bob Noyce). Kilby would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000.\n\nBut Kilby\u2019s story is not only relevant to Vivek\u2019s misguided rant. It also poses a question: would Kilby be given an opportunity in America\u2019s current economic climate, where talented and well-qualified citizens are ignored for cheaper foreign labor?\n\nOr - are just how many other talented Americans are passed-over, or fired and replaced, so the mega-corps can earn an extra quarter cent per share?\n\nAs you may have seen, the Twitter discussion over the hiring of foreign workers evolved into a debate over corporate labor abuses with a specific focus on the H-1B program, which \u201capplies to employers seeking to hire nonimmigrant aliens as workers in specialty occupations (those that require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree) or as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability.\u201d\n\nAnd it was enlightening, if only to see that the supporters of H-1B in its current form (or in many cases a slightly reduced form) essentially disclaim any sense of duty towards, or a mere interest in, fellow Americans who lose their livelihoods to imported competitors. Corporate profits seem to be the only measure by which a country\u2019s worth should be valued \u2013 not social cohesion or a person\u2019s opportunity to earn an honest living.\n\nThose wanting a fair system, those opposing cheap foreign labor and advocating for the interests of American workers (and their families, on whom they rely), are labeled racists or pelted with insults: the \u201cwoke right\u201d, DEI for white people, slothful, etc. We haven\u2019t seen anything this disingenuous and this dishonest in a long time.\n\nCase in point from serial plagiarist Collin Rugg:\n\nOf course, the debate isn\u2019t over who will work longer hours and it\u2019s dishonest to say otherwise. H-1B workers (or other imported equivalents) aren\u2019t working 80 hours \u2013 save for a few exceptions, nobody else is either. Even the overworked associates in BigLaw aren\u2019t putting up those numbers for the most part. Again, there are exceptions. And it\u2019s not about laziness; Americans are generally willing to study and work and contribute, and they do so in with creative ingenuity that many other countries can\u2019t replicate.\n\nThen there\u2019s the wrong argument that this has to do with merit \u2013 that American\u2019s aren\u2019t as qualified for the jobs, thus necessitating work visas. The proponents of imported labor would have you believe that American employees, who have thrived in positions for years, are inadequate. So inadequate, in fact, that the companies promoted these same employees over the course of their careers and trust them to train their replacements.\n\nTo support our point, a Vice President for Cognizant, a staffing firm that has sourced tens of thousands of H-1B visa holders to tech firms and other industries (and which abuses the H-1B system to replace its own workers), recently \u201cadmitted that visa workers are not more \u2018skilled\u2019 than U.S. workers.\u201d No shock there - American engineers have long known about the poor quality of work of their foreign peers.\n\nCognizant, by the way, was recently held by a jury to be liable for intentional discrimination against non-South Asian and non-Indian employees for whom it sponsored H-1B visas. This isn\u2019t just a one-off for Cognizant; back in 2020, the EEOC found the company discriminated against a \u201cnationwide class of non-Indian employees on the basis of race and national origin.\u201d And in 2018, an internal Cognizant report documented that H-1B holders were the beneficiary of racial disparities in rates of \u201cinvoluntary terminations.\u201d (That\u2019s just the tip of the corporate misconduct regarding the H-1B program. There\u2019s a ton out there if you care to look.)\n\nInstead of merit or the willingness to work, this is what it has always been about: cheap labor and the discriminatory practices that come with it. As reported by Bloomberg, one global executive for Cognizant said the company\u2019s \u201cpreference for Indian H-1B workers is intrinsic to its outsourcing business model because they are almost the cheapest labor option.\u201d And at trial, this text from one Cognizant executive was admitted as evidence: \u201cAn open secret: we hired H1s for the longest because they were cheaper labor that would relocate anywhere.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that American jobs are being taken. It\u2019s also that American wages are being intentionally depressed. So much for the alleged talent shortage.\n\nAll of this coincides with mass layoffs of domestic employees by the very companies that take advantage of the H-1B system. In 2022, \u201cthe top 30 H-1B employers hired more than 34,000 new H-1B workers.\u201d Those same companies \u201calso laid off, or [would] imminently lay off, at least 85,000 workers in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.\u201d\n\nIt comes as no surprise that cheap labor has always been the end-strategy \u2013 or at least the predicted result \u2013 of H-1B. As observed by Eric Weinstein, the effect of holding down wages (and providing less of an incentive for Americans to enter certain professions) has been known since the start. It\u2019s simple supply and demand.\n\nIf we are to discuss solutions, then we have to be honest about the problems. How do we support American workers, and support living wages, while attracting the top talent from overseas? It\u2019s easy to do both. End H-1B, which victimizes the American middle class, and keep the O-1 visa for those individuals with extraordinary achievements or abilities. H-1B has run its course. Don\u2019t feel bad for the mega-corporations - it was their abuse of the system that will hopefully contribute to its demise.",

The $2.6 billion program aims to create a lunar economy while learning more about the moon in preparation for the first crewed flights to the lunar surface in more than 50 years.\n\n\u201cFirefly is proud to land our fourth NASA award for another complex mission, which is what our team does best,\u201d Firefly CEO Jason Kim said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nScheduled for 2028, Firefly\u2019s new contract calls for the company\u2019s Elytra Dark transfer vehicle to deploy one of its Blue Ghost lunar landers into orbit around the moon. The transfer vehicle will stay on orbit to provide communications while Blue Ghost attempts to land in the Gruithuisen Domes, silica-rich volcanic features on the near side of the moon.\n\nOnce on the surface, Blue Ghost is to deploy a rover and operate for more than 14 days.\n\nA Blue Ghost lunar lander is seen earlier this year at Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Cedar Park headquarters. William Luther/San Antonio Express-News\n\nIt will carry six NASA instruments to take samples and measurements and carry out other projects. Multiple instruments attached to both the lander and rover will be used to determine the composition of the domes.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe launch provider for the mission, which is scheduled for 2028, has not been announced.\n\nMission 1 countdown\n\nFirefly\u2019s first lunar payload services mission, dubbed Ghost Riders in the Sky, is set to launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in mid-January.\n\nFirefly Aerospace employee Will Coogan stands in front of a model of the Blue Ghost lunar lander earlier this year at the company\u2019s Cedar Park headquarters as he touches a model of a probe designed by Southwest Research Institute. The lander, with the SwRI built probe, is scheduled to go to the moon next month. William Luther/San Antonio Express-News\n\nIn that mission, a Blue Ghost lander carrying 10 NASA instruments \u2014 including one built at San Antonio-based Southwest Research Institute \u2014 will attempt to land near the Mons Latreille within Mare Crisium, a 300-mile-wide basin on the northeast quadrant of the moon\u2019s near side.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nSwRI\u2019s Lunar Magnetotelluric Sounder is a $4.8 million device that consists of a control box, four electrodes attached to wires and a telescoping boom with a magnetometer.\n\nThe electrodes, each a few inches long, are housed in softball-sized launchers the engineers call \u201cyarn balls\u201d attached to each side of the lander. Once Blue Ghost is on the moon, the electrodes are to shoot out from their launchers and settle on the lunar surface to measure currents and collect data.\n\nIn May, David Stillman, a project scientist working in SwRI\u2019s office in Boulder, Colo., described the launchers as \u201cspring-loaded mortars\u201d that shoot the small metal electrodes about 20 meters from the spacecraft.\n\nA Blue Ghost lunar lander is seen earlier this year at Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Cedar Park headquarters.

Scheduled for 2026, the mission is to deploy the European Space Agency\u2019s Lunar Pathfinder satellite into lunar orbit before landing a Blue Ghost on the dark side of the moon.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nFirefly\u2019s fourth lunar payload services contract is an $18 million contract to provide radio frequency calibration services from lunar orbit as part of Blue Ghost Mission 2.\n\nShown is Firefly Aerospace\u2019s manufacturing facility in rural Bertram in northeast Burnet County where the company manufactures and test rockets and rocket engines. William Luther/San Antonio Express-News\n\nNASA so far has had mixed success with the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.\n\nIn January, its first mission saw Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology attempt to send its Peregrine lander to the moon. The craft experienced a series of problems including a valve failure and burst propellant tank after separating from the Vulcan rocket that ferried it to space. The lander was guided back toward Earth where it burned up over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThen, during the second lunar payload services mission in February, Houston-based Intuitive Machines made history when its uncrewed lander successfully touched down. It was the first-ever privately owned spacecraft to land on the moon and the first U.S. vehicle to touch down there since Apollo 17 in 1972.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nArtemis itself is increasingly behind schedule and over budget.\n\nEarlier this month, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced new delays in the program, pushing back the next two planned missions amid potential policy changes under President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nNelson told a news conference at NASA headquarters that the Artemis II mission, sending astronauts around the moon and back, has now slipped to April 2026 from a planned September 2025 launch.

            "content": "The Semiconductor Leader\n\nAs electronics and microchips made their way into virtually every product, from washing machines to cameras and phones, their manufacturers became increasingly large and important companies.\n\nThe first dominant actors of the nascent tech industry were established in the USA, with companies like Intel (INTC +14.6%) and IBM (IBM -1.53%). Quickly after, the industry shifted toward Asia, with Japan and then Taiwan benefiting from the combination of high-quality labor and lower costs.\n\nThis shift over costs turned into a long-term advantage. Experience and accumulated R&D effort transformed the Asian chip foundries into giants, which today produce most of the global chip supply.\n\nBesides almost the entire industry, one company dominates the most advanced chip production process: the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM -3.15% )\n\nA State-Led Initiative\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987, at the initiative of the Taiwanese government to build the country\u2019s chip industry from scratch. It was a spin-off from the government research institute ITRI (Industrial Technology Research Institute) .\n\nThis was after industry leaders like Texas Instruments and Intel declined the opportunity, with only Philips willing to sign a joint venture and invest $58M & IPs in exchange for 27.5% in TSMC.\n\nToday, the Taiwanese government still owns 6% of TSMC, and Philips would sell all its TSMC shares in 2008 .\n\nDr. Morris Chang was instrumental in founding the company. Born in China, and with 25 years of experience working at Texas Instruments, he would be remembered as known as the \u201cfather of semiconductors\u201d.\n\nCutting Into Intel\u2019s Business Model\n\nAt the time, there were plenty of \u201cfabless\u201d chip producers, companies designing the chips, but having no manufacturing facilities, having this job done instead by the likes of Intel (a fab, or foundry, is the industry term for a chip factory).\n\nThis was in large part because the manufacturing needed equipment worth $50M to $100M to engrave silicon wafers and turn them into computer chips.\n\nThe chip manufacturing process is a very complex one, relying on an ultra-specialized supply chain, where the foundry (fab) is in charge of assembling together as efficiently as possible the diverse manufacturing equipment (wafers, lithography, heating, doping, packaging, assembling, etc.).\n\nAs a result, Intel could not only ask for high prices but even force fabless producers to have the right to design. Intel could later on bring its own competing design that is produced in-house.\n\nTSMC would make its way into the industry by being the first pure \u201cfoundry\u201d, offering manufacturing services without competing with its fabless clients.\n\nAt the time, TSMC was lagging behind in technology, but this offer proved highly successful. Early customers included companies like Broadcom (AVGO -1.48%), and later on, Apple (AAPL -3.36%), Nvidia (NVDA -0.14%), AMD (AMD -2.66%), etc.\n\nTSMC would IPO in Taiwan in 1994, and be listed on the NYSE in 1997, the same year it reached a 1 million silicon wafer capacity.\n\nRise Of A Tech Giant\n\nThe Elephant In The Room\n\nAnother factor in TSMC's success was its dedication to R&D. Determined to quickly fill the technological gap with industry leaders, the company invested a massive amount of money in new machinery and research.\n\nThe large ownership by the Taiwanese government was also important in the early days. The government was satisfied with the company's progress in the industry and high-value jobs and did not care much about a quick return on its money.\n\nOver time, TSMC became the semiconductor foundry, with no less than 59.5% of the industry\u2019s revenues, far ahead of its largest competitor, Samsung (16.1%).\n\nThis lead is getting stronger over time, with TSMC having captured a very large part of the industry growth from 2019 and the Q2 2024 revenue share reaching 62%.\n\nLeading In Advanced Nodes\n\nFrom its beginning as a more fair production partner, TSMC has progressively become the technology leader of the industry, especially in the \u201cleading edge\u201d chips.\n\nChips are generally classified by the size of their processor.\n\nIn general, all nodes above 16-28 nanometers (nm) are considered legacy semiconductors. They are still very important for the global economy, as they are the bulk of the world's semiconductor consumption for appliances, cars, infrastructures, defense equipment, etc. These chips are, however, mostly a commodity with very low margins for the producers.\n\nIn contrast, the most recent nodes are where most of the profit of the industry is made, with often more demand than the foundries can provide, and that holds especially true for TSMC.\n\nToday, the company is leading in the most advanced node, 3nm, and the upcoming 2nm is even more in demand, expected to be larger than 5nm and 3nm combined .\n\nMass production of TSMC's 2nm node is expected to start in 2025. It will likely be a tight competition with Samsung, which has also started preparing 2nm and 1.4nm production lines .\n\nA turning point for TSMC was in 2010, when Apple chose it as the supplier for the chips of its iPhones , whose sales were exploding. For the past two decades, smartphones and advanced computers and data centers (or HPC\u2014High-Performance Computing) have been the core applications for the most advanced chips, advancing the industry and paying for the associated massive R&D costs.\n\nTo this day, Apple is still TSMC's largest consumer, followed by Nvidia.\n\nEUV\n\nWhat makes the smallest and most advanced nodes unique is that they use a new technology called EUV (Extreme UltraViolet lithography), an upgrade from the previous DUV (Deep UltraViolet).\n\nCurrently, EUV is the monopoly of the Dutch company ASML (ASML -1.25%), the sole manufacturer of EUV lithography machines.\n\nBack in 2019 , TSMC\u2019s 7nm node chips were made with the first EUV process, delivering high volume customer products to the market.\n\nThe next step, a lithography machine called High NA (Numerical Aperture) EUV, is now being shipped to semiconductor foundries, to Intel in December 2023, and to TSMC a year later, and Samsung is expected to get it by 2025.\n\nIt should be noted that beyond production itself, the design costs for chips using increasingly smaller processors is growing almost exponentially, indicating that maybe at some point in the future, the race to smaller processors will bring diminishing returns.\n\nChina, US Factories & Trade Wars\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Awkward Diplomatic Status\n\nDue to the importance of advanced chip manufacturing for AI, defense, and the tech industry in general, this is a very strategically important industry.\n\nAt the same time, the Chinese government officially considers Taiwan as a \u201crebellious province of China\u201d, and not an independent country. A situation that is currently the official position of most countries, including the US (\u201cOne China policy\u201d), with, for example, a declaration by Joe Biden in 2024 that the \u201c U.S. does not support Taiwan independence \u201d.\n\nAt the same time, the US is arming Taiwan to defend against a potential Chinese invasion and has repeatedly implied it would go to war with China over an attack on the island.\n\nTSMC As A Target?\n\nThis puts TSMC, as the producer of the most important industry of the island, in a tough geopolitical spot.\n\nOn one hand, it is a technological leader in a de-facto (but not de jure) independent country under the protection umbrella of the USA.\n\nOn the other hand, it could become the prime target in any military action, with US lawmakers even suggesting the US itself should be ready to bomb TSMC's factories to prevent China from acquiring them in case of an invasion.\n\nThis idea was strongly supported by Elbridge Colby , now Trump\u2019s nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.\n\nTSMC American Factories\n\nUnder the geopolitical risk of an interruption of Taiwan's supply, the US has been pressuring TSMC to open more factories in mainland America.\n\nThis led to plans since 2020 to open a large foundry in Arizona , to which another fab was added in 2022, bringing the total investment to $40B.\n\nThe move has not been without issues, as TSMC is struggling to find adequately trained local workers and reports of conflicts arising from differences in work culture between Taiwanese and American employees .\n\nNevertheless, the first production should start in 2025 for the first fab, and production yield (the efficiency of properly engraved chips, a key industry metric) is now higher in Phoenix than in Taiwan .\n\nThe second fab will start production in 2028 for 3nm and 2nm process. A third fab was even announced that will focus on the 2nm process and beyond, to start production by the end of the decade.\n\nTrade War Collateral Damages\n\nAs the US tries to limit access to advanced technologies in China, especially for computing and AI, the country's semiconductor industry has been subject to restrictions and sanctions.\n\nThis started with banning the export of EUV machines to China, to an ever-expanding list of banned products, including all advanced chips.\n\nIf this had succeeded, it would have been great news for non-Chinese chip manufacturers.\n\nHowever, this has led China to develop it domestic foundry capacity as aggressively as possible. At the heart of this effort are state-owned SMIC and Huawei.\n\nSMIC claims to have developed a 5nm process without EUV . China is also looking at developing its own EUV lithography, as well as replacing the entirety of the international semiconductor supply chain with domestic manufacturers.\n\nAmong the possible alternatives to EUV, and even more High-NA EUV, the following solutions have been proposed:\n\nBuilding a massive cyclotron (particle accelerator) to replace the ASML-type lithography machines.\n\n(particle accelerator) to replace the ASML-type lithography machines. Replicating ASML's machines , a task mostly taken on by Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE).\n\n, a task mostly taken on by Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE). A refocus on photonics , a field where the West does not hold a significant advantage, and which could be the future of computing. Neuromorphic chip designs are also being considered, especially for AI applications.\n\n, a field where the West does not hold a significant advantage, and which could be the future of computing.\n\nIn the long run, this could prove the largest threat to TSMC, more than its traditional rivals. This is because China is already consuming more than 50% of the global chip supply .\n\nSo, it could provide companies like SMIC the domestic demand to scale up to the size where it could rival TSMC while also benefiting from tax advantages, access to capital, and other advantages provided by the Chinese government to a strategic sector.\n\nTSMC Financials\n\nFor an industrial company, TSMC had a remarkably high gross margin of 57.8% in Q3 2024, up 3% from the previous year. This converts into an equally impressive 42.8% net profit margin. The company has very little debt, with total liabilities equal to the cash on hand.\n\nThe stock price has grown threefold since its low point at the end of the pandemic and tenfold in the past ten years.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM -3.15% )\n\nThe company also started to pay dividends in 2004 and has never reduced dividends per share since.\n\nConclusion\n\nTSMC is maybe the most important chip & semiconductor manufacturer in the world. The company has a long history of building a solid competitive advantage, first with fairer deals, and then with a persistent lead in quality, technology, and yields, allowing it to generate consistently impressive margins, especially for a manufacturing business.\n\nAs a result, although it is not without competition, with Samsung and Intel serious contenders, it is far behind in market share of the uncontested leader. It will likely take years at best for Chinese foundries to catch up as well.\n\nAn investment in TSMC is not without risks; however, the largest is almost completely out of control of the company's management. Would a Chinese invasion of Taiwan occur, it would certainly devastate the company's ability to produce chips and even maybe destroy its factories or see them seized by what would then be a hostile foreign nation.\n\nSo, investors in the company will need to monitor not only whether TSMC's advantages in technology and manufacturing excellence persist, including against SMIC and other Chinese firms, but also the global geopolitical situation.",

Traditional Chinese manufacturers like Gree Electric made surprising pivots into chips, highlighting the industry's rapidly evolving landscape amid intensifying technological competition.\n\nUS launches probe into China's silicon carbide chip dominance amid domestic industry struggles\n\nIn a significant move highlighting the intensifying US-China tech rivalry, the US government has initiated a Section 301 investigation into China's silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor manufacturing while boosting support for domestic producers through substantial funding packages.\n\nThe investigation comes as Chinese manufacturers have captured nearly 50% of global SiC substrate exports in the first nine months of 2024, putting pressure on US companies like Wolfspeed, which has faced significant challenges including a CEO departure, workforce reduction, and facility closures despite receiving $750 million in government support.\n\nThe US administration has responded by extending financial aid to other domestic producers, including Bosch ($575 million in combined subsidies and loans), X-Fab ($50 million), and Coherent ($48 million), as Chinese competitors like TankeBlue and Sanan continue aggressive capacity expansion, with China projected to reach an annual SiC substrate production capacity of 4.68 million wafers by 2026.\n\nChinese memory maker begins DDR5 production, challenging global rivals\n\nChangXin Memory Technologies has begun mass-producing DDR5 memory chips with an 80% yield rate, marking China's first entry into advanced DRAM manufacturing and potentially disrupting the market dominated by Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron.\n\nWhile CXMT hasn't officially confirmed the production, Chinese module manufacturers are already selling 32GB DDR5 modules using chips made with 17.5-nanometer technology, pushing beyond US export restrictions that limit Chinese firms to 18nm processes. The development follows CXMT's successful LPDDR5 rollout for mobile devices and partnerships with Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi and Transsion.\n\nIndustry experts predict the company's monthly production capacity will peak in 2025 at 170,000 wafers, though its notable exclusion from recent US sanctions may be linked to Japanese diplomatic efforts to protect equipment suppliers' interests in the Chinese market.\n\nBiden's chip scrutiny may reshape global semiconductor landscape\n\nUS intensifies oversight of China's mature process chips amid growing tensions in the semiconductor industry, prompting major American PC manufacturers to eliminate Chinese-designed components from their supply chains and forcing IC design firms to adapt their strategies.\n\nWhile Chinese clients increasingly demand domestic chip fabrication, industry experts maintain that China's expanding mature process capacity primarily serves internal needs, with limited global impact due to the technological advantages held by US and Taiwanese firms. The potential tightening of US restrictions could benefit Taiwanese companies by neutralizing Chinese competitors' pricing advantages, though it may also accelerate China's push for technological independence.\n\nMarket analysts anticipate that new policies will deepen market decoupling, particularly affecting US and Chinese sectors, while creating opportunities for European and Taiwanese firms equipped with flexible production capabilities to navigate the evolving landscape.\n\nChinese appliance makers, shoe firm make unexpected pivot to chip sector amid US curbs\n\nTraditional Chinese manufacturers are making surprising forays into the semiconductor industry as the nation seeks to counter US trade restrictions. Home appliance giant Gree Electric, footwear manufacturer AoKang International, and rare earth entrepreneur Shi-hui Zhu have emerged as unlikely players in the chip sector through various investments and acquisitions.\n\nNotable moves include Gree's CNY5.5 billion investment in a silicon carbide chip facility, AoKang's stake in memory chip maker United Memory Technology, and Zhu's controlling investment in semiconductor equipment firm Wanye Enterprises through his Vital group. While Gree's vertical integration strategy in developing chips for its appliances shows promise, industry observers remain skeptical about AoKang's ability to navigate the complex semiconductor landscape, particularly given its recent financial struggles with losses of CNY576 million in 2022-2023.\n\nThe trend highlights China's aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency, though experts caution that success in this highly technical sector requires more than just capital investment.\n\nGree claims chip independence as Chinese appliance maker ships 200 million units\n\nGree Electric, China's leading air conditioner manufacturer, has achieved a significant milestone in its semiconductor venture, shipping nearly 200 million self-developed chips without government funding, according to Chairwoman Ming-zhu Dong. The company's chip journey, which began in 2012, has evolved from establishing China's first domestic IPM production line to building what it claims will be Asia's largest automated compound semiconductor facility.\n\nWith investments totaling over CNY50 billion in chip R&D and a product portfolio spanning MCUs, AIoT SoCs, and power semiconductors, Gree has reported impressive growth in its semiconductor segment, generating CNY10 billion in revenue and CNY2 billion in net profit in 2023.\n\nHowever, this diversification comes amid challenges in its core business, with the company facing declining air conditioner sales and investor skepticism about its transformation strategy, as its main appliance business saw a 5.39% revenue drop in the first three quarters of 2024.\n\nChina's mature chip push raises global market disruption concerns\n\nChina's aggressive expansion in mature semiconductor manufacturing, backed by substantial state investments and following its successful solar panel strategy playbook, is raising concerns about potential market disruption despite US export controls. With Chinese semiconductor equipment spending projected to reach $41 billion in 2024 \u2013 representing 40% of global expenditure \u2013 and SMIC's record $7.5 billion capital expenditure in 2023, Beijing is rapidly building domestic chip-making capabilities.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Bernstein data show China's share of global mature chip production has grown from 14% in 2017 to 18% in 2023, while domestic customers now represent 53% of local foundries' demand, up from 48% in 2017.
