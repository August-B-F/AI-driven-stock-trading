Shell estimates recoverable resources to be 370 million barrels.\n\n\u201cGato do Mato is an example of our ongoing investment in increasingly efficient projects\u201d, commented Zo\u00eb Yujnovich, integrated gas and upstream director at Shell. \u201cThe project contributes to maintaining stable liquids production from our advantaged Upstream business, and expands our leadership as the largest foreign producer in Brazil as we continue working to provide for the world\u2019s energy needs well into the future\u201d.\n\nThe discovery straddles two contiguous blocks: BM-S-54, awarded 2005, and Sul de Gato do Mato, a 2017 production sharing agreement. The leaseholds are located off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in water depths ranging from 1,750 meters (5,741.47 feet) to 2,050 meters, according to Shell.\n\nShell operates the Gato do Mato consortium with a 50 percent stake through Shell Brasil Petr\u00f3leo Ltda. Ecopetrol SA owns 30 percent. TotalEnergies SE holds the remaining 20 percent. State-owned Pr\u00e9-Sal Petr\u00f3leo SA (PPSA) manages the production sharing contract.\n\n\u201cInitial operations will involve the reinjection of natural gas for reservoir pressure support, with future optionality to export gas to onshore facilities\u201d, Shell said.\n\n\u201cThe investment in Gato do Mato is expected to generate an internal rate of return in excess of the hurdle rate for Shell\u2019s Upstream business\u201d, it added.\n\nLast year Shell and its partners in Atapu, another Santos field, reached a final investment decision on a phase 2 project. Expected to start production 2029, the second phase will have a new FPSO with a capacity of 225,000 bopd. Phase 1 went onstream 2020 through FPSO P70, which has a capacity of 150,000 bopd.\n\nAtapu is operated by Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro SA with a 65.7 percent interest. Shell owns 16.7 percent, France\u2019s TotalEnergies 15 percent, Petrogal Brasil Ltda. 1.7 percent and PPSA 0.9 percent.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024 Shell and its partners put onstream another Santos Basin project, Mero3. Mero\u2019s phase 3 has a production capacity of 180,000 bpd, which will raise the field\u2019s installed capacity to 590,000 bpd, according to the owners.\n\nPetrobras operates Mero with a 38.6 percent stake.

            "content": "The board of TotalEnergies SE ( ) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 1st of April, with investors receiving $0.79 per share. The payment will take the dividend yield to 5.6%, which is in line with the average for the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTotalEnergies' Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings\n\nUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Based on the last payment, TotalEnergies was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 22.8% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 37% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $3.26 total annually to $3.5. Dividend payments have been growing, but very slowly over the period. It's encouraging to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth anyway, which makes this less attractive as an income investment.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. We are encouraged to see that TotalEnergies has grown earnings per share at 10% per year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.\n\nWe Really Like TotalEnergies' Dividend\n\nOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out that investors should take into consideration.

In her capacity as Chair of the Audit Committee since 2021, Maria van der Hoeven has notably overseen this Committee's work on taking account of regulatory developments in extra-financial reporting.\n\nIn view of the corporate governance practice of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors, according to which a director must not reach the age of 75 during her or his term of office, Mrs. Maria van der Hoeven and Mr. Jean Lemierre did not seek the renewal of their mandates.\n\nOn the proposal of the Governance and Ethics Committee, the Board of Directors decided to submit to the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on May 23, 2025 the renewal for a period of three years of the directorships of Mrs. Lise Croteau.\n\nThe directorships of Mrs. Lise Croteau, Mrs. Maria van der Hoeven, Mr. Jean Lemierre as well as Mrs. Emma de Jonge, director representing employee shareholders, expire at the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 23, 2025.\n\nThe Board of Directors of TotalEnergies SE (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) met on March 19, 2025 under the chairmanship of Mr. Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. It has decided to convene the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of the Corporation on Friday, May 23, 2025. The Notice of Meeting will be published soon in France's BALO ( Bulletin des Annonces L\u00e9gales et Obligatoires ) and will be available on the Company's website. The Board of Directors also approved the documents that will be submitted to shareholders at the Annual Meeting, including the Management Report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOf Korean origin and American and French nationality, Mrs. Helen Lee Bouygues has been residing in France since 2004. She holds a MBA from Harvard Business School. For over 25 years, she has been supporting the strategic transformation of leading French and international companies. Thanks to her extensive experience as a director and member of audit committees of listed companies, such as Neoen SA and Viridien SA (formerly CGG), Helen Lee Bouygues has developed a broad understanding of the various challenges faced by companies, particularly in the energy sector. She will thus bring her financial and strategic expertise to the Board.\n\nMr. Laurent Mignon, a French national, a graduate from HEC and from the Executive Program at Stanford, is Chairman of the Executive Board (Pr\u00e9sident du Directoire) of Wendel, an investment company, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas, in which Wendel holds a controlling interest in Bureau Veritas and fully consolidates.\n\nHe will bring to the Board his leading expertise in the banking and financial sector and the wealth of his experience in investments and general management of listed companies. Throughout his career, he has successfully led the transformation and development of the companies he has managed, with a constant desire to create sustainable value.\n\nThe appointment of a new director representing employee shareholders, replacing Ms. Emma de Jonge, will also be submitted to the vote of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. The Board will recommend to the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting the candidacy of Ms. Val\u00e9rie Della Puppa-Tibi, presented by the collective investments fund (FCPE) TotalEnergies Actionnariat France (TAF), i.e., the largest employee shareholding fund in terms of share of capital held (4.82% of the Corporation's capital as of December 31, 2024). Ms. Val\u00e9rie Della Puppa-Tibi, who was already a member of the Board of Directors from 2019 to 2022, will therefore immediately be able to contribute fully to the work of the Board. The Board thanks Ms. Emma de Jonge for her active contribution to the work of the Board.\n\nAt the end of the Shareholder\u2019s Meeting on May 23, 2025, if the Board proposed resolutions are approved, the Board of Directors will be composed of 14 members, of whom 8 will be French and 6 Internationals. The proportion of independent directors as defined by the AFEP-MEDEF Code will stand at 82%, in line with best standards. The proportion of women and men will be 45% and 55% respectively.\n\nSustainability & Climate - 2025 Progress Report\n\nDuring the Shareholders\u2019 Meetings of 2023 and 2024, in response to consultative resolution projects submitted at the initiative of shareholders, the Board of Directors reaffirmed its strong commitment to shareholder dialogue and invited shareholders who wish to open a debate with the Board of Directors to place an item on the agenda of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting as provided for in the French Commercial Code, emphasizing that \"this would be a better way to engage in dialogue with shareholders in the future\".\n\nIn a context of major regulatory changes (CSRD) and controversies regarding the practice of Say on Climate through consultative resolutions, the Board of Directors conducted a review of the practices of its peers, market developments, and a consultation with shareholders and proxy advisors to gather their expectations regarding Say on Climate.\n\nFollowing this review, the Board of Directors decided to include a formal item for debate (without a resolution submitted to the shareholders' vote) on the agenda of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on May 23, 2025, concerning the Sustainability & Climate - 2025 Progress Report. This report accounts for the progress made in implementing the Corporation\u2019s ambition in terms of sustainable development and energy transition towards carbon neutrality, as well as its objectives in this area by 2030.\n\nThe Board of Directors intends to make this practice of including an item on the agenda a permanent feature at future shareholders\u2019 meetings. In the event of a significant change in the strategy, a consultative vote by shareholders on the Sustainability & Climate strategy would be initiated by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors reminds that it is entitled not to accept the inclusion of consultative shareholder resolutions on the agenda that would encroach on the Board's own competencies under French law, particularly in matters of governance or strategy, as confirmed by the President of the Nanterre Commercial Court in relation to the Corporation\u2019s 2024 Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. However, it invites shareholders who wish to do so to propose items for debate on the agenda of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting or to question the Board through written questions.\n\nThe Sustainability & Climate - 2025 Progress Report will be presented online on March, 27 2025, followed by a Q&A session. The event will be webcast live on totalenergies.com from 2:00 pm (Paris time). The Report and presentation material will be available on the website.\n\nOther resolutions\n\nThe Board of Directors will also submit to the Shareholder\u2019s Meeting for approval resolutions on the compensation of corporate officers as well as financial resolutions.\n\nAbout TotalEnergies\n\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity.

Factory to be comparable to some of the biggest in the world\n\nTotalEnergies Invests in Brazilian Renewable Energy for EU Refining\n\nVanessa Dezem, Francois De Beaupuy, and Peter Millard, Bloomberg News\n\nRIO\n\nEnergiesnet.com 03 24 2025\n\nTotalEnergies SE is considering importing green hydrogen from a multi-billion dollar project under development in northeastern Brazil to supply its European refineries.\n\nThe French energy company would be a key buyer from a plant planned by Brazilian renewables developer Casa dos Ventos, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. TotalEnergies, which has a 34% stake in the developer\u2019s wind and solar generation unit, also is considering taking a direct shareholding in the project, the people said.\n\nTotalEnergies and Casa dos Ventos have yet to make a final decision on the deal, according to the people. Both companies declined to comment.\n\nThe project, which would be developed in stages at the port of Pecem, eventually may reach a capacity of 1.2 gigawatts of electrolysis, which could produce 160,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. Production of green ammonia, which is easier to ship than hydrogen, could reach 900,000 tons a year, according to Casa dos Ventos.\n\nGreen hydrogen has been touted as a key fuel for a carbon-free future as it is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using renewable energy. However, few large-scale projects to make it have progressed to the construction phase due to costs and technological complexities.\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 contract would be a new step in the oil major\u2019s plan to reduce its carbon emissions by replacing the 500,000 tons of gray hydrogen \u2014 made out of fossil fuels \u2014 that is used in its refining processes in Europe with green hydrogen by 2030.\n\nThe switch to the clean, but far more expensive, gas is motivated by a planned European Union tax on fuel distributors who fail to meet greener standards, the company has said.\n\nSo far, the company has signed contracts for more than 130,000 tons of green hydrogen that will be made in Europe, and for 70,000 tons that is expected to be shipped from Saudi Arabia in the form of green ammonia. Saudi Arabia\u2019s flagship plant in Neom, one of the largest green hydrogen factories in the world, was estimated to cost $8.4 billion in 2023 and aims to start operating in 2026 with a view to export as much as 1.2 million tons of green ammonia per year.\n\nCasa dos Ventos plans to supply about 3 gigawatts of wind and solar to power electrolyzers that make green hydrogen, said the company. The development of renewable energy plants and the green hydrogen factory eventually may result in a total investment of about $5 billion, according to Casa dos Ventos.\n\nBrazil is seeking to encourage investment and kick-start a low-carbon hydrogen industry and recently passed an eagerly anticipated law that offers some tax exemptions for projects. South America\u2019s largest economy is capable of making the cheapest green hydrogen in the world excluding subsidies, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nThe port in Ceara state may become the first big export hub for green hydrogen in Brazil, with other energy companies such as Fortescue also mulling factories in the location.\n\n\u201cThe green hydrogen plant in Pecem will be Brazil\u2019s flagship project for hydrogen export,\u201d said Casa dos Ventos in a statement. A final investment decision for the factory is expected for next year, while operations should start in 2029, according to the company.\n\nbloomberg.com 03 20 2025",

TotalEnergies is present in the wider motorsport ecosystem, notably providing sustainable fuel for the FIA World Endurance Championship and FIA European Truck Racing Championship. The fuel provided to the former will presumably form the basis for the WRC product, given the broad range of powertrains (turbocharged and naturally aspirated) in which it is currently used.\n\nThe last remaining stocks of P1-supplied fuel were already in transit to the Safari Rally in Kenya, which took place last weekend, when the company entered administration. TotalEnergies will begin supplying sustainable fuel to the FIA priority drivers in Rally Islas Canarias before rolling out the distribution to all crews at subsequent events until the end of the season.\n\nThe tender for the single supply of sustainable fuel to the FIA World Rally Championship for 2026-2028 has recently closed and the FIA is assessing the submissions received. An announcement will be made regarding this in due course.\n\nFIA junior road sport director Emilia Abel commented, \u201cI would like to thank TotalEnergies and the FIA team for moving so quickly to make this agreement that guarantees the supply of sustainable fuel for the remainder of the season. TotalEnergies is a recognized supplier of sustainable fuels to the motorsport industry, and I am sure that we have found the right solution for now while we consider the longer-term options for the single fuel supplier to be selected for 2026 onward, following the tender process. It is never an easy situation when a supplier enters administration, but we have been able to react effectively to ensure there has been no negative impact on the competition.\u201d",

            "content": "TotalEnergies\u2019 massive liquified natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique is to receive a US$4.7-billion loan, a lifeline for the \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d fossil gas plant long-delayed by insurgent Islamist terrorists in the region, reports Climate Home News.\n\nThe backing of the US Export-Import Bank (EXIM), a federal agency, is seen as key to unlocking additional financing for the project, estimated at US$20 billion. EXIM previously agreed to fund the project in 2019, during US President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration, but two years later, a massive assault by local Islamist terrorist groups forced the French energy company to pull out of Mozambique.\n\nConstruction on the project in northern Cabo Delgado Province ceased after the Al-Shabaab attack, in which as many as 1,200 people were killed or went missing. TotalEnergies\u2019 actions triggered a contractual force majeure pause, requiring fresh approval for the financing to go through.\n\nThe company had hoped to start construction last year, as Mozambican and allied forces made significant progress in eradicating the terrorist group, but conceded in January this year that continued security concerns and funding issues would push the restart to 2029.\n\nTotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 lobbied hard late last year to secure funding from the outgoing Biden administration with no luck. With the new board, appointed by Trump, Pouyann\u00e9 told Bloomberg that \u201cnow you have a functional US EXIM.\u201d\n\nThe agency approved billions for oil and gas development overseas under Biden, despite the US joining 33 other countries at the COP26 climate summit to pledge an end to direct public finance for overseas fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022.\n\n[See more: Mozambique\u2019s ruby production nears 4 million carats in 2024]\n\nA last-minute attempt by Biden to back an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) proposal banning such support, an effort led by the European Union and UK, failed due to opposition from two member nations.\n\nThe export credit agencies of OECD countries provide around US$40 billion to support overseas fossil fuel projects every year, including in Mozambique. But few can rival the climate impacts of the TotalEnergies mega-project, producing up to 121 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually over a nearly 40-year lifecycle, according to calculations by Friends of the Earth, a UK-based environmental organisation.\n\nSupporting the Total project is \u201cthe pinnacle of government waste and an egregious abuse of taxpayer dollars,\u201d Kate DeAngelis, economic policy deputy director at Friends of the Earth US, told Climate Home. Collin Rees, US campaign manager at Oil Change International, agreed and condemned the project as a \u201cclimate and human rights disaster.\u201d\n\nFrench authorities began investigating TotalEnergies for possible involuntary manslaughter last year after survivors of the 2021 Al-Shabaab attack accused the company of failing to secure the safety of its subcontractors. Total rejected the accusations.\n\nA journalistic investigation by Politico meanwhile alleges that Mozambican soldiers operating out of the French company\u2019s plant abducted, raped and killed dozens of civilians. Total\u2019s Mozambican subsidiary told Politico it had no knowledge of the events.\n\nBeing linked to such alleged human rights violations appears to have been shrugged off by US EXIM, which announced the multi-billion-dollar investment amid staggering cuts to US international aid programmes \u2013 including projects geared toward stabilising the situation in Cabo Delgado \u2013 which the Trump administration deemed as not serving the country\u2019s national interest.",

            "content": "Spread the love\n\nUS Loan Could Improve Mozambique\u2019s LNG Prospects\u2014Fitch\n\nThe Export-Import Bank of the United States\u2019 (EXIM) reported approval of a USD4.7 billion loan for TotalEnergies\u2019 liquefied natural gas (LNG) venture in Mozambique, if confirmed, will improve prospects for the resumption of the huge project, which could have multiple positive benefits for Mozambique over the medium term, says Fitch Ratings.\n\nHowever, analyst believe insecurity will continue to pose significant risks to completion of the development. Mozambique\u2019s Energy Minister, Estev\u00e3o Pale, has said that EXIM\u2019s board voted to approve the project, according to media reports, though the bank has yet to confirm this.\n\n\u201cIf true, this would confirm the view we expressed when we downgraded Mozambique\u2019s rating to \u2018CCC\u2019, from \u2018CCC+\u2019, in February 2025, that prospects for EXIM financing could improve under the new US administration.\n\n\u201cOther export credit agencies that have committed funds to the project were reported in late 2024 to be reviewing their financial pledges, in light of political developments in Mozambique\u201d.\n\nFitch Ratings baseline assumption remains that work on the TotalEnergies LNG project will resume in 2025, once the force majeure that has been in place since 2021 is lifted.\n\nTotalEnergies said in January, following the political unrest in Mozambique in late 2024, that the project would not be operational by 2029, but Fitch analysts believe a swift resumption of the project could allow some production and exports to begin around 2030.\n\nSuccessful development of the project would boost economic growth and provide important support to Mozambique\u2019s export earnings and fiscal revenues. The first principal repayments of around USD250 million a year on Mozambique\u2019s USD900 million Eurobond are due from 2028, ahead of its maturity in 2031, a period that may overlap with the start of production.\n\nThe resumption of construction on TotalEnergies\u2019 LNG project could facilitate a final investment decision on a proposed USD30 billion LNG project by ExxonMobil. This project would be partly onshore and would contribute to economic growth during its construction stage. The production capacity of this project could be the largest so far in Mozambique, with a total capacity of 18 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), compared with 12.9 mtpa for the TotalEnergies project. Production is expected to start after 2030.\n\nEni has ordered a second floating facility (Coral North) for Area 4, likely to have the same capacity of 3.7mtpa as Coral South \u2013 the only LNG project in Mozambique currently at the production stage. Coral North will be offshore, and Fitch expect its contribution to economic growth to begin only at the production stage, targeted for 2027-2028. Progress on Coral North is not related to TotalEnergies\u2019 project.\n\nSecurity threats and political instability could still pose risks to the resumption of the TotalEnergies LNG project. Notably, Fitch said assumption that a Rwandan force, in place since 2021, will continue to support security in the area around the development is subject to uncertainty.\n\nEU funding for the force\u2019s presence could be affected by political controversies. For example, the EU imposed restrictions on some members of the Rwanda Defence Force in March 2025 over alleged involvement in armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nFurther domestic political and social unrest in Mozambique could also retard progress on the project. Development of the LNG sector will be important to Mozambique\u2019s medium-term credit profile.\n\nHowever, Fitch analysts believe more important drivers of the sovereign rating in the near term will be the government\u2019s access to external financing, its efforts to consolidate the public finances, and the prospects for an easing of domestic political and social tensions that support a normalisation of economic activity. #US Loan Could Improve Mozambique\u2019s LNG Prospects\u2014Fitch NASCON Rises as Investors Take Position After Dividend Notice",

Despite not winning the title, they showcased their attacking strength, most notably in a resounding 5-1 victory over Egypt, the eventual tournament winners.\n\nThroughout the competition, Ziyad Baha emerged as a key figure, netting three goals, while Ismail El Aoud contributed two goals, playing a crucial role in Morocco\u2019s strong finish.\n\nHistory in the U-17 AFCON\n\nMorocco has been steadily building its reputation in African youth football, though they have had limited appearances in the U-17 AFCON.\n\nTheir best-ever finish came in 2023, when they reached the final in Algeria but fell just short against Senegal in a narrow defeat. That campaign earned them a spot at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Indonesia, where they made history by reaching the quarter-finals before being eliminated by Mali.\n\nNotably, former Fiorentina and Manchester United midfielder Sofyan Amrabat was once a standout player for Morocco at the U-17 level.\n\nKey Players to Watch\n\nIbrahim Rabbaj \u2013 One of Chelsea\u2019s most promising young attackers, Rabbaj has been involved in nearly three goals or assists per game, making him a major threat in Morocco\u2019s attacking setup.\n\nZiyad Baha \u2013 A clinical forward with a natural instinct for goal, Baha finished as Morocco\u2019s top scorer in the UNAF U-17 Championship with three goals.\n\nIsmail El Aoud \u2013 The Valencia midfielder is a key playmaker, renowned for his technical ability, composure on the ball, and ability to dictate the tempo of the game.\n\nHamza Bouhadi \u2013 The team captain, Bouhadi is a highly-rated\n\nright-back, known for his defensive solidity and leadership qualities.\n\nCoach & Tactical Approach\n\nMorocco is managed by Nabil Baha, a former international who has instilled a possession-based philosophy combined with a well-structured defensive approach.\n\nBaha, who led Morocco to a second-place finish at the UNAF U-17 Championship, took over from Said Chiba after the U-17 World Cup in Indonesia.\n\nHis task now is to guide Morocco to their first-ever TotalEnergies CAF U-17 AFCON title and secure back-to-back World Cup qualifications.\n\nTournament Expectations & Group Analysis\n\nMorocco will enter the tournament with high expectations, bolstered by their recent triumph at the Antalya Youth Cup in T\u00fcrkiye, where they gained valuable experience against international opposition.\n\nDrawn in Group A, they will face Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia\u2014two East African sides with similar fast-paced playing styles and a Zambian team known for its physicality.\n\nWith home advantage and a technically gifted squad, Morocco will be targeting a strong group stage performance to set the stage for a deep tournament run.",

His ability to find the net will be crucial for Uganda.\n\nRichard Okello (Defender & Captain) \u2013 A commanding presence in the backline, Okello is a natural leader who provides defensive stability and motivation to his teammates.\n\nMagala Isima Mulala (Midfielder) \u2013 Named MVP of the 2024 Uganda Secondary Schools Championship , Mulala is a dynamic midfielder who contributed two goals during the CECAFA tournament.\n\nAbubakali Walusimbi (Midfielder) \u2013 The best player of the CECAFA U-17 tournament, Walusimbi possesses excellent technical ability and vision , making him a key creative force in Uganda\u2019s midfield.\n\nCoach & Tactical Approach\n\nHead coach Brian Ssenyondo has shaped a squad that plays with cohesion, discipline, and attacking intent. His tactical philosophy emphasizes:\n\nStructured attacking play , with a focus on breaking down defenses through quick movement.\n\nFast transitions , ensuring the team can counterattack effectively.\n\nDefensive organization , allowing the Cubs to remain compact and difficult to break down.\n\nUnder Ssenyondo\u2019s leadership, Uganda has developed a strong team identity, which could be a key factor in their success at the tournament.\n\nTournament Expectations & Group Analysis\n\nUganda is determined to make history by qualifying for the FIFA U-17 World Cup for the first time. However, they face a tough challenge in Group A, where they will compete against:\n\nMorocco (Hosts) \u2013 A technically gifted side with home support, making them one of the tournament favorites.\n\nTanzania (CECAFA Rivals) \u2013 A familiar opponent that will provide a highly competitive East African clash.\n\nZambia \u2013 A physically strong and fast-paced team that will test Uganda\u2019s defensive discipline.\n\nUganda\u2019s success will depend on how well they handle pressure and execute their tactical game plan. If they can build on their strong attacking form and defensive organization, they could emerge as one of the surprise packages of the tournament.",

On both occasions, they failed to progress beyond the group stage, highlighting the challenge they face at this level.\n\nDespite their struggles on the continental stage, Zambia remains the most successful team in COSAFA U-17 history, having won the regional championship four times.\n\nTheir ability to produce top-tier talent is evident, with former Leicester City forward Patson Daka being a notable graduate of their U-17 setup.\n\nKey Players to Watch\n\nAbel Nyirongo (Forward) \u2013 A natural goal scorer, Nyirongo was the top marksman in the COSAFA U-17 Championship, scoring seven goals, including a hat-trick against Zimbabwe. His sharp finishing and ability to exploit spaces make him Zambia\u2019s most lethal attacking weapon.\n\nMapalo Simute (Midfielder) \u2013 A versatile playmaker, Simute was named the MVP of the COSAFA tournament.

His ability to control the tempo of the game will be vital as Zambia navigates tough group-stage battles.\n\nCoach & Tactical Approach\n\nThe Young Chipolopolo are led by Ian Bakala, who also managed the team in the 2023 U-17 AFCON, where they fell short in the group stage.\n\nBakala\u2019s philosophy is built on free-flowing attacking football, quick transitions while defensive compactness prevents exposure at the back.\n\nZambia\u2019s ability to dominate possession and execute rapid counterattacks will be key to their success in this tournament.\n\nTournament Expectations & Group Analysis\n\nZambia has been drawn into a competitive yet winnable Group A, where they will face:\n\nMorocco (Hosts) \u2013 A technically gifted side playing on home soil, making them the toughest challenge in the group.\n\nUganda \u2013 A fast-improving East African team known for their structured play and strong team spirit.\n\nTanzania \u2013 A familiar COSAFA rival, bringing a similar playing style and competitive intensity.\n\nWith a squad rich in attacking depth and experience in high-pressure matches, Zambia\u2019s primary goal will be to advance beyond the group stage for the first time.\n\nIf they can harness their goal-scoring prowess while maintaining defensive discipline, the Young Chipolopolo have the potential to make a deep run and challenge for World Cup qualification.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) stands against other best energy stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher.\n\nKen Fisher, an American billionaire investor, author, and financial analyst, founded and manages Fisher Asset Management. He is one of the world\u2019s most renowned investment managers, known for his contrarian style and strong confidence in capitalism. With an estimated net worth of more than $11.2 billion, he is also one of the wealthiest billionaires in the world. Fisher launched his fund in 1979, which has since developed into a global investment powerhouse that manages over $252 billion in securities. That said, Fisher\u2019s influence extends beyond asset management to include financial journalism and publishing. He penned a Forbes magazine column for more than three decades, the longest in the magazine\u2019s history, and authored eleven books, four of which were New York Times bestsellers.\n\nNotably, Fisher pioneered the use of the Price-to-Sales Ratio in the early 1980s, demonstrating its use as a tool for financial investment research. His hedge fund uses this technique to manage small-capitalization portfolios for institutional investors across the globe. Fisher Asset Management\u2019s concept is founded on Ken Fisher\u2019s understanding of the operation of free markets. The billionaire investor believes that supply and demand are the only factors influencing securities prices and that capital markets are generally effective discounters of well-known information.\n\nEnergy Sector Outlook\n\nEnergy companies were off to a solid start this year, outperforming the S&P 500 for the first time in years, driven by gains in natural gas equities as prices recover from record lows. The sector\u2019s advances indicate a notable turnaround for the industry. Energy stocks fell 1.3% in 2023 and only gained 5.7% last year, while the S&P 500\u2019s bull run continued, rising over 50% over the past two years. According to most analysts, the sector\u2019s excellent year has been fueled by a comeback in oil and gas prices with the beginning of the cold weather in the United States, resulting in significant gains for natural gas equities.\n\nAs the energy sector evolves, investors must balance the stability of traditional fossil fuels with the growing potential of renewables and modern nuclear technologies. In such a market dynamic, oil and gas firms have placed importance on high-return investments and increased production efficiency, which has led to noteworthy financial performance and investor confidence. According to Deloitte, industry capital expenditures have risen 53% in the last four years, while net profit has increased by approximately 16%. Despite ongoing uncertainties over OPEC+ production cutbacks and potential interruptions to energy commerce, the industry\u2019s financial discipline, customer-focused initiatives, and technical advances position it for a successful 2025.",

[File photo: CDD]\n\nTransaction expected to support more than 16,000 American jobs and nearly 70 U.S. suppliers across country; Board also votes to increase \u2018Make More in America\u2019 initiative efficiency\n\nMarch 19, 2025\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 The newly constituted Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) on Thursday, March 13, unanimously approved the second amendment of a 2019 direct loan of up to $4.7 billion to support the export of U.S. goods and services for the development and construction of an integrated liquefied natural gas (LNG) project. The financing for the project located on the Afungi Peninsula in northern Mozambique will support the engineering, procurement, and construction of the onshore LNG plant, related facilities, and offshore activities.\n\nThe transaction, which had been on a four-year pause, will support an estimated 16,400 good-paying American jobs which support workers and families at more than 68 companies across 14 states including Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Illinois, South Carolina, New Jersey, California, Nevada, Colorado and the District of Columbia. Follow-on states are expected to support thousands of additional jobs across the United States.\n\n\u201cI am pleased that in authorizing this amendment the Bank finally fulfills the commitment EXIM made nearly six years ago to this Mozambique LNG project, which is important to thousands of U.S. employees working for U.S. manufacturing and services companies,\u201d said Acting President and Chairman Jim Cruse. \u201cMy hope is that moving this project forward will convey how serious EXIM is in its efforts to increase U.S. export competitiveness and that American workers should never be at a disadvantage against foreign competitors.\u201d\n\nActing Vice Chairman Jim Burrows added, \u201cThis 2019 transaction, which is the largest deal in EXIM\u2019s now 91-year history, finally can move forward so that thousands of American workers can export their \u201cMade in the USA\u201d equipment and services, something that instead would have gone to Chinese and Russian manufacturers but for President Trump\u2019s leadership in reauthorizing EXIM. Our great U.S. companies large and small\u2014including those that will benefit from this $4.7 billion EXIM loan, which will be repaid and generate $600 million in interest and fees for the U.S. Treasury\u2014need a level playing field to compete in a world in which there are at least 115 competing foreign export credit agencies, many of which are proactively furthering the national interest objectives of their governments.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, President Donald Trump reauthorized EXIM after four years of near closure in order to give American workers a level playing field, expand foreign markets for American-made goods, help create more great-paying jobs, provide equal footing for U.S. businesses by increasing their competitiveness globally, and ensure the world sees more products stamped with \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d\n\nNow, as part of the second Trump Administration, EXIM proudly supports President Trump\u2019s promises of creating employment opportunities for American workers, putting American workers first in trade, and undoing the harm to the American economy caused by the Biden Administration\u2019s coercive climate policies.\n\nLast year, numerous executives of U.S. companies, including manufacturers and service providers who plan to utilize U.S. subcontractors and the domestic supply chain of goods and services for the Mozambique project, contacted EXIM and the U.S. Congress urging the Board\u2019s consideration and approval of the amendment for the globally strategic project. The executives who wrote to former EXIM Chairman Reta Jo Lewis on behalf of their employees and subcontractors so that thousands of U.S. jobs in support of the project could be assured included:\n\nMr. Lorenzo Simonelli, Chairman & CEO, Baker Hughes, Houston, TX\n\nMr. Peter de Laat, CEO, Brunel Energy Inc., Houston, TX\n\nMr. Mark D. Butts, CEO, CB&I, Houston, TX\n\nMr. Shane Reph, COO, Ebara Elliott Energy, Jeannette, PA\n\nMr. Lee Jordan, CEO, Gate Energy, Houston, TX\n\nMs. Kathryn Renee Eberwein, CEO, Global Edge Group, LLC, and its affiliate companies, The Woodlands, TX\n\nMr. Ken West, President and CEO, Energy & Sustainability Solutions, Honeywell, Charlotte, NC\n\nMr. James J. Kirchdorfer, Jr., CEO, ISCO industries, Inc., Louisville, KY\n\nCaptain William G. Schubert, President & CEO, International Trade & Transportation, Inc., Pineville, TX\n\nMr. Jonathan Motherwell, President, Jonathan T. Motherwell and Associates, LLC, The Woodlands, TX\n\nMr. Michael McKelvy, President and CEO, McDermott, Houston, TX\n\nMr. Paul Jacob, General Manager, Ocean Flow International, LLC, Houston, TX\n\nMr. Felipe Gonzalez, President, PERC Engineering, LLC, Houston, TX\n\nMs. Mary Zappone, CEO, Sundyne, LLC, Arvada, CO\n\nMr. Douglas Pferdehirt, CEO, TechnipFMC, Houston, TX\n\nMr. Quintin Kneen, President & CEO, Tidewater Inc., Houston, TX\n\nMr. Donnie Smith, CEO, W-Industries, Spring, TX\n\nMr. Darton Zink, President & CEO, Zeeco, Inc., Tulsa, OK\n\nThese executives emphasized the critical role EXIM financing played in the successful completion of the project while noting the effects the continued delay of the project\u2019s start could have on U.S. companies looking to do business in the region, stating that \u201cwithout EXIM\u2019s approval of the amendment allowing the restart of construction, we consider that the project as currently defined will be jeopardized. Any potential new project would require new contractual arrangements and potentially new project participants with different geopolitical interests, an outcome that would be disadvantageous to all U.S. corporations that may compete for project contracts.\u201d The letter continued on to note that \u201cEXIM is considered a bellwether export credit agency, and your approval of the amendment is essential so that construction may be resumed as early as possible in 2025.\u201d\n\nThis second amendment, which contains no material change from the original approval and thus is not subject to additional U.S. Congressional notification, extends certain dates and makes related changes in connection with the restart of project construction operations following a security related force majeure declaration by the project operator in April 2021. Consistent with President Trump\u2019s goal of ushering in an American manufacturing renaissance, the EXIM team thoroughly reviewed the physical security situation of the project. Upon conclusion of the review, EXIM determined that the security risks to the project had been properly addressed, with substantial systems in place and appropriate management plans and mitigation applied to respond appropriately to evolving security concerns.\n\n\u201cAt a time when EXIM\u2019s finance export support is vital to the U.S. supply chain,\u201d said Director Spencer Bachus III, \u201cthe vote taken to authorize this amendment to the Mozambique LNG project reinforces the fact U.S. manufacturers require a diversified portfolio of U.S. and international export projects to remain competitive and viable.\u201d\n\nBoth during the initial consideration of the 2019 transaction and today, EXIM upheld and will continue to uphold its statutory requirements as set by Congress, including the prohibition on discrimination based on industry, sector, or business. This project, which supports the export of U.S. equipment and services, will not compete in any harmful way with the production of U.S. LNG. EXIM is required by statute to conduct an economic impact analysis for each of its transactions and concluded with independent experts that the transaction would likely have a net positive impact on the U.S. economy, based on supply/demand analysis over the life of the loan.\n\nBefore the 2019 Board approval, the transaction also underwent a lengthy and transparent internal, interagency, and external due diligence and risk review process. Private financing was not available for the project given its size and complexity. Additionally, EXIM was told that the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Russia originally were slated to finance the deal, a factor important to the United States\u2019 national security interests allowing the transaction to be included as part of EXIM\u2019s China and Transformational Exports Program (CTEP), which was also established in EXIM\u2019s historic 2019 reauthorization. The proposed transaction was sent to the U.S. Congress on August 22, 2019, for a 35-day notification period, open for public comment between August 23 and September 17, 2019, unanimously approved by the first Trump Administration\u2019s EXIM Board of Directors on September 26, 2019, and then unanimously amended on May 14, 2020.\n\nAs is underscored in its charter, EXIM also was\u2014and will continue to be\u2014focused on raising awareness, conducting outreach, and enhancing the tailoring of products to help U.S. companies large and small that are interested in exporting, including with the U.S. LNG export industry. For example and as published in the Federal Register, on September 16, 2019, LNG Allies President and CEO Fred Hutchinson wrote to EXIM about ideas discussed in EXIM\u2019s outreach meetings, including one that took place in August 2019 with LNG Allies, the Center for LNG, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Global Energy Institute, and the American Petroleum Institute. Hutchinson noted, \u201c[t]he ideas discussed during the August 21 meeting and in other meetings with EXIM staff, such as risk guarantees for lower credit-quality buyers of U.S. LNG, EXIM participation in foreign LNG import facilities (using LNG from the United States), and EXIM participation in the financing of U.S. export facilities could be particularly valuable in assisting the next wave of U.S. LNG export projects reach final investment decisions, creating thousands of jobs, and adding billions of dollars to the U.S. economy. In light of EXIMs commitment to working with U.S. LNG project developers to increase U.S. energy exports LNG Allies no longer objects to the Bank supporting the exports of U.S. goods and services to Mozambique as described in the August 23 Federal Register notice.\u201d\n\nAdditional amendment approval improves \u201cMake More in America\u201d program efficiency\n\nDuring the meeting, the Board also unanimously approved a separate amendment to its Make More in America (MMIA) initiative so that transactions with an upper limit of $25 million, after undergoing fulsome due diligence and risk analysis to protect the American taxpayer, can be approved by specific senior EXIM officers. This action reduces government bureaucracy and red tape, which will improve EXIM\u2019s efficiency and customer service when considering MMIA applications. Through EXIM\u2019s existing medium- and long-term loans, loan guarantees, and insurance for export-oriented domestic manufacturing projects, MMIA helps companies make more in America, including sectors critical to national security, and strengthens the resiliency and security of America\u2019s supply chains.\n\nEXIM, as a special tool in the U.S. trade toolbox, stands ready to empower U.S. businesses and workers to compete globally. As of January 20, 2025, EXIM had obligated $34 billion of its $135 billion in financing authority as set by the U.S. Congress. This leaves approximately $101 billion available to support future transactions, and EXIM, per its Congressional charter, welcomes all applications that support American jobs and U.S. exports for consideration.\n\nAbout EXIM:\n\nThe Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) is the nation\u2019s official export credit agency with the mission of supporting American jobs by facilitating U.S. exports. To advance American competitiveness and assist U.S. businesses as they compete for global sales, EXIM offers financing including export credit insurance, working capital guarantees, loan guarantees, and direct loans. As an independent federal agency, EXIM contributes to U.S. economic growth by supporting tens of thousands of jobs in exporting businesses and their supply chains across the United States.

The initiative will support over 600 families from 3 de Fevereiro, Capacira e Muaria.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the General Manager of TotalEnergies, Maxime Rabilloud, stated: \u201cwe are here to express our solidarity with the families affected by Cyclone Chido on behalf of all Mozambique LNG Project partners and in reaction to the Government\u2019s call to support the affected communities.\u201d\n\nThe support includes food supplies for 627 families \u2013 500 from the 3 de Fevereiro and 127 from the Capacira villages. Additionally, agricultural inputs will be distributed to 200 families in Muaria village, while construction materials will be provided to an equal number of families in critical need in the 3 de Fevereiro village.\n\nOn his turn, the Governor of Cabo Delgado, Valige Tauabo, recognized TotalEnergies efforts for its ongoing commitment to disaster relief and humanitarian assistance.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that this support alone will not solve all the challenges caused by Cyclone Chido. That is why we continue to mobilize additional resources. In the meantime, we encourage the population to rebuild their homes and strengthen agricultural production to ensure food security and income generation\u201d- said the Governor.\n\nWith more than 100,000 people affected, humanitarian efforts are now focused on distributing essential goods in the hardest-hit districts of Pemba and Mecufi, ensuring immediate relief and supporting long-term recovery.\n\nThe Mozambique LNG Project\u2019s support reflects its commitment to sustainable development and improvement of the quality of life in the region.\n\nSource: Mozambique LNG Project / Media Release",

            "content": "If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the TotalEnergies SE ( ) share price is 78% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 6.4% in the last year.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, TotalEnergies achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 12% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nThis free interactive report on TotalEnergies' is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for TotalEnergies the TSR over the last 5 years was 146%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in TotalEnergies had a tough year, with a total loss of 2.6% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 1.4%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 20% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

            "content": "TotalEnergies, which has a 34 percent stake in the developer's wind and solar generation unit, also is considering taking a direct shareholding in the project.\n\nTotalEnergies SE is considering importing green hydrogen from a multi-billion dollar project under development in northeastern Brazil to supply its European refineries.\n\nThe French energy company would be a key buyer from a plant planned by Brazilian renewables developer Casa dos Ventos, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. TotalEnergies, which has a 34 percent stake in the developer\u2019s wind and solar generation unit, also is considering taking a direct shareholding in the project, the people said.\n\nTotalEnergies and Casa dos Ventos have yet to make a final decision on the deal, according to the people. Both companies declined to comment.\n\nThe project, which would be developed in stages at the port of Pecem, eventually may reach a capacity of 1.2 gigawatts of electrolysis, which could produce 160,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. Production of green ammonia, which is easier to ship than hydrogen, could reach 900,000 tons a year, according to Casa dos Ventos.\n\nGreen hydrogen has been touted as a key fuel for a carbon-free future as it is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using renewable energy. However, few large-scale projects to make it have progressed to the construction phase due to costs and technological complexities.\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 contract would be a new step in the oil major\u2019s plan to reduce its carbon emissions by replacing the 500,000 tons of gray hydrogen - made out of fossil fuels - that is used in its refining processes in Europe with green hydrogen by 2030.\n\nThe switch to the clean, but far more expensive, gas is motivated by a planned European Union tax on fuel distributors who fail to meet greener standards, the company has said.\n\nSo far, the company has signed contracts for more than 130,000 tons of green hydrogen that will be made in Europe, and for 70,000 tons that is expected to be shipped from Saudi Arabia in the form of green ammonia. Saudi Arabia\u2019s flagship plant in Neom, one of the largest green hydrogen factories in the world, was estimated to cost $8.4 billion in 2023 and aims to start operating in 2026 with a view to export as much as 1.2 million tons of green ammonia per year.\n\nCasa dos Ventos plans to supply about 3 gigawatts of wind and solar to power electrolyzers that make green hydrogen, said the company. The development of renewable energy plants and the green hydrogen factory eventually may result in a total investment of about $5 billion, according to Casa dos Ventos.\n\nBrazil is seeking to encourage investment and kick-start a low-carbon hydrogen industry and recently passed an eagerly anticipated law that offers some tax exemptions for projects. South America\u2019s largest economy is capable of making the cheapest green hydrogen in the world excluding subsidies, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nThe port in Ceara state may become the first big export hub for green hydrogen in Brazil, with other energy companies such as Fortescue also mulling factories in the location.\n\n\u201cThe green hydrogen plant in Pecem will be Brazil\u2019s flagship project for hydrogen export,\u201d said Casa dos Ventos in a statement. A final investment decision for the factory is expected for next year, while operations should start in 2029, according to the company.",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Shell plc SHEL, Uber Technologies, Inc. UBER, TotalEnergies SE TTE, Geospace Technologies Corp. GEOS and Natural Health Trends Corp. NHTC.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Shell, Uber and TotalEnergies\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Shell plc, Uber Technologies, Inc. and TotalEnergies SE, as well as two micro-cap stocks Geospace Technologies Corp. and Natural Health Trends Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\n\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> A Brief History of Fed Funds Moves in the 21st Century\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\nShell\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+11.3% vs. +6%). The company remains a global leader in liquefied natural gas. Shell leverages its strong LNG position, bolstered by the acquisition of BG Group, to generate consistent earnings by capitalizing on steady demand for this transitional fuel.\n\n\n\nShell\u2019s strategic joint venture in the UK North Sea with Equinor enhances its dominance in the region while aligning with high-value objectives. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s strong free cash flow generation and sustained buybacks reinforce shareholder value.\n\n\n\nHowever, the underperformance of its Renewable segment is a matter of concern. Another concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Sensitivity to oil prices and the rise of EVS are other negative factors. Therefore, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Shell here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Uber have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past six months (-3.2% vs. -1.2%). The company\u2019s underperformance may be due to fears of market saturation and the possibility of self-driving cars eliminating intermediary services. Uber, which dominates the North American ride-sharing market, is likely to increase its focus on suburban markets to drive growth.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst remains confident about its ability to combat the challenges with the help of a strong operating model and successful diversification strategy. Even though Uber\u2019s primary business is ride-sharing, it has diversified into food delivery and freight over time. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Uber here >>>)\n\n\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 shares have declined -5.7% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry\u2019s decline of -14.2%. The company\u2019s production might be impacted by security reasons in some regions and it remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. The natural field decline will impact production volumes and lower profits.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, TotalEnergies benefits from contributions coming from startups, acquisitions, well-spread LNG assets and upstream assets located in the new hydrocarbon-producing regions. Multi-energy assets spread across the globe and cost reduction initiatives are benefiting the company.\n\n\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 free cash flow allows it to increase shareholders value. It is investing in clean power generation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Geospace Technologies have underperformed the Zacks Electronics - Measuring Instruments industry over the past year (-42.5% vs. -2.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $94.04 million is facing risks which include rising costs, cash flow deterioration and customer concentration.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Geospace maintains a strong balance sheet with no debt and $22.1 million in cash and investments, plus a $12.1 million undrawn credit facility. Despite a 25.6% year-over-year revenue decline to $37.2 million in first-quarter fiscal 2025, it posted an $8.4 million net income, aided by a 54.1% gross margin. The Smart Water segment grew 72.1% to $7.3 million, showing promise in municipal and multifamily markets.\n\n\n\nEnergy Solutions revenues fell 39.2% to $24.3 million, but a $17 million OBX sale and a pending Permanent Reservoir Monitoring (PRM) contract offer potential upside. Intelligent Industrial revenues fell 4.1% to $5.6 million. Rising research and development (R&D) investment (up 35.9% year over year) targets growth in seismic, security and smart water solutions.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Geospace Technologies here >>>)\n\n\n\nNatural Health Trends\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (-10.8% vs. +11.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $58.37 million is witnessing higher freight and incentive costs pressured margins. Active members declined 4.8% to 30,870, raising concerns about engagement.\n\n\n\nExpansion into Latin America and new product launches aim to drive growth, but reliance on China, rising costs and regulatory risks remain key challenges. Expansion efforts beyond Asia remain limited. Nevertheless, Natural Health Trends saw a 9% sequential and 7% year-over-year sales increase in Hong Kong, which accounts for 82% of revenues.\n\n\n\nDespite this, full-year sales declined 2.2% to $42.9 million due to weakness in Taiwan and North America. The company improved its operating cash flow to $602,000 (before tax payments) but still reported a $3.4 million cash outflow. Cash reserves declined to $43.9 million in 2024 from $56.2 million in 2023. Operating losses narrowed to $1.3 million in 2024 from $1.7 million in 2023.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Health Trends here >>>)",

            "content": "TotalEnergies has said that the $15 billion in financing to restart the natural gas exploration megaproject in Cabo Delgado, northern Mozambique, is almost closed, following the go-ahead from US bank Exim\n\n\u201cWe are still in a situation of force majeure, the project has not restarted yet, but one of the critical steps was the decision of the Exim Bank, which reconfirmed, reaffirmed, its support for the overall financing of the project. This is a very important financing, it is a critical step,\u201d said the director of TotalEnergies for Mozambique, Maxime Rabilloud.\n\nRabilloud was reacting to the reconfirmation, on March 13, by the administration of the Export-Import Bank of the United States of America (Exim Bank) of US$4.7 billion in financing for the project.\n\nTotalEnergies, the leader of the Area 1 consortium, is currently developing the construction of a plant in Afungi, near Palma in Cabo Delgado province, for the production and export of natural gas.\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project, one of three under development in Mozambique, has been suspended since 2021 due to the terrorist attacks in Cabo Delgado, which led the oil company to invoke \u2018force majeure\u2019 and withdraw all personnel from the construction site.\n\nThis forced the consortium of financing banks to reconfirm the previously approved financing, with the resumption of the project also conditional on the reestablishment of security, which is supported in that area by the Rwandan armed forces.\n\nMaxime Rabilloud recalled that the overall financing for the project, with several international banks and credit agencies, is US$15 billion. In addition to the US Exim Bank, the Asian banks in the financing consortium had also reconfirmed financing of around US$5 billion (\u20ac4.5 billion), with only the reconfirmation of financing from European banks pending.\n\nTotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne said on 5 February that he was expecting approval of Exim Bank financing for its natural gas project in Mozambique, admitting a further delay to 2029-2030 for the start of LNG production, stating that \u201ca few more months\u201d had been lost recently.\n\nThe TotalEnergies executive had said, in a previous meeting with investors, that meeting the previous objective implied \u201crestarting the project in 2024\u201d, which did not happen.\n\nAt the end of January, Mozambican president Daniel Chapo said that he had received from Patrick Pouyanne a guarantee of TotalEnergies\u2019 \u201ccommitment\u201d to restarting the project in Cabo Delgado.\n\nPouyanne acknowledged that \u201cthere are undeniable improvements in security, but it is not perfect\u201d, referring to the situation in Cabo Delgado, for more than seven years the scene of attacks by terrorist groups associated with the Islamic State.\n\nThis gas exploitation project was halted in 2021 after a \u2018jihadist\u2019 attack in which dozens of civilians were killed.\n\nTotalEnergies has a 26.5% stake in the project \u2013 which is mainly intended to supply customers in Asia \u2013 along with Mozambican partners and the Japanese company Mitsui (20%).\n\nMozambique has three development projects approved to exploit the natural gas reserves of the Rovuma basin off the coast of Cabo Delgado, classified as among the largest in the world.\n\nSource: Lusa",

(TPC).\n\nFEC is TotalEnergies\u2019 joint venture partner in local companies engaged in the supply, distribution, and marketing of petroleum products.\n\nBEC holds a 60% stake in FEC, giving it an indirect interest in FEC\u2019s joint ventures with Total Marketing Services, the Philippine subsidiary of TotalEnergies. These joint ventures include TPC, Filoil Logistics Corp., and La Defense Filipinas Holdings, Inc.\n\nTotalEnergies will continue overseeing operations as the franchisor of the brand and business.\n\nThe integrated energy company operates across multiple sectors, including oil and gas, natural gas and green gases, renewables, and electricity.\n\nUnder Republic Act No. 8479, or the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998, no permit or clearance from the Department of Energy (DoE) is required for the transition, according to Rino E. Abad, director of the DoE\u2019s Oil Industry Management Bureau.\n\nThe DoE is being updated on company developments through annual company profile reports.\n\nWhile BEC clarified that it is not involved in the transaction between TotalEnergies and FEC, it said the shift to a franchise model \u201chas no material effect or impact on its business and operations.\u201d\n\nBATAAN SOLAR PROJECT\n\nIn a separate disclosure, BEC said it has secured approval from the DoE to proceed with the pre-development phase of its proposed solar power project in Mariveles, Bataan.\n\nThe DoE has granted a solar energy operating contract allowing BEC to begin procurement activities ahead of the 25-year contract term.\n\nThe solar facility will cover approximately 72 hectares and is expected to generate a peak output of at least 62 megawatts (MW), based on a preliminary assessment by an independent third-party firm.\n\nFollowing the permit approval, BEC said it will now proceed with securing approvals from relevant national agencies and local government units. It will also conduct a system impact study with the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to advance the development of the Mariveles Solar Power Project and remain committed to providing updates as the project progresses,\u201d the company said.\n\nOscar L. de Venecia, Jr., vice-chairman and chief executive officer of BEC, earlier told BusinessWorld that the company is applying for two solar power projects in Negros and Bataan with a combined capacity of 90 MW.\n\nBEC aims to develop 500 MW of solar and 500 MW of wind energy projects by 2030.\n\n\u201cOnce realized and operational, these initiatives are expected to contribute meaningfully to [BEC\u2019s] growth and reinforce its position as a key player in the energy sector,\u201d it said. \u2014 Sheldeen Joy Talavera",

The legal action launched by the Nanterre prosecutor\u2019s office was prompted by complaints from survivors and relatives of victims, who allege that TotalEnergies did not take sufficient measures to protect workers in the lead-up to the attack. Despite evacuating over 2,500 people during the crisis, the company is accused of not providing necessary support to subcontractors and of halting its project without adequate security precautions. TotalEnergies has denied the accusations, asserting that it did everything possible to ensure the safety of its employees.\n\nThe case has raised significant concerns over the balance between corporate interests and human rights, with victims seeking justice for the lives lost in the deadly attack. As the investigation in France unfolds, TotalEnergies is also pushing to restart its LNG project, having secured a $4.7 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank to aid the endeavor. Production is now expected to resume by 2029 or 2030, with a total investment of $20 billion. The project\u2019s resumption has sparked fierce debates, with human rights groups condemning it as a \u201cclimate bomb\u201d and calling on other European and Asian banks to refuse its financing while the African Energy Chamber has hailed it as a \u201ckey project\u201d for the economic development of the continent.",

            "content": "The United States has just approved a $4.7 billion loan aimed at financing the Mozambique LNG project, led by the French company TotalEnergies. This large-scale gas project, located in Cabo Delgado province, had been suspended in 2021 following a jihadist attack that prompted TotalEnergies to declare force majeure. Initially approved in 2020 under the Trump administration, the loan recently required amendments to account for accumulated delays and a new completion date set for 2030. TotalEnergies holds a 26.5% stake in this estimated $20 billion project, primarily targeting the Asian market.\n\nRestart conditional on financial approvals\n\nFunding provided by the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM Bank) is part of a series of approvals awaited by TotalEnergies to restart operations. According to Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, CEO of the French company, this American loan is part of a broader process that also involves British and Dutch export credit agencies. These financial approvals represent an essential condition for relaunching the project, with liquefied natural gas production now scheduled to begin between 2029 and 2030, instead of the initial 2028 timeline.\n\nIn September 2024, U.S. media reported allegations of abuses allegedly committed by security forces tasked with protecting the site after the events of 2021. At the time, TotalEnergies Mozambique LNG stated that it had not identified credible evidence to corroborate these allegations.\n\nMixed reactions to the loan approval\n\nThe African Energy Chamber (AEC) reacted positively to the U.S. approval of the loan. In a recent statement, the AEC emphasized that this decision represents a significant boost for one of Africa\u2019s largest current energy investments, capable of reshaping Mozambique\u2019s energy landscape as well as other regions across the continent.\n\nHowever, several non-governmental organizations, including Reclaim Finance and Friends of the Earth (Les Amis de la Terre), have sharply criticized this decision. In a recent joint statement, these NGOs urged financial institutions, notably French banks Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, not to support the project\u2019s restart. They highlighted the potential negative climate consequences and ongoing human rights concerns related to the project site.\n\nRegional economic and strategic stakes\n\nThe Mozambique LNG project is one of the most significant gas investments currently being developed on the African continent. Alongside TotalEnergies, it involves Mozambican partners as well as the Japanese group Mitsui, holding a 20% stake. The project\u2019s revival is eagerly anticipated by Asian markets, the primary intended recipients of the liquefied natural gas produced.\n\nThis U.S. decision could also influence upcoming decisions by the British and Dutch agencies. For international financial markets, the effective restart of the project now depends on the definitive approval from these other financial institutions, essential for the full release of funds required to restart operations.",

The green hydrogen, produced by a 300 MW electrolyzer in Lingen, will help reduce emissions at the refinery by 300,000 tons of CO2 annually and marks the largest hydrogen contract from an electrolyzer in Germany.\n\nPlug Power said it has partnered with Southwire to create a clean hydrogen ecosystem at its new Dallas-Fort Worth distribution site, providing more than 50 hydrogen-powered forklifts and a fueling station with four GenFuel dispensers. Plug Power said the hydrogen will be sourced from one of its production facilities in Georgia, Tennessee, or Louisiana.\n\nGasunie said it will jointly explore reusing the Petrogas pipeline under the North Sea to transport green hydrogen with Petrogas. The research, focused on repurposing the pipeline for the offshore hydrogen project Demo 1, aims to lower hydrogen costs and enable imports from other North Sea countries.\n\nHanwha Aerospace has secured approval in principle (AIP) certification from DNV for its 200 kW hydrogen fuel cell system for maritime applications. The certification positions the company to secure type approval for its Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) technology, enhancing its competitiveness in the zero-carbon propulsion systems market for various marine vessels.",

            "content": "Donald Trump is a polarizing political figure, and he has come into office with a long list of plans. While not every president is as polarizing as Trump, every single president comes into office with plans. That's the key investment issue to think about, whether or not the current energy plan -- Trump's energy plan -- succeeds in its goals or fails. If you're looking to own an energy stock for more than the next four years, you'll probably want to consider these three energy giants.\n\n1. ExxonMobil's dividend has weathered 10 presidential terms\n\nExxonMobil (XOM 2.97%) has increased its dividend annually for 42 consecutive years. That's just over 10 four-year periods spanning seven presidents, which means ExxonMobil's dividend has been robust through the energy plans of Democrats and Republicans alike. That's not to suggest that the various energy plans haven't mattered or that they don't have an effect on the company's performance -- only that Exxon is built to survive whatever gets thrown at it. That's exactly what a long-term dividend investor should be looking for in an energy stock.\n\nThe company's strength starts with its business model, which is of the integrated variety. That basically means that it operates in the upstream (energy production), the midstream (energy transportation), and the downstream (chemicals and refining).\n\nEach segment of the broader energy industry operates a little differently. The midstream tends to produce reliable cash flows through the entire energy cycle. The upstream does well when energy prices are high. And the downstream often does well when energy prices are low, given that oil and natural gas are key inputs. This diversification helps soften the peaks and valleys of the volatile energy sector, no matter who is president at any given time.\n\nExxonMobil also has a very strong balance sheet. The value of this can't be overstated, as it allows management to take on debt during weak patches so that it can keep funding its business and shareholder dividends. When energy prices rise again, as they always have historically, ExxonMobil reduces its leverage in preparation for the next industry downturn. The company's built to survive, and the changing of the guard in Washington isn't going to change much about how ExxonMobil operates over the long term.\n\n2. Chevron is like ExxonMobil, but with a higher yield\n\nThe integrated model that underpins ExxonMobil's business is the same model that Chevron (CVX 2.22%) uses. In some ways, they are interchangeable. ExxonMobil is a much larger company, with a market cap of around $486 billion versus Chevron's $276 billion at recent prices. While both are gigantic companies, if you prefer to stick to the largest companies in an industry, ExxonMobil wins. Another key difference is that Chevron has \"only\" increased its dividend annually for 37 consecutive years. That's roughly one less presidential term, which really isn't that big a deal. The two really stand toe to toe on the dividend reliability front.\n\nHowever, when it comes to dividend yield, Chevron is the clear winner, as its 4.5% yield is nearly a full percentage point higher than ExxonMobil's 3.6%, which is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nThe interesting thing about ExxonMobil and Chevron is that it sometimes seems like they switch places, performance-wise, over time. Right now, ExxonMobil's operating better as a business and Chevron is facing some headwinds, including an acquisition that's not going as smoothly as hoped. If you're looking to maximize the income your portfolio generates, however, that means Chevron could be the right all-weather energy pick for your portfolio today.\n\n3. TotalEnergies is French; very, very French\n\nTotalEnergies (TTE 1.24%) is also an integrated energy giant. Unlike ExxonMobil and Chevron, which are both based in the United States, TotalEnergies is French. That changes some things about the business, including the fact that much of its revenue come from operations that have little to nothing to do with the U.S. In fact, its exposure to the rest of the world, notably on the production side, is one of the reasons to like TotalEnergies. Because it isn't a U.S. company, it can forge relationships with countries that wouldn't necessarily be possible for a U.S. company to easily deal with.\n\nHowever, the bigger reason to like TotalEnergies is its increasing exposure to electrical power, notably including clean energy like wind and solar. It stands apart from all its direct peers in this commitment, which makes it a hedge of sorts against the ongoing clean energy transition. And, as with oil and natural gas, it can operate in countries that would basically be off limits to U.S. competitors.\n\nTotalEnergies has more leverage than either Chevron or ExxonMobil, which is actually pretty normal for a European integrated energy giant (these companies carry more cash as a way to offset the increased financial risk). However, it stands miles above its European peers on the dividend front.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic's height, BP (BP 3.15%) and Shell (SHEL 1.52%) both cut their dividends as they announced they would increase their investment in clean energy. TotalEnergies stood by its dividend while making the same basic commitment. Meanwhile, both BP and Shell have since walked back their clean energy goals, while TotalEnergies has, if anything, picked up the pace of its investment. Its integrated power dividend grew 17% in 2024 and made up roughly 10% of the company's adjusted net operating income.\n\nMost long-term energy investors would probably be better off with ExxonMobil or Chevron, particularly if the goal is exposure to oil and natural gas. However, if you like the idea of owning a resilient energy stock that's preparing for the clean energy transition today, that would be TotalEnergies. It also pays a lofty 5.7% dividend yield (U.S. investors have to pay French taxes on the dividend, but a portion of those taxes can be claimed back come April 15).\n\nPresidents shouldn't drive your investment decisions if you are a long-term investor\n\nWall Street's investment horizon seems to get shorter and shorter all the time. If you're day trading, which is a terrible investment tactic for most people, news about Trump's fast-moving administration will be a very big deal to you. But if you're a dividend investor who thinks in decades and not days, Trump's administration is just another in a long line of presidential administrations.\n\nYour goal shouldn't be to position your portfolio to handle Trump, good or bad. It should be to position your portfolio so that it can handle anything, good or bad. On that score, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and TotalEnergies are three integrated energy giants that have proven they know how to survive, and continue to reward investors, no matter what president is in the White House.",

Several have already been handed out, usually for an irregular sprint. But you can also get one for cycling on the sidewalk, as Axel Zingle experienced. The rider from Visma | Lease a Bike was penalized with a yellow card, although he had unofficially received one from a colleague along the way.\n\nIt all happened in the fifth stage of Paris-Nice, at a significant bottleneck in the road. The large peloton suddenly had to pass through a narrow stretch of road, and the traffic jam caused considerable chaos. It was too much for Zingle, who was way out on the edge of the bunch. He chose not to get involved in the chaos and went to the bottleneck's right side. He tried to catch up with the pack on the pavement but encountered a spectator who had not been expecting to see a cyclist there. Fortunately, the two managed to avoid each other, allowing the 26-year-old French rider to rejoin his colleague.\n\nHowever, these riders were not exactly pleased with the sprinter's behavior. Once back in the peloton, Zingle was confronted by a TotalEnergies rider, who playfully used a gesture to show him the yellow card. The rider was later proven right, as the Visma | Lease a Bike rider was also given a card by the jury. He will be on his best behavior for the rest of the race. If he breaks the rules again, he will be suspended for seven days.\n\nRead more below the video!\n\nYellow cards criticized in the past\n\nDanny van Poppel made the news earlier this year with a yellow card in the Tour Down Under. He later repeated this trick in the UAE Tour: by deviating from his line, he became the first rider to receive his second yellow card. He did not fully agree with the new system. \"Something had to change because cycling is becoming dangerous. But my frustration is that I have already seen a few sprints in which they did not give out a yellow card even though they could have,\" he said at the time.",

Critics note that a long-awaited Alaska LNG pipeline proposal, which President Trump touted in his address to Congress this month, would face direct competition from the TotalEnergies facility.\n\nThe company was one of the largest importers of Russian LNG last year, according to the Associated Press. It was also the first Western company to sign an oil deal with the Iranian government during a break in U.S. sanctions in 2016.\n\nRick Perry, Trump\u2019s former energy secretary, told the Washington Free Beacon that the TotalEnergies Mozambique project \"directly competes with the U.S. LNG industry, at a time when the President is looking to expand it.\"\n\n\"President Trump and his cabinet have been very clear that this administration will restore American energy dominance and protect the U.S. energy industry and the millions of people that support it,\" said Perry. \"The proposal for ExIm bank to send $5 billion in taxpayer dollars to fund a foreign owned project in Africa contradicts this priority.\"\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank originally greenlit funding for the Mozambique facility at the end of the first Trump administration, but the proposal was paused due to ISIS-linked terrorist activity in the area. The project remained in limbo during the Biden administration, which was reluctant to fund fossil fuel companies.\n\nIn 2019, Ex-Im said the loan would boost the U.S. economy by funding the \"export of U.S. goods and services from multiple states for the development and construction\" of the Mozambique facility, while supporting \"an estimated 16,400 American jobs over the five-year construction period.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Ex-Im\u2019s board approved the $4.7 billion loan in a closed-door meeting.\n\nDaniel Turner, director of the energy lobbying group Power the Future, slammed the closed-door Ex-Im vote as an example of \"weaponized bureaucracy\" and said the loan would go toward \"building a company that will now directly compete with America.\"\n\n\"Ex-Im is an organization that is indifferent to the voting will of the American people, the national ethos, and the conversation around savings,\" said Turner. \"Why does a French company need $5 billion from U.S. tax dollars?\"\n\nOpponents are also voicing concerns about TotalEnergies' involvement with adversarial countries. A former White House official, who served in the first Trump administration, said the Total Mozambique loan raised alarms when it was first proposed in 2019.\n\n\"We're an administration that is \u2018America first,\u2019\" said the former official. \"Basically anywhere the United States says this is an area where we don't want anybody going and investing, and we're sanctioning this country \u2026 TotalEnergies looks at that and says, \u2018Okay, so that's where we're going to go invest,\u2019\" said the official.\n\nTotalEnergies continues to hold investments in the Russian LNG sector, including a nearly 20 percent stake in Novatek, one of Russia\u2019s largest natural gas producers. The company also inked a cooperation deal last year with the Chinese government-owned China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (SINOPEC), and has been working to help China produce \"sustainable jet fuel,\" according to a press release.\n\nAfter the Obama administration lifted sanctions on Iran, TotalEnergies was the first Western company to strike a major oil deal with the regime. The company pulled out of Iran after the renewal of U.S. sanctions but maintains a small office and staff in Tehran, according to its 2023 financial report.\n\nTotal also held investments in Cuba and Venezuela until 2022, according to the financial report. The company is the largest shareholder in Yemen LNG, which operated a gas plant that was allegedly used by Emirati forces as a military prison, according to a 2023 lawsuit.\n\nThe Ex-Im loan has already faced some backlash from conservative media, a sign that it could become a flashpoint in the Republican fight to curb government spending and overseas funding. Last month, the Wall Street Journal editorial board called the TotalEnergies proposal a \"risky foreign project that competes with American businesses\" and denounced Ex-Im as an agency \"in need of the DOGE treatment.\"\n\nSteve Forbes, the conservative media publisher, told the Free Beacon it was a \"risky and nonsensical investment.\"\n\n\"DOGE\u2019s admirable work is intended to cut unnecessary foreign aid, especially projects which would directly compete with American LNG,\" said Forbes.",

            "content": "In a groundbreaking step for the hydrogen market, TotalEnergies and RWE have for the first time agreed on conditions for the purchase of green hydrogen over a period of 15 years. The agreement stipulates that TotalEnergies will purchase around 30,000 metric tons of green hydrogen per year from RWE for its refinery in Leuna (Saxony-Anhalt) from 2030. This is the largest quantity of climate-neutral hydrogen ever contracted from an electrolyser in Germany.\n\nThe agreement is a signal for the German market because fuel suppliers such as refineries are encouraged to gradually reduce their greenhouse gas emissions over time. Using 30,000 metric tons of green hydrogen in a refinery saves 300,000 metric tons of CO 2 per year. That's how much 140,000 cars emit on average per year.\n\nMarkus Krebber, CEO RWE AG: \u201dWe are proud to have secured the first long-term offtake agreement for green hydrogen of this size with TotalEnergies in Germany. Six months after the investment decision for the construction of the 300-megawatt electrolysis plant in Lingen, we have acquired an important anchor customer in TotalEnergies. This shows that hydrogen works with the right incentives for customers.\u201d\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies: \u201cWe are looking forward to developing further our partnership with RWE, our partner in several offshore wind projects in Germany and the Netherlands. This long-term green contract for green hydrogen marks an important milestone to reducing our CO 2 emissions at our Leuna refinery. It will be made possible thanks to the completion of the H 2 backbone by German authorities and their efficient support to green H 2 customers like our Leuna refinery.\u201d\n\nStephan Weil, Prime Minister of Lower Saxony: \u201dThis contract also sends an important signal to the important energy city of Lingen and for the development of a hydrogen economy in Lower Saxony and throughout Germany. The production and marketing of green hydrogen on an industrial scale, which we as a state also support financially, is an essential prerequisite for the successful transformation of our industry towards climate neutrality. Lower Saxony is leading the way in this area in Germany: 50 per cent of the EU-approved production of green hydrogen in Germany is in Lower Saxony, and 20 per cent of the hydrogen core network is being realised in Lower Saxony. Now it is important to further strengthen industry demand and push ahead with the expansion of the hydrogen core network with all our power. We also need to design the framework conditions in such a way that hydrogen projects can be approved more easily and quickly.\u201d\n\nDr. Reiner Haseloff, Minister President of Saxony-Anhalt: \u201dSaxony-Anhalt is a land of the chemical industry as well as of renewable energies. Green hydrogen is an important link between these two industries. Therefore, we support the development of a hydrogen pipeline network as well as the production and use of green hydrogen. The use of hydrogen is a central component for the maintenance and modernisation of our chemical industry. The signing of the contract between RWE and TotalEnergies underscores Saxony-Anhalt's prominent position in the ramp-up of the climate-neutral hydrogen economy. This will strengthen Saxony-Anhalt as a business location by using green hydrogen at TotalEnergies' refinery in Leuna and it will promote innovation and sustainable industrial jobs in southern Saxony-Anhalt.\u201d\n\nTotalEnergies needs significant quantities of green hydrogen to decarbonise its refineries in Europe. The company has invited tenders for 500,000 metric tons per year across Europe. The 30,000 metric tons that have been contractually agreed upon will be produced at RWE's 300-megawatt electrolysis plant in Lingen (GET H2 Nukleus), which will go into operation by 2027.\n\nRWE operates its electrolysers with electricity from renewable energy sources. Under EU law, these electrolysers may only be operated with renewable electricity generated in the same hour as the hydrogen. In order to be able to reliably supply the contractually agreed hydrogen even at times when there is little sun and wind, RWE Generation will use booked capacities of the hydrogen storage facility in Gronau-Epe. A subsidiary of RWE, RWE Gas Storage West, plans to put this facility into operation in 2027.\n\nRefineries already use large quantities of hydrogen today. This mainly comes from fossil natural gas, which causes high CO 2 emissions. In Germany, fuel suppliers are encouraged to gradually reduce the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG quota) generated by their fuels, for example by 25% by 2030.The use of green hydrogen is one way for refineries to prevent CO 2 emissions and thus meet their GHG quota.\n\nThe supply relationship between RWE and TotalEnergies will be facilitated by the German hydrogen core network. This will connect ideal hydrogen production sites, such as Lingen in Lower Saxony, with large centres of industrial hydrogen consumption, such as Leuna. The more than 9,000-kilometre-long pipeline network is to be phased into operation between 2025 and 2032 by both repurposing existing gas pipelines and building sections of new pipelines.\n\nImages for media purposes (Image rights: RWE) are available in the media library.",

This situation can expose us to safety, security, health, environmental and ethical risks. For this reason, states and civil society have particularly high expectations with regard to our industry.\n\nEach and every day, we therefore rely on our values to guide our actions and relationships with our stakeholders, taking a collective approach to achieve our ambition of being a world-class player in the energy transition.\n\nOur Business Principles, rooted in our values\n\nWe apply and comply with all national and international laws and standards in all of our host countries. Beyond rules, we have made our values \u2013 Safety, Respect for Each Other, a Pioneer Spirit, the need to Stand Together and a Performance-Minded attitude \u2013 the beacons that guide our actions day after day. Our two core values, Safety and Respect for Each Other, form the basis of our Code of Conduct.\n\nSafety: Untiring collective vigilance\n\nBecause we work in an industry that can never be completely risk-free, Safety is the cornerstone of our operational efficiency. Safety is also the foundation of our collective commitment to operate sustainably and establish relationships based on trust with our host countries. To meet our goal of zero fatal accidents, we need to enhance our risk management, both on work stations and in our facilities. Safety is a daily battle that is waged with humility and vigilance. Safety rules always need to be followed, but people should also step in if they feel a situation is unsafe. Safety is also an essential criterion in choosing our business and industry partners. We place particular emphasis on their ability to apply a policy equivalent to ours.\n\nRespect for each other: Central to our collective principles\n\nFor TotalEnergies, exemplary behavior starts by listening to and respecting all of our stakeholders. It means showing unwavering integrity, but also respecting human rights in all circumstances and protecting the environment and human health.\n\nMeeting the most stringent integrity standards To ensure we exhibit exemplary behavior as a Group in all of our host countries, we need to be able to count on the integrity of each of our stakeholders. This is why we have developed rigorous compliance programs based on zero tolerance towards fraud, corruption, influence peddling and failure to abide by competition law. In particular, these programs make use of: Risk analyses\n\nDedicated policies and procedures\n\nTraining and awareness programs on rules and best practices for preventing risks\n\nAssistance in preventing and detecting risks\n\nAnalyses and feedback Read our Business Integrity Guide (pdf) Respecting human rights, a fundamental commitment at TotalEnergies We uphold the commitment to our stakeholders to respect human rights everywhere we operate. This includes: Rights at work, through compliance with the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nRights of local communities, through the implementation of grievance mechanisms in communities that are impacted by our activities.\n\nGuaranteeing that the measures adopted to ensure the safety and security of our employees and our facilities do not hinder the fundamental freedoms of local community members. Read our Human Rights Guide (pdf) In July 2016, we were the first oil and gas company to issue a Human Rights Briefing paper. Based on the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework, it shows our current approach to embedding respect for Human Rights in our operations. Read our Human Rights Briefing Paper, updated in 2024 (pdf) Protecting human health and the environment, a pillar of our responsible development strategy We are committed to protecting the environment by controlling the impact of our operations in all of our host countries. We promote efficient and responsible use of our energy sources and products. At the same time, we strive to protect the health of people, whether our employees, our customers or local communities. We implement awareness and prevention actions on the various types of health risks.\n\nOur values, our reference standards and our collective and individual principles are set out in our Code of Conduct, which serves as our reference document. It is intended primarily for our employees and managers, who must adhere to it in their daily activities. We are convinced that our development is intrinsically rooted in the confidence and respect that exists between TotalEnergies and our employees and among the employees themselves. Our Code of Conduct also sets out our commitments and expectations with regard to our other stakeholders, including shareholders, customers and suppliers, so that our continued growth benefits everyone while helping to drive economic and social development in all of our host countries.\n\nA major commitment to promote financial transparency At TotalEnergies, we promote transparency in respect of the profits derived from our activities. We have supported the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) since it started in 2002 with the aim to report the payments by extractive industry companies to host country governments. We are particularly engaged in this voluntary, multilateral initiative, as it offers a framework for dialogue to everyone involved, including governments, oil, gas and mining companies, and civil society. In addition to our commitment in favor of the EITI, we report the payments made by the Company\u2019s extractive companies for the benefit of each government of states or territories in which TotalEnergies carries out its activities. In our annual Universal Registration Document, we break down the types of payment and totals by country, project and government. Read our report on the payments made to governments (pdf)\n\nOur Ethics Committee: Ensuring Compliance With Our Principles\n\nSince 2001, the Ethics Committee has been responsible for monitoring the application of our Code of Conduct. Importantly, it is also responsible for supporting and advising TotalEnergies\u2019s employees and stakeholders and for listening to their concerns. Employees and stakeholders may contact the Committee to: Ask a question or request advice concerning the application of or compliance with the Code of Conduct\n\nReport any matter that poses serious risks in areas such as corruption, fraud, anti-competitive practices, discrimination, workplace harassment, workplace health, hygiene and safety, and environmental protection.\n\nSpeak up: An alert system open to all Situations in the field can be complex, which means our employees may need advice. To support them every day, we encourage an environment of dialogue and trust in which each person can express his or her point of view and concerns. Our employees may contact their immediate supervisors, an HR manager, any other manager, their Compliance Officer or their Ethics Officer. Because ethics is everybody's responsibility, our employees and our external stakeholders may contact the Ethics Committee if they need advice, have a question or want to report any matter that poses an ethical risk at [email protected].\n\nCommunicating And Promoting Our Ethics Policy",

A high-pressure distillate hydrodesulphurization unit also allows production of ultra-low sulfur diesel that meets the specification of the American market. A catalytic gasoline hydrotreater reactor started in 2020, to bring the gasoline production of the refinery below the 10-ppm sulfur mark.\n\nThe platform has also implemented several projects in recent years to increase its environmental compliance, including the largest turnaround of its history in 2023.\n\nThe Port Arthur platform, a major player in the U.S. petrochemical industry\n\nThe Port Arthur platform features a 1 million metric ton/year steam cracker through a joint venture with BASF. After undergoing adaptation work since 2013, the steam cracker now uses mainly locally produced ethane and butane as feedstock. In December 2023, for the first time in the United States, TotalEnergies converted feedstock from plastic (pyrolysis oil) into a monomer at the BTP cracker (JV BASF), then into circular polypropylene, ISCC+ certified, at the TotalEnergies La Porte plant.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the completion of two major petrochemical projects developed by Baystar, a 50/50 joint venture between TotalEnergies and Borealis, further consolidated our development in the United States:\n\nThe commissioning of a new ethane cracker with a production capacity of 1 million ton of ethylene per year at the Port Arthur site for an investment cost of USD 2 billion.\n\nsite for an investment cost of USD 2 billion.

As a pioneer in detecting and quantifying emissions in real-life conditions, TotalEnergies is using the AUSEA technology developed in cooperation with the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne. It is one of the means we are using to reach our objective of near-zero methane emissions from our operations by 2030.\n\nMethane is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 times higher than that of CO 2 and a much shorter atmospheric lifetime. Reducing methane emissions is a priority, and TotalEnergies intends to establish an exemplary track record in this area.\n\nSince 2017, we have been working with the CNRS and the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne to develop the AUSEA technology (Airborne Ultralight Spectrometer for Environmental Applications) to detect and quantify methane and carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nAUSEA: a solution for detecting and measuring emissions\n\nThe AUSEA technology comprises a drone-mounted ultralight CO 2 and CH 4 sensor for ensuring access to hard-to-reach emission points while delivering readings with the highest precision. The sensor features a diode laser spectrometer and is capable of detecting and quantifying methane emissions with a high level of accuracy (> 1 kg/h).\n\nIn 2022, a first campaign to detect and measure emissions on site in real-life conditions covered 95% of operated sites(1) in the upstream sector. More than 1,200 AUSEA flights were carried out in 8 countries to cover 125 sites.\n\nThe long-term objective is to use the technology as part of a seamless and autonomous system. To achieve this aim, the research teams are looking to develop an unmanned drone navigation system with data automatically streamed to the servers, as well as instantaneous data processing and reporting capabilities. Automating the system will deliver immediate results to local operators at the facilities and increase the number of flights.\n\nIn addition to detection campaigns at our operated sites, we are making AUSEA technology available to certain operators to enable them to carry out targeted detection campaigns on their own sites. This is a concrete action to encourage the entire sector, especially national companies, to move towards zero methane emissions.\n\nOur objective: near-zero methane emissions by 2030\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, we halved our methane emissions by spearheading an action program targeting each of the emission sources at our assets (flaring, venting, fugitive emissions and incomplete combustion) and reinforcing the design criteria for our new facilities. To go even further, we are committed to a 50% reduction in our methane emissions by 2025 (achieved a year ahead of schedule) and 80% by 2030 compared to 2020 levels.\n\nThese targets cover all our operated assets and go beyond the 75% reduction in methane emissions from coal, oil and gas between 2020 and 2030 outlined in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario.\n\n(1) Calculated as a percentage of 100% operated production.",

Green hydrogen storage will be provided locally. The green hydrogen will be delivered by a 600 km pipeline to the gates of the refinery and will prevent the site\u2019s emission of some 300,000 tons of CO 2 beginning in 2030. This is the largest quantity of green hydrogen ever contracted from an electrolyzer in Germany.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to developing further our partnership with RWE, our partner in several offshore wind projects in Germany and the Netherlands. This long-term contract for green hydrogen marks an important milestone to reducing our CO 2 emissions at our Leuna refinery. It will be made possible thanks to the completion of the H 2 backbone by German authorities and their efficient support to green H 2 customers like our Leuna refinery,\u201d said Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to have secured the first long-term offtake agreement for green hydrogen of this size with TotalEnergies in Germany. Six months after the investment decision for the construction of the 300-megawatt electrolysis plant in Lingen, we have acquired an important anchor customer in TotalEnergies. This shows that hydrogen works with the right incentives for customers.\u201d said Markus Krebber, Chief Executive Officer of RWE.\n\nTotalEnergies and the decarbonization of its European refineries\n\nTotalEnergies is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of producing, converting and supplying energy to its customers. One of the pathways identified by the Company is using low-carbon hydrogen to decarbonize its European refineries, a move that should help reduce its annual CO 2 emissions by around three million tons by 2030. In order to fully decarbonize the hydrogen the Company uses in its European refineries, it has already contracted over 200,000 tons of various forms of green and renewable hydrogen a year for its sites at La M\u00e8de, Grandpuits and Normandy in France, in Leuna in Germany, for its northern European refineries and in Antwerp in Belgium and Zeeland in the Netherlands.\n\n***",

Until 2019, its facilities processed and exported over 90% of the natural gas produced in the Danish North Sea.\n\nDue to the natural subsidence of the field after almost 40 years of continuous gas extraction, the seabed beneath the Tyra platforms had sunk by more than five meters. In 2017, the Danish Underground Consortium \u2013 a partnership between TotalEnergies, BlueNord and Nords\u00f8fonden \u2013 took the decision to rebuild and upgrade the facilities to ensure continuous and safe operations. Therefore, production was suspended between September 2019 and March 2024.\n\nTyra's redevelopment: a human and technical feat\n\nA large-scale technical and logistical effort was required to drive Tyra's transformation. The teams began by dismantling the obsolete installations. This stage was completed during the summer of 2020 and involved two of the world's largest construction and crane vessels. In total, some 50,000 metric tons of material were removed.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, eight new platforms were installed, including six wellhead and riser platforms, an accommodation platform and a processing platform. The last processing module, weighing 17,000 metric tons, was installed in October 2022, breaking a world record as heaviest crane lift at sea. After the platforms were powered up and reconnected to the existing North Sea energy infrastructure, Tyra II resumed production on March 21, 2024, with ramp-up to full technical capacity in the following months.\n\nRecycling efforts are one of the project's defining features.

            "content": "The energy transition also involves the development of low-carbon energies, based on the transformation of biomass or the production of synthetic molecules (e-fuels) combining hydrogen and CO 2 as raw materials. TotalEnergies is developing these new energies.\n\nBiofuels\n\nToday, biofuels emit less than 50% more CO 2 e* than their fossil fuel equivalents over their life cycle, so they represent a way of decarbonizing liquid fuels. Demand is strong, making this a highly profitable market, but access to raw materials remains a barrier to growth.\n\nAmong these biofuels, TotalEnergies favours the manufacture of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to decarbonize the aviation sector, while the road sector has other options besides biodiesel to decarbonize, in particular electricity.\n\nTo avoid land-use conflicts, TotalEnergies is developing solutions based on the priority use of waste and residues from the food industry. As for the agricultural raw materials used, they comply with sustainability and traceability requirements: carbon footprint, non-deforestation, and good land use.\n\nTotalEnergies has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of circular feedstocks (waste oils, animal fats) to more than 50% of the feedstocks used to produce biofuels by 2025. The Company has also stopped sourcing palm oil.\n\nBiogas\n\nBiogas, produced by the degradation of organic waste, is a renewable gas composed mainly of methane. Compatible with existing gas transport and storage infrastructures, it has an important role to play in decarbonizing the use of gas products (power generation, heating).\n\nTo this end, the Company is forging strategic partnerships with players in the agricultural, waste and wastewater treatment sectors to develop growth platforms in Europe and the United States.\n\nHydrogen\n\nTotalEnergies' priority is to decarbonize the hydrogen consumed in its European refineries by 2030, which should reduce CO 2 emissions by 3 Mt/year by 2030.\n\nSynthetic fuels\n\nIn the future, using CO 2 as a raw material will help to decarbonize certain transport sub-sectors to an even greater extent. The captured CO 2 can be used, in reaction with green hydrogen, to produce fuels or synthesis gas. TotalEnergies is positioning itself in this market by developing pilot units.",

            "content": "INTERVIEW | Among oil and gas majors, TotalEnergies stands alone in its plans to shift a fifth of its business to renewable-led integrated power by 2030. It\u2019s a tightrope walk for the company\u2019s long-time CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9\u2014essentially a strategy that\u2019s not \u201cenough oil and gas\u201d for traditional investors nor \u201cenough renewables\u201d for green ones.\n\nBut after a decade in charge, the Frenchman is thinking about his legacy and remains confident his is a no-regret strategy that fosters innovation, has raised employee morale, and targets returns on an integrated-clean-power equivalent to what oil delivers through the price cycle.\n\nAppointed after the tragic death of his predecessor in a plane crash, Pouyann\u00e9 has led the business through turbulent times for the sector, including the decarbonization commitments in the Paris Agreement, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. While he counsels leaders to expect the unexpected, he has no doubt that the energy of the 21st century is electrons. He argues for both carbon prices and net-zero ambitions but also says the transition needs to be gradual, pragmatic, and affordable to bring society along.\n\nPouyann\u00e9 recently spoke with Sandra Sancier\u2013Sultan, a McKinsey senior partner, at TotalEnergies\u2019 Paris headquarters. The discussion provides an important and timely perspective on the broader energy transition and its implications.\n\nToday we\u2019re seeing a slowdown in the energy transition\u2014not in the commitments, but in the actual projects. What\u2019s your view of this change?\n\nWhat I see\u2014and I\u2019m a little surprised by it\u2014is that for some people, having more pragmatism means backtracking on their commitments. But to me, pragmatism doesn\u2019t mean renouncing the ambition. I don\u2019t want to renounce the aspiration that TotalEnergies could achieve net zero by 2050, together with society, because it\u2019s a big motivator for our employees and our strategy.\n\nBut there are challenges to reaching that goal, like we see today with the slowdown in electric-vehicle [EV] adoption in the US. What the US decides will be fundamental to the pace of the transition everywhere. Europe may go faster, but in other big markets of the world\u2014China, India, South America\u2014the transition won\u2019t go faster than in the US.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing a backlash to going too far in the net-zero-above-everything approach, so we need to rebalance. That\u2019s why I\u2019m insisting that the targets we set for 2030 are pragmatic ones: reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and continuing to grow via renewables. I don\u2019t know if collectively we will be able to reach the COP28 [28th UN Climate Change Conference] target of tripling renewables, but it\u2019s a bold objective. If we can make 2.5 times, we\u2019re not yet on the trajectory to reach the 1.5\u00b0 target, but at least we will have made strong progress.\n\nIn your view, what are the major misconceptions people have about the energy transition?\n\nIn 2015, when the Paris Agreement was signed, the target was well below 2\u00b0\u2014if possible, 1.5\u00b0, which meant carbon neutrality around 2070. Then in 2017 or 2018, scientists said if you want to reach 1.5\u00b0, you need carbon neutrality in 2050. This was a huge acceleration. Immediately, a sense of urgency arose, and it ignored that a transition means gradual changes. Instead, it led to the belief that we could transform the energy system overnight. The change in target also led to the idea that we need to urgently go to the ultimate solutions\u2014that we need EVs and e-fuels tomorrow morning instead of having some time for gradual solutions, like more fuel-efficient internal combustion engine cars. Suddenly we want the perfect solution, as if tomorrow morning we will be in 2050. But perfect solutions are expensive. We need to bring them to customers and society gradually. For example, we\u2019re working with the marine industry to use liquefied natural gas [LNG] as marine fuel. It\u2019s not the ultimate solution, but it decreases emissions by 20 percent. During the past five years, we lost time talking about e-methanol and ammonia, which are a perfect, final solution but aren\u2019t available now, because they\u2019re expensive. Now the marine industry is coming back to LNG, which is good for 15 years, giving us time to develop better solutions.\n\nSo you want to keep the ambition but be pragmatic about the way to reach it?\n\nYes. We won\u2019t make this transition if we forget that the fundamental characteristic of energy is affordability, because it\u2019s central to everybody\u2019s lives and to economic development. If we don\u2019t find a path for affordable energy, emerging countries won\u2019t accept it. And it\u2019s one of the difficulties for Europe, as well, which is the only continent where we have a significant price on carbon. And the desynchronization on carbon price with the other regions of the world has become a real problem for European competitiveness.\n\nI signed the 2015 call for a carbon price. It\u2019s good for the climate because it\u2019s the right signal to influence economic choices; I\u2019m absolutely convinced. But ten years on, Europeans haven\u2019t convinced other big countries about carbon pricing. And in the new geopolitical context, this is a major question for Europe: Are we going too far? Should we be more pragmatic?\n\nWhat about China\u2019s carbon price?\n\nIt\u2019s still low, and China will not change it quickly but gradually\u2014it\u2019s pragmatic. It\u2019s ahead today in many low-carbon technologies because in 2010, when the price of oil reached $100, its bill was exploding. As the largest oil importer, China was fundamentally thinking of affordability but also of its own security of supply.\n\nChina was a strong believer in solar, wind, and batteries. It developed them very quickly, much earlier than the others. China has been super at driving costs down\u2014which the rest of the world benefits from today. But it didn\u2019t do it with a real carbon price but by driving its own technologies to be affordable. Today its EVs are the best, but it also has too much renewable energy and can\u2019t cope with the intermittency. So it\u2019s reintroducing a carbon price, but I\u2019m sure it will keep the price at a level where it remains competitive with the US and the rest of the world.\n\nEarly in your tenure as CEO, you made a choice to expand the company from oil and gas to a multi-energy strategy that includes electricity. You talked about this as \u201cwalking a tightrope.\u201d What do you mean when you say this?\n\nWe\u2019re a successful oil and gas company. We restructured our portfolio to reach a $25 per barrel breakeven and have the highest profitability of the oil majors. At the same time, we observed the energy transition all around us, with society pressuring us to contribute to the new energy world. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but we\u2019ve done it for several reasons.\n\nThe first is that, historically, we were an energy supply company. Our strategy was to supply more oil and gas, knowing the market would buy it. Suddenly in 2015, a new realization came to us: Maybe we were wrong. Maybe oil demand won\u2019t continue to grow proportionately to the population. So we needed to look at demand. And when we did so, there were many different scenarios. But in all of them, electricity was growing. There\u2019s no doubt that the energy of the 21st century is electrons. Our strategy is led by demand planning, not just by supply capacities. We then considered if we could find a way to use our fossil fuel skills to develop an integrated electricity business. We decided yes, it made sense.\n\nThe other motivation was our people. In 2018, when the net-zero debate arose, I was having lunch one day with some young drillers. They asked me, \u201cWhat will I become in ten years?\u201d For me, it was obvious: They would drill. But for them, it wasn\u2019t obvious. I realized we will have an issue if our own people, who are proud of the company and whose motivation is our best asset, begin to ask this question. So one key factor in our decision to move to the multi-energy strategy was to give our people a positive answer. And it\u2019s working. In our surveys this year, 92 percent of our employees are proud of the company and are convinced that the strategy is right and that it will succeed. That\u2019s much higher than ever before.\n\nWe\u2019re walking a tightrope at TotalEnergies. The people who tell us we should only do oil and gas aren\u2019t happy with us, because we invest 30 percent in renewables and electricity. And other people say to us, \u201cYou continue to put two-thirds into oil and gas; you aren\u2019t good citizens for the planet. Why not put more in renewables?\u201d So today, we think we\u2019re doing well because we\u2019re building a strong renewable-integrated-power business that delivers good profits. But it\u2019s not enough for one, and it\u2019s too much for the other.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m sticking to the strategy, even as some of my peers backtrack. Consistency of strategy in such a fast-changing environment is the best answer because the energy business is a long-term business. I\u2019m convinced that by 2030, these electrons will represent nearly 20 percent of our mix. It\u2019s a sizable transformation for us.\n\nWhat fuels that conviction when you have stakeholders who question it?\n\nIt\u2019s a no-regret strategy, and the board is unanimously supportive. Having said that, we face reality, too; we check our progress quarter after quarter. For me, it\u2019s a no-regret decision, and the motivation it creates for our people confirms it. It would have been more comfortable to remain an oil-and-gas-only company even if we had to face criticism. But I thought that if we didn\u2019t make that decision, our successors would regret it.\n\nAs a CEO, you also think about your legacy. I\u2019m number ten in the series of CEOs of TotalEnergies over 100 years. I said to myself, \u201cIf you don\u2019t move in this electricity segment, it will be difficult to catch up. With all that we\u2019re doing this decade, we will learn, we will spend some money, and we will build teams and competencies. And yes, it will produce a legacy that will be different, and to be a little different from the others is also to differentiate in terms of business model. So why not?\u201d\n\nThe topic of the energy transition is very politically charged. You have been challenged a number of times, especially in your own country. How do you navigate this? What\u2019s your \u201ctrue north\u201d?\n\nMy true north is clear: It\u2019s the interest of the company. When you become CEO, your life is driven fundamentally by the interests of the company, not personal interests. There\u2019s a lot of politics and criticism. Yes, I\u2019m frustrated by it. And strangely, it\u2019s in my home country that we\u2019re most criticized. It can have an impact on my children, sometimes, but not on me. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t question myself regularly. But if it\u2019s what I believe is good for the company, I have to stick with it. That\u2019s just part of the job.\n\nYou\u2019ve told the media that your main competitors don\u2019t like to take risk, so you do. What do you need to do as a leader to take that risk?\n\nIt\u2019s boldness. I\u2019m not a poker player, to be clear. I\u2019m quite rational. But being too cautious is also not best for the future of the company. Again, my driver is: Will taking that risk be good for the company or not? It\u2019s not an emotional decision, it\u2019s intuition. But the intuition is also based on my experience, not on emotion.\n\nWe faced a lot of criticism when the war in Ukraine started because we didn\u2019t immediately declare that we would leave Russia. But the company had $15 billion of assets in Russia. Emotionally, I could have said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave,\u201d but it was in the interest of the company to take a little more time. I was quite heavily criticized in the newspapers at the time.\n\nMy team spent the summer of 2022 in a big exercise evaluating what we would do if we didn\u2019t have assets in Russia. Part of the answer was in the diversification to electricity; another part was to invest more in the US. I said to my team, \u201cThe US has oil, gas, LNG, and renewables. So let\u2019s redeploy the capital we were planning to spend in Russia and put it in the US instead.\u201d We found a new road map for the company, and then the momentum came back. In the US today, we\u2019re the largest LNG exporter and one of the top five renewable companies.\n\nCEOs with a decade in charge are quite rare. What have you learned over the years?\n\nI came young into the job. At the beginning, it was suddenly very different to be number one compared with number two or three. What\u2019s fundamentally different is that everybody is looking to you permanently. I made some mistakes during the first few months because I didn\u2019t realize I was no longer \u201cnormal\u201d in the eyes of my colleagues.\n\nIn 2015, we faced some hard times because the price of oil dropped dramatically. Our breakeven was above $80 per barrel, and we had to reduce it to $25. It was a huge effort to convince my colleagues of that. You discover that you have to convince people; it\u2019s not a given. It\u2019s not because you are the CEO that they will follow you. You have to show them step by step. Of course, it\u2019s also very important to have strong unity at the top of the company, but that doesn\u2019t mean everybody has to be like you. Diversity is also good.\n\nYear after year, I see what works and what doesn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t correct everything, but I think I\u2019m a better CEO today than I was at the beginning.\n\nCan you tell us a bit more about how you bring your people along with you?\n\nPeople look to you as the CEO because, in the end, the CEO will decide. But at the same time, your decision is the result of exchanges with others. You need to be a sponge: to listen and to create debate. Then you can make better decisions, people will follow you, and the execution will be in the right direction.",

It also projects an operating profit of N7.8 bn, after deducting selling and distribution costs of N4.4bn and administrative expenses of N15.6bn.\n\nAccording to the notice, TotalEnergies expects to record a net finance cost of N5.6bn, driven by a finance income of N854.4m and finance costs amounting to N6.5bn. This will leave the company with a profit before tax of N2.1bn. After accounting for an income tax expense of N725.5m, the firm expects a net profit of N1.4bn for the period under review.\n\nIn its projected cash flow statement, the energy giant estimates a net cash inflow of N18.3bn from operating activities, following cash receipts of N172.4bn from customers and cash payments of N149.3bn to suppliers and employees. However, after factoring in income tax payments of N4.8bn, the net cash provided by operations will stand at N18.3bn.\n\nTotalEnergies Marketing Nigeria also plans capital expenditures of N2.1bn of fixed assets during the quarter. Meanwhile, its financing activities will see a cash outflow of N27.3bn, driven by borrowing repayment of N17.6bn, interest payments of N6.5bn, and dividend payments of N3.2bn.\n\nOverall, the company expects cash and cash equivalents at March 31 of N10.3bn, bringing its cash and cash equivalents to a projected deficit of N145.8bn as of June 30, 2025, compared to the N135.5bn deficit recorded at the end of March.\n\nThe PUNCH reported that TotalEnergies Marketing Nigeria Plc has projected a profit of N2.41bn for the first quarter of 2025.",

I am very proud of it,\u201d he said.\n\nThings went perfectly for the sprinters but there was some stress before that.\n\n\u201cI think from 70km to go Visma started to make the bunch really nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were some attacks on the climbs, Julien LuLu [Alaphilippe] attacked there. The second one was for the bonifications.\n\n\u201cSo the bunch was really nervous. But then we organized again, we stayed in front, the others closed the gap. They brought me in a good spot in the last kilometer and then Bert did a perfect leadout.\u201d\n\nA flurry of attacks in the finale\n\nDefending champion Matteo Jorgenson and teammate Jonas Vingegaard represent Visma-Lease a Bike\u2019s big hopes in the race (Photo: Dario Belingheri/Getty Images/Velo)\n\nThe break of the day went inside the first 10km and saw Alexandre Delettre (Team TotalEnergies), Samuel Fern\u00e1ndez (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) and Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch\u00e9-Wanty) build a maximum lead of over two minutes.\n\nThe teams of Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) and Tim Merlier (Soudal Quick-Step) controlled the gap and the move was finally brought back with just under 50km to go.\n\nVisma-Lease a Bike, Bahrain-Victorious and EF Education-EasyPost put the hammer down prior to the last of the day\u2019s three climbs, with Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling) attacking on the ascent.\n\nDefending Paris-Nice champion Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) went with him and pipped him to the summit, with things then settling down heading towards the bonus sprint with 9.5km to go.\n\nSantiago Buitrago (Bahrain-Victorious) surged there in pursuit of the time bonus, but couldn\u2019t get a lasting gap. Jorgenson went for it but was passed by Jhonathan Narv\u00e1ez (UAE Team Emirates) just before the line.\n\nHe kept pushing after that, but this plus a subsequent attack by Stefan K\u00fcng (Groupama-FDJ) were controlled by the sprinters\u2019 teams.\n\nMatteo Trentin (Tudor Pro Cycling), Matthias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) and Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers) had more luck in opening gap, with the trio holding an advantage of seven seconds with 5km remaining.\n\nHowever this too would fizzle out under the pressure of the chase behind, with the subsequent bunch finish seeing the sprinters tussling for position before launching their effort.\n\nSoudal Quick-Step hit the front for Merlier, but other teams swept past close to the line. This didn\u2019t deter the Belgian, who powered clear on the left side of the road to capture the stage and the first leader\u2019s jersey.\n\nIt is his fifth victory thus far this season; does he have his best legs ever?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered. \u201cLast year was also really good. I\u2019m on the same level as last year, I think.\u201d",

In the 15th minute, Neo Maema broke the deadlock, silencing the home fans with a well-taken goal.\n\nJust over ten minutes later, Yandisa Mfolozi doubled the lead in the 26th minute, putting Egypt in a precarious position. The hosts responded before halftime, pulling one back to make it 2-1, but they failed to build on that momentum.\n\nAny hopes of an Egyptian comeback were dashed five minutes into the second half when Luthuli converted a penalty to restore South Africa\u2019s two-goal cushion.\n\nThe visitors then managed the game efficiently, preventing Egypt from creating any clear-cut chances.\n\nWith the first leg having ended 1-1, South Africa\u2019s comprehensive performance in Cairo ensured a 4-2 aggregate victory, eliminating the Pharaohs and securing their place in the next round.\n\nMeanwhile, Gabon\u2019s hopes of progressing were dashed as they suffered a penalty shootout defeat to Gambia after a goalless draw in Libreville on Saturday.\n\nDespite dominating the second-leg match of the second qualification stage and creating numerous scoring chances, the Panthers failed to find the net, ultimately paying the price in the shootout.\n\nThe decisive moment came in the 78th minute when Gabon was awarded a penalty, but Samson Mbingui failed to convert, leaving the Scorpions with a lifeline.\n\nWith the match still deadlocked at 0-0 after regulation time, the contest went to a penalty shootout, where Gambia kept their composure to secure victory and advance to the next round.\n\nThe Scorpions converted all their attempts, while Gabon\u2019s Nasta Oyono missed his shot, sending his effort wide and sealing his team\u2019s elimination.\n\nElsewhere, Malawi advanced thanks to their 2-0 home win over Comoros to seal a 4-0 aggregate victory.\n\nWongani Lungu opened in the scoring for the home side in the 50th minute before Binwell Katinji's strike on the hour mark secured the win.\n\nThe last round of qualifiers will be played in May with the first leg will taking place between May 2-4, while the return leg fixtures are scheduled for May 10-11.\n\nThe final tournament will be played in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania will host in August.\n\nFirst Leg Results:\n\nGambia 0-0 Gabon (February 28, 2025)\n\nComoros 0-2 Malawi (March 2, 2025)\n\nSouth Africa 1-1 Egypt (March 2, 2025)\n\nSecond Leg Fixtures:",

            "content": "The Parliament passed the Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) Bill 2025, the bill seeks to regulate and promote CCUS technologies, which are part of Malaysia\u2019s multipronged strategy to address climate change and drive economic growth in new areas in line with 2023\u2019s National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR). The quick succession of the tabling, reading and approval of the bill\u2014all within three days\u2014shows the government\u2019s decisiveness and urgency in capitalizing the opportunities and potential in CCUS.\n\nKenanga iB in its review noted that CCUS could bring about opportunities in new areas of growth. With the CCUS hubs planned on the east coast (Terengganu and Pahang), it can help spur the growth of heavy industries (e.g. iron & steel, cement) that need carbon mitigation measures in addition to attracting investment interest from countries such as Japan and South Korea which need to meet their emission reduction targets.\n\nState to Benefit from CCUS Bill\n\nWhy Malaysia, particularly Sarawak? Huge storage capacity, geologically stable and suitable proximity (compared to other\n\nCCUS facilities in Europe, Australia). Here are the agreements that have been inked:\n\nPetros and POSCO International MoU (2022) \u2013 To conduct a feasibility study for capturing CO2 from industrial sources\n\nand storing it in Sarawak\u2019s geological formations, including cross-border transport from South Korea.\n\nPetros and TotalEnergies (2024) \u2013 To explore CCUS opportunities offshore, focusing on storage in depleted fields like\n\nLang Lebah-Golok. TotalEnergies is a partner in Norway\u2019s Northern Lights CCUS project.\n\nOther commercial agreements with partners (in 2024, undisclosed Australian and US firms) \u2013 To explore CCUS potential\n\nin Kasawari-M1, Lang Lebah-Golok, and M3 (industrial CO2 storage).\n\nThe following legislations put Malaysia, and particularly Sarawak, ahead in the low-carbon economy readiness:\n\nSarawak\u2019s Land Code (Carbon Storage) Rules 2022\n\nEnvironment (Reduction of Greenhouse Gases) Ordinance which requires registered businesses in scheduled economic sectors to submit annual carbon emission reports and setting carbon emission thresholds. This would drive the energy, oil & gas and other carbon-intensive industries to consider CCUS as one of their carbon mitigation measures.\n\nThe Forests (Forest Carbon Activity) Rules 2022 which regulates forest carbon-related activities including revenue-sharing mechanism.\n\nCCUS Bill and details of the carbon tax (expected in the upcoming National Climate Change Bill) which is scheduled to be imposed by 2026\n\nCost. Globally, CCS costs vary widely, ranging from USD15 to USD120 per tonne. There is no clarity yet on CCS cost in\n\nMalaysia. Pending details of the carbon tax rate, some Malaysian companies are implementing internal carbon pricing for an\n\nestimate on their carbon cost e.g. Petronas USD50 per tonne, CIMB RM70 per tonne, Sunway RM15 per tonne (up till 2024).\n\nExclusion of Sarawak and Sabah. In our view, the exclusion is likely due to Sarawak\u2019s already established regulatory\n\nframework in carbon-related activities i.e. storage, trading, hence avoiding overlapping or conflict which could delay and\n\ndampen Malaysia\u2019s CCUS development and opportunities. The quick succession of the tabling, reading and approval of the\n\nbill shows the government\u2019s decisiveness and urgency in capitalizing opportunities and potential in CCUS. It is clear that\n\nSarawak is way ahead in terms of carbon-ready legislation, a strong indication of its commitment to a low-carbon economy.\n\nWith Kasawari scheduled to begin operations by end-2025, the state government is ready for the first CO2 injection by 2026,\n\npaving the way for the state to become a regional hub.\n\nCO2 mitigation. Strictly speaking, CCUS is not a cost-effective method. The annual storage capacity for Kasawari alone is\n\n3.3m tonnes while the total of Malaysia\u2019s three CCUS hubs (including Kasawari) is 15m tonnes. The Petronas Group alone\n\nemit over 50m tonnes a year. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), including current and planned projects,\n\nabout 320m tonnes of CO2 a year would be stored away by 2030 and this represents only about 8% of CO2 produced\n\nannually by human activities. Nevertheless, CCUS play an important role in supporting modern and flexible power systems\n\nthat remain very much fossil-fuel dependent.\n\nProspects. Worldwide, there are 51 CCUS facilities in operation based on data by the IEA as at March 2024. The bulk of\n\nthese are for enhancing oil recovery (EOR) with only 10 dedicated storage sites. There are 44 under construction and 844\n\nbeing planned, with about 70% dedicated storage facilities. This shows that the growing potential of CO2 storage, more so\n\nwhen gas becomes increasingly important in the global energy transition journey.\n\nWhat\u2019s next. The National Climate Change Bill is a much-awaited next step, with many hoping to obtain clarity on a carbon\n\npolicy that spells out among others, the carbon tax, cross-border carbon trading and carbon project development regulations.\n\nWithout an effective carbon tax mechanism, there is very little incentive to drive mitigation projects such as CCUS.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nX\n\n",

Main elements impacting the Third Quarter aggregates Hydrocarbon production is expected to be at 2.4 Mboe/d, thanks to the ramp up of the Mero 2 project in Brazil that partially offsets unplanned shutdowns in Ichthys LNG and security-related disruptions in Libya. Exploration & Production results are expected to reflect the decrease in liquid prices compensated by an increase in gas prices.\n\nIntegrated LNG results are expected to be above $1 billion, in a context of low market volatility and a decrease in production due to unplanned maintenance on Ichthys LNG.\n\nIntegrated Power results are expected to be broadly in line with the second quarter.\n\nDownstream results are expected to sharply decrease given much lower refining margins in Europe and in the Rest of the World. Main elements impacting the Second Quarter aggregates Hydrocarbon production is expected to be within the high end of the guidance range, close to 2.45 Mboe/d. Exploration & Production results are expected to reflect this production level and the positive evolution of the oil price environment, partially offset by a decrease in gas realizations.\n\nIn a context of low volatility in the markets, Integrated LNG results are expected to be broadly in line with first quarter, while reflecting a slight decrease in realized prices.\n\nGiven seasonality, Integrated Power results are expected to be around $500 million, with quarterly cash flow expected to be in line with the $2.5 to $3 billion annual guidance.\n\nDownstream results will reflect the decrease in refining margins in Europe and in the Middle East, but will be partially compensated by a higher utilization of refineries and an increase in marketing results. Main elements impacting the First Quarter aggregates Hydrocarbon production is expected to be stable quarter-on-quarter, above 2.45 Mboe/d, despite the Canadian oil sands assets disposals effective during the fourth quarter 2023, thanks to the growth in LNG production and the startups of Mero 2 in Brazil and Akpo West in Nigeria.\n\nIntegrated Power results are expected to be up quarter-on-quarter, thanks to growth in the business.\n\nDownstream results will reflect the increase in refining margins, as the utilization rate of refineries during the first quarter 2024 was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter 2023.\n\nDue to the low volatility during the first quarter 2024, oil and LNG trading results are expected to be in line with their historical averages.\n\nSensitivities 2024*\n\nSensitivities 2024 Change Estimated impact on adjusted net operating income Estimated impact on cash flow from operations Dollar +/- 0.1 $ par \u20ac -/+ 0.1 B$ ~0 B$ Average liquids price ** +/- 10 $/b +/- 2.3 B$ +/- 2.8 B$ European gas price - NBP / TTF +/- 2 $/Mbtu +/- 0.4 B$ +/- 0.4 B$ European Refining Margin Marker (ERM) +/- 10 $/t +/- 0.4 B$ +/- 0.5 B$\n\n* Sensitivities are revised once per year upon publication of the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter results.

Beyond the strong local roots, our partnership with the Section Paloise is enriched by shared values: respect for others, a spirit of innovation, the strength of the team, a taste for performance and a sense of challenge.\n\nWe are therefore supporting the club in its new sporting ambitions, as well as in training and CSR. Nourished by these qualities, the club is building its success on the extra energy that characterizes all its members.\n\nI spent a large part of my youth in the South-West, where I still return regularly. I learned and played rugby there, with its culture and its side effects. TotalEnergies shares with rugby a vision of the collective: diversity, respect and solidarity, a taste for the land, shared emotions, commitment, effort and perseverance. It is for all these reasons that we have been accompanying the Section for so many years. Building the future is a challenge for TotalEnergies and for the Section: it can count on my fervent support and that of all the Company\u2019s employees.\n\nTotalEnergies, sponsor of the Section\u2019s training center\n\nWe are committed to supporting the professional integration of young people and have become the \u201csponsor\u201d of the Section\u2019s training center, which is accredited by the French Ministry of Youth and Sports and the National Rugby League. Through this partnership, we are helping strengthen the relationship between the TOP 14 club and local clubs, especially by inviting them to the Stade du Hameau on match days.\n\nThe Section Paloise and TotalEnergies, committed to the future\n\nThe Section Paloise was the first club to be labeled \u201cFair Play for Planet\u201d in recognition of the many eco-responsible practices that have been put in place, such as the creation of a CSR committee, the recovery of rainwater for watering the pitch and the promotion of local gastronomy. By unveiling the \u201cGreenest Shirt\u201d in August 2020, the Section Paloise became the first club to offer replica shirts made from 100% recycled plastics.\n\nMaking every match a popular celebration\n\nWe are working hand in hand with the Section Paloise to create positive events and bring together all local energies around the Stade du Hameau. To reinforce rugby\u2019s unifying spirit, we set up a village of activities at each of the Section\u2019s home matches.\n\nKeep track of the latest Section Paloise news\n\nTotalEnergies: partner to Club de Lons\n\nSince December 2023, TotalEnergies has been a partner to Lons Section Paloise Rugby F\u00e9minin, with the determination of helping the women\u2019s rugby club consolidate its presence at the highest level.

LPG stands for liquefied petroleum gas. The burning of wood and charcoal are very harmful to humans. LPG is an alternative to solid fuel and it deposits low amount of carbon.\n\nBeing able to cook without polluting the air is so important to me and to the next generations of my family too.\n\nI work for Total Energies in Nairobi, helping people transition to LPG. I love my job. I get to meet different people, I get to meet different customers. It makes me happy when I see them using LPG. The government plans to transition nearly four and a half million people from using kerosene and charcoal to LPG by 2028.\n\nThe effects of Woodfield are horrible, especially to children. In Kenya, there are about 23,000 deaths per year related to respiratory infections. LPG when it burns, it doesn\u2019t make any soot or smoke, and it emits low amounts of carbon.\n\nOne of my favorite clients is Marian\u2019s school. They were using wood fuel. I managed to transition them to LPG. They\u2019re much happier because the walls were full of soot, but now they\u2019re all smiley and happy.\n\nMike Wanjohi, Operations Manager Marion Farmhouse School:\n\nIn terms of health, I would say it\u2019s much better. Our kitchen staff are much happier than before.\n\nCatherine Mueni, Chef Marion Farmhouse School:\n\nIt\u2019s perfect because you know when you\u2019re cooking you can be able to reduce the light, the fire and also you can be able to know which food needs a lot of heat. So it\u2019s really nice.\n\nAt least now we have relaxed, even our skin colour has changed. Oh yeah, I can see you\u2019re glowing.\n\nJudith Kowuoche:\n\nDonnattah is the LPG depot manager. She\u2019s a friend of mine and a close colleague.\n\nDonnattah Khadambi, LPG Plant Manager TotalEnergies:\n\nOver the last seven years, the LPG demand has doubled. We have an ambition of reaching 100 million customers in Africa and India by the year 2030. Our mission is to ensure that all households are using LPG as the main fuel.\n\nJudith Kowuoche:\n\nWomen have been disadvantaged for very many years. For example, when they use wood fuel, they take a lot of time to go collecting the fuel.\n\nIf that use LPG, that time will be cut to almost nil. We have an app called Easy Gas. If you run out of gas, you\u2019re able to get the gas at the touch of a button. I love Chama because it\u2019s a time that we come to spend together. Today I\u2019m going to be cooking with LPG for my Chama members, so I\u2019ll be able to spend quality time with them and not spend a lot of time using wood fuel. So transitioning to LPG is helping empowering women and knowing we\u2019ve done a little bit, help improve the lives of people in Nairobi and to make the world a better place too.",

The project is owned in equal shares by TotalEnergies, Equinor and Shell. Operational since September 2024, the Phase 1 installations can store to 1.5 million tons of CO 2 per year.\n\nTotalEnergies is aiming to develop a CO 2 storage capacity (CCS) of more than 10 million tons by 2030, both for its own facilities and for its customers. Europe has a central role to play in the Company's CCS strategy, especially the North Sea where the Company can harness its status as a long-standing operator as well as its recognized operational and geological skills. Together with Equinor and Shell, we are developing Northern Lights, the first large-scale CO 2 transport and storage project off the Norwegian coast.\n\nAccelerating the decarbonization of heavy industry in Europe\n\nApproved by the Norwegian government in 2020 and designated as a Project of Common Interest (PIC(1)) by the European Union, Northern Lights aims to transport, receive and store CO 2 in geological layers buried at approximately 2,600 meters below the seabed in the Northern North Sea. The goal is to help European industrial companies reduce their CO 2 emissions.\n\nNorthern Lights can receive and store CO 2 since September 2024. It offers a safe and reliable shipping and storage service to industrial emitters across Europe, with a storage capacity of 1.5 million tons of CO 2 per year during Phase 1 of the project. In response to growing interest in these services from several industrial sectors, additional shipping and storage capacities up to 5 million tons per year will be developed as demand increases.\n\nA first commercial agreement signed with Yara\n\nThe first commercial agreement was signed in August 2022 with Yara to transport and store CO 2 captured from Yara Sluiskil, an ammonia and fertilizer plant in the Netherlands. Some 800,000 metric tons of CO 2 per year will be captured, compressed and liquefied in the Netherlands and then transported to the Northern Lights site to be permanently sequestered off the coast of \u00d8ygarden in the Norwegian North Sea.\n\nView text version\n\n\u00d7 This map shows the stages involved in capturing, transporting and storing CO 2 as part of the Northern Lights project, using the example of the Dutch-based company Yara. First, the CO 2 is captured, compressed and liquefied in the Netherlands. Then it is shipped to the Northern Lights receiving terminal in \u00d8ygarden, Norway, and permanently sequestered in geological layers buried about 2,600 meters below the seabed in the Norwegian North Sea.\n\nThe Northern Lights project in a few dates\n\nKey Dates in the Northern Lights Project\n\n(1) Defined as key infrastructure projects to complete the European energy market in order to help the EU achieve its energy and climate policy goals.",

I did that from September 2015 to April 2016 and then I became Project Admin, until I left in 2018.\u201d\n\nThrough her project admin role, she grew comfortable learning more about the roles of everyone involved in construction and engineering because she had a hands-on involvement on all administrative related operations.\n\n\u201cIn 2019 I joined China Railway Construction Engineering. I was the Project site Admin HR and the only national woman (at the time), out of a project team of over 100 men from Indonesia, China and Papua New Guinea that built the Able Computing Office complex,\u201d Lillian said.\n\nTaking a break in 2020, she returned to NC Civil Works in 2021 to help out for a few months, feeling grateful to her former boss Nicholas Constantinou for helping her with her starting position and credits him for shaping her into the professional she is now.\n\n\u201cHe is the reason why I am, where I am. We were trained tough \u2013 he was a very tough boss but I got used that leadership style and appreciate it because it prepared me to always be on top of things and plan ahead,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile she was back with NC Civil works, she applied for the position of Fleet Coordinator with TotalEnergies after noticing it on LinkedIn. Although she was asked to go in for an interview, she was not successful but did receive a favourable offer from Ela Motors, so joined in late 2021.\n\nWorking as a Fleet Support officer with Ela Motors for one year and credits her time at Ela Motors for learning more about vehicles in general and the processes in place for fleet customers, which has come in handy for her current role.\n\n\u201cIt was challenging (at Ela Motors) because of the number of branches and customers but I enjoyed my time there, I learnt so much.\n\n\u201cI was part of the team that looked after fleet customers and then we also provided guidance to the service departments of the 16 branches,\u201d she says.\n\nJoining TotalEnergies in March 2023 as Fleet Admin, she was promoted to the position of Coordinator in October 2024, working closely and learning as much as she can from the Fleet Superintendent.\n\n\u201cMy job is to make sure that the vehicles are safe, that the staff are transported to and from, the drivers are happy and to make sure that the people who help us by providing us drivers are paid,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt has been interesting thus far, my time with TotalEnergies.\n\n\u201cThis is my first Oil & Gas job, which is what enticed me to apply in the first place so I\u2019m enjoying learning from all my colleagues.\u201d\n\nGrateful for all of her experiences, she would like to believe that she has left an impact during her time within the different companies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an avid church goer but the main thing is that I have faith in the Lord and in where he is leading me.

The Gas Growth Integrated Project (GGIP) is designed to enhance the development of the country\u2019s natural resources to support its energy independence.\n\nThe GGIP project showcases our multi-energy strategy and our sustainable development model. Combining the production of natural gas, solar energy and improved oil production, GGIP reflects our determination to help oil and gas-producing countries move forward with their energy transition plans.\n\nWith support from the Iraqi authorities, we are going to invest in facilities to recover flared gas from three oil fields in the first phase and four other fields in the second phase to supply power plants, redevelop oil production at the Ratawi field, build a seawater treatment plant to supply the wells, and build and operate a solar power plant to provide carbon-free energy to the region\u2019s inhabitants. These projects represent a total investment of approximately $10 billion.\n\nA four-in-one project to sustainably develop the country\u2019s natural resources\n\nThe GGIP project features four sub-projects led by a consortium comprising TotalEnergies (45%), Basrah Oil Company (30%) and QatarEnergy (25%):\n\nAssociated Gas Upstream Development (AGUP) , which aims to develop production from the Ratawi field by upgrading the existing facilities to reach a capacity of 120,000 barrels per day (b/d) during phase 1, followed by 210,000 b/d during phase 2 by building a new plant.\n\nAr-Ratawi Gas Midstream Project (GMP) , which aims to eliminate flaring and recover the gas from several oil fields. Collected and processed, the gas will then be transported by pipeline to supply the local power plants, thereby improving the electricity supply to this region, which is regularly affected by power cuts. Until the commissioning of the GMP, scheduled in 2028, the ArtawiGas25 Project will reduce flaring on the Ratawi field from the end of 2025, followed by the neighbouring Majnoon and West Qurna fields. Eliminating flaring at these three fields represents a reduction of approximately 6 million tons of CO 2 per year.\n\nCommon Seawater Supply Project (CSSP) , which involves building a seawater treatment plant between the ports of Khor Zubair and Umm Qasr. The plant will be capable of treating 5 million barrels of water per day during phase 1. The filtered water will be piped to the Zubair, Rumaila, Majnoon, West Qurna and Ar-Ratawi fields to maintain pressure in the fields. It will replace the fresh water currently drawn from the rivers and groundwater. This project will reduce water stress in the area and free up 250,000 cubic meters of fresh water per day for irrigation and local agricultural needs.\n\nA 1-gigawatt solar power plant, the first in Iraq. Spanning some 2,200 hectares near the gas treatment plant, it will be divided into four units to adapt more easily to the capacity of the local grid. This power plant will supply electricity to 350,000 homes in the region, while avoiding 2 million tons of CO 2 emissions per year. It will contribute to the Iraqi government's goal of meeting 12% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2027.\n\nSocio-economic benefits of the project\n\nThe GGIP project represents a major investment in the Basra region, creating economic activity and over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. To maximize our contribution to the Iraqi economy, our local content policy for this project is based on three pillars:\n\nrecruiting and developing local talent: over 85% of the direct jobs created by the GGIP project will be filled by Iraqis;\n\ncontracting with Iraqi companies;\n\nstrengthening the skills of local resources: two contractual funds have been set up to promote employment, training and education, and to develop infrastructure projects.\n\nOver and above the jobs created and the local content, our aim is to carry out local socio-economic projects in this region of Iraq. A third fund, created on our initiative, is working in the fields of health, education and agriculture.",

You know, in every country, you have bureaucracy and routine. If you have the will to make it work, it works, and the will is there and is shared between the partners,\" she added.\n\n\n\nThe following is the full transcript of the discussion with Dunya Chalabi:\n\n\n\nRUDAW: How much is the deal worth now?\n\n\n\nChalabi: So you must have heard of two different figures: The $27 billion figure which represents accumulation of [capital expenditures] CAPEX and [operating expense] OPEX over 30 years; and the $10 billion investment in CAPEX over the investment period.\n\n\n\nSo $10 billion, this is for...\n\n\n\nJust a few years. Just a few years. Just investment.\n\n\n\nAnd the total is...\n\n\n\n$27 billion, for 30 years with OPEX.\n\n\n\nThe deal was signed some time ago, so why has there been a delay?\n\n\n\nIt wasn't quite a delay, actually. We first signed [the preliminary agreement] in 2021 and then there were some conditions required for it to be ratified. It took some time for those conditions to be fulfilled and for [the agreement] to be ratified. We finally signed the contract on July 10th, 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong the projects, which of them are now being implemented?\n\n\n\nWell, we can talk about the implementation of all of them. I'll start with the oil because this was already in production, not because it is the most important among the projects. There are four projects, as you know, and we've added a fifth.\n\n\n\nI will start with oil because the oil project had already started before the production. We are increasing the production and rehabilitating the [Artawi] field. We are also looking forward to increasing the production in two phases even further.\n\n\n\nAs for gas, the gas midstream project, which aims to capture and process flared gas from different fields, we actually started the pre-feed studies before the ratification in order to save time and finish the feed quickly. This year, we will be implementing the construction of the gas midstream project.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the solar project is already under construction, and by the end of this year, we will be injecting the first 250 megawatts into the national grid. Finally, the water project - which we were also doing the studies during the time where we could with the the Basra Oil Company (BOC) - we will be implementing it shortly as well.\n\n\n\nThe contract includes capturing, I think, 600 million cubic feet of gas?\n\n\n\nIn two phases.\n\n\n\nIn two phases, from five fields?\n\n\n\nCorrect.\n\n\n\nHow will this contribute to reducing Iraq's reliance on imported gas?\n\n\n\nSo it is not so much about reducing reliance, but rather about providing access to electricity, because this gas that is today being flared will be captured, processed, turned into dry gas and then into electricity. So for the first phase, which is the first half of the 600 million cubic feet - 300 million cubic feet - this will be providing electricity for households in the south [of Iraq] and a significant number of households. The second phase will obviously surpass that number and in fact double it.\n\n\n\nQatarEnergy has entered the project with 25 percent stake. What role does it play?\n\n\n\nWell, it is a partner. We are three partners: TotalEnergies, the Basra Oil Company (BOC), and QatarEnergy. All three partners are working together to make sure that the projects advance on time.\n\n\n\nAnd QatarEnergy will mainly be working on gas?\n\n\n\nNo, not at all. Their work is related to all [four projects], and we were in talks about a fifth project, which we have added. The fifth project aims to capture the gas that the Artawi oilfield [in Basra province] is producing. So, we put together a modular small gas capturing and processing plant that would take in the gas flared by Artawi.\n\n\n\nYou mentioned a water project. One part of your project is using sea water instead of freshwater water, while Iraq is in dire need of water now. Iraq officially says it is poor in terms of water resources. This is what the government says.\n\n\n\nIndeed, there is water stress.\n\n\n\nYou mentioned studies about this. When do you think that the water project will be implemented?\n\n\n\nOh, we will be executing shortly. We are governed by a joint management committee, which comprises [representatives from] the Iraqi oil ministry as regulator, but also from QatarEnergy and BOC as partners. All the projects, all the decisions are governed by that joint management committee. We will move forward with implementation as soon as we reach an agreement to go ahead, after the studies have been finalized and the decision of the EPCs [engineering, procurement, and construction contracts] are made, then we will implement. So today in 2025, we are executing the projects.\n\n\n\nWhat about the solar power plant with a capacity of 1000 megawatts? When do you think that will be implemented?\n\n\n\nSo it will be in four stages. It will be in the south near the Ratawi region, and it is in four stages. The first stage will be by the end of this year. The first 250 [megawatts] will be provided by the end of this year and will be injected into the grid by the end of this year. Then then next year, and over the next two years after that, the three other phases [will be implemented].\n\n\n\nHow does TotalEnergies ensure that these projects align with Iraq's commitment to reducing emissions?\n\n\n\nSo you must know that we ourselves are very careful about emissions and we make sure to include reducing emissions in our targets and as part of our own commitments. We have of course entered this agreement with the idea that we accompany the Iraqi government in reducing its CO2 footprint. And this project has a very good sustainability aspect since it reduces the carbon footprint significantly and provides cleaner energy from solar and gas [sources], access to cleaner energy for the population, and reduces the hydric stress. All this goes into the idea and the policies of energy transition.\n\n\n\nOne more question regarding the environment, we are in the era of climate change and all the big companies are somehow shifting to renewable energies. However, in the last few years, we've seen TotalEnergies return to Iraq. BP is back in Iraq as well, investing tens of billions of dollars in fossil fuel. You mentioned that part of it is to make Iraq rely on cleaner energy. The question is why?\n\n\n\nWell, all energy companies are committed to doing as much as they can in terms of energy transition and when I focus on TotalEnergies, [it is because] we are committed to that strategy of energy transition, to the reduction of CO2 footprint and the multi-energy strategies that we have are designed to have integrated projects so that we can, on the one hand, ensure production, and on the other hand, [ensure] low emissions to we reduce the [CO2] footprint.\n\n\n\nUsually big companies have their own concerns when it comes to investing such big sums in Iraq. How do you view this? What are the guarantees that you have to invest for 30 years, a sum of $27 billion?\n\n\n\nWe signed a contract with the authorities, with the government, with our partners, and we are sticking to the contract, and so are they. So far, we are moving ahead together, working together on ensuring that we respect the timeline [of the [project] and that we execute the project and make it workable.\n\n\n\nWhich expectation for the future of energy do you rely on more? Or I don't know if the word trust is more accurate to use, the OPEC outlook or the IEA?\n\n\n\nSo I can't really make a judgment on any of the two. What I can tell you is that we have our own energy outlook, like all energy companies, and all the outlooks, even those whom you would expect least of, talk about the need for energy transition and reducing the CO2 footprint in countries.\n\n\n\nAs TotalEnergies, you didn't participate in the five plus round of licensing. Do you have plans to participate in the sixth round, which I think will be more about investing in gas?\n\n\n\nWell, we have a very big gas project at the moment. So, [if] we already have it, let's get it done.\n\n\n\nDo you have any plans, besides these projects, to invest in other parts of Iraq?\n\n\n\nLet's do this project [first]. We are very keen on making this project work on time and to adhere to the timeline. It is very important to us to commit ourselves to leaving a place better than we found it, to make it much better, and this is already a focal point for us.\n\n\n\nYou already have a lot to do and to focus on.\n\n\n\nWe'll see what happens in the future, but for the time being, as we speak, we're looking into that.\n\n\n\nHow many jobs do you expect will be created, directly and indirectly?\n\n\n\nDirectly 5,000 jobs and indirectly 10,000 jobs, about 10,000 jobs. We have a very high Iraqization rate and we're doing very well. We have a good track record for that.\n\n\n\nI am always keen on asking about women's participation. You are the managing director of TotalEnergies in Iraq, and you are a woman, which is a very positive indicator. In the created jobs, what is the quota for women?\n\n\n\nWe don't have a quota. We have a general policy in the company of equality between men and women, and promoting women, including in their studies, so that they - girls and young girls - can through their studies become engineers. We are applying this in Iraq to promote women recruitment and we can do this given the qualifications that are there.\n\n\n\nIs it hard to recruit women in job openings in Iraq? The oil and energy sector in Iraq is usually dominated by men.\n\n\n\nWell, I am Iraqi, and I am a woman, and it is working.\n\n\n\nWhat are the main challenges that you face in this big project?\n\n\n\nWell, the real challenge is to really remain focused on synchronizing all five projects, making sure that they go well. Five parallel projects! It is huge! And doing all that goes with it, it is a positive challenge that we are focusing on. So all the things that come with it are taken as something that is part of the job.\n\n\n\nWe heard from other companies in the past that they face challenges from political elites, security challenges in part. How do you address such challenges?\n\n\n\nWell, we haven't addressed such challenges yet since we haven\u2019t faced them. We are very grateful for the support that we are getting. As I said to you, we have this joint management committee that is also governing us. So we have the support of the government, we have the support of our partners, and we're tracking ahead.\n\n\n\nBasra Oil Company is also part of this project. How do you deal with government entities?\n\n\n\nVery well. We work together hand in hand. We do. I know it. You don't seem to be convinced, but we do.\n\n\n\nUsually I hear from other companies that working with the state-owned companies in Iraq is not easy because of the bureaucracy they have. Do you face such challenges?\n\n\n\nIt is working very well. You know, in every country you have bureaucracy and routine, every country in the world. If you have the will to make it work, it will work. And the will is there and is shared between the partners.\n\n\n\nWhat is the expected timeline for the full execution of this contract and projects?\n\n\n\nSo the execution is proceeding. The full [implementation], I would say, operational readiness [will be achieved] by the end of 2027. Less than three years that is! We will make it work throughout the 27th. So I'm taking it large. But no, it's a very, very tight schedule.\n\n\n\nIt is a tight schedule, especially when we talk about energy, gas and oil, this field takes time. So far, are you progressing according to the schedule you had set?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely, we sure are!\n\n\n\nThat's interesting. You seem so confident, and that's a very good point. I really thank you, Dunia, for this interview.\n\n\n\nThank you very much.",

            "content": "Culzean is a gas condensate field located in the North Sea, 230 kilometers off the coast of Aberdeen. It was discovered in 2008 in an area that had been left unexplored for a long time. Its resources are estimated between 250 and 300 million barrels of oil equivalent. The Culzean platform is one of TotalEnergies\u2019 flagship offshore facilities, both in terms of its innovative technological and digital solutions, and the reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions from its activities.\n\nWith the acquisition of Maersk Oil in 2018, TotalEnergies became the operator of the Culzean offshore gas field located in Block 22/25a in the East Central Graben area of the central North Sea. This high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) gas condensate field is made up of two reservoirs at a depth of 4,300 meters below sea level, with reserves estimated at between 250 million and 300 million barrels of oil equivalent. Production from Culzean started in June 2019 and is capable of meeting 5% of the gas demand in the United Kingdom, where TotalEnergies is one of the main operators in the oil and gas sector.\n\nAn unprecedented offshore facility\n\nThe depth and size of the reservoirs require a unique approach to production. Culzean has three offshore platforms, linked together with bridges. The first platform is used for drilling and hydrocarbon production, the second for processing and export of produced gas and condensate, and the last for the crew\u2019s living quarters. The project also includes a floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel measuring 52 meters at its highest point and 243 meters in length. Called the Ailsa, the FSO can store up to 430,000 barrels of oil equivalent of condensate.\n\nWe have worked alongside our partners to perfect our technologies at each stage in the Culzean project\u2019s development. More efficient drilling techniques have allowed us to reach depths of up to 5,000 meters. In June 2022, we managed to increase Culzean\u2019s capacity by 10% through improvements in our technologies, reaching production of 550 million cubic meters of gas per day to meet the growing level of demand for gas in the United Kingdom and Europe.",

They could use that money to go on a nice vacation, pay down some of their debt, or invest for the future.\n\nOne place to consider investing your tax refund is the oil patch. While the sector can be volatile, there are some great oil stocks to consider buying these days. TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE), ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) stand out to some Fool.com contributors as the top ones to buy right now because they have the fuel to potentially grow your tax refund into a much bigger future windfall.\n\nTotalEnergies is oil...and more\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer (TotalEnergies): One long-term trend that investors in the energy sector have to contend with is the increasing use of clean energy. That's not to suggest that oil and natural gas are going away; that's far from the case, as an \"all of the above\" approach appears to be the way forward. But the big growth in the energy sector has been in areas like solar and wind. What's an investor to do with the dichotomy between slow-growing carbon fuel businesses and faster-growing renewable energy? Punt with TotalEnergies.\n\nTotalEnergies is one of the largest integrated energy companies on the planet. It will continue to supply the world with the carbon fuel it needs for as long as it is profitable to do so. But unlike most of its integrated energy peers, TotalEnergies has made a material commitment to cleaner energy options via its integrated power division.\n\nThis business grew 17% in 2024. Profit-wise, it is hard to compare integrated power to TotalEnergies' oil and gas operations, which all shrank in 2024, since commodity prices make those divisions fairly volatile. The real takeaway is that management is preparing today for a future in which cleaner energy sources have a more important role in the global energy landscape.\n\nThis matters because it means you can comfortably own TotalEnergies and collect its 5.8% dividend yield without worrying that the energy transition is leaving you behind. Better yet, profits from carbon fuels are effectively powering TotalEnergies' business shift. So, you are benefiting today from carbon fuels and using those same profits to benefit from what is likely to be a future with more clean energy in it.\n\nThe best of the best\n\nMatt DiLallo (ExxonMobil): ExxonMobil is the undisputed leader in the oil patch. Last year, the company produced $34 billion in earnings and $55 billion in cash flow from operations. That marked its third-best year in a decade and led all international oil companies (IOCs).",

After seven days of racing, Fabien Doubey (TotalEnergies) is now the overall winner of the African race.\n\nThe Tour of Rwanda began with a short prologue of 3.4 kilometers. The 19-year-old Aldo Tailleu (Lotto) was the strongest in Kigali, the country's capital. The Belgian managed to stay two seconds ahead of overall winner Doubey and teammate Milan Menten. The first stage was for the fast men with stamina: after 157 kilometers of relatively flat racing, the finish was uphill in Kayonza. On that day, Henok Mulubrhan secured the victory for the Eritrean team. Tailleu had already lost the leader's jersey.\n\nStage 2 was also tough: after a short 112-kilometer ride, with 2200 meters of climbing, Israel - Premier Tech managed to win. Brady Gilmore beat teammate Itamar Einhorn, making it a one-two for the team. The 23-year-old Australian also managed to win the third stage after being the best of an elite group. In stage four, he was close again, but he finished three seconds behind the stage winner, Joris Delbove (TotalEnergies).\n\nRead more below the video!\n\nYoung Belgians and Eritreans at the top in Rwanda\n\nAfter the success of the prologue, there was another Belgian celebration in the fifth stage. Once again, the youth left their mark, as the climber Duarte Marivoet (UAE Team Emirates Gen Z) managed to surprise the group of favorites and crossed the line 25 seconds ahead of the second group. However, TotalEnergies controlled the race effectively and fared well in the sixth stage, the queen stage to Kigali. The day's victory may have gone to Nahom Zeray, but Doubey (then second in the GC behind teammate Delbove) finished fourth, 14 seconds behind. This left him six seconds ahead of Mulubrhan and eleven seconds ahead of Oliver Mattheis (BIKE AID).\n\nIt promised an exciting final stage, with Mont Kigali and the Mur de Kigali on the program. These climbs are both included in the route of the cycling world championships in September. Unfortunately, it did not come to a battle. The weather was dreadful: the race had to change route after the original roads transformed into mud. After trying for a while, the cyclists hit the brakes: the roads were too slippery, the wind was too strong, and there was even lightning.\n\nRead more below the photo!\n\nDiscussion between TotalEnergies and Eritrea\n\nNot everyone agreed with the decision. The Eritrean national team was too eager to continue, seeing an opportunity with Mulubrhan to win the leader's jersey. A challenging discussion ensued, but in the end, it was decided to cancel the race. Doubey thus secured the final victory, but with a bittersweet aftertaste. It is not the first time this year that riders have opted not to continue: in the Trofeo Andratx, the peloton also refused to race after several crashes.\n\nFinal standings Tour of Rwanda 2025\n\nResults powered by FirstCycling.com",

            "content": "The first leg of the second qualification stage for the TotalEnergies CAF African Nations Championship (CHAN) 2025 concluded on Sunday, with key results shaping the road to the next round.\n\n\n\nMalawi stunned Comoros with a decisive 2-0 away victory, while South Africa came from behind to secure a 1-1 draw against Egypt.\n\nThe first fixture of the round, played on Friday, saw Gambia and Gabon share the spoils in a goalless encounter.\n\nMalawi Take Command Against Comoros\n\nPlaying away, Malawi impressed with a clinical display, defeating Comoros 2-0.\n\nThe visitors took control in the 44th minute, when Binwell Katinji capitalized on a defensive lapse to put Malawi ahead just before halftime.\n\nComoros attempted to fight back in the second half, but their inability to break through a well-organized Malawian defense proved costly.\n\nAny hopes of a comeback were dashed in stoppage time, when Zebron Kalima sealed the victory with a second goal in the 90th minute.\n\nWith a two-goal cushion, Malawi will now look to finish the job at home in the return leg on March 8.\n\nMeanwhile, Comoros face an uphill battle to overturn the deficit.\n\nSouth Africa Battle Back Against Egypt\n\nAt the Orlando Stadium, South Africa produced a spirited fightback to hold Egypt to a 1-1 draw in a tightly contested match.\n\nThe Bafana Bafana squad, named by coach Molefi Ntseki, featured a strong attacking lineup, including Monnapule Saleng, Terrence Mashego, Jamie Webber, and Donay Jansen.\n\nSouth Africa had their chances in the first half, with Saleng firing over from a cutback before Neo Maema forced a save from Egyptian goalkeeper Mohamed Kassem with a curling effort.\n\nThe Pharaohs, who adopted a defensive approach, were largely content to absorb pressure and strike on the counter.\n\nTheir strategy paid off in the 75th minute, when a long ball from Kassem led to a knockdown for Hassan Abdelaal, who volleyed home a stunning strike from outside the box to put Egypt ahead.\n\nSouth Africa, however, responded in emphatic style. Jamie Webber unleashed a powerful long-range effort that rifled into the top corner, drawing the hosts level.\n\nDespite late pressure from the home side, Egypt held firm to secure an important away result ahead of the return leg in Cairo on March 9.\n\nGambia and Gabon Play Out Goalless Stalemate\n\nIn the opening match of the round, Gambia and Gabon played out a 0-0 draw at the Stade Lat Dior in Thi\u00e8s, Senegal.\n\nGabon\u2019s defensive solidity ensured they left with a valuable away result, giving them the advantage heading into the return leg on March 8, where they will host Gambia with the opportunity to progress.\n\nWith the first legs completed, all six teams will now turn their attention to the crucial second-leg fixtures, where places in the next phase of CHAN 2025 qualification will be decided.\n\nFirst Leg Results:\n\nGambia 0-0 Gabon (February 28, 2025)\n\nComoros 0-2 Malawi (March 2, 2025)\n\nSouth Africa 1-1 Egypt (March 2, 2025)\n\nSecond Leg Fixtures:\n\nMalawi vs. Comoros \u2013 March 8, 2025 | 13:00 GMT\n\nGabon vs. Gambia \u2013 March 8, 2025 | 15:00 GMT\n\nEgypt vs. South Africa \u2013 March 9, 2025 | 19:30 GMT\n\nWith all to play for in the return legs, the battle for qualification to CHAN 2025 remains wide open.",

Azarenka has explained why she snubbed Ostapenko's controversial gesture after the clash.\n\nAd\n\nThe duo locked horns in a thrilling quarterfinal clash at the WTA 1000 event in Doha last year, with Azarenka claiming a dominant 6-0, 6-3 victory to extend her perfect winning record against Ostapenko to 5-0.\n\nAs the players approached the net after the clash, Victoria Azarenka appeared to be expecting the usual handshake, but Jelena Ostapenko instead extended her racket for the Belarusian to tap. The former World No. 1 ignored Ostapenko's gesture and proceeded to shake hands with the umpire before celebrating her triumph.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nAzarenka recently made an appearance on Daria Kasatkina's 'What the Vlog' YouTube channel and revisited the controversy. The Belarusian stated that she played nice until someone \"provoked\" her and accused Ostapenko of being the one with the \"problem\" during the incident.\n\n\"I can say it is not my problem, it was her problem. I don't know what she wanted me to do with the racket she gave me. She can put it in another place. Who gives the racquet in 2024? Somebody who acts like a b*tch, I'll be a b*tch too. I won't start it but if you want to play, let's play. I'm nice until someone provokes me,\" Victoria Azarenka said.\n\nAd\n\nVictoria Azarenka has called out Jelena Ostapenko's contentious on-court behavior on a previous occasion as well.\n\n\"It can be a bit comical\" - Victoria Azarenka on Jelena Ostapenko challenging line calls\n\nVictoria Azarenka - Source: Getty\n\nSpeaking to the press after her 6-1, 7-5 win over Jelena Ostapenko at the 2024 Australian Open, Victoria Azarenko called out the Latvian's \"comical\" tendency to challenge line calls and dispute the electronic system.\n\nAd\n\nThe Belarusian also pointed out that Ostapenko consistently acted the same, regardless of whether she was winning or losing.\n\n\"I can't speak for how she feels and why she does it. I don't know. Some of the line callings, I mean, it can be a bit comical. I'm like, Whatever. What are you going to do? Sometimes we look at the lines and you're like, Are you sure it was in when it's close? When it's pretty obvious, then you maybe don't argue as much,\" Azarenka said.\n\nAd\n\n\"I think it's something you kind of expect. She's doing what she's doing. It's actually interesting 'cause I feel like it doesn't necessarily always affect her. When she's winning, she's like this; when she's losing, she's kind of like this. I think it's just how she deals with herself on the court,\" she added.\n\nVictoria Azarenka and Jelena Ostapenko could get an opportunity to face each other again when they return to action at the 2025 Indian Wells Open, which begins on March 5.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "Thus, for short-term ease, the U.S. may rely on Europe\u2019s demand, however, IEA predicts that the European gas demand will decline from 507 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023 to somewhere between 281 and 407 bcm by 2035, owing to its transition to renewable energy sources. On the other hand, China\u2019s LNG demand is expected to grow and reach between 397 and 522 bcm by 2035.\n\nHowever, the industry is currently facing challenges in the form of the U.S.-China trade war, under which China imposed a 15% tariff on the U.S. LNG, as U.S. President Donald Trump put a 10% charge on Chinese imports. While long-term commitments are significant, in 2024, China\u2019s imports made up for only 5.5% (4.3 MT) of the total exports by the U.S., as per Kpler. It has been reported by Reuters that under 20-year agreements, Chinese buyers are to import 20 million tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG from U.S. terminals. However, ongoing issues may curb further contracts.\n\nThis increased demand is driven by strong winters as well as supply-related issues from Russia. Previously, Europe imported LNG through Ukraine in 2024, while it is currently seeing increasing geopolitical issues. On the other hand, Asia\u2019s LNG demand has also seen growth, making up 34% of the total LNG exports made by the U.S. in 2024. Accordingly, shipments to Asia rose to 2.01 MT in December from 1.64 MT in November (up by 24%).\n\nIn contrast, the global market also has a major impact from Europe\u2019s LNG demand. The region\u2019s demand accounted for 55% of total LNG exports by the U.S. in 2024, according to LSEG. LNG shipments of 5.84 MT were sent to Europe by the U.S. in December 2024, which is up from 5.09 MT in the previous month.\n\nThe global market for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), with the support of secure energy and industrial demand, is looking at continued expansion. The industry is forecasted to grow from $143.35 billion in 2024 to $155.85 billion in 2025, according to The Business Research Company. This reflects a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.7%. Looking further ahead, it is expected that the LNG market will reach $205.95 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.2%, which is predominantly attributed to the global demand for cleaner energy. The demand for LNG is majorly fulfilled by the U.S., exporting around 88.3 million metric tons (MT), which is up by 4.5% from 2023, according to LSEG.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoreover, advancements in technology in liquefaction and regasification have helped in improving energy efficiency and in reducing methane emissions across the supply chain. Furthermore, offshore gas extraction has been enabled by floating LNG (FLNG) with minimal onshore infrastructure, which adds to flexibility in production. The global LNG liquefaction capacity by 2028 is expected to increase from 473 million tons per annum (MTPA) in 2023 to 968 MTPA by 2028 with the help of new projects as per BusinessWire. The expansion will be led by North America, making up for 54% of the total capacity increase.\n\nLooking on to the other side, Australia also makes up for a key LNG player with over $126 billion invested in new and upcoming projects, as reported by Deloitte. These investments look to increase production capacity and help Australia secure long-term contracts amidst changing global demand.\n\nDespite these developments, natural gas futures prices have increased by around 98.02% in the past six months. This is an increase from $1.956 on August 26, 2024 to $4.23, as of writing this article. This reflects on the high volatility of the market as well as evolving trade flows.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 10 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we picked the top LNG companies having an exposure to LNG production and distribution. Furthermore, we made sure that we picked companies with strong market capitalization. Additionally, we looked into the number of hedge funds having a stake in the respective stocks, and made sure the hedge fund sentiment was positively strong for the respective stocks. Finally, we ranked the stocks based on the upside potential predicted by a healthy number of analysts, as of writing this article.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs TotalEnergies SE (TTE) The Best Oil Refinery Stock To Invest In According to Analysts?\n\nAn industrial oil and gas plant, with stacks of pipes issuing steam into the sky.\n\nTotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 19.37%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 26\n\nTotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) produces and markets oil, biofuels, natural gas, renewables and electricity. Its operations expand through Europe, North America, Africa, and globally. The company has operations in five major segments, which include Exploration & Production, Integrated LNG, Integrated Power, Refining & Chemicals, and Marketing & Services.\n\nTotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) reported adjusted net income of $18.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. This income was supplemented by low upstream production costs below $5 per barrel, as well as expansion of reserves, enabling the company to increase its production. The company was able to distribute $8 billion in share buybacks and increase its dividends by 7% for the third consecutive year, in the light of high cash flow from operations of around $29.9 billion. However, its earnings took a hit due to lower LNG prices and weaker refining margins in Europe, specifically in Integrated LNG and Downstream operations.\n\nThus, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) has enhanced its LNG flexibility by making use of the U.S. supply and regasification capacity in Europe to enhance its exposure to the market. Under its 2030 strategy, the company advanced its Mozambique LNG to achieve its 3 million tons of LNG target. Elsewhere, renewables and power saw cash flow more than double to $2.6 billion to exceed targets, as return on capital employed (ROCE) improved from 7% to 10%.\n\nLooking ahead, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) has projected a growth of 3% in its annual upstream production by 2030, which is supplemented by a 12.4-year reserve life index and efficient capital allocation. The company is focused on increasing its profitability and grabbing high-return opportunities, despite adjusting its CapEx guidance to $17 billion. The company stock is one of the Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy.\n\nOverall TTE ranks 2nd on our list of the best LNG and LNG shipping stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of TTE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Our exploration and production operations are faced with a growing number of constraints, including increasingly complex fields, volatile crude oil prices, and the need to factor in climate change. For our teams across the world, these challenges also represent a tremendous opportunity, encouraging us to constantly explore new frontiers and continually improve our production techniques while bringing costs down and reducing our environmental impact. When working to provide competitive responses to today's energy issues and secure tomorrow's energy solutions, our strength lies in our ongoing process of innovation.\n\nR&D: the driving force behind TotalEnergies' competitiveness\n\nWith more than 200 patents filed every year across the Comany, TotalEnergies remains true to the pioneer spirit that it has embodied since its creation. Our R&D focuses on four key areas:\n\nFirst and foremost, developing operations and programs that directly contribute to the TotalEnergies company's ambition to become the responsible energy major.\n\nPreparing for technological breakthroughs to capitalize on opportunities and position TotalEnergies as a major player in the future of energy.\n\nJoining forces with select partners to lead projects, drawing on specific, top-level skills.\n\nOptimizing R&D resources, including human talent, infrastructure and regional centers of excellence. Our R&D is organized around strategic programs and investments designed to seek out effective, safe and lasting solutions that set us apart from competitors. Our teams are working on eight cross-functional programs led by our four business segments (Exploration & Production, Refining & Chemicals, Marketing & Services, and Gas, Renewables & Power), as well as so-called vertical programs that are specific to each business segment. R&D is crucial for Exploration & Production, as it continuously perfects the technologies used to meet global demand for oil and gas under increasingly tight operating conditions. Our R&D teams focus on strategic areas to ensure an efficient, responsible future for oil and gas. They strive to steer the Company toward the best opportunities for exploration and to improve the recovery of oil and gas, while consolidating its tools and expertise to manage risks and environmental impact. Their research projects are focused on finding new ways to collect and process geophysical data (for subsurface imaging that reflects reality as closely as possible), improving reservoir modeling and simulation tools, and developing better recovery technologies. The teams are also committed to maintaining our competitive lead in the deep offshore market and supporting the Company's progress in unconventional oil and gas.\n\nResources to match our ambitions\n\nTotalEnergies is one of the few oil majors to have an in-house infrastructure spanning the entire development process, from laboratory testing to industrial-scale production. We also have a worldwide network of R&D centers for exploration and production, with locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, Qatar, and soon Brazil. Furthermore, we develop top-tier partnerships with academic institutions and major companies from the energy industry. Our prospective labs (Nanotechnologies, Sensors and Nanosensors, Biotechnologies, Robotics) are at the forefront of our R&D work and form part of our cross-functional programs. They enable TotalEnergies to explore emerging innovations with high disruptive potential in areas other than oil and gas, which the Company can then apply to its own operations. Technological Innovation Platforms (TIPs) work to quickly integrate technologies that have reached industrial maturity into exploration and production projects\n\nContributing to a cleaner energy future",

            "content": "With ten race interruptions (Safety-Car, Virtual Safety-Car, and Full Course Yellow), the 1812 km Qatar 2025 race was eventful on the Losail International Circuit. Team Peugeot TotalEnergies managed these delicate phases well and adapted their strategies to stay in contention and finish in the top 10.\n\nQualifying in 10th position by Jean-Eric Vergne, the PEUGEOT #93 had a chaotic start, including a drive-through penalty for failing to follow procedures under Full Course Yellow (about 30 seconds lost), before being penalized by an initial Safety-Car, and then rejoining the \"lead lap\" thanks to a second Safety-Car. Mikkel Jensen then set fast laps \u2013 1min42s646 on the 134th lap \u2013 before handing over to Jean-Eric Vergne, who completed a double stint, with the second stint on hard left-side tires and medium right-side tires. Paul Di Resta and Mikkel Jensen took over the wheel of the #93 to finish in 9th place.\n\nThe start of the PEUGEOT #94 was similarly eventful, with contact on the first lap. After a double stint on hard tires, Lo\u00efc Duval handed over to Stoffel Vandoorne, who continued with the same tire strategy. At 18:15, Malthe Jakobsen got behind the wheel of the PEUGEOT 9X8 for the first time in the race, completing an excellent 64-lap double night stint that he would remember for a long time. In the 8th hour of the race, after an intense on-track battle with the Porsche #5, the PEUGEOT 9X8 #94, then driven by Lo\u00efc Duval, unfortunately received a drive-through penalty, dropping it out of the points.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty complicated race, and very tight in the middle of the pack,\u201d sums up Olivier Jansonnie, Technical Director of Peugeot Sport. \u201cLosail is a circuit that doesn\u2019t degrade tires much, so no issues with the tire quota here. However, the track changes a lot, and we had to find the right tire combinations depending on the conditions, while trying to outmaneuver the competitors within our reach and make the best use of the Safety-Cars to keep both our cars in the lead lap as long as possible.\u201d\n\nAfter over 8,000 kilometers covered in eight days on the Losail circuit, Team Peugeot TotalEnergies will participate in a development session on the Qatari track before turning their attention to the next FIA WEC race, the 6 Hours of Imola (Italy), on April 20.\n\nJean-Marc Finot, Senior VP of Stellantis Motorsport\n\n\u201cThe two cars finished, and they were very reliable in this 10-hour race, which is a positive point because we had to rebuild #94 before qualifying. We extracted the maximum from the package we had during the race and took advantage of all opportunities and Safety-Cars to reposition ourselves in the standings. I am very proud of the work of the entire team this week. Now, we need to find a bit more pace to more regularly compete for the top spots.\u201d\n\nMikkel Jensen (PEUGEOT 9X8 #93)\n\n\u201cI did a first double stint of more than two hours. Between day and night, temperatures dropped, and the track evolved a lot. It was hard to know whether to use hard or medium tires at that point. We chose to run hard on the left and medium on the right. We weren\u2019t the fastest on track, but we stuck with it to stay in the top 10 and on the lead lap.\u201d\n\nMalthe Jakobsen (PEUGEOT 9X8 #94)\n\n\u201cMy first double stint with my new team! It wasn\u2019t easy with two Safety-Car periods. I had to manage the hard tires on the left and medium on the right, warming them up for the restarts on a rather cold track. I really didn\u2019t want to make any mistakes, and at the same time, I wanted to stay in the top 10. It was really fun!\u201d\n\nStoffel Vandoorne (PEUGEOT 9X8 #94)\n\n\u201cI pushed really hard in my last double stint to recover from the drive-through penalty. I made some good overtakes, the feeling was great, and the pace was good. It\u2019s a shame we didn\u2019t score points this weekend. We\u2019ll analyze everything and come back stronger in Imola.\u201d\n\nFind all the latest news about Peugeot Sport on its website (www.peugeot-sport.com) and on the\n\nfollowing platforms:\n\nTwitter : @peugeotsport\n\nFacebook : @peugeot.sport\n\nInstagram : @peugeotsportofficial\n\nYouTube: Peugeot Sport Official\n\nDiscover our videos of the 2024 season : https://www.youtube.com/@peugeotsportofficial\n\nMedia site / Photos / Video: https://www.media.stellantis.com/em-en/peugeot-sport\n\nContacts Media Peugeot Sport WEC :\n\nCharles Coutaz / charles.coutaz@external.stellantis.com / +33684115722\n\nSonya d\u2019Artois / sonya.dartois@external.stellantis.com / +33627816828",

            "content": "What is biogas?\n\nBiogas is a renewable gas produced by the anaerobic digestion (fermentation) of organic plant or animal waste collected from farmers, the food industry and local authorities.\n\nOnce purified, biogas becomes biomethane, a gas that has the same properties as natural gas and which can therefore be injected into distribution networks or used as an alternative fuel for land and sea transport (bioNGV or bioLNG). The digestate, a by-product of anaerobic digestion, can be used as a high added-value organic fertilizer instead of synthetic fertilizers.\n\nThe biogas sector is making a full contribution to the objectives of the energy transition, namely the development of renewable energies, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the development of the circular economy.\n\nAll About the Production Process and Uses of Biogas\n\nBecoming a world-class player in the sector\n\nOur ambition is to become a world-class player in biogas in Europe and key international markets. To achieve that aim, we are working alongside innovative and market-leading partners.\n\nTotalEnergies and biogas in France\n\nIn addition to being a transitional energy, biogas contributes to securing the gas supply of France and Europe. By developing a local industry, the production of biogas helps strengthen the continent\u2019s energy autonomy. Following the acquisition of Fonroche Biogaz in April 2021, we became the French leader in biogas. We are continuing to develop the sector in France, from producing to marketing finished products, through several agreements and partnerships.",

With Cristal Union, we are partnering long-term with a robust, internationally recognized partner committed to sustainable growth of its activities. With this new biogas project, TotalEnergies continues to contribute to the promotion of a circular economy with multiple local benefits, the production of renewable energies, and the decarbonization of the French energy mix,\u201d said Karine Boissy-Rousseau, VP Green Gases at TotalEnergies.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with the commissioning of this biomethane production unit located close to our sugar factory in Fontaine-le-Dun. Cristal Union has been committed to decarbonizing its activities for over 20 years. Unlike many industries, we have an asset: the ability to valorize the residues of our production, beet pulp, and industrial effluents, and reuse them to produce energy through anaerobic digestion or combustion. This partnership with TotalEnergies is a full-scale project for the treatment of pulp. Beyond the production of biogas from our production residues, it will allow us to provide our partner farmers with digestate to spread on their fields.

            "content": "As a multi-energy company integrated across the oil and gas value chain, we are committed to providing energy that is more affordable, more reliable, cleaner and accessible to as many people as possible. To put this ambition into practice and become the responsible energy major in today\u2019s complex environment, we rely on our key strengths, working every day to develop a diversified portfolio and focusing particularly on our expertise in deep offshore production and liquefied natural gas (LNG).\n\nA global, diversified and balanced oil and gas portfolio\n\nAt TotalEnergies, close to 13,000 people help supply our customers with the energy they need through their daily commitment to oil and gas exploration and production. In 2019, our teams produced more than 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. We operate in all the main oil and gas production regions, from Asia to Africa, Russia, the Middle East, the United States and the North Sea. We leverage cutting-edge technologies for the complex onshore and offshore oil and gas projects that we run all over the world. In addition, as part of our ambition to prepare the future of energy, we are renewing our portfolio by developing our exploration strategy. Today, we have a solid, diversified portfolio of proven and probable reserves1 representing around 20 years of reserve life at constant production levels. To steer exploration operations toward the most promising areas, we capitalize on 3D and 4D modeling technologies, which help us assess the potential of reservoirs as accurately as possible and more effectively plan ahead for seismic risks. 1 Proven reserves of oil and gas are reserves that have been estimated with reasonable certainty, since fields have already been discovered and their potential has been assessed. Probable reserves are estimated based on proven reserves and the probability of finding more elsewhere. Proven and probable reserves correspond to the sum of proven reserves and probable reserves.\n\nCreating value for our stakeholders in all our host countries As an oil and gas major, we are committed to contributing to the socio-economic development of our host countries and the people living near our facilities. That is why we engage in dialogue with our stakeholders well before our projects are launched, and take a comprehensive and integrated approach to local development in our operations. Find out more about our community commitments: Harnessing our community initiatives to create value.\n\nExpertise across the entire LNG chain\n\nThe proportion of natural gas in the energy mix is expected to stay high over the next two decades, meeting around a quarter of global energy demand1. Gas emits half the greenhouse gas of coal in power generation, making it an immediate, practical response to global warming. When converted to liquefied natural gas (LNG), it can be easily transported and delivered as closely as possible to consumer markets. It is then regasified before being fed into the distribution network. Growth in LNG demand is strong and expected to average some 5% per year for the 2015-2040 period. We are pioneers in LNG, which we have been producing for more than 40 years, and are now the world No. 2 in this resource. In fact, it is a key part of our strategy. We operate across the entire LNG value chain, from production and processing to trading, shipping and distribution, and use our liquefaction assets and regasification capacities across the world to supply all the main consumption areas. To continue developing our portfolio and meet our sales target of 50 million metric tons by 2025, we made final investment decisions in major projects in 2019: Mozambique LNG and NLNG Train 7 in Nigeria. Our many supply sources and delivery points around the world mean that we can guarantee our customers flexibility and maximum competitiveness. Further down the supply chain, to bring LNG to new markets, we are prepared to invest in new regasification terminals and power plants. We are working on floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) projects, which provide quick, cost-effective and flexible access to LNG. We also market natural gas thanks to our acquisitions since 2018 of various suppliers in the Residential sector (TotalEnergies in France, Lampiris in Belgium and the Spanish portfolio of Energias de Portugal). In addition, we joined forces with the privately owned Adani Group in 2018 to develop a broad energy offering for the Indian market. The alliance covers the importation and regasification of LNG for sale to industrial and corporate customers. Lastly, we work for cleaner energy by promoting LNG in maritime and ground transportation. For example, we use tankers with engines that are partly fueled by the LNG they transport and we are developing LNG marine fuel and natural gas fuel for vehicles. Find out more about our expertise in LNG\n\n1 According to the IEA\u2019s Sustainable Development scenario and TotalEnergies\u2019s Rupture scenario.\n\nLONGSTANDING expertise in deep offshore\n\n\"Deep offshore\" refers to oil and gas situated more than 500 meters underwater. Deep offshore is a strategic business, and remains a major growth driver for TotalEnergies. To develop these reserves, we are applying the diverse skill set we have acquired over close to 20 years. We are exploring and developing fields located in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Guinea and the North Sea in complex and increasingly diverse environments, dealing with such challenges as different natures of fluids, varying thermodynamic conditions, and deposit sizes ranging from small satellites to giant fields. Our launches in 2018 and 2019 included two major deep offshore projects in Africa: Kaombo and Egina Since 2012, we have been increasing our presence in Brazil, home to the largest recently discovered offshore deposits. These resources have great potential for low-cost development, which is in line with our strategy. This was reflected in our farm-in into the Iara and Lapa blocks under our strategic alliance with Petrobras, taking over the operatorship on Lapa, and the production start-up of Iara 1 in 2019. Our Company thus became the first major to operate a pre-salt producing field in Brazil. Already a top-tier operator, TotalEnergies has set itself a number of technical priorities to strengthen its leadership in deep offshore oil and gas. These include reducing our development and operating costs, fine-tuning innovative production and drilling technologies for use in ultra-deep offshore fields (1,500 meters and deeper), and managing industrial risks and our impact on the environment.

Despite the derecho winds reaching a top speed of 40 meters per second, a bouncing effect caused more damage.\n\nLucio Vasquez\n\nA recently published study employed miniature models of skyscrapers to find out why the May 2024 derecho in Houston was able to cause so much damage to \"hurricane-proofed\" buildings.\n\nThe study, published last week in Frontiers in Built Environment, recreated derecho-like conditions in a wind tunnel using scaled models of tall buildings and compared them to hurricane-like conditions. According to the findings, the deadly May windstorm created a unique \"bouncing\" effect that resulted in more significant damage than its wind speeds would have normally indicated.\n\nResearchers specifically focused on five Houston skyscrapers: the Chevron Building Auditorium, the CenterPoint Energy Plaza, the El Paso Energy Building, the RRI Energy Plaza and the Wedge International Tower \u2014 all of which were designed to withstand category 4 hurricane winds of up to 67 meters per second.\n\nDespite the derecho winds reaching a top speed of 40 meters per second, the bouncing effect caused more damage.\n\n\u201cWhen strong winds move through a city, they can bounce due to interference between tall buildings,\" Omar Metwally, a doctoral student who was the study's lead author, told Frontiers. \"This increases pressure on walls and windows, making damage more severe than if the buildings were isolated.\"\n\nRELATED: What is a derecho? Explaining the unusual storm that battered Houston\n\nWith Hurricane Beryl blowing through the Houston area less than two months after the derecho, Florida International University professor Amal Elawady said he and the other authors of the study were provided with a unique opportunity to compare the damage.\n\n\u201cHere we show that a type of highly localized strong winds called \u2018downbursts,' which were generated during the May derecho, can significantly impact tall buildings and facades due to their unique characteristics in comparison to hurricanes,\" Elawady said in Frontiers\u2019 announcement.\n\nAccording to the study's findings, the Gulf is warming at twice the rate of the global ocean, meaning the straight-line derecho winds are expected to become more common.\n\nMetwally said the \"bouncing\" wind effect should be considered in future skyscraper designs.\n\n\"Accounting for the unique effects of downbursts and thunderstorm winds in derechos is essential in urban planning and building design, to protect tall buildings against damage,\" he said in a statement. \"Current construction guidelines for facades should be re-evaluated to reflect this.\"",

            "content": "Guyana expects to soon sign an oil production-sharing agreement with a consortium led by France's TotalEnergies that will allow it to explore an offshore area, Energy Minister Vickram Bharrat told Reuters.\n\nGuyana is the world's fastest-growing oil-producing country and is on course to reach capacity of 940,000 barrels per day this year - nearly 1% of global supply - up from an output of 616,000 bpd last year.\n\nA consortium led by U.S. major Exxon Mobil produces all Guyana's oil. The government, which has sought to diversify the sector, awarded TotalEnergies's consortium the block in an auction in 2023.\n\nAs well as the agreement with TotalEnergies, at least three other contracts for exploration blocks awarded in that auction should be signed this year, Bharrat said in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference in the capital Georgetown on Wednesday.\n\nGuyana is also exploring options to reoffer an offshore block where a consortium by Toronto-listed Frontera Energy and CGX Energy made oil discoveries, Bharrat said.\n\nThe Corentyne block was seen as the likely next area for development after Exxon's success at the Stabroek block, where more than 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources have been found.\n\nFrontera and CGX's license on Corentyne has expired, according to the government, which did not approve the consortium's application to extend the license last year.\n\nEarlier this month, the consortium said the government notified them of the license cancellation. The firms have sent a letter disputing the cancellation to the government, Bharrat said, which means the case could go to court.\n\n\"We have been very lenient with CGX, very helpful to them like we are with any company investing in Guyana, but there's a limit too,\" Bharrat said.\n\n\"There's only so much we can bend... without breaking our laws. And there was no legal ground for me to extend (the license),\" he added.\n\nFrontera and CGX discovered light oil and condensate in Corentyne in 2022 and 2023, but failed to complete an appraisal of the block in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, Frontera said the company was looking for investors to help finance development of the project. The company has yet to disclose any partners.\n\n\"It's both a capacity and a financial problem,\" the minister said when asked about the consortium's struggles to complete the mandatory exploration program. Delays in the delivery of drilling equipment contributed, he added.\n\nFrontera and CGX did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe government could open a bidding round to reoffer the block or negotiate directly with interested parties, Bharrat said.\n\n\"Once it's completely cleared, I think there will be a lot of companies interested in it,\" he said.\n\nCorentyne could still be developed fairly soon, he said, but the Exxon group would continue to dominate Guyana's oil industry in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\nContracts To Come\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government and the Exxon consortium have yet to agree terms for exploring another area the group won in the 2023 auction, he added.\n\nThe consortium and the government recently reached an agreement on a portion of Stabroek to be returned to the government this year, Bharrat said. The areas are scattered across the block, however, so they might need to be delimited again to be reoffered in the future, he added.\n\nThe government is forecasting average oil output of 675,000 bpd this year versus 616,000 bpd in 2024. Guyana expects to receive one or two cargoes this year as a share of oil produced at Exxon's fourth floating output facility, which is expected to begin production in the third quarter, the minister said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reuters - Reporting by Marianna Parraga and Kemol King; Editing by Simon Webb and Nia Williams)",

Image courtesy of TotalEnergies Corbion.\n\nThe choice of Luminy PLA was no accident. \u201cWe looked at every material available,\u201d Daley explains. \u201cRight now, Luminy PLA is the winner in every metric. It is the safest and most environmentally friendly option available.\n\n\u201cWin Win Water was established with a mission to revolutionize the bottled water industry by combining purity, sustainability, and social responsibility,\u201d says Joshua Daley, company director at Win Win Water. \u201cThe market is demanding change, and as plastic becomes public enemy number one, we\u2019ve taken a step toward a better solution.\u201d\n\nU.K.-based Win Win Water is making waves in the bottled water market with a new 100% plant-based, industrially compostable bottle. The entire package, including the cap and label, is made from polylactic acid derived from sugarcane and supplied by TotalEnergies Corbion .\n\n\u201cThe absolute factor for us is human health. Why are we forced to drink millions of PET microplastic particles with every bottle or can of water? PLA offers a solution.\u201d\n\nThe bottle is made from Luminy PLA. This bioplastic is, according to TotalEnergies,100% non-GMO and produced from sustainably and ethically grown sugarcane. The cap is made from a proprietary PLA compound developed by one of TotalEnergies\u2019 partners.\n\nAs Derek Atkinson, VP of sales and business development at TotalEnergies Corbion, explains, the bio-based material provides a 75% reduced carbon footprint compared to petroleum-based plastics, with sugarcane crops absorbing carbon during growth and storing it in the material. \u201cThe biogenic carbon from the sugarcane is transferred to the value chain, ensuring a lower environmental impact,\u201d he says.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with using PLA for beverage bottles has historically been heat sensitivity, but for bottled water, Atkinson says it\u2019s not an issue. \u201cHigh heat-deflection temperatures are not required for water bottles, so this is not a concern here,\u201d he explains.\n\nWin Win\u2019s bottles have been designed to break down within 90 days in industrial composting facilities but are also durable enough for multiple reuses.\n\nWhile the current production doesn\u2019t include recycled PLA, Win Win Water is exploring the incorporation of rPLA in future runs. TotalEnergies Corbion operates its own chemical recycling plant that uses a depolymerization process via hydrolysis to recycle post-industrial and post-consumer PLA into lactic acid used to produce new, virgin-quality PLA.\n\n\u201cOur technology ensures that over 95% of the carbon in the incoming waste is returned as virgin PLA, which is far more efficient than recycling polyolefins,\u201d says Atkinson.\n\nAs Daley relates, developing the bio-based water bottle hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. \u201cWe have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds over the last three years to make this possible,\u201d he says, but the response, he adds, has been \u201camazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next generation of young adults gracefully demand healthy, forward-thinking innovation, and it\u2019s great to feel the love for trying to impact the world in a positive way,\u201d Daley say.\n\nWin Win Water is available in the U.K. and Austria; the company has a goal of expanding worldwide by 2027.

These projects will cut CO 2 emissions from TotalEnergies\u2019 refineries in Belgium and the Netherlands by up to 450,000 tons a year and contribute to the European renewable energy targets in transport.\n\nGreen hydrogen production by TotalEnergies and Air Liquide\n\nThe two companies have signed an agreement to set up a joint venture, equally held by TotalEnergies (50%) and Air Liquide (50%), which will build and operate a 250 MW electrolyzer near the Zeeland refinery. This project will enable the production of up to 30,000 tons of green hydrogen a year, most of which will be delivered to Zeeland\u2019s platform. The electrolyzer will be commissioned in 2029 and will cut the site\u2019s CO 2 emissions by up to 300,000 tons a year. This project represents a global investment of around \u20ac600 million for both partners and has made requests for support under European and national subsidy programs. Project funding will also be sought by the partners.\n\nSupplying TotalEnergies\u2019 Antwerp platform with green hydrogen\n\nIn addition, as part of Air Liquide\u2019s 200 MW ELYgator electrolyzer project located in Maasvlakte (Netherlands), TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 MW to be dedicated to the production of 15,000 tons per year of green hydrogen for the TotalEnergies platform in Antwerp. Under this agreement, TotalEnergies will supply the renewable electrons produced by the OranjeWind project to Air Liquide to be transformed into green hydrogen. The project is expected to be operational by the end of 2027 and will reduce CO 2 emissions at the Antwerp site by up to 150,000 tons per year.\n\n\u201cFollowing the first partnership agreement with Air Liquide to supply the Normandy refinery with green hydrogen, and the agreements to supply the Grandpuits and La M\u00e8de biorefineries with renewable hydrogen, the partnership with Air Liquide takes on a new dimension and marks a new step in TotalEnergies\u2019 ambition to decarbonize the hydrogen consumed by its refineries in Europe by 2030\u201d, said Vincent Stoquart, President, Refining & Chemicals at TotalEnergies. \u201cBy supplying these two electrolyzers with renewable electricity from our offshore wind project in the Netherlands, TotalEnergies is leveraging its positioning as an integrated electricity company.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlagship projects such as the ones we are announcing today, will play a key role in reducing emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and heavy mobility. We are proud to lead the way on European renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production, and to accompany TotalEnergies in their journey to decarbonizing their industrial assets. These two projects will complete the five Air Liquide low carbon units already in operation or construction in Europe. This illustrates our capacity to offer concrete solutions to our customers, to reach our carbon neutrality ambition by 2050, and to support Europe\u2019s leadership ambition towards decarbonized growth. It also demonstrates the ability of Air Liquide to develop solid business models in the energy field of low carbon hydrogen.\u201d said Emilie Mouren-Renouard, member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee, in charge of Europe operations.\n\nTotalEnergies and the decarbonization of its European refineries",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Oil Refinery Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) stands against other best oil refinery stocks to invest in according to analysts.\n\nThe United States of America is the Largest Oil Producing Country in the World with current production reaching record levels, so it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that it is also counted among the Countries with the Largest Refining Capacities. The US had 132 oil refineries with a total capacity of 18.4 million barrels per day (bpd) at the start of 2024, a 2% increase compared with the start of 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now\n\n2024 was a difficult year for the global refining sector as industry players faced a drop in profitability to multi-year lows amid soft consumer and industrial demand (especially in China), slowing economic growth, increasing energy transition, and expanding global refining capacity. The declining fuel margins in the Q4 2024 led to disappointing earnings results for many oil refiners, as a flood of new output competed with stagnating demand. This has led to several oil majors shutting down operations and putting their refineries up for sale, but that is also not going as smoothly as expected.\n\nThings don\u2019t seem to be getting any better either as according to the International Energy Agency\u2019s recent market outlook, growth in the global demand for oil is expected to slow down in the coming years as energy transitions advance, putting downward pressure on prices. The US Energy Information Administration stated last month that it expects Brent crude oil prices to fall 8% to average $74 a barrel in 2025, then fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026, further reducing margins for refiners.\n\nMoreover, despite his repeated calls to ramp up oil production in the country, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada could make things worse for the refining sector. Many refineries in the Midwest depend on Canadian crude and the upcoming 10% tariff will force them to pay either more for their feedstock, or slash production, further squeezing an industry already in decline. The President wants to make America self-sufficient and independent when it comes to energy, but no matter how much oil the United States pumps, its refineries were designed to process the darker, denser, cheaper crude that is hard to find domestically. However, Trump\u2019s plans to roll back support for electric vehicles and charging stations could slow their sales and bolster gasoline demand, offering some respite to the industry.\n\nThe rapid energy transition is also a major cause of concern for the refining sector as governments push drivers toward electric vehicles in pursuit of climate goals. So the only way forward is for the industry to adapt and evolve. Several forward-looking refiners are now boosting their resilience by upgrading their facilities to produce higher-value but lower-carbon products such as petrochemicals and renewable fuels, though it will require significant capital investment.\n\nThe energy sector has witnessed considerable fluctuations over the last few months, surging by over 6% in November before declining around 10% in December. However, the broader energy sector ended last year with a return of just 5.72%, significantly lagging behind gains of 25% by the wider market. Nevertheless, the sector\u2019s performance over the past 3-year and 5-year periods remains strong.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we examined all the companies in the oil refining sector that are listed on NASDAQ and NYSE and then compiled a list of the stocks with the highest upside potential according to Wall Street analysts, as of February 18, 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nTotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)\n\nStock Upside Potential: 12.69%\n\nWith a presence in more than 130 countries around the world, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) is a broad energy company that produces and markets energies on a global scale: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables, and electricity. The company is also actively involved in the refining business and has six refining and petrochemical platforms worldwide.\n\nTotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) displayed a better-than-expected performance in Q4 2024 as higher trading profits in the gas segment helped it offset some of the impact of low oil prices and weak fuel demand. The company reported an adjusted net income of $4.4 billion during the quarter, down 15% YoY but still beating market expectations by $200 million.

This anomaly is something coach Younes Zerdouk intends to fix.\n\nAppointed to lead this promising generation, Zerdouk is no stranger to African football. After a notable stint with the Comoros and Egyptian club Wadi Degla, he now faces a significant challenge: to build a competitive team capable not only of competing with the best nations on the continent but also securing a historic qualification for the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile.\n\nDrawn in a tough Group A with DR Congo, Ghana, Tanzania, and a Central African opponent to be determined, Cote d\u2019Ivoire will need to show character and consistency if they are to go all the way. But Younes Zerdouk remains confident.\n\nIn this interview, the coach reveals his ambitions, his approach to youth football, and the challenges he is about to face.\n\nCote d\u2019Ivoire has been drawn in Group A with DR Congo, Ghana, Tanzania, and the second Central African team. What are your impressions of this group?\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly tough group, but at this level of competition, there are never any easy games. DR Congo and Ghana have teams built for this kind of competition. Ghana has a strong tradition in youth football, as we remember their World Cup title in 2009 with the generation of Andr\u00e9 Ayew. Tanzania has made huge progress in recent years and comes into this competition with positive momentum after their CECAFA U-20 tournament. As for the Central African team that will complete the group, they will undoubtedly have strengths to bring to the table. We know every match will be a battle, and we must be ready to face the challenge.\n\nYou will be playing this competition at home. What does this mean for you?\n\nIt is an honour for Cote d\u2019Ivoire yet another prestigious competition. Playing in front of our fans is an added motivation, but it also brings a responsibility: to perform well, to give our all in every match, and to meet the expectations of the Ivorian people. We know our supporters will be behind us, and we must repay their trust on the field by playing attractive football and achieving good results.\n\nCote d\u2019Ivoire has never won this competition before. What are your ambitions for this edition?\n\nIt\u2019s true that we have a great football tradition but has yet to win this title at the U-20 level. We want to change that. The goal is clear: to go as far as possible. However, we know we won\u2019t be the only ones aiming for this trophy, and we\u2019ll need to be at our best in every match.\n\nWhat have you planned for the preparation of this tournament?\n\nPreparation is a key step to arrive in the best condition for the tournament. We have put together a structured plan based on several areas: assessing the squad, establishing a clear style of play, and fostering team cohesion. We are also working on the physical and mental aspects so that the players can reach their maximum potential on the day of the match. We make sure to leave nothing to chance.\n\nYounes, your face is familiar to African football experts. After coaching the Comoros and Wadi Degla, how will your experience benefit this Ivorian U-20 team?\n\nEvery experience gained is valuable, but the most important thing is to adapt it to the context in which you operate. My time with the Comoros taught me how to work with young players eager to progress, to instil solid principles of play, and to get the best out of each player. At Wadi Degla, I discovered another approach to football, with players performing in a demanding professional environment. Today, with the this team, my role is to use these experiences to build a competitive team capable of performing well at home.\n\nYou\u2019ve gone from coaching professionals to guiding young Ivorian and African football talents. What is your approach?\n\nFootball is the same, whether coaching professionals or young players. What changes is how we convey our message. The U-20s are still in a learning phase, meaning they are receptive and have a lot of room for improvement. My job is to create an environment conducive to their development, focusing on the details that will make a difference at the highest level. Listening, mentoring, and repetition are key to helping them take their game to the next level.\n\nCan you describe your team?\n\nWe have a talented group, with players possessing very interesting technical and physical qualities. Our goal is to highlight our strengths: speed, creativity, and football intelligence. We want a team capable of playing together, of having real chemistry on the field, and of always striving to improve.\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned that one of your goals with the U-20 team is to strengthen the transition to the senior team. What measures have you implemented with the Elephants\u2019 staff?\n\nWe are working closely with the senior team\u2019s staff and the Ivorian Football Federation to ensure continuity between the different categories.

Battistella, my teammate, said that he was suffering on the long climb with the hard pace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in good shape on the last climb. Bahrain tried to attack a lot of times but in the end, I won the sprint with Buitrago.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll try to keep the jersey. I\u2019m really happy for the team and we\u2019ll see tomorrow. It will be another day.\u201d\n\nScaroni now holds the overall race lead heading into a gentler concluding stage to Vence on Sunday. He enjoys a four-second lead on Buitrago while Martinez lies in third at 10 seconds. Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana) and Jarno Widar (Lotto) are in fourth and fifth places at 57 seconds.\n\nHow it unfolded\n\nThe opening stage of the two-part Tour des Alpes-Maritimes et du Var would see the riders tackle a mountainous 162km course between Contes and Gourdon. The first-category climbs of the Col Saint-Roch and Col de Ch\u00e2teauneuf, as well as two ascents of the second-category Gourdon, lay along the route.\n\nAttacks flew from the start of the stage, but it wasn\u2019t until the riders hit the Col Saint-Roch that a breakaway got away. On the way up the 11km climb, Baptiste Veistroffer (Lotto) was joined in a seven-man move by Edoardo Zamperini (Ark\u00e9a-B&B Hotels), Matt\u00e9o Vercher (TotalEnergies), Sergio Meris (Unibet Tietema Rockets), Morn\u00e9 Van Niekerk (Van Rysel-Roubaix), and St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93 pair Dillon Corkery and Kenny Molly.\n\nAs the break jumped clear up the road, EF Education-EasyPost were among the teams who settled in to control the peloton on behalf of their leader Richard Carapaz. The men in pink limited the break\u2019s advantage to 1:30.\n\nCorkery was the first man to drop from the breakaway, letting go on the 6.7km climb of the Col de Ch\u00e2teauneuf as the peloton closed to within a minute of the leaders. They wouldn\u2019t make the catch so early, however, instead letting the six remaining riders build their lead back up to the 1:30 mark.\n\nAs the final 40km \u2013 and the first climb up Gourdon (17.7km at 3.8%) \u2013 began, though, the breakaway was quickly dragged back. By the 35km mark, it was over for the sextet, with EF bringing it all back together at the head of the race.\n\nThe group went over the top of the climb all together, and it would take until the end of the descent, 18km from the finish, for the first major attack to come. Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) made the move, going clear on the downhill and pulling out a small gap before the start of the final ascent (13.9km at 3.9%).\n\nOn the way back uphill, Vendrame pushed on to open up a 20-second gap. He hit the final 10km holding that advantage with EF massed on the front of the slimmed-down peloton in pursuit.\n\nVendrame\u2019s lead wouldn\u2019t last to the top, however. EF dragged him back by the 8km mark, setting up a grand finale among the top climbers of the race. Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious) would be the man to launch that finale, going clear at 6.5km to go.\n\nWith the peloton at that point totally blown apart, the Colombian was chased by groups of riders in ones and twos. His teammate Lenny Martinez was in the second group along with Cristian Scaroni (XDS-Astana), while Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) dropped a little further back to chase alone.\n\nWith Martinez and Scaroni catching Buitrago at 5.5km to go, the Bahrain duo had the numbers to work against the Classic Var winner. Martinez briefly tried a move, though the trio settled in to work together and distance those chasing behind.\n\nThat strong chase group included Carapaz, Guillaume Martin (Groupama-FDJ), Jarno Widar (Lotto), Aur\u00e9lien Paret-Peintre (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana), Joseph Blackmore (Israel-Premier Tech).\n\nMartinez led the way into the final 4km, with the leading trio enjoying a 40-second lead on the chasers heading towards the finish. The Frenchman stuck on the front deep into the final kilometre, setting up a Buitrago vs Scaroni sprint finish.\n\nScaroni launched from second wheel heading into the steep final 100 metres, taking Buitrago with him as the pair shot past Martinez to the line. But despite Bahrain having the numerical advantage, it was Scaroni who had the legs to come through and win.\n\nResults\n\nResults powered by FirstCycling",

The sugarcane is said to be \u2018ethically farmed and sustainably sourced\u2019 to ensure a toxin-free product.\n\nDesigned for rapid biodegradation, the bottles reportedly break down within 90 days in commercial composting facilities. Total Energies Corbion adds that despite their compostability, the bottles are durable enough for multiple reuses.\n\nWin Win Water hopes to reduce the environmental impact of bottled water by using renewable, plant-based materials and supporting initiatives that remove ocean plastic while empowering vulnerable communities.\n\nDerek Atkinson, vice president of Sales at TotalEnergies Corbion, believes that Win Win Water is \u201crevolutionizing sustainable hydration with natural alkaline electrolyte spring water.\u201d He continued: \u201cmore and more water companies are using PLA bottles, contributing to end plastic pollution due to the recyclable and compostable nature of Luminy PLA bioplastics.\u201d\n\nIn related news, last year Bottle Up claimed to provide the first \u2018fully reusable, pre-filled, plant-based water bottle\u2019 sold in the UK. Aiming to become a renewable and recyclable alternative to single-use plastic bottles, the company turns sugar cane from Brazilian grasslands into BPA-free water bottles.\n\nNBCo recently presented its \u2018disappearing\u2019 fibre-based bottle at the 2025 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, intended as a replacement for conventional plastic bottles. Said to be up to 99% recyclable and biodegradable in the natural environment, the solution seeks to conserve resources and minimize strain on waste systems.\n\nIf you liked this story, you might also enjoy:\n\nThe ultimate guide to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation in 2024\n\nHow are the top brands progressing on packaging sustainability?\n\nSustainable Innovation Report 2024: Current trends and future priorities\n\nEverything you need to know about global plastic sustainability regulation",

These projects will cut CO2 emissions from TotalEnergies\u2019 refineries in Belgium and the Netherlands by up to 450,000 tons a year and contribute to the European renewable energy targets in transport.\n\nTotalEnergies and Air Liquide will develop two green hydrogen projects in the Netherlands, producing 45,000 tons annually using renewable power from the OranjeWind offshore wind farm. A 250 MW electrolyser near Zeeland will supply 30,000 tons, while 15,000 tons will come from Air Liquide's ELYgator project. These initiatives aim to cut CO2 emissions by 450,000 tons per year.\n\nGreen hydrogen production by TotalEnergies and Air Liquide\n\nThe two companies have signed an agreement to set up a joint venture, equally held by TotalEnergies (50%) and Air Liquide (50%), which will build and operate a 250 MW electrolyzer near the Zeeland refinery. This project will enable the production of up to 30,000 tons of green hydrogen a year, most of which will be delivered to Zeeland\u2019s platform. The electrolyzer will be commissioned in 2029 and will cut the site\u2019s CO2 emissions by up to 300,000 tons a year. This project represents a global investment of around \u20ac600 million for both partners and has made requests for support under European and national subsidy programs. Project funding will also be sought by the partners.\n\nSupplying TotalEnergies\u2019 Antwerp platform with green hydrogen\n\nIn addition, as part of Air Liquide's 200 MW ELYgator electrolyzer project located in Maasvlakte (Netherlands), TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 MW to be dedicated to the production of 15,000 tons per year of green hydrogen for the TotalEnergies platform in Antwerp. Under this agreement, TotalEnergies will supply the renewable electrons produced by the OranjeWind project to Air Liquide to be transformed into green hydrogen. The project is expected to be operational by the end of 2027 and will reduce CO2 emissions at the Antwerp site by up to 150,000 tons per year.\n\n\u201cFollowing the first partnership agreement with Air Liquide to supply the Normandy refinery with green hydrogen, and the agreements to supply the Grandpuits and La M\u00e8de biorefineries with renewable hydrogen, the partnership with Air Liquide takes on a new dimension and marks a new step in TotalEnergies' ambition to decarbonize the hydrogen consumed by its refineries in Europe by 2030\u201d, said Vincent Stoquart, President, Refining & Chemicals at TotalEnergies. \u201cBy supplying these two electrolyzers with renewable electricity from our offshore wind project in the Netherlands, TotalEnergies is leveraging its positioning as an integrated electricity company.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlagship projects such as the ones we are announcing today, will play a key role in reducing emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and heavy mobility. We are proud to lead the way on European renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production, and to accompany TotalEnergies in their journey to decarbonizing their industrial assets. These two projects will complete the five Air Liquide low carbon units already in operation or construction in Europe. This illustrates our capacity to offer concrete solutions to our customers, to reach our carbon neutrality ambition by 2050, and to support Europe\u2019s leadership ambition towards decarbonized growth. It also demonstrates the ability of Air Liquide to develop solid business models in the energy field of low carbon hydrogen.\u201d said Emilie Mouren-Renouard, member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee, in charge of Europe operations.\n\nTotalEnergies and the decarbonization of its European refineries\n\nTotalEnergies is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of producing, converting and supplying energy to its customers. One of the pathways identified by the Company is using low-carbon hydrogen to decarbonize its European refineries, a move that should help reduce its annual CO2 emissions by around three million tons by 2030. In order to fully decarbonize the hydrogen used in its European refineries, TotalEnergies has already contracted over 170,000 tons of green hydrogen annually at: La M\u00e8de, Grandpuits and Normandy in France, Leuna in Germany and its refineries in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nNote: The headline, insights, and image of this press release may have been refined by the Fibre2Fashion staff; the rest of the content remains unchanged.\n\nFibre2Fashion News Desk (HU)",

Exxon continues to dominate Guyana\u2019s oil industry\n\nNew agreement to explore offshore areas as Guyana diversifies its rapidly growing oil sector\n\nMarianna Parraga and Kemol King, Reuters\n\nGEORGETOWN\n\nEnergiesNet.com 02 21 2025\n\nGuyana expects to soon sign an oil production-sharing agreement with a consortium led by France\u2019s TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA), opens new tab that will allow it to explore an offshore area, Energy Minister Vickram Bharrat told Reuters.\n\nGuyana is the world\u2019s fastest-growing oil-producing country and is on course to reach capacity of 940,000 barrels per day this year \u2013 nearly 1% of global supply \u2013 up from an output of 616,000 bpd last year.\n\nA consortium led by U.S. major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), opens new tab produces all Guyana\u2019s oil. The government, which has sought to diversify the sector, awarded TotalEnergies\u2019s consortium the block in an auction in 2023.\n\nAs well as the agreement with TotalEnergies, at least three other contracts for exploration blocks awarded in that auction should be signed this year, Bharrat said in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference in the capital Georgetown on Wednesday.\n\nGuyana is also exploring options to reoffer an offshore block where a consortium by Toronto-listed Frontera Energy (FEC.TO), opens new tab and CGX Energy (OYL.V), opens new tab made oil discoveries, Bharrat said.\n\nThe Corentyne block was seen as the likely next area for development after Exxon\u2019s success at the Stabroek block, where more than 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources have been found.\n\nFrontera and CGX\u2019s license on Corentyne has expired, according to the government, which did not approve the consortium\u2019s application to extend the license last year.\n\nEarlier this month, the consortium said the government notified them of the license cancellation. The firms have sent a letter disputing the cancellation to the government, Bharrat said, which means the case could go to court.\n\n\u201cWe have been very lenient with CGX, very helpful to them like we are with any company investing in Guyana, but there\u2019s a limit too,\u201d Bharrat said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much we can bend\u2026 without breaking our laws. And there was no legal ground for me to extend (the license),\u201d he added.\n\nFrontera and CGX discovered light oil and condensate in Corentyne in 2022 and 2023, but failed to complete an appraisal of the block in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, Frontera said the company was looking for investors to help finance development of the project. The company has yet to disclose any partners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s both a capacity and a financial problem,\u201d the minister said when asked about the consortium\u2019s struggles to complete the mandatory exploration program. Delays in the delivery of drilling equipment contributed, he added.\n\nFrontera and CGX did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe government could open a bidding round to reoffer the block or negotiate directly with interested parties, Bharrat said.\n\n\u201cOnce it\u2019s completely cleared, I think there will be a lot of companies interested in it,\u201d he said.\n\nCorentyne could still be developed fairly soon, he said, but the Exxon group would continue to dominate Guyana\u2019s oil industry in the coming years.\n\nCONTRACTS TO COME\n\nThe government and the Exxon consortium have yet to agree terms for exploring another area the group won in the 2023 auction, he added.\n\nThe consortium and the government recently reached an agreement on a portion of Stabroek to be returned to the government this year, Bharrat said. The areas are scattered across the block, however, so they might need to be delimited again to be reoffered in the future, he added.\n\nThe government is forecasting average oil output of 675,000 bpd this year versus 616,000 bpd in 2024. Guyana expects to receive one or two cargoes this year as a share of oil produced at Exxon\u2019s fourth floating output facility, which is expected to begin production in the third quarter, the minister said.\n\nGuyana last year became Latin America\u2019s fifth largest crude exporter after Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nReporting by Marianna Parraga and Kemol King; Editing by Simon Webb and Nia Williams\n\n\n\nreuters.com 02 20 2025",

            "content": "TotalEnergies and Air Liquide Commit \u20ac600 Million to Green Hydrogen in the Netherlands\n\nGreen hydrogen is gaining momentum as a powerful clean energy solution, and two major players, TotalEnergies and Air Liquide, are doubling down on its potential. Announcing a joint investment of \u20ac600 million (approximately USD 627 million), the companies aim to develop two large-scale green hydrogen projects in the Netherlands. These efforts will rely on advanced electrolyzer technology and renewable energy to cut carbon emissions significantly\u2014and they couldn\u2019t come at a better time.\n\nA Look at the Technology Behind Green Hydrogen\n\nAt the heart of these projects are electrolysis-based hydrogen production plants. But how does it all work? Simply put, electrolyzers use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. When powered by renewable energy\u2014like wind or solar\u2014the process leaves behind virtually no carbon footprint, making it a standout in the race to combat climate change.\n\nThe Zeeland electrolyzer, one of the projects under this collaboration, will have a 250 MW production capacity and is expected to generate 30,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. Allianz and Air Liquide are banking on Siemens Energy\u2019s advanced electrolyzer technology to make this possible. This technology is optimized for efficiency, maximizing the amount of green hydrogen produced per unit of renewable energy consumed.\n\nThe second project, the Elygator electrolyzer, will be situated at Maasvlakte in Rotterdam. This facility, also with a 250 MW capacity, is anticipated to produce an additional 15,000 tons of green hydrogen annually. It will be powered by renewable electricity from TotalEnergies\u2019 offshore OranjeWind project. Together, these two electrolyzers have the potential to cut a whopping 450,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually.\n\nWhy This is a Game-Changer\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why green hydrogen is getting so much attention, it\u2019s because of its unique versatility. Hydrogen isn\u2019t just a clean fuel\u2014it\u2019s a tool that can tackle emissions in sectors that are traditionally hard to decarbonize. Industrial refineries like those operated by TotalEnergies fall squarely into this category. Hydrogen is already heavily used in refining, and replacing conventional hydrogen (produced from fossil fuels) with green hydrogen can substantially lower the overall carbon footprint.\n\nFor TotalEnergies, the investment aligns with its larger goal of decarbonizing the hydrogen used across its European refineries by 2030. Currently, the company\u2019s refineries emit around 3 million tons of CO2 annually, but projects like these aim to drive that number down significantly.\n\nOn a broader scale, the initiative fits neatly into Europe\u2019s renewable energy goals, as outlined under the European Green Deal. According to research from Wood Mackenzie, hydrogen demand is predicted to surge in the years ahead, growing by over 50% by 2050. This collaboration between TotalEnergies and Air Liquide positions both companies as leaders in Europe\u2019s hydrogen transition\u2014a win for the environment, industry, and energy security.\n\nRecent Developments from the Partners\n\nThis is not the first time TotalEnergies and Air Liquide have joined forces. Previous partnerships saw them developing green hydrogen facilities in France\u2019s Normandy region, along with other projects in Belgium and Germany. Currently, TotalEnergies has over 170,000 tons of green hydrogen capacity under its belt, distributed across refineries in key European locations.\n\nFor Air Liquide, this marks another chapter in its growing portfolio of low-carbon hydrogen solutions. The company already operates\u2014or has under construction\u2014five low-carbon hydrogen facilities across Europe, with this latest venture in the Netherlands set to expand that reach even further.\n\nBeyond hydrogen, TotalEnergies has been making headlines for its renewable energy activities. For example, the OranjeWind offshore wind farm\u2014which will help power these hydrogen projects\u2014is part of its joint venture with German company RWE. Offshore wind is another pillar of the energy transition that TotalEnergies has been aggressively pursuing, with installations planned across Europe, Asia, and the United States.\n\nTimelines and Next Steps\n\nTimeframes for these projects are ambitious but achievable. The Elygator electrolyzer in Rotterdam is slated to begin operations as early as 2027, while the Zeeland electrolyzer is expected to go live in 2029. The companies have also applied for European and national subsidies to support development and further accelerate timelines.\n\nWith these projects underway, the tangible impacts\u2014like reduced carbon emissions and increased hydrogen availability\u2014are just a few years out.",

            "content": "The lawsuit filed in May 2024 by three non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and eight individuals against TotalEnergies was dismissed on February 7, 2025, by the Paris judicial court. The plaintiffs, supported by the NGOs Bloom, Alliance Sant\u00e9 Plan\u00e9taire, and Nuestro Futuro, accused the French oil giant of contributing to climate change and its fatal impacts on humanity and the environment. The infractions mentioned in the lawsuit included involuntary manslaughter and harm to biodiversity.\n\nThe public prosecutor justified the decision by citing a lack of concrete evidence establishing a direct link between the company\u2019s activities and the severe climatic events that allegedly caused deaths. In particular, the notion of causality between greenhouse gas emissions from TotalEnergies and natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, or storms was deemed too complex to result in a conviction. The prosecutor also noted that while greenhouse gas emissions are indeed harmful, they do not constitute an illegal activity per se.\n\nThis lawsuit targeted not only TotalEnergies but also several of its shareholders, such as BlackRock and Norges Bank, as well as its executives, including CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9. The plaintiffs, hailing from various countries including France, Pakistan, Greece, and Australia, claimed to have been victims of natural disasters exacerbated by climate change. They had sought recognition as victims to pursue criminal proceedings.\n\nDismissal Sparks Reactions\n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s decision immediately provoked reactions from the plaintiff NGOs. Aymeric Thillaye du Boullay, head of litigation at the NGO Bloom, lamented the \u201cimpotence of the French criminal justice system\u201d in the face of major oil companies. He cited a \u201cdisconnection between legal criteria and the realities of climate change,\u201d calling for a reform of the legal framework to better address the challenges posed by greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn response, TotalEnergies stated that it took note of the decision, emphasizing that it would continue its commitment to energy transition. The group, the fourth largest oil and gas player in the world, continues to allocate a significant portion of its investments to fossil fuels while seeking to diversify into low-carbon energy, particularly through wind and solar projects.\n\nA Context of Multiple Legal Actions\n\nThis lawsuit is part of a series of ongoing legal actions against TotalEnergies, particularly in France, where the company is also accused of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d and \u201cclimaticide.\u201d The company is regularly criticized by environmental defenders, who believe its green transition efforts are insufficient.\n\nThe oil and gas sector, one of the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, remains at the center of increasing debates regarding its responsibility for global warming. Future judicial decisions concerning TotalEnergies and other major players in this sector could have significant implications for how large companies manage their environmental impact.",

            "content": "TotalEnergies and Air Liquide have partnered to advance green hydrogen production in Europe. Their goal is to reduce carbon emissions in key industries and heavy transport.\n\nThis deal includes two large projects that will supply clean hydrogen to refineries and other industrial users. Companies want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy. This will help Europe switch to cleaner energy sources.\n\nVincent Stoquart, President, Refining & Chemicals at TotalEnergies, remarked on this deal, saying:\n\n\u201c\u2026the partnership with Air Liquide takes on a new dimension and marks a new step in TotalEnergies\u2019 ambition to decarbonize the hydrogen consumed by its refineries in Europe by 2030.\u201d\n\nThe Game-Changing Projects: ELYgator and Zeeland Electrolyzer\n\nThe first project, called ELYgator, is a 200MW electrolyzer built by Air Liquide in Maasvlakte, Rotterdam. This facility will make 23,000 tons of renewable hydrogen each year. It will supply TotalEnergies\u2019 industrial sites and other customers.\n\nThe project will use electricity from offshore wind farms and is expected to avoid up to 500,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually. The Dutch government and the EU\u2019s Innovation Fund have funded this initiative. If everything goes as planned, the ELYgator plant will start operating by the end of 2027.\n\nThe second project is a 250MW electrolyzer developed through a 50/50 joint venture between TotalEnergies and Air Liquide. Located in Zeeland, Netherlands, this facility aims to produce 30,000 tons of renewable hydrogen annually.\n\nIt will mainly supply TotalEnergies\u2019 Zeeland refinery. This will help cut carbon emissions in refining. The project should be up and running by 2029. It will use electricity from the OranjeWind offshore wind farm and TotalEnergies has a 50% stake in this farm.\n\nWhy Green Hydrogen? The Climate Hero Europe Needs\n\n\n\nGreen hydrogen comes from renewable electricity and water. It is created without releasing carbon emissions. It is different from gray hydrogen, which is made using fossil fuels and releases large amounts of CO2.\n\nGreen hydrogen is key to cutting carbon emissions in industries such as refining, chemicals, and steelmaking. In these sectors, direct electrification isn\u2019t always an option.\n\nHere\u2019s how green hydrogen helps:\n\nReduces CO2 Emissions : It replaces fossil fuel-based hydrogen in industrial processes.\n\nSupports Clean Transport : It can be used in fuel cells for trucks , ships, and trains.\n\nfuel cells Stores Renewable Energy : Hydrogen stores extra electricity from : Hydrogen stores extra electricity from wind and solar farms. It provides energy when needed.\n\nEnhances Energy Security : Countries can produce hydrogen locally, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels.\n\nFrom Refineries to Roads: A Cleaner Future for Heavy Industry\n\n\n\nThese projects will help decarbonize TotalEnergies\u2019 refineries in Belgium and the Netherlands. The company estimates that using green hydrogen in these facilities will cut CO2 emissions by 450,000 tons per year.\n\nAir Liquide will use its hydrogen pipeline network to deliver hydrogen. This will help industrial customers and heavy-duty transport users in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nHeavy industries and transportation are some of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. These new hydrogen projects will play a critical role in making these sectors more sustainable. Focusing on heavy-duty mobility, like hydrogen-powered trucks and buses, will cut transport emissions. Transport is a major pollution source in Europe.\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 Bold Push for Net-Zero by 2050\n\nTotalEnergies is working toward reducing its CO2 emissions by 3 million tons per year by 2030. The company is moving away from fossil fuels. It focuses on cleaner energy sources like wind, solar, and green hydrogen. It has signed deals to produce 170,000 tons of green hydrogen each year. This will supply refineries in France, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\n\nTotalEnergies is investing $100 million in sustainable forestry. This project will cover 300,000 hectares across 10 U.S. states. The initiative, in partnership with Anew Climate and Aurora Sustainable Lands, seeks to protect forests. It will also reduce timber harvesting and improve carbon sequestration.\n\nThe carbon credits generated will help offset Scope 1 and 2 emissions after 2030, supporting the company\u2019s broader net-zero goals.\n\nTotalEnergies has committed to cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 2015 levels. It is also investing in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and e-fuels, aiming to potentially avoid up to 100 million tons of CO2 annually.\n\nThe CO2 Fighters Squad is a key group behind these reductions. They focus on tracking emissions, boosting energy efficiency, and speeding up facility electrification.\n\nBy integrating offshore wind power into hydrogen production and investing in nature-based solutions, TotalEnergies is positioning itself as a leader in the clean energy sector. Its investments align with the European Union\u2019s goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAir Liquide\u2019s Role in Green Hydrogen Development\n\nAir Liquide is a global leader in hydrogen production and distribution. It has invested in low-carbon and renewable hydrogen solutions, which support industrial customers. The company already operates five low-carbon hydrogen plants in Europe and plans to expand its hydrogen network.\n\nAir Liquide\u2019s expertise in electrolyzer technology, developed in partnership with Siemens Energy, ensures efficient and large-scale hydrogen production. The company thinks flagship projects like ELYgator and the Zeeland electrolyzer will boost the hydrogen economy. They will also help industries reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nA Major Step for the Future\n\nTotalEnergies and Air Liquide are partnering to help decarbonize European industries. These projects will produce a lot of green hydrogen from offshore wind energy. This will help cut emissions, support clean transport, and create a sustainable energy future.\n\nAs demand for green hydrogen increases, partnerships like this will help speed up the shift to cleaner industries and a low-carbon economy. With the ELYgator and Zeeland projects set to come online in the coming years, Europe is taking a major step toward its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.",

            "content": "For years, residents of the coastal village of Djeno in the Republic of Congo have complained of hydrocarbon pollution and the effects of gas flaring on their health.\n\nTotalEnergies EP Congo (TEPC), a subsidiary of the French oil giant, has had its contract to manage the Djeno terminal renewed, despite evidence of remaining pollution from half a century of operations.\n\nThe environment ministry has prohibited toxic gas emissions, as well as the discharge of polluting substances, into marine and continental waters.\n\nIn a statement, TEPC said it had taken steps to mitigate pollution in the area, adding that industrial activities by other companies had also contributed to the situation. See All Key Ideas\n\nAfter hours spent at sea, fisherman Guy Bayonne Balou and his crew return to the southern shore of the Republic of Congo with their catch. The crew carry their pirogue, a small canoe, to the beach beside the Bouloumouka mangrove; inside the canoe are a handful of fish. Was it a good catch? \u201cNo,\u201d Balou replies with a chuckle.\n\nThe residents of the fishing village of Djeno point to a range of factors that have decreased their yield, including climate change, but talk soon turns to pollution and the nearby oil terminal, operated by a subsidiary of French oil giant TotalEnergies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encroaching on the fish\u2019s natural breeding ground,\u201d Balou says. \u201cWhere they could feed and reproduce, there\u2019s this pollution. The fish can no longer live in that environment, they\u2019re forced to go and live elsewhere.\u201d\n\nSince 1972, Djeno has been home to the country\u2019s largest oil terminal, from where most of the oil extracted in the country is produced. TotalEnergies EP Congo (TEPC), previously known as Elf Congo, is the main owner and operator.\n\nIn 2020, the concession contract came to an end, and the terminal became the property of the Congolese state. Management rights were renegotiated, and TotalEnergies was awarded the lion\u2019s share for the next 20 years for the modest rent of $1.5 million per month. TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 told AFP at the time that the company would work \u201cin good faith\u201d with the authorities.\n\nYet according to the terminal\u2019s 2016 Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), shared with Mongabay and Mediapart by French accountability platform Climate Whistleblowers, since the 1990s more than 96,000 liters (25,360 gallons) of crude oil have leaked from the terminal into the nearby Loubi lagoon and along the coastal mangroves.\n\nCrude oil is highly toxic to marine ecosystems. It can kill fish, birds and marine mammals, and damage sensitive ecosystems.\n\nBiodiversity at risk\n\nThe Djeno terminal is located in the Cayo-Loufoualeba wetlands, a biodiverse region that was declared a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention in 2007. It\u2019s a haven for hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and 378 species of birds. Two species of sea turtle, the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), both classified as vulnerable to extinction, lay their eggs on the beaches here.\n\nAccording to the BAP, which has not previously been reported, the \u201caccidental hydrocarbon pollution\u201d from the terminal has had a \u201cmajor\u201d impact on coastal habitats and turtles, while there have been \u201cvery strong\u201d impacts from \u201cchronic hydrocarbon pollution of process water.\u201d\n\nTo remedy the situation, the company planned to install a \u201chydrocarbon retention coil in the Loubi lagoon\u201d and to improve its water treatment network.\n\nThe 2016 BAP also states that \u201cclean-up operations were carried out in 2003 following the discharge of hydrocarbons into the lagoon\u201d, but no clean-up action was planned in 2007. The last decontamination operation took place in 2011 and lasted three months. Actions to clean up the lagoon had to be halted in 2011 due to \u201ctensions between young people from two Djeno neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nThe BAP specifies that, at the time of its publication, \u201cthe significance of the current impact of accidental runoff pollution on the Loubi lagoon remains major.\u201d\n\nA published commitment by Pouyann\u00e9 states that a BAP in a Ramsar zone \u201cis designed to achieve a Net Gain in Biodiversity certified by a third-party institution.\u201d As a signatory to the Act4Nature charter, TotalEnergies agreed to take measures to avoid, reduce and compensate for the environmental impacts of a project, with the aim of \u201cno net loss of biodiversity, or even a net gain.\u201d\n\nYet the BAP doesn\u2019t contain a complete list of local plant and animal species in the area, admitting \u201cthere has not been a faunal inventory as such on the Djeno site\u201d. Instead, the 2016 document focuses on the Loubi lagoon and its threatened and protected species. Many species are therefore overlooked in the plans.\n\nIn a statement to Mongabay, TEPC said the 2016 BAP was valid until 2021. It added that another BAP was created, covering the period 2023-2028, which took \u201caccount of the ecosystem services provided by the lagoon\u201d, without providing a copy of the document for verification.\n\nThis limited focus is a common problem with such plans, Brian Padilla, an ecologist at the French National Museum of Natural History, told Mongabay.\n\n\u201cWhen consultancies try to carry out an initial inventory of biodiversity, they often base themselves almost exclusively on a very restricted list of species. The consultants will look first and foremost at those species that are going to be protected, because the project owner is thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to have a regulatory consequence, so I have to do something.\u2019 And in the end, the proportion of biodiversity that is actually assessed is not representative of how ecosystems function, it merely represents the legal risks that the project owner thinks his project will incur,\u201d he said.\n\nQuestions over neutrality\n\nThe situation at Djeno outraged a former employee of Biotope, the consultancy that TotalEnergies contracted to produce the BAP. For security reasons he preferred to remain anonymous.\n\n\u201cEthically speaking, working at Biotope made me realize that there were things that weren\u2019t right. Talking about it around me, I quickly realized that it was quite common, almost normal, and I didn\u2019t understand why it was normal. The world of consultancy is just as guilty of destroying biodiversity,\u201d he said.\n\nBiotope did not respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nWhen this former employee was working for the company, he said, he discovered connections between the firm\u2019s design office and its contractor that he considered unethical.\n\n\u201cIt was not a neutral commercial relationship. They passed on information internally. There\u2019s a benefit in keeping things that way.\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the pitch document for the BAP that Mongabay obtained from Climate Whistleblowers, Biotope quoted TotalEnergies 97,380 euros (about $100,000) including tax, a large sum for a company with declared working capital of 18,832 euros (about $19,300).\n\nIn the 2015 bid document, the Biotope consultant states that its report will conclude with \u201cvalidation by Total,\u201d suggesting that TotalEnergies would have the final review of the suggested measures, raising questions over the independence of the report.\n\nBiotope was previously criticized by a group of naturalists in 2014 in connection with its involvement in a planned airport in France.\n\nPadilla, the ecologist, said such consultancies are simply governed by the \u201claw of the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an obvious form of subordination between a project owner and his consultancy firm,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a call for tenders and the client puts the consultancies out to tender and they look at them and say, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to spend so much money on my impact study, what can you do for me?\u2019\n\n\u201cIn the end, the client will go for the one that can sell him the most comprehensive study for the least amount of money, and this inevitably leads to a deterioration in the quality of the impact study, because whoever says they can get results with the least amount of data will be put forward, whereas they will often weaken their study.\u201d\n\nLegal battle\n\nAccording to an Amnesty International report published in 2024, in 2016 the Association Jeunesse pour la Vie du Kouilou (AJVK), a local NGO, filed a legal complaint against TEPC.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, the court ruled that the company was responsible for pollution and ordered it to pay damages and resume the clean-up of the Loubi lagoon,\u201d the report states. According to Amnesty, locals in Djeno don\u2019t consider the company\u2019s cleanup operations sufficient.\n\nAlain Pratt, a fisherman and member of AJVK, said that after winning the case, members of the local community understood TotalEnergies was ordered to completely clean up the area by 2025. But only two months later the company claimed to have completed remediation.\n\n\u201cIt only lasted two months. Two months instead of five years. They removed just the most conspicuous parts, but since no one from the government comes here, nothing has been done since 2019, so we don\u2019t talk about it anymore,\u201d Pratt said.\n\nOther fishers in the region who spoke to Mongabay were similarly unimpressed by TotalEnergies\u2019 efforts.\n\nEfferole Mabiala, a 58-year-old fisherman, has worked in the Loubi lagoon, which borders Djeno and is used as a waste runoff reservoir by TEPC, since he was a child. \u201cWe\u2019re fed up with Total. We asked Total to completely clean up this lagoon, but to this day, there are still impacts,\u201d he told Mongabay.\n\nMongabay asked TEPC about the request. In an email they said that the government had created a committee under the oil and gas ministry in 2018 that was charged with cleaning up the lagoon, though it could not share the details as the government had not made them public.\n\nAccording to a statement from the committee, following testing of the water, \u201cthe lagoon is no longer polluted\u201d.\n\nIn 2022, the authorities stated that TotalEnergies had carried out the cleanup according to \u201cthe rules of the game.\u201d\n\nTesting the waters\n\nMongabay visited Djeno in August to investigate the claims that TEPC had mitigated the effects of its pollution in the region.\n\nThe Loubi lagoon appears relatively clean at first glance, but the floor of the lagoon is carpeted in small black pellets.\n\nPlacide Kaya, environmental and social assessment expert for Eco Durable Sarlu, a company that makes environmental assessments, said that when the temperature rises, the pellets melt, adding more oil to the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThis disturbs the lagoon\u2019s biodiversity. Oil pollution can have an impact on the pH [level] of the water. These oils have a very high hydrogen potential, so when they melt, they start to disrupt the physical state of the water,\u201d Kaya said.\n\nThe pellets are also visible at the nearby Djeno beach. Under the supervision of a qualified scientist, Mongabay collected a soil sample and had it analyzed by an independent laboratory under Dutch pollutant standards (a set of environmental standards used internationally).\n\nThe analysis found that \u201cresidual levels of this pollution are still very low,\u201d adding that as the Loubi lagoon is connected to the ocean, the pollution found could be connected to \u201ca polluting slick from the ocean entering the Loubi during a high tide. It\u2019s unlikely but not impossible. But it could also come from the terminal\u2019s waste water.\u201d\n\nThe main pollution indicators, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are either below detection limits or within acceptable standards, according to the scientist.\n\nWhile the findings show that the area doesn\u2019t meet the threshold of the Dutch pollutant standards that would require further cleanup operations, this doesn\u2019t mean the pollution that was found has had a marginal impact on biodiversity.\n\nEven low levels of hydrocarbon pollution may negatively affect sensitive species such as clams and oysters, while oil that drifts into the mangroves can affect their growth.\n\n\u201cSo you have these oils that stick around the mangrove roots and clog them up. So it disrupts the growth of these trees, and the oysters clinging to the roots dry up and die,\u201d said Kaya, the environmental and social assessment expert.\n\nMangrove forests in tropical and subtropical zones serve as a boundary between land and sea. The intertwined stilt roots of mangrove trees can grow on soil with high concentrations of salt. These and other coastal ecosystems like wetlands and seagrasses store more carbon than traditional forests, according to U.S. scientific and environmental agencies. Their roots serve as nurseries for various marine species, so their degradation also has an impact on the quantity of fish to be found in the open ocean.\n\n\u201cOn the surface of the water you\u2019ll see this oil there. The fish doesn\u2019t grow and it doesn\u2019t taste the same. It smells like crude oil,\u201d said Mabiala, the fisherman, who added his children often complain of stomach aches and diarrhea after eating fish caught in the area.\n\nAuditing the site\n\nFor years, Brice Mackosso, permanent secretary of the Justice and Peace Commission, an NGO based in the coastal city of Pointe-Noire, has been fighting to have the pollution around the Djeno terminal recognized and for TotalEnergies to further clean the region.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t prove that the pollution comes from Total. We often hear the scientific argument. We need proof and we don\u2019t have any \u2026 It\u2019s impossible to exploit oil without polluting. But we need to carry out water and soil analyses to see,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are numerous other industrial sites in the region including a gas power station, the production of rebars, fishing equipment warehousing, logging, and the processing and marketing of lumber and its derivatives, which could also have an impact on the pollution levels.\n\nIn October 2021, the Republic of Congo\u2019s General Directorate for the Environment validated a certificate of conformity for \u201can environmental and health audit report carried out by an independent firm.\u201d But if such an audit was carried out, the findings aren\u2019t publicly available.\n\nAbdoulaye Diarra, a researcher with Amnesty International who authored the human rights NGO\u2019s Djeno report last year, said the regional environment agency had told him further water quality tests had found \u201cno problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government always presents itself as being one step ahead on environmental issues, but at the same time, they benefit greatly from underdocumenting any violations that may occur, whether at the terminal or elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is glossed over.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental impact studies are nowhere to be found,\u201d he added. \u201cWe asked to consult them. We\u2019ve been told, \u2018No, that\u2019s not possible,\u2019 for reasons that we don\u2019t think are convincing. This goes against the right to information, not only for the population but also for all those who work on environmental issues.\u201d\n\nFlaring\n\nAnother threat to biodiversity mentioned in Djeno\u2019s BAP is flaring, the process of burning off unwanted gas during oil extraction. According to the World Bank, the Republic of Congo released an estimated 1.67 billion cubic meters (59 billion cubic feet) of gas in 2023, a steady increase since 1996.\n\nTo assess the level of flaring in the area, Mongabay partnered with a consortium of journalists from Mediapart and Domani to review satellite data supplied by the Group on Earth Observation of the Payne Institute for Public Policy and the environmental NGO SkyTruth.\n\nWe were able to estimate that from 2012 to 2022, emissions from Djeno\u2019s flares have risen from around 100,000 metric tons of CO2 in 2012 to 220,000 metric tons in 2022, roughly equivalent to 110,000 cars being driven in France for a year.\n\nHowever, not everything can be attributed to the Djeno terminal. On our visit to the site, we observed four flares, two at the oil terminal itself and two at the Djeno gas power plant. According to local residents, the flares have burned continuously for more than 20 years.\n\nFlaring releases numerous polluting components into the atmosphere. Among them, one can find fine particulates, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide and black carbon, which, at high levels or with continuous exposure, have been linked to serious health impacts.\n\nOn the approach into Pointe-Noire, the rotten-eggs smell of the flaring becomes overpowering, leaving a strong taste in the mouth and causing dizziness.\n\n\u201cIn the course of a day, you can smell a wave coming three, four times,\u201d said Pratt, the fisherman. \u201cEven grandchildren aged 7 or 8 are already familiar with the smell, and even a child aged 2 or 3 will say, \u2018That doesn\u2019t smell good, it stinks.\u2019 Then it goes away for a while, then it comes back.\u201d\n\nAn audit of environmental illnesses carried out on the coast of Pointe-Noire in 2006 showed that Djeno has high rates of cancer, dermatoses and lung diseases, which may be caused by air and water pollution.\n\nJean-Louis Pecho, a former TotalEnergies employee, experienced those symptoms. \u201cI worked as a cleaner at the terminal from August 1, 1990, to 1998. I had protective equipment, but when I took it off, the smells persisted. Today, I have a lung problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re tired, we want doctors to come and tell us what\u2019s wrong. And Total doesn\u2019t take medical expenses into account.\u201d\n\nPratt said these illnesses are still widespread, but due to a lack of medical services, they aren\u2019t taken seriously.\n\n\u201cWe have no medical followup. So we\u2019re sick people who don\u2019t know we\u2019re sick. You\u2019re going to suffer from headaches, you\u2019re going to go to a dispensary where they\u2019re going to do a test, and that\u2019s where they\u2019ll find you with spots on your lungs. H2S is toxic to the body,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2024, just a few weeks after we met, Alain Pratt passed away. He died of a heart attack, according to those close to him.\n\nFlaring is also a major source of the greenhouse gases CO2 and methane, which contribute to global warming. It also has an impact on biodiversity. Other toxic substances found in the gas produced by flaring, such as nitrogen oxide, react with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain, which, according to the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), can remove \u201cminerals and nutrients from the soil that trees need to grow.\u201d\n\nSince 2004, TotalEnergies has been a member of the World Bank\u2019s Global Gas Flaring Reduction program, which brings together governments and private companies with the aim of limiting flaring and its environmental impacts. TEPC states on its website, \u201cSeveral initiatives are planned and key projects have already been launched to reduce flaring, notably at our offshore facilities and at the Djeno oil terminal. The aim is to eliminate routine flaring by 2025.\u201d The company does not specify how this goal will be achieved.\n\nTEPC said in a statement that the company \u201chas pledged to cease routine flaring completely by 2030,\u201d though it did not elaborate on the details of these plans. It added: \u201cConcretely, across the whole Company, methane emissions from our operated facilities fell by 15% in 2024, year on year, thanks largely to the continued reduction of flaring and fugitive emissions in Exploration & Production facilities, and by 55% compared to our 2020 baseline, allowing us to achieve our target one year faster than planned.\u201d\n\nHowever, the effects of flaring are scarcely mentioned in the 2016 BAP, other than as visual pollution for turtles.\n\nThe Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Hydrocarbons did not respond to Mongabay\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nIn January 2024, the environment minister issued a memo prohibiting the emission of pollutants of any kind, including smoke, dust and toxic gases, in any \u201cindustrial establishment.\u201d\n\nAnother circular issued the same month bans the discharge of polluting substances into marine and continental waters that are likely to harm human health and marine life. Yet at Djeno, the flares are still burning.\n\nBanner image: Total Energies Plant in Djeno. Behind one can see the smoke rising from the flares.

Now, we need to find a little more performance. A suspension-focused Joker will be deployed starting from Qatar.\"\n\nDuring the off-season, the Peugeot TotalEnergies Team continued developing the PEUGEOT 9X8 with two test sessions. \"A long endurance session at the Castellet, which allowed us to work on reliability and confirmed the significant progress made in this area\", confirms Olivier Jansonnie, Technical Director of Peugeot Sport. \"We also had a test day in Qatar in January with two cars, which was very instructive for us, as the PEUGEOT 9X8 2024 version hadn\u2019t been updated at this track last year. Losail is a unique circuit.\"\n\nThe Losail International Circuit (5.418 km, 16 corners) is flat, with very little elevation, which favors cars with good aerodynamics at a very low ride height. \"But the curbs still require the car not to be set too low\", points out Olivier Jansonnie. \"There is a compromise to find in the setup. Other factors must also be considered, like the large temperature variation between the start at 2:00 p.m. and the finish\u2014around midnight\u2014which affects race strategies, tire changes, etc.\"\n\nA year ago, the PEUGEOT 9X8 #93 led the 1812 km of Qatar for 37 laps and was in second place after\u2026 1807 kilometers! \"Apart from this mistake so close to the end, the race went pretty well for us last year. That doesn\u2019t mean it will work out the same way this year, as the car and the circumstances are different\", warns Olivier Jansonnie.\n\n\" What we hope for this season is that our performance level will allow us to compete with the best and take advantage of opportunities to aim for the top steps of the podium. The goal is to be in a position to fight for the podium at every race, starting with Qatar. It\u2019s ambitious because the FIA WEC Championship is extremely competitive. We are living in a golden age of endurance racing. We are lucky to experience this. It\u2019s very exciting and highly motivating for the teams, but the spots are hard to get, very hard...\"\n\nThe 13th season of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) will begin with an official Prologue at the Losail International Circuit (February 21-22). After three Free Practice sessions, Qualifying, and Hyperpole, the 1812 km of Qatar will start on Friday, February 28 at 14:00 local time (12h00 CET UTC+1, 11h00 GMT).).\n\nJean-Eric Vergne (PEUGEOT 9X8 #93) \"Losail is one of the circuits that suits us the best with its very smooth surface, long fast corners, and plenty of straights that offer many overtaking opportunities. I love this layout, and it worked well for Peugeot last year until the end of the race. We hope to be just as competitive this year. We\u2019ve done a lot of testing during the off-season to continue developing the car and work on small details that can make a difference. I\u2019m excited for the season to start, and on the #93, I\u2019m reuniting with Mikkel and Paul, my teammates from 2023.\"\n\nMalthe Jakobsen (PEUGEOT 9X8 #94) \"Since the Rookies Tests in Bahrain last November, I\u2019ve competed in the Asian Le Mans Series, the 24 Hours of Daytona, and also participated in PEUGEOT 9X8 development sessions. It was during this time that I discovered the Losail circuit. It\u2019s a very flat track with fast corners and very little tire degradation. The team had a great race in Qatar last year, and I hope we can achieve a good result this season. It will be my first race with the Peugeot TotalEnergies team and my teammates on the #94, Stoffel and Lo\u00efc, who are very experienced. I have a lot to learn from them.\"\n\nFind all the latest news about Peugeot Sport on its website (www.peugeot-sport.com) and on the\n\nfollowing platforms:\n\nTwitter : @peugeotsport\n\nFacebook : @peugeot.sport\n\nInstagram : @peugeotsportofficial\n\nYouTube: Peugeot Sport Official\n\nDiscover our videos of the 2024 season : https://www.youtube.com/@peugeotsportofficial\n\nMedia site / Photos / Video: https://www.media.stellantis.com/em-en/peugeot-sport\n\nContacts Media Peugeot Sport WEC :\n\nCharles Coutaz / charles.coutaz@external.stellantis.com / +33684115722\n\nSonya d\u2019Artois / sonya.dartois@external.stellantis.com / +33627816828",

            "content": "Among oil and gas majors, TotalEnergies stands alone in its plans to shift a fifth of its business to renewable-led integrated power by 2030. It\u2019s a tightrope walk for the company\u2019s long-time CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9\u2014essentially a strategy that\u2019s not \u201cenough oil and gas\u201d for traditional investors nor \u201cenough renewables\u201d for green ones. But after a decade in charge, the Frenchman is thinking about his legacy and remains confident his is a no-regret strategy that fosters innovation, has raised employee morale, and targets returns on an integrated-clean-power equivalent to what oil delivers through the price cycle.\n\nAppointed after the tragic death of his predecessor in a plane crash, Pouyann\u00e9 has led the business through turbulent times for the sector, including the decarbonization commitments in the Paris Agreement, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. While he counsels leaders to expect the unexpected, he has no doubt that the energy of the 21st century is electrons. He argues for both carbon prices and net-zero ambitions but also says the transition needs to be gradual, pragmatic, and affordable to bring society along.\n\nPouyann\u00e9 recently spoke with Sandra Sancier-Sultan, a McKinsey senior partner, at TotalEnergies\u2019 Paris headquarters. The discussion provides an important and timely perspective on the broader energy transition and its implications. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: Today we\u2019re seeing a slowdown in the energy transition\u2014not in the commitments, but in the actual projects. What\u2019s your view of this change?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: What I see\u2014and I\u2019m a little surprised by it\u2014is that for some people, having more pragmatism means backtracking on their commitments. But to me, pragmatism doesn\u2019t mean renouncing the ambition. I don\u2019t want to renounce the aspiration that TotalEnergies could achieve net zero by 2050, together with society, because it\u2019s a big motivator for our employees and our strategy.\n\nBut there are challenges to reaching that goal, like we see today with the slowdown in electric-vehicle [EV] adoption in the US. What the US decides will be fundamental to the pace of the transition everywhere. Europe may go faster, but in other big markets of the world\u2014China, India, South America\u2014the transition won\u2019t go faster than in the US.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing a backlash to going too far in the net-zero-above-everything approach, so we need to rebalance. That\u2019s why I\u2019m insisting that the targets we set for 2030 are pragmatic ones: reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and continuing to grow via renewables. I don\u2019t know if collectively we will be able to reach the COP28 [28th UN Climate Change Conference] target of tripling renewables, but it\u2019s a bold objective. If we can make 2.5 times, we\u2019re not yet on the trajectory to reach the 1.5\u00b0 target, but at least we will have made strong progress.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: In your view, what are the major misconceptions people have about the energy transition?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: In 2015, when the Paris Agreement was signed, the target was well below 2\u00b0\u2014if possible, 1.5\u00b0, which meant carbon neutrality around 2070. Then in 2017 or 2018, scientists said if you want to reach 1.5\u00b0, you need carbon neutrality in 2050. This was a huge acceleration. Immediately, a sense of urgency arose, and it ignored that a transition means gradual changes. Instead, it led to the belief that we could transform the energy system overnight.\n\nThe change in target also led to the idea that we need to urgently go to the ultimate solutions\u2014that we need EVs and e-fuels tomorrow morning instead of having some time for gradual solutions, like more fuel-efficient internal combustion engine cars. Suddenly we want the perfect solution, as if tomorrow morning we will be in 2050. But perfect solutions are expensive. We need to bring them to customers and society gradually. For example, we\u2019re working with the marine industry to use liquefied natural gas [LNG] as marine fuel. It\u2019s not the ultimate solution, but it decreases emissions by 20 percent. During the past five years, we lost time talking about e-methanol and ammonia, which are a perfect, final solution but aren\u2019t available now, because they\u2019re expensive. Now the marine industry is coming back to LNG, which is good for 15 years, giving us time to develop better solutions.\n\nSuddenly we want the perfect solution, as if tomorrow morning we will be in 2050. But perfect solutions are expensive.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: So you want to keep the ambition but be pragmatic about the way to reach it?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: Yes. We won\u2019t make this transition if we forget that the fundamental characteristic of energy is affordability, because it\u2019s central to everybody\u2019s lives and to economic development. If we don\u2019t find a path for affordable energy, emerging countries won\u2019t accept it. And it\u2019s one of the difficulties for Europe, as well, which is the only continent where we have a significant price on carbon. And the desynchronization on carbon price with the other regions of the world has become a real problem for European competitiveness.\n\nI signed the 2015 call for a carbon price. It\u2019s good for the climate because it\u2019s the right signal to influence economic choices; I\u2019m absolutely convinced. But ten years on, Europeans haven\u2019t convinced other big countries about carbon pricing. And in the new geopolitical context, this is a major question for Europe: Are we going too far? Should we be more pragmatic?\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: What about China\u2019s carbon price?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: It\u2019s still low, and China will not change it quickly but gradually\u2014it\u2019s pragmatic. It\u2019s ahead today in many low-carbon technologies because in 2010, when the price of oil reached $100, its bill was exploding. As the largest oil importer, China was fundamentally thinking of affordability but also of its own security of supply.\n\nChina was a strong believer in solar, wind, and batteries. It developed them very quickly, much earlier than the others. China has been super at driving costs down\u2014which the rest of the world benefits from today. But it didn\u2019t do it with a real carbon price but by driving its own technologies to be affordable. Today its EVs are the best, but it also has too much renewable energy and can\u2019t cope with the intermittency. So it\u2019s reintroducing a carbon price, but I\u2019m sure it will keep the price at a level where it remains competitive with the US and the rest of the world.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: Early in your tenure as CEO, you made a choice to expand the company from oil and gas to a multi-energy strategy that includes electricity. You talked about this as \u201cwalking a tightrope.\u201d What do you mean when you say this?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: We\u2019re a successful oil and gas company. We restructured our portfolio to reach a $25 per barrel breakeven and have the highest profitability of the oil majors. At the same time, we observed the energy transition all around us, with society pressuring us to contribute to the new energy world. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but we\u2019ve done it for several reasons.\n\nThe first is that, historically, we were an energy supply company. Our strategy was to supply more oil and gas, knowing the market would buy it. Suddenly in 2015, a new realization came to us: Maybe we were wrong. Maybe oil demand won\u2019t continue to grow proportionately to the population. So we needed to look at demand. And when we did so, there were many different scenarios. But in all of them, electricity was growing. There\u2019s no doubt that the energy of the 21st century is electrons. Our strategy is led by demand planning, not just by supply capacities. We then considered if we could find a way to use our fossil fuel skills to develop an integrated electricity business. We decided yes, it made sense.\n\nThere were many different scenarios [for oil and gas demand]. But in all of them, electricity was growing. There\u2019s no doubt that the energy of the 21st century is electrons.\n\nThe other motivation was our people. In 2018, when the net-zero debate arose, I was having lunch one day with some young drillers. They asked me, \u201cWhat will I become in ten years?\u201d For me, it was obvious: They would drill. But for them, it wasn\u2019t obvious. I realized we will have an issue if our own people, who are proud of the company and whose motivation is our best asset, begin to ask this question. So one key factor in our decision to move to the multi-energy strategy was to give our people a positive answer. And it\u2019s working. In our surveys this year, 92 percent of our employees are proud of the company and are convinced that the strategy is right and that it will succeed. That\u2019s much higher than ever before.\n\nWe\u2019re walking a tightrope at TotalEnergies. The people who tell us we should only do oil and gas aren\u2019t happy with us, because we invest 30 percent in renewables and electricity. And other people say to us, \u201cYou continue to put two-thirds into oil and gas; you aren\u2019t good citizens for the planet. Why not put more in renewables?\u201d So today, we think we\u2019re doing well because we\u2019re building a strong renewable-integrated-power business that delivers good profits. But it\u2019s not enough for one, and it\u2019s too much for the other.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m sticking to the strategy, even as some of my peers backtrack. Consistency of strategy in such a fast-changing environment is the best answer because the energy business is a long-term business. I\u2019m convinced that by 2030, these electrons will represent nearly 20 percent of our mix. It\u2019s a sizable transformation for us.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: What fuels that conviction when you have stakeholders who question it?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: It\u2019s a no-regret strategy, and the board is unanimously supportive. Having said that, we face reality, too; we check our progress quarter after quarter. For me, it\u2019s a no-regret decision, and the motivation it creates for our people confirms it. It would have been more comfortable to remain an oil-and-gas-only company even if we had to face criticism. But I thought that if we didn\u2019t make that decision, our successors would regret it.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s a no-regret decision. . . . It would have been more comfortable to remain an oil-and-gas-only company even if we had to face criticism. But I thought that if we didn\u2019t make that decision, our successors would regret it.\n\nAs a CEO, you also think about your legacy. I\u2019m number ten in the series of CEOs of TotalEnergies over 100 years. I said to myself, \u201cIf you don\u2019t move in this electricity segment, it will be difficult to catch up. With all that we\u2019re doing this decade, we will learn, we will spend some money, and we will build teams and competencies. And yes, it will produce a legacy that will be different, and to be a little different from the others is also to differentiate in terms of business model. So why not?\u201d\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: The topic of the energy transition is very politically charged. You have been challenged a number of times, especially in your own country. How do you navigate this? What\u2019s your \u201ctrue north\u201d?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: My true north is clear: It\u2019s the interest of the company. When you become CEO, your life is driven fundamentally by the interests of the company, not personal interests. There\u2019s a lot of politics and criticism. Yes, I\u2019m frustrated by it. And strangely, it\u2019s in my home country that we\u2019re most criticized. It can have an impact on my children, sometimes, but not on me. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t question myself regularly. But if it\u2019s what I believe is good for the company, I have to stick with it. That\u2019s just part of the job.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: You\u2019ve told the media that your main competitors don\u2019t like to take risk, so you do. What do you need to do as a leader to take that risk?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: It\u2019s boldness. I\u2019m not a poker player, to be clear. I\u2019m quite rational. But being too cautious is also not best for the future of the company. Again, my driver is: Will taking that risk be good for the company or not? It\u2019s not an emotional decision, it\u2019s intuition. But the intuition is also based on my experience, not on emotion.\n\nWe faced a lot of criticism when the war in Ukraine started because we didn\u2019t immediately declare that we would leave Russia. But the company had $15 billion of assets in Russia. Emotionally, I could have said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave,\u201d but it was in the interest of the company to take a little more time. I was quite heavily criticized in the newspapers at the time.\n\nMy team spent the summer of 2022 in a big exercise evaluating what we would do if we didn\u2019t have assets in Russia. Part of the answer was in the diversification to electricity; another part was to invest more in the US. I said to my team, \u201cThe US has oil, gas, LNG, and renewables. So let\u2019s redeploy the capital we were planning to spend in Russia and put it in the US instead.\u201d We found a new road map for the company, and then the momentum came back. In the US today, we\u2019re the largest LNG exporter and one of the top five renewable companies.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: You\u2019ve communicated a very strong ambition for electricity: over 100 terawatt hours with a return on average capital employed [ROACE] of 12 percent\u2014much higher than established utilities. What gives you the conviction that you will be able to get to that level of profitability?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: First, the idea that oil is more profitable than electrons is true at $80 per barrel, but it\u2019s not true at $50 or $60. At $50 or $60, we\u2019re doing 10 percent\u2014maybe 12 percent\u2014ROACE. So this is where our target for electricity is coming from. I want this integrated-power business to be as profitable as oil and gas at $50 to $60. Why $50 or $60? When you take the average of the cycles, you will find that the average price of oil is around $50 to $60 per barrel. Of course, at $80, it\u2019s a bonanza. There\u2019s more upside in profits of oil and gas today, but I\u2019m not sure that will be the case in 2040.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s not renewables; it\u2019s integrated power. An energy product needs to be reliable. Renewables aren\u2019t reliable; they\u2019re intermittent. So we\u2019re developing flexible assets, as well, with gas-fired power plants and batteries. And why are we doing that? Because our customers want firm power, but they want it with more green electrons. And when we add in some trading\u2014because the more intermittent sources in the electricity system, the more there are imbalances\u2014we can create additional value. And our strong balance sheet allows us to take merchant risk and sanction renewable projects with a different model from the competition. Our integrated-power business is really delivering: Today we make a 10 percent ROACE. That 10 percent could become 12 percent when we have some scale, better understand the business, and develop more integration.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: How are you going to do all that? How do you think about the balance between using your historical skills from oil and gas and getting in some new skills?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: That\u2019s a major question. In the beginning, we were betting on people from outside by buying smaller renewable developers. We had some success, but they weren\u2019t really thinking the way we wanted them to think. They came with their experience of renewable infrastructure, and we wanted to build an integrated-power play. So I also took some of our best talent from our oil and gas business and transferred them into this new integrated-power business because they knew the company. And it worked.\n\nThe clear management lesson I drew is that, in this time of diversification, you can bring in external talent, but you also have the question of culture. If you want the new business to be a success, you must also transfer some of your strong people from your core business into the new activities to be able to overcome difficulties and move faster. Maybe they didn\u2019t know electricity, but they learned, and we learned with them. It was quicker to make some decisions because of the trust we had built up with them.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: In parallel to that big transition, you also have high ambitions for innovation in your core business. How do you foster that innovative spirit?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: The climate challenge gave me a path to innovate\u2014to say to my colleagues in oil and gas, \u201cYour mission will be to produce oil and gas but differently, with much lower emissions.\u201d We told them, \u201cThere\u2019s another KPI that\u2019s as important as production; it\u2019s emission reduction.\u201d This has created a lot of innovation in the company. I went to a production unit in Angola, and the engineers told me it was difficult balancing production and emission reduction because higher production meant flaring more gas. But they said they eventually found ways to produce with technologies that reduced flaring.\n\nI\u2019m convinced AI and digital tools will be at the core of the next wave of efficiency in the energy world. We set up a 300-person digital factory in the company to keep this innovative mindset.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: CEOs with a decade in charge are quite rare. What have you learned over the years?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: I came young into the job. At the beginning, it was suddenly very different to be number one compared with number two or three. What\u2019s fundamentally different is that everybody is looking to you permanently. I made some mistakes during the first few months because I didn\u2019t realize I was no longer \u201cnormal\u201d in the eyes of my colleagues.\n\nIn 2015, we faced some hard times because the price of oil dropped dramatically. Our breakeven was above $80 per barrel, and we had to reduce it to $25. It was a huge effort to convince my colleagues of that. You discover that you have to convince people; it\u2019s not a given. It\u2019s not because you are the CEO that they will follow you. You have to show them step by step. Of course, it\u2019s also very important to have strong unity at the top of the company, but that doesn\u2019t mean everybody has to be like you. Diversity is also good.\n\nYear after year, I see what works and what doesn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t correct everything, but I think I\u2019m a better CEO today than I was at the beginning.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: Can you tell us a bit more about how you bring your people along with you?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: People look to you as the CEO because, in the end, the CEO will decide. But at the same time, your decision is the result of exchanges with others. You need to be a sponge: to listen and to create debate. Then you can make better decisions, people will follow you, and the execution will be in the right direction.\n\nSandra Sancier-Sultan: What\u2019s the biggest challenge you see for TotalEnergies in the years to come?\n\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9: We have to be ready to face the unexpected. At the end of 2021, I thought, \u201cWe\u2019ve overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. Life will be easier.\u201d Oil prices were coming back. And then the war in Ukraine happened. 2022 was probably one of the most complex years for our company\u2014even more than 2020. We\u2019re in a world where, unfortunately, we see more and more volatility. We have to be ready for the unexpected.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m optimistic because I\u2019m very lucky to be at the helm of a company that has huge capacities and can absorb shocks. I feel we\u2019re ready to face the unexpected.\n\nMcKinsey Quarterly 60th birthday\n\nWe are celebrating the 60th birthday of the McKinsey Quarterly with a yearlong campaign featuring four issues on major themes related to the future of business and society, as well as related interactives, collections from the magazine\u2019s archives, and more.

(Photo: TotalEnergies)\n\nTotalEnergies and Air Liquide announced on Feb. 18 that they will invest \u20ac600 million (about USD 627 million) to produce green hydrogen in the Netherlands using offshore wind energy. The project is expected to generate 45,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, reducing 450,000 tons of carbon emissions for refineries.\n\nTotalEnergies supplies offshore wind power for hydrogen production\n\nTo meet its European hydrogen decarbonization target for refineries by 2030, TotalEnergies and Air Liquide will jointly invest in two green hydrogen development projects in the Netherlands.\n\nOne of the projects involves forming a 50/50 joint venture to build an electrolyzer with a capacity of 250 MW near the Zeeland refinery, which is expected to begin operations in 2029. This facility will produce 30,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, helping the refinery cut 300,000 tons of carbon emissions.\n\nThe second project involves Air Liquide\u2019s Elygator electrolyzer development in Rotterdam. TotalEnergies will supply renewable energy generated by its OranjeWind offshore wind farm, with green hydrogen produced for use at a refinery platform in Antwerp, Belgium. Set to be operational by the end of 2027, the project will provide TotalEnergies with 15,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, reducing 150,000 tons of carbon emissions at the plant.\n\nAir Liquide\u2019s statement noted that the electrolyzer technology used in both projects was developed in partnership with Siemens Energy. The Elygator electrolyzer, which Air Liquide operates, has a total capacity of 250 MW. The green hydrogen produced will also be supplied to European manufacturers and heavy vehicle industries.\n\nTotalEnergies and Air Liquide will jointly invest in two green hydrogen development projects in the Netherlands. (Image: TotalEnergies)\n\nGreen hydrogen: Key to decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries\n\nVincent Stoquart, President of TotalEnergies\u2019 Refining and Chemicals, emphasized that this is not the companies' first green hydrogen collaboration. \"By supplying these two electrolyzers with renewable electricity from our offshore wind project in the Netherlands, TotalEnergies is leveraging its positioning as an integrated electricity company.\"\n\nAs part of the hard-to-abate sector, TotalEnergies' European refineries emit approximately 3 million tons of CO2 annually. In recent years, the company has been actively adopting low-carbon hydrogen to reduce emissions. It has signed green hydrogen supply contracts in France, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with an annual production capacity of over 170,000 tons.\n\nAccording to data from energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the refining industry is a major consumer of hydrogen, accounting for over 30% of global hydrogen demand. With the global decarbonization trend, low-carbon hydrogen demand in the refining industry is expected to grow by more than 50% by 2050, reaching 50 million tons annually, potentially reducing carbon emissions by up to 35%.\n\nSource: Total Energies, Air Liquide, Wood Mackenzie",

            "content": "Air Liquide recently announced two electrolyzer projects for the large-scale production of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen in Europe. The first project, ELYgator, is a 200 MW electrolyzer located in Maasvlakte (Rotterdam). The second project, still under study, would have a capacity of 250 MW and be located in the province of Zeeland (The Netherlands) as part of a joint venture between Air Liquide and TotalEnergies. \u00c9milie Mouren-Renouard, Group Vice President overseeing Air Liquide\u2019s operations in Europe, Africa, Middle-East, and India and a member of the Executive Committee, explains.\n\nWhat do these renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production projects involve?\n\nThe first, called the ELYgator project, represents a new milestone in the development of very large-capacity electrolyzers, following the Normand\u2019Hy project in France. It is expected to significantly increase the Group's renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production capacity, this time for the Netherlands and neighboring countries. With its 200 MW capacity, it will supply TotalEnergies' industrial platform under a long-term contract, while also serving customers in the industrial and heavy mobility sectors in the region.\n\nAdded to this is the planned creation of a joint venture, owned equally by Air Liquide and TotalEnergies, to develop another 250 MW electrolyzer in the province of Zeeland, in the Netherlands, to supply the TotalEnergies refinery.\n\nOnce completed, these two projects would represent a combined investment of more than one billion euros! Located in key industrial basins, these new large-scale electrolyzers will make a very tangible contribution to the energy transition in Europe.\n\nI must say that I am particularly proud of the work done by the teams \u2013 from all parts of Air Liquide \u2013 on these projects. Developing electrolyzers of this scale is a major technological challenge! And we are meeting it thanks to our more than 60 years of hydrogen expertise and our ability to secure a supply of renewable electricity.\n\nHow do these projects play a key role in Europe's decarbonization?\n\nThese two flagship projects would help avoid up to 500,000 tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent emissions per year, primarily in the Netherlands, but also in Belgium and beyond. This is a concrete step \u2013 a significant step \u2013 toward a low-carbon society, fully aligned with our goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nWith these initiatives, we are demonstrating that industrial decarbonization is indeed in motion, despite what some voices might claim today, and that serious projects continue to move forward. It is also a strong way to reaffirm our commitment to the energy transition and to reinforce our position as a technology leader in this field, with no fewer than seven low-carbon hydrogen projects in Europe alone.\n\nContributing to low-carbon growth is, for us, far more than just a target on paper: it\u2019s an ambition we pursue with conviction and determination, drawing on our portfolio of technological solutions. It is also a collective journey, made possible through strategic collaborations, notably with TotalEnergies, a long-standing customer of the Group, and Siemens Energy, a key technology partner. For these two projects, Air Liquide will rely on proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer modules developed within its joint venture with Siemens Energy.\n\nHow do you view the collaboration between Air Liquide and TotalEnergies?\n\nI am convinced that by joining forces, we will succeed in decarbonizing industry and heavy mobility. It is exactly in this spirit that Air Liquide and TotalEnergies are collaborating: TotalEnergies will provide part of the renewable energy needed for the electrolysis process, while Air Liquide \u30fc which already operates electrolyzers in Canada (B\u00e9cancour) and Germany (Trailblazer) and is currently building one in France (Normand'Hy) \u30fc will develop the two future production units. TotalEnergies will then integrate the renewable, low-carbon hydrogen produced into its industrial activities.\n\nThis partnership is a perfect example of how we can meet the challenge of the energy transition together! Air Liquide, through its ADVANCE strategic plan for sustainable growth, is committed to supporting its customers in the realization of their decarbonization projects.",

The project is expected to be operational by the end of 2027 and will reduce CO 2 emissions at the Antwerp site by up to 150,000 tons per year.\n\n\u201cFollowing the first partnership agreement with Air Liquide to supply the Normandy refinery with green hydrogen, and the agreements to supply the Grandpuits and La M\u00e8de biorefineries with renewable hydrogen, the partnership with Air Liquide takes on a new dimension and marks a new step in TotalEnergies' ambition to decarbonize the hydrogen consumed by its refineries in Europe by 2030\u201d, said Vincent Stoquart, President, Refining & Chemicals at TotalEnergies. \u201cBy supplying these two electrolyzers with renewable electricity from our offshore wind project in the Netherlands, TotalEnergies is leveraging its positioning as an integrated electricity company.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlagship projects such as the ones we are announcing today, will play a key role in reducing emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and heavy mobility. We are proud to lead the way on European renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production, and to accompany TotalEnergies in their journey to decarbonizing their industrial assets. These two projects will complete the five Air Liquide low carbon units already in operation or construction in Europe. This illustrates our capacity to offer concrete solutions to our customers, to reach our carbon neutrality ambition by 2050, and to support Europe\u2019s leadership ambition towards decarbonized growth. It also demonstrates the ability of Air Liquide to develop solid business models in the energy field of low carbon hydrogen.\u201d said Emilie Mouren-Renouard, member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee, in charge of Europe operations.\n\nTotalEnergies and the decarbonization of its European refineries\n\nTotalEnergies is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of producing, converting and supplying energy to its customers. One of the pathways identified by the Company is using low-carbon hydrogen to decarbonize its European refineries, a move that should help reduce its annual CO 2 emissions by around three million tons by 2030. In order to fully decarbonize the hydrogen used in its European refineries, TotalEnergies has already contracted over 170,000 tons of green hydrogen annually at: La M\u00e8de, Grandpuits and Normandy in France, Leuna in Germany and its refineries in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\n***",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) stands against the other cheap high dividend stocks.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, the global economy in 2025 is expected to face some tough challenges, with growth forecasts looking modest \u2013 the US GDP at 2.0%, the Eurozone at 0.9%, and China at 4.2%. Inflation may persist due to higher fiscal spending and potential tariff hikes, which could limit central banks' ability to lower interest rates. This could in turn lead to more market volatility. Productivity has been growing slowly, and in some cases, it has even declined, affecting long-term living standards. However, AI and new technologies could help drive productivity higher, though it will take time to see noticeable results.\n\nDespite these challenges, 2025 will be about navigating turbulent times, with a clear gap between the high-tech, high-productivity US economy and Europe, which is lagging behind. Policy focus is shifting from monetary to fiscal, with China taking the lead on new initiatives. Stocks, especially in the United States, remain a strong opportunity for growth, while European equities offer potential despite economic struggles.\n\nIn Q4 2024, S&P Global reported that US domestic stocks saw a net dividend increase of $11.7 billion, which was lower than the $13.7 billion increase in the same quarter last year. Overall, dividend increases totaled $14.2 billion for the quarter, which was down from $17.5 billion in Q4 2023. For the entire year, dividends grew by $53.3 billion, a significant jump from the previous year's $36.5 billion. On a per-share basis, the broader market's dividends hit a record, growing by 6% to $19.81 per share. In Q4 last year, there were 635 dividend increases, which is a 10.2% decrease compared to the 707 increases in Q4 2023.\n\nOver the past 12 months, total dividend increases amounted to $71.4 billion, up from $65.1 billion in the previous year. Interestingly, the number of companies cutting dividends decreased by 19.5% in Q4, with only 33 companies lowering their payouts, compared to 41 the year before. Here, we discuss some of the best cheap high dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out stocks with dividend yields over 3% and P/E ratios under 15. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in ascending order of the dividend yield as of February 17. We have also mentioned the P/E ratios and hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024.",

TotalEnergies said that the projects will cut CO2 emissions from its refineries in Belgium and the Netherlands by up to 450,000 tons a year, while contributing to European renewable energy targets in transport.\n\nThe agreement, TotalEnergies said, is in line with its efforts to decarbonize the hydrogen used in its European refineries. TotalEnergies has set a goal to achieve a 40% reduction in net Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions linked directly to its oil and gas operations by 2030. As part of these efforts, the company has stated that it wants to replace 500,000 tons per year of the hydrogen consumed in its refineries with green hydrogen by 2030, which it anticipates could help reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 5 million tonnes annually.\n\nEmilie Mouren-Renouard, member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee, in charge of Europe operations, said:\n\n\u201cFlagship projects such as the ones we are announcing today, will play a key role in reducing emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and heavy mobility.

This project will enable the production of up to 30,000 tons of green hydrogen a year, most of which will be delivered to Zeeland\u2019s platform, TotalEnergies said. The projects will cost each partner approximately \u20ac600 million, and they have made requests for support under European and national subsidy programs. Project funding will also be sought by the partners, the companies said.\n\nIn addition, TotalEnergies has signed an agreement for 130 MW from Air Liquide\u2019s 200 MW ELYgator electrolyzer project, located in Maasvlakte (Netherlands), to be used to supply the TotalEnergies platform in Antwerp. In addition, TotalEnergies will supply renewable electrons produced by the OranjeWind project to Air Liquide to be transformed into green hydrogen. The project is expected to be operational by the end of 2027 and will reduce CO2 emissions at the Antwerp site by up to 150,000 tons per year.\n\nThe power used to produce the hydrogen for the projects will be largely generated at the OranjeWind wind farm, located off the Dutch coast and developed by TotalEnergies with German energy firm RWE.\n\nTotalEnergies and Air Liquide have several agreements behind them. In 2024, the two companies announced the launch of TEAL Mobility, a joint venture aimed at accelerating the development of a hydrogen network for heavy duty trucks across major European corridors. Under the agreement, over 100 hydrogen stations will be opened throughout Europe over the next decade operating under the TotalEnergies brand. TotalEnergies has also contracted for supply of over 170,000 tons of green hydrogen annually at its refineries in La M\u00e8de, Grandpuits and Normandy in France, Leuna in Germany, as well as its refineries in Belgium and the Netherlands, part of which is supplied by Air Liquide.\n\nVincent Stoquart, President, Refining & Chemicals at TotalEnergies, said:",

            "content": "TotalEnergies strengthens Tier one partnerships\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 green hydrogen drive is firmly underway as it steps up efforts to decarbonise its refineries.\n\nIn 2023 it launched a call for tenders to secure a supply of 500,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year from 2030 to supply its European refineries.\n\nLast summer, it signed a 15-year agreement with Air Products for the annual supply in Europe of 70,000 tonnes of green hydrogen starting in 2030.\n\nRead more: Air Products and TotalEnergies signs major green hydrogen supply deal\n\nAnd now it has announced a major deal with Air Liquide.\n\nThe ELYgator project, a 200MW (megawatt) electrolyser in Rotterdam, will produce up to 23,000 tonnes of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen per year from 2027, powered by offshore wind. The second project, a 250MW electrolyser in Zeeland, will produce up to 30,000 tonnes annually under similar conditions from 2029.\n\nRead more: Air Liquide and TotalEnergies invest \u20ac1bn in Dutch green hydrogen\n\nIt\u2019s not the first agreement between the two companies \u2013 they joined forces last November to produce renewable hydrogen, at La M\u00e8de in southeast France \u2013 but it signals that their relationship is switching gears.\n\nWith an annual capacity of 25,000 tonnes, coproducts will be recycled from TotalEnergies\u2019 biorefinery. The hydrogen will then be used to produce biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nTotalEnergies is also continuing the development, with partner ENGIE, of the Masshylia project of green hydrogen production by water electrolysis with a capacity of 10,000 tonnes per year, to contribute to the decarbonisation of both the biorefinery and local customers at the Fos-Berre industrial-port zone.\n\nLike many hard-to-abate sectors, traditional oil refineries and integrated energy companies are facing up to the challenges of addressing Paris commitments and reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (which account for about 25-30% of global emissions).\n\nThis is particularly complex for an industrial process whose bread and butter includes converting crude oil into refined transport fuels, such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and fuel oil.\n\nReplacing fossil fuels in combustion applications to generate heat and steam could create a larger market for low-carbon hydrogen in refining. In this segment, the potential market for low-carbon hydrogen could be up to 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2050, according to Wood Mackenzie.\n\nBut as with other sectors, green hydrogen needs to achieve a much lower cost to compete in combustion sector than that required to compete with on-purpose hydrogen. The cost of hydrogen is important to refiners, as it accounts for 10-25% of a refinery\u2019s variable operating expenditure.\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 decisive moves in Europe in recent months contrast with the policy uncertainty surrounding the US, where President Trump has made it clear fossil fuel development will be the priority over clean energy development. The EU aims to produce 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen annually by 2030 and import another 10 million tonnes to help decarbonise heavy industry and transport across the bloc.\n\nNearly all hydrogen consumed in the US today is produced with fossil fuels and used by industry for refining petroleum, producing fertiliser and chemicals, treating metals and processing foods.\n\nThere have been high-profile moves to develop hydrogen, through the Hydrogen Hubs, although they made little reference to deploying clean hydrogen at refineries.\n\n\u201cSome actors in the oil and gas complex are deeply opposed to alternative energy sources in the interest of sustaining demand for their own products. Others go so far as to assert that climate change is a myth. These hydrocarbon hardliners will seek to slow the shift to clean hydrogen at refineries,\u201d notes an Atlantic Council paper.\n\n\u201cWhile clean hydrogen uptake at refineries will likely accelerate due to funding from the infrastructure law as well as from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the DOE\u2019s award suggests that the complex political economy of clean hydrogen at refineries may constrain its uptake.\u201d\n\nWhile Asia is increasingly exploring the use of green hydrogen in various sectors, its current usage in refineries is still relatively limited, with most hydrogen produced using fossil fuels (grey hydrogen) and only a very small percentage coming from renewable sources.",

We are fine with the group that we have, and we will be able to prepare ourselves and play to our best\u201d said a confident Mdaka.\n\nSouth Africa will be making their ninth TotalEnergies CAF U-20 AFCON appearance with not only the aim of lifting the title, but being amongst the top four finishers who will gain automatic qualification to the FIFA U-20 World Cup Chile 2025 set to take place in September this year.",

This new deal underscores TotalEnergies' leadership in the LNG domain and commitment to India\u2019s energy transition and security of supply,\u201d Gregory Joffroy, TotalEnergies Senior Vice President for LNG, said.\n\n\u201cThis agreement marks a major step towards reinforcing GSPC\u2019s strategy to secure competitive LNG on a long-term basis, helping to bridge the growing natural gas demand-supply deficit in Gujarat and across India. Partnering with TotalEnergies, one of the largest LNG players in the world, aligns with GSPC\u2019s strategy to build up its long-term portfolio and become a leading Indian player in gas trading\u201d, Milind Torawane, GSPC Managing Director said.\n\n\u201cThis deal will further strengthen GSPC\u2019s portfolio and its operations in the gas value chain, leveraging GSPC Group\u2019s transmission and distribution infrastructure,\u201d Torawane added.\n\nAccording to the release, GSPC, one of the largest gas trading companies in India, is involved in the entire gas value chain, including LNG terminals, gas transmission, gas distribution and power generation. In Gujarat, GSPC and its group companies supply one-third of the natural gas demand in the state, serving 2.3 million households and 20,000 industrial and commercial clients, as well as operating over 800 CNG stations.\n\nRenewable PPA Signed in France\n\nLast month, TotalEnergies signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) to supply renewable electricity to STMicroelectronics sites in France.\n\nTotalEnergies will provide the global semiconductor firm with renewable power produced by two wind and solar farms of 75 megawatts (MW) it operates. The contract, which started in January and has a length of 15 years, represents an overall volume of 1.5 terrawatt-hours, the company said in an earlier statement.\n\n\"We are delighted to sign this agreement with STMicroelectronics, which demonstrates our ability to provide long-term and innovative clean firm power solutions tailored to our customers' needs,\" Sophie Chevalier, TotalEnergies Senior Vice President for Flexible Power, said. \"TotalEnergies aims to be a preferred partner to support tech industry players towards their decarbonization efforts, and this agreement showcases our commitment and capabilities\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis first PPA in France marks yet another important step towards ST\u2019s goal of becoming carbon neutral in its operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and partially scope 3) by 2027, including the sourcing of 100% renewable energy by 2027,\u201d Geoff West, STMicroelectronics EVP and Chief Procurement Officer, said. \u201cPPAs will play a major role in our transition, and we have already signed several to support ST\u2019s operations in Italy and Malaysia. Starting in 2025, this PPA with TotalEnergies will provide a significant level of renewable energy for ST\u2019s operations in France, which includes R&D [research and development], design, sales and marketing and large-volume chip manufacturing\u201d.\n\nTo contact the author, email rocky.teodoro@rigzone.com",

The Belgian from Cofidis was surprisingly too strong for Max Kanter (XDS Astana) and Emilien Jeanni\u00e8re (TotalEnergies). Top favorite Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) fell behind and finished fourth.\n\nEdition 38, with 189.1 kilometers. Traditionally, a race has a difficult first part but a less hilly second part. It was no surprise that many fast men were at the start, with the skills to survive a climb. No Visma | Lease a Bike to defend Kooij's title, but Q36.5 did have 2023 winner Matteo Moschetti at the start. Arnaud De Lie (Lotto), Alberto Dainese (Tudor), and Bryan Coquard (Cofidis) were also present.\n\nThe hilly first part of the race could lend itself well to a team that would benefit from a tough race, but the teams appeared more than willing to gamble on their fast men. This allowed five riders to break away, of which three would remain: Belgian Victor Vercouille (Flanders-Baloise) was joined by Spaniards Ibai Azanza (Equipo Kern Pharma) and Joan Albert Riera (Illes Balears Arabay). This made for a relatively easy day for the sprinters' teams.\n\nRead more below the photos!\n\nSprinters' teams catch leading group, sprint imminent\n\nThe sprinters' teams let the trio struggle for as long as possible; the peloton controlled everything. Q36.5 Pro Cycling, Ark\u00e9a-B&B Hotels, and TotalEnergies kept the gap to a minimum. On the local circuit, in the last 25 kilometers, the peloton caught up to the leading group, and we could soon prepare for a sprint. The Italian man from Moschetti's team initiated the sprint while De Lie and his men waited for their chance.\n\nLotto took the lead in the last kilometer, but it was hectic. Astana and TotalEnergies mixed it up in the finale, which was full of traffic islands and roundabouts. In the end, Kanter got a perfect lead-out from teammate Gleb Syritsa, but he had to start his sprint a little too early. Fretin emerged from his wheel and easily held off the oncoming De Lie.\n\nResults Clasica de Almeria 2025\n\nResults powered by FirstCycling.com",

            "content": "American Amanda Anisimova effectively neutralised Jelena Ostapenko\u2019s fire-power with a 6-4 6-3 win in the Qatar TotalEnergies Open final to claim her maiden WTA 1000 title, and a rise to a career-high ranking of World No 18 on Monday.\n\nI think that I've been able to really execute well from my backhand side. But also I've been working a lot on my forehand, which I think that I've also had a lot of winners on. I think I'm really trying to develop my game as a whole, try to come into the net more, and use my serve to my advantage. I think my whole game is actually coming together, and, yes, I still try to go for my backhand line when I can. Amanda Anisimova\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing,\u201d Anisimova told the press after her win. \u201cIt\u2019s been such an incredible week here. I think every match has been very tough. I\u2019m just super happy with my performances and my level here, and to be able to get my first 1000 title is really special to me.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s title is the American\u2019s first since 2022, and the first Doha title for any American woman since Monica Seles in 2002, and it comes after an injury-ridden early 2024, just a year-and-a-half after she took a break due to burnout to protect her mental health.\n\n\u201cTo be able to lift the trophy here for my first WTA 1000 is super special,\u201d the American said in the presentation ceremony. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it without my team. I love you guys. Without you this wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of hard work, a lot of tears, a lot of good moments. I think, with tennis you experience it all, but that\u2019s also why I love it.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of challenges the last few weeks, and I\u2019m very proud of myself, and happy with how I\u2019ve dealt with them. It\u2019s been an incredible week on top of that.\u201d\n\nIn the first Doha final to feature two players ranked outside the Top 30, it was the former World No 21, Anisimova, who prevailed in a big-hitting battle that lasted an hour and 21 minutes of on-court action, along with two short rain delays on a drizzly day.\n\nRanked 213 a year ago, Anisimova reached her first career WTA 1000 final last summer in Toronto, and has now gone one better this week.\n\nCurrently ranked 41 in the world, the American now finds herself on the brink of her Top 20 debut.\n\nAnisimova collected her 3rd career WTA singles title, and her first since Melbourne Summer Set #2 in 2022.\n\nIt has been a difficult road for the 23-year old, who, at the end of 2023, was ranked outside the world\u2019s Top 350 due to ending her season in the spring of that year to protect her mental health.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really been struggling with my mental health and burnout since the summer of 2022,\u201d Anismova wrote at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s become unbearable being at tennis tournaments. At this point, my priority is my mental well-being and taking a break for some time. I\u2019ve worked as hard as I could to push through it.\n\n\u201cI will miss being out there, and I appreciate all the continuous support.\u201d\n\nAnisimova had a meteoric rise to the top of women\u2019s tennis, reaching the semi-finals of Roland Garros in 2019 as a 17-year-old, but, tragically, she lost her father and coach Konstantin just a few months later.\n\n\u00a9 Mohamed Farag/Getty Images\n\nSaturday\u2019s opening set saw the two power players trading breaks to 3-3, duelling forehand winners on break points and testing each other out.\n\nIt was Anisimova who finally moved ahead, firing a backhand return winner to lead 5-4, aided by Ostapenko, who coughed up multiple double-faults in a game for the second time in the set.\n\nAnisimova coolly served out the one-set lead, striking an error-forcing forehand on her first set point.\n\nThe American deployed 10 winners to the Latvian\u2019s 9 in the opener, while Ostapenko was undone by her 19 unforced errors, including 5 double-faults.\n\nOstapenko\u2019s game was mis-firing in a manner that was absent in her demolition of World No 2 Iga Swiatek on Friday, but when her missiles did find their targets on the court she proved equally lethal.\n\nWhile they were evenly matched up until a 20-minute rain delay at 3-3, deuce, Anisimova returned and neutralised the Latvian\u2019s game sufficiently to reel in the final 3 games and claim her biggest title thus far.\n\n\u201cIt was actually quite stressful, especially with the rain, at 3-3,\u201d Anisimova said. \u201cI was trying to stay focused.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much that either of us could do with the conditions. But I think that game was super important, and I\u2019m happy that it went my way because, as you said, it was a very challenging moment in the match.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Karim Jaafar/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnisimova\u2019s return game, particularly off her backhand wing, proved the critical difference between the two, as the American won 20 of Ostapenko\u2019s 29 second-service points, helping her amass 12 break points on the day, and converting 5 of them, which was enough for the straight-sets win.\n\n\u201cI think that I\u2019ve been able to really execute well from my backhand side,\u201d Anisimova said. \u201cBut also I\u2019ve been working a lot on my forehand, which I think that I\u2019ve also had a lot of winners on. I think I\u2019m really trying to develop my game as a whole, try to come into the net more, and use my serve to my advantage.\n\n\u201cI think my whole game is actually coming together, and, yes, I still try to go for my backhand line when I can,\u201d she laughed.\n\nOstapenko, who will rise 11 places in the ranking from 37 to 26, stated after the final: \u201cOf course it\u2019s not the result that I wanted today, but I really hope I will come back stronger, and I hope that one day I will lift this trophy.\u201d\n\nThe Latvian had previously reached the final in Doha back in 2016.\n\nFacebook\n\nItalian 3rd seeds Sara Errani & Jasmine Paolini captured the doubles title on Saturday with a 7-5 7-6(10) win over China\u2019s Jiang Xinyu & Wu Fang-Hsien from Chinese Taipei.\n\nThe 2024 WTA Doubles Team of the Year are now 3-0 in WTA 1000 finals as a pair in their careers, winning in Rome and Beijing last year.\n\nTo add a first Doha title together to their resumes, they needed to overcome a stern challenge from an in-form unseeded team already competing in their 3rd final of 2025, and who had upset No 2 seeds Hsieh Su-wei & Jelena Ostapenko earlier in the tournament.\n\nErrani & Paolini saved a pair of set points in the first set, and, in the second, they came from 3-5 down before a dramatic deciding tiebreak that pushed the total match time to nearly 2 hours.\n\nThey needed 7 championship points to seal their triumph, the first of which came in the 12th game of the set, before the 22-point deciding frame even began.\n\nJiang & Wu later built a 5-3 lead in the breaker, but used bold, inspired play to turn aside 3 more championship points.\n\nThe 3rd save levelled the tiebreak at 8-8, when, adding to the drama, the 4 players had to sit on court through a brief rain delay.\n\nAfter the break, Jiang & Wu had their only set point, when Paolini missed a second-serve return well long and wide, but Errani wiped the chance away with a high forehand volley winner that just kissed the sideline.\n\n\u201cIt was a really tough match. They are playing amazing,\u201d Paolini said post-match. \u201cDoubles, it\u2019s a little bit tricky, with the deciding point and the tiebreak. Yesterday [when they saved match points to beat Russians Mirra Andreeva & Diana Shnaider] we were a little bit lucky, today maybe a little bit as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a special week here.\u201d\n\nErrani first triumphed in Doha 12 years ago alongside former longtime partner Roberta Vinci, and the 37-year-old has now captured a total of 8 WTA 1000 titles in doubles.",

It was his second goal in the competition after the one he scored in the 4-0 win over Namibia on the second day of the group stage.\n\nOne of the best assets of the Bafana Bafana selection, the 28-year-old defensive midfielder is expected to play in his second TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations at the end of the year in Morocco. He is having a remarkable season with Mamelodi Sundowns, leader of the South African league with 42 points in 16 rounds and qualified for the quarter-finals of the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League.\n\nAMANALLAH MEMMICHE (ESPERANCE DE TUNIS & TUNISIA)\n\nAt 20 years old, Amanallah Memmiche is one of the greatest hopes of Tunisian football and is preparing to play in his first Africa Cup of Nations at the end of the year in Morocco.\n\nAn undisputed starter in goal for Esperance de Tunis, the goalkeeper is multiplying remarkable performances with his club, which he led to the final of the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League last season.\n\nCurrently leader of the Tunisian Ligue 1 championship with 42 points after 19 rounds, Esperance is also qualified for the quarter-finals of the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League after finishing top of Group D with 13 points in the group stage.\n\nBefore the AFCON, Memmiche will play in the FIFA Club World Cup with Esperance next summer in the United States.\n\nDJIGUI DIARRA (YOUNG AFRICANS & MALI)\n\nA member of the Young Africans in Tanzania since 2021, Malian Djigui Diarra is one of the best goalkeepers on the continent. His performances have largely contributed to making his club one of the references in Africa in recent seasons.\n\nFinalists of the TotalEnergies CAF Confederation Cup in 2023, the Malian goalkeeper and his team were stopped last season in the quarter-finals of the Champions League before failing this year in the group stage. The former Stade Malien goalkeeper and the team he captains have also won the last three editions of the Tanzanian championship.\n\nIn Morocco, he will probably play in his fifth TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations after Gabon 2017, Egypt 2029, Cameroon 2021 and Ivory Coast 2023. An undisputed starter in goal for the Eagles, the 29-year-old, 65 caps, hopes to make history with the Eagles on Cherifian soil.\n\nFISTON MAYELE (PYRAMIDS FC & DR CONGO)\n\nFiston Mayele is in great form with Pyramids FC this season. With his four goals, he contributed to the brilliant performances of the Egyptian club who brilliantly qualified for the quarter-finals of the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League after finishing co-leaders of Group D with 13 points, level with Esperance de Tunis.\n\nHis team also sits at the top of the Egyptian league standings with 30 points after 13 rounds, ahead of giants Al Ahly (29 points) and Zamalek (26 points).\n\nOne of the important elements of S\u00e9bastien D\u00e9sarbre's system, Fiston Kalala Mayele (30 years old) should play his second TotalEnergies CAF AFCON with the Democratic Republic of Congo after a first experience last year in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire where his team finished fourth.",

Our two core values, Safety and Respect for Each Other, form the basis of our Code of Conduct.\n\nSafety: Untiring collective vigilance\n\nBecause we work in an industry that can never be completely risk-free, Safety is the cornerstone of our operational efficiency. Safety is also the foundation of our collective commitment to operate sustainably and establish relationships based on trust with our host countries. To meet our goal of zero fatal accidents, we need to enhance our risk management, both on work stations and in our facilities. Safety is a daily battle that is waged with humility and vigilance. Safety rules always need to be followed, but people should also step in if they feel a situation is unsafe. Safety is also an essential criterion in choosing our business and industry partners. We place particular emphasis on their ability to apply a policy equivalent to ours.\n\nRespect for each other: Central to our collective principles\n\nFor TotalEnergies, exemplary behavior starts by listening to and respecting all of our stakeholders.

This is why we have developed rigorous compliance programs based on zero tolerance towards fraud, corruption, influence peddling and failure to abide by competition law. In particular, these programs make use of: Risk analyses\n\nDedicated policies and procedures\n\nTraining and awareness programs on rules and best practices for preventing risks\n\nAssistance in preventing and detecting risks\n\nAnalyses and feedback Read our Business Integrity Guide (pdf) Respecting human rights, a fundamental commitment at TotalEnergies We uphold the commitment to our stakeholders to respect human rights everywhere we operate.

Read our Human Rights Guide (pdf) In July 2016, we were the first oil and gas company to issue a Human Rights Briefing paper. Based on the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework, it shows our current approach to embedding respect for Human Rights in our operations. Read our Human Rights Briefing Paper, updated in 2024 (pdf) Protecting human health and the environment, a pillar of our responsible development strategy We are committed to protecting the environment by controlling the impact of our operations in all of our host countries. We promote efficient and responsible use of our energy sources and products. At the same time, we strive to protect the health of people, whether our employees, our customers or local communities. We implement awareness and prevention actions on the various types of health risks.\n\nOur values, our reference standards and our collective and individual principles are set out in our Code of Conduct, which serves as our reference document.

            "content": "Methane emissions have many dispersed sources (animal husbandry, fossil fuel production and combustion, transportation, decomposing waste, etc.). As a pioneer in detecting and quantifying emissions in real-life conditions, TotalEnergies is using the AUSEA technology developed in cooperation with the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne. It is one of the means we are using to reach our objective of near-zero methane emissions from our operations by 2030.\n\nMethane is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 times higher than that of CO 2 and a much shorter atmospheric lifetime. Reducing methane emissions is a priority, and TotalEnergies intends to establish an exemplary track record in this area.\n\nSince 2017, we have been working with the CNRS and the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne to develop the AUSEA technology (Airborne Ultralight Spectrometer for Environmental Applications) to detect and quantify methane and carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nAUSEA: a solution for detecting and measuring emissions\n\nThe AUSEA technology comprises a drone-mounted ultralight CO 2 and CH 4 sensor for ensuring access to hard-to-reach emission points while delivering readings with the highest precision. The sensor features a diode laser spectrometer and is capable of detecting and quantifying methane emissions with a high level of accuracy (> 1 kg/h).\n\nIn 2022, a first campaign to detect and measure emissions on site in real-life conditions covered 95% of operated sites(1) in the upstream sector. More than 1,200 AUSEA flights were carried out in 8 countries to cover 125 sites.\n\nThe long-term objective is to use the technology as part of a seamless and autonomous system. To achieve this aim, the research teams are looking to develop an unmanned drone navigation system with data automatically streamed to the servers, as well as instantaneous data processing and reporting capabilities. Automating the system will deliver immediate results to local operators at the facilities and increase the number of flights.\n\nIn addition to detection campaigns at our operated sites, we are making AUSEA technology available to certain operators to enable them to carry out targeted detection campaigns on their own sites. This is a concrete action to encourage the entire sector, especially national companies, to move towards zero methane emissions.\n\nOur objective: near-zero methane emissions by 2030\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, we halved our methane emissions by spearheading an action program targeting each of the emission sources at our assets (flaring, venting, fugitive emissions and incomplete combustion) and reinforcing the design criteria for our new facilities. To go even further, we are committed to a 50% reduction in our methane emissions by 2025 (achieved a year ahead of schedule) and 80% by 2030 compared to 2020 levels.\n\nThese targets cover all our operated assets and go beyond the 75% reduction in methane emissions from coal, oil and gas between 2020 and 2030 outlined in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario.\n\n(1) Calculated as a percentage of 100% operated production.",

The Gas Growth Integrated Project (GGIP) is designed to enhance the development of the country\u2019s natural resources to support its energy independence.\n\nThe GGIP project showcases our multi-energy strategy and our sustainable development model. Combining the production of natural gas, solar energy and improved oil production, GGIP reflects our determination to help oil and gas-producing countries move forward with their energy transition plans.\n\nWith support from the Iraqi authorities, we are going to invest in facilities to recover flared gas from three oil fields in the first phase and four other fields in the second phase to supply power plants, redevelop oil production at the Ratawi field, build a seawater treatment plant to supply the wells, and build and operate a solar power plant to provide carbon-free energy to the region\u2019s inhabitants. These projects represent a total investment of approximately $10 billion.\n\nA four-in-one project to sustainably develop the country\u2019s natural resources\n\nThe GGIP project features four sub-projects led by a consortium comprising TotalEnergies (45%), Basrah Oil Company (30%) and QatarEnergy (25%):\n\nAssociated Gas Upstream Development (AGUP) , which aims to develop production from the Ratawi field by upgrading the existing facilities to reach a capacity of 120,000 barrels per day (b/d) during phase 1, followed by 210,000 b/d during phase 2 by building a new plant.\n\nAr-Ratawi Gas Midstream Project (GMP) , which aims to eliminate flaring and recover the gas from several oil fields. Collected and processed, the gas will then be transported by pipeline to supply the local power plants, thereby improving the electricity supply to this region, which is regularly affected by power cuts. Until the commissioning of the GMP, scheduled in 2028, the ArtawiGas25 Project will reduce flaring on the Ratawi field from the end of 2025, followed by the neighbouring Majnoon and West Qurna fields. Eliminating flaring at these three fields represents a reduction of approximately 6 million tons of CO 2 per year.\n\nCommon Seawater Supply Project (CSSP) , which involves building a seawater treatment plant between the ports of Khor Zubair and Umm Qasr. The plant will be capable of treating 5 million barrels of water per day during phase 1. The filtered water will be piped to the Zubair, Rumaila, Majnoon, West Qurna and Ar-Ratawi fields to maintain pressure in the fields. It will replace the fresh water currently drawn from the rivers and groundwater. This project will reduce water stress in the area and free up 250,000 cubic meters of fresh water per day for irrigation and local agricultural needs.\n\nA 1-gigawatt solar power plant, the first in Iraq. Spanning some 2,200 hectares near the gas treatment plant, it will be divided into four units to adapt more easily to the capacity of the local grid. This power plant will supply electricity to 350,000 homes in the region, while avoiding 2 million tons of CO 2 emissions per year. It will contribute to the Iraqi government's goal of meeting 12% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2027.\n\nSocio-economic benefits of the project\n\nThe GGIP project represents a major investment in the Basra region, creating economic activity and over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. To maximize our contribution to the Iraqi economy, our local content policy for this project is based on three pillars:\n\nrecruiting and developing local talent: over 85% of the direct jobs created by the GGIP project will be filled by Iraqis;\n\ncontracting with Iraqi companies;\n\nstrengthening the skills of local resources: two contractual funds have been set up to promote employment, training and education, and to develop infrastructure projects.\n\nOver and above the jobs created and the local content, our aim is to carry out local socio-economic projects in this region of Iraq. A third fund, created on our initiative, is working in the fields of health, education and agriculture.",

            "content": "The analysts covering TotalEnergies SE ( ) delivered a dose of negativity to shareholders today, by making a substantial revision to their statutory forecasts for this year. This report focused on revenue estimates, and it looks as though the consensus view of the business has become substantially more conservative.\n\nFollowing the latest downgrade, the 20 analysts covering TotalEnergies provided consensus estimates of US$191b revenue in 2025, which would reflect a noticeable 2.1% decline on its sales over the past 12 months. Prior to the latest estimates, the analysts were forecasting revenues of US$214b in 2025. The consensus view seems to have become more pessimistic on TotalEnergies, noting the measurable cut to revenue estimates in this update.\n\nThere was no particular change to the consensus price target of US$71.87, with TotalEnergies' latest outlook seemingly not enough to result in a change of valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic TotalEnergies analyst has a price target of US$93.76 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$62.25. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 2.1% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 9.6% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 2.5% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - TotalEnergies is expected to lag the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their revenue estimates for this year. They're also anticipating slower revenue growth than the wider market. Given the stark change in sentiment, we'd understand if investors became more cautious on TotalEnergies after today.\n\nOf course, this isn't the full story.

Under this agreement, TotalEnergies will supply GSPC with 400,000 tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG), amounting to six cargoes per year.\n\nThe LNG, sourced from TotalEnergies' global portfolio and delivered to terminals on India's west coast, will primarily serve GSPC's industrial customers. It will also supply Indian households for domestic use, businesses, and service stations for vehicles running on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), such as auto-rickshaws.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to have been chosen by GSPC to supply them with LNG in India. This new deal underscores TotalEnergies' leadership in the LNG domain and commitment to India\u2019s energy transition and security of supply\u201d, said Gregory Joffroy, Senior Vice President LNG at TotalEnergies.\n\n\u201cThis agreement marks a major step towards reinforcing GSPC\u2019s strategy to secure competitive LNG on a long-term basis, helping to bridge the growing natural gas demand-supply deficit in Gujarat and across India. Partnering with TotalEnergies, one of the largest LNG players in the world, aligns with GSPC\u2019s strategy to build up its long-term portfolio and become a leading Indian player in gas trading\u201d, said Milind Torawane, Managing Director at GSPC. \u201cThis deal will further strengthen GSPC\u2019s portfolio and its operations in the gas value chain, leveraging GSPC Group\u2019s transmission and distribution infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIn India, natural gas will play a pivotal role in the energy transition. As a cleaner alternative for industrial activities, cooking and transportation, it enhances air quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.\n\n***",

Drilling was conducted by the semi-submersible rig Deepsea Mira, owned by Northern Ocean Ltd. and operated by Odfjell Drilling Ltd.\n\n\u201cWith further analysis of the Tamboti-1X results underway, the outcome of this well, within the northern region of Block 2913B, highlights the potential of Namibia\u2019s deep offshore play\u201d, Impact chief executive Siraj Ahmed commented.\n\nTamboti-1X sits about 12 kilometers (7.46 miles) northeast of the Mangetti-1X exploration well and around 25 km north-northwest of the Venus-2A appraisal well, according to London-based Impact. Both nearby wells are part of the Venus light oil field, discovered 2022 via the Venus-1X well.\n\nMeanwhile, drilling started at Marula-1X, in the southern part of 2913B. \u201cThis well will target Albian-aged sandstones, within the Marula fan complex and has the potential to unlock further exploration targets across the south, which is an area lying at the heart of the prolific Kudu source-rock kitchen\u201d, Impact said.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe Joint Venture is continuing to progress the proposed development of the Venus Field, with development studies ongoing\u201d. The field has been appraised via a sidetrack to the discovery well, as well as Venus-1A, Venus-2A and Mangetti-1X.\n\n\u201cThe Venus Field is expected to be the first development in Block 2913B, producing 150kb/d [150,000 barrels a day] of ~45\u00b0 API oil, with final investment decision expected by the first half of 2026\u201d, Impact said.\n\nAt year-end, the rig is expected to move onto drilling the Olympe prospect on the adjacent Block 2912, Impact said.\n\nBlock 2913B, also known as Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) 56, spans 8,215 square km (3,171.83 square miles) offshore southern Namibia.

The peak production level is seen at 755,000 barrels daily, which is significantly higher than initial peak output expectations of 660,000 bpd. The peak output was hit for the first time in September 2024 when Johan Sverdrup produced 756,000 bpd. The field\u2019s output alone accounts for a third of Norway\u2019s total oil production.\n\nJohan Sverdrup is estimated to have reserves of 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalents, and the entire field is now in production. Phase One of Johan Sverdrup was put online in October 2019, and Phase Two came on stream in December 2022.\n\nEarlier this month, operator Equinor said that it expects production at Johan Sverdrup to continue to be close to 2023 and 2024 levels in 2025. The recovery rate ambition has been increased from 65% in the plan for development and operations to 75% now, including Johan Sverdrup phase 3, Equinor said last week.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

Please click here to read our full disclaimer.\n\n\n\nThe outlook for TotalEnergies\u2019 delayed Mozambique LNG project is increasingly uncertain.\n\nThe Financial Times reported at the end of January that the company had failed to convince the outgoing Biden administration to release US$4.7 billion in funding for the project.\n\nThe US$20 billion project \u2013 set to be the largest ever direct foreign investment in Africa \u2013 secured funding in 2020. However, the following year TotalEnergies declared force majeure after violence in the north of Mozambique by Islamist insurgents close to the project site. The funding from the US Export-Import Bank, as well as from the UK and Netherlands governments, now must be reapproved.\n\nAs the FT reported, disclosed letters to the Biden administration from the company\u2019s CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 highlighted concerns that the transition to the Trump administration would add further delays that could \u201cundermine the financing structure, already in place and approved, and bring the entire project to a stop\u201d.\n\nThere are now key questions over whether the US, UK and Netherlands will want to approve the project, and indeed whether they should.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will be in favour of funding Mozambique LNG given its \u201cAmerica first\u201d stance and the lack of any US ownership of the project.\n\nThe US is the largest LNG exporter in the world, and the new administration clearly wants to see more. In January, President Donald Trump signed the Unleashing American Energy executive order, which ended the pause on further LNG export permits. Does this fit with US funding for a French, Japanese, Indian and Thai project, particularly in the context of questionable long-term LNG demand?\n\nThe governments of the US, UK and the Netherlands should also consider the risks and controversies that plague the project.\n\nPouyann\u00e9 told investors in October 2024 that the project would be restarted by the end of that year. But it was delayed again after violence broke out in Mozambique following disputed elections, which European Union observers concluded were \u201cmarked by anomalies and serious flaws\u201d.\n\nThere is fresh controversy over the presence of Rwandan troops in northern Mozambique. They were sent there in 2021 to quell the Islamist insurgency and pave the way for the restart of the LNG project. The EU has been funding Rwanda\u2019s deployment, and TotalEnergies has hired a security company backed by the ruling party of Rwanda to guard its project in Mozambique.\n\nNow Rwanda is accused of using its forces to back a major escalation of conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. France has demanded Rwandan forces leave the DRC. Will an EU member such as the Netherlands still want to fund an LNG project protected by Rwandan forces amid calls to reduce Western support for the regime?\n\nLNG supply glut approaching\n\nAside from the controversies, there is another good reason potential financiers shouldn\u2019t back the project.\n\nAs the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has been warning, lacklustre demand growth and a huge wave of new export capacity are poised to send global LNG markets into oversupply, pushing down prices.\n\nThe US and Qatar account for much of the new supply due to come online but increased supply is also planned to come from the Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Gabon and later Tanzania, in addition to Mozambique.\n\nDemand growth does not look like it will be sufficient to match all this new supply. European imports may rise in 2025 but IEEFA expects LNG demand in Europe, Japan and South Korea will fall through 2030. Together these countries account for more than half of global LNG imports.\n\nMeanwhile, the idea that LNG will be a bridge fuel that will allow China to reduce its coal consumption is not playing out. China\u2019s astonishing rate of wind and solar installation and reliance on gas imports via pipeline mean the nation\u2019s demand will likely disappoint LNG exporters.\n\nPotential financiers of the Mozambique LNG project need to consider the wisdom of opening up more capacity in an oversupplied market.\n\nAnd they shouldn\u2019t worry about denying Mozambique a development opportunity. Oil and gas developments have a long history of disappointing development outcomes, often doing more harm than good.\n\nThe International Institute for Sustainable Development has warned that the financial benefits of LNG development in Mozambique will be weighted towards multinational oil and gas companies, with little left for the nation.\n\nNine of the 20 fastest growing economies in the world are in Africa, according to the International Monetary Fund. Most of these states are not dependent on exports of fossil fuels, metals and minerals. Resource-intensive economies in Sub-Saharan Africa have seen far lower growth than the rest of the region over the past decade.\n\nThere are a growing number of reasons the US, UK and the Netherlands should not finance the Mozambique LNG project. They can take solace from the fact that Mozambique will likely be better off without it.\n\nThis article was first published by Business Day.",

            "content": "French oil and gas giant TotalEnergies is preparing to restart development work on its long-delayed liquefied natural gas (LNG) fsproject in northern Mozambique \u2013 but faces a key test in persuading lenders to fulfil their commitments.\n\nTotal originally took a final investment decision on the project in 2019, and agreed a debt financing arrangement with eight export credit agencies, along with 19 commercial lenders and the African Development Bank. Japanese commodities firm Mitsui, Mozambique\u2019s state-owned ENH, and several Indian and Thai firms also hold equity stakes alongside Total\n\nJust two years after greenlighting the $20bn development, Total was forced to declare force majeure in 2021 as the Islamist insurgency in Cabo Delgado province made onshore construction activities impossible. Now Total faces the challenge of persuading those investors who committed before the suspension to stick with the project.\n\n\u201cThe operator has been planning to lift the force majeure for some years now, and we have seen improvements in the security situation, at least around the LNG facility,\u201d says Pranav Joshi, vice president of upstream research at advisory firm Rystad Energy.\n\n\u201cThe main thing would be to get the financing agreed on, because that is critical for the project to move ahead. If there are any [export credit] agencies that are backing out, then we can expect more delays on the project.\u201d\n\nUS firm, UK wavers\n\nTotal is optimistic that the Export-Impact Bank of the United States will re-approve its loan offer. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne\u0301 said last week in a conference call with investors that it is \u201ca question of weeks\u201d before the US loan is rubber-stamped.\n\nBut UK Export Finance is reportedly seeking legal advice on withdrawing its $1.15bn loan offer, due to the UK government\u2019s stance on funding fossil fuel projects. In his conference call Pouyanne\u0301 said that he is \u201cready to exercise all my contractual rights,\u201d if any export credit agency backs out.\n\nJoshi notes that while any backtracking from export credit agencies is likely to cause further delays, it may be possible to persuade committed lenders \u2013 particularly Asian banks \u2013 to increase their contribution.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that financing hurdles are the main reasons for the delay in lifting force majeure. Total is \u201cbuying more time\u201d by claiming that the project\u2019s resumption depends on export credit agency approvals, suggests Anna Westwell, senior associate at strategic advisory firm JS Held.\n\nThe viability of the project depends on containing the insurgency and ensuring the economic redevelopment of Cabo Delgado, she argues.\n\nThe long road to production\n\nTotal originally intended to start delivering gas from Mozambique in 2024. Rystad believes that 2030 is now the most likely date to start production \u2013 but says this depends on avoiding further roadblocks.\n\n\u201cOur estimate is strictly based on a potential resumption of construction activities by the second half of next year,\u201d says Joshi.\n\n\u201cAny delay due to any reasons, be it security or financing not being resolved or contract negotiations taking longer, that obviously delays the project even further.\u201d\n\nEven if construction can resume next year, developments costs are likely to be considerably higher in real terms than originally planned, due to global inflation in recent years. Meanwhile, with LNG deliveries delayed until around 2030, market conditions when the gas is shipped may be less favourable than anticipated.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the long-term LNG demand outlook, there could be stiffer competition coming in from the likes of Qatar or even the US,\u201d says Joshi. \u201cSo the gap that needs to be filled in the market right now will also continue to shrink as time passes by.\u201d\n\nJS Held\u2019s Westwell adds that the project could be \u201cutterly transformative for Mozambique\u2019s economy,\u201d but only if it is well-managed. The delay in receiving revenues from Total\u2019s LNG project is partly responsible for the country\u2019s ongoing economic difficulties, she says, while the budget shortfall means less money is available to begin the rebuilding of conflict-ravaged Cabo Delgado.\n\n\u201cWithout LNG exports, the new government under Daniel Chapo will need to act quickly to implement fiscal prudence,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\n",

They must use ADRs (American Depositary Receipts), which have higher transaction costs and are not appreciated by investment funds.\n\n\u201cWe are subject to SEC regulation, and ADRs can hinder some investors,\u201d explained the CEO. With this new strategy, TotalEnergies hopes to attract more American investors by facilitating access to its shares and improving its share price.\n\nTotalEnergies is to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange soon\n\nWhat are the consequences of TotalEnergies\u2019 listing on the New York Stock Exchange?\n\nNo, TotalEnergies shares will not soon be leaving the Paris Stock Exchange, but they are well on their way by putting American and French shareholders on an equal footing. In addition, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 announced:\n\nTotalEnergies should not pay corporate tax in France for 2024 due to refining losses.\n\nUndoubtedly, the company\u2019s disengagement from France is well underway, and the government is concerned about it, but it is already very late. For a long time, the political and media world has designated TotalEnergies as the scapegoat for all climate and societal ills.\n\nEnvironmental activists systematically disrupt shareholders\u2019 general meetings yearly, and the French authorities do nothing to prevent the disorder.\n\nIf France does not like TotalEnergies, it is normal for the company to seek closer ties with its most trusted shareholders, who are now mostly American.\n\nTotalEnergies shares are less valued than those of its American competitors.\n\nConcretely, the listing in New York can only be positive for the shareholder:\n\nExxon Mobil TotalEnergies Chevron Corporation stock price 109.88 58.62 152.99 Earnings per share 7.85 7.43 10.05 PER (Price earning ratio) 14 8 15 Valuation of TotalEnergies and its American competitors\n\nIf TotalEnergies shares were valued at the same levels as their counterparts in the United States (PER of 14), the theoretical share price would be \u20ac104.02, an increase of 77%. Therefore, the company should adjust its listing position in the interest of French and foreign shareholders. The PER (Price earning ratio) is the result of dividing the \u201d share price \u201d by the \u201d net profit per share.\u201d\n\nPositive reaction from the markets\n\nEvolution of the TotalEnergies share price\n\nTotalEnergies shares were up 1.67% today at \u20ac58.98.\n\nTotalEnergies is on the verge of passing under the American flag\n\nTotalEnergies on the verge of passing under the American flag: our analysis\n\nTotalEnergies Shares Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): New York Listing and Strategy\n\nWill TotalEnergies be listed on the New York Stock Exchange? Yes, but it will be a continuous listing on the Paris and New York markets. The share will be unique and linked by the exchange rate. Why is TotalEnergies adopting this listing method? The objective is to facilitate access to TotalEnergies shares for American investors, in particular by reducing the transaction costs associated with ADRs (American Depositary Receipts). What is the difference between a dual listing and the strategy chosen by TotalEnergies? A dual listing involves issuing two separate share classes on two markets. Here, there will be a single share class listed continuously in Paris and New York, with a price adjusted by the exchange rate. What impact for current shareholders? Institutional and individual shareholders do not have to take any specific steps. The share will remain listed on Euronext Paris and accessible on the American market without using ADRs. Will American investors be able to buy TotalEnergies shares directly? Thanks to this new listing, American investors can acquire TotalEnergies shares directly on the markets without using ADRs, which are often more expensive. What impact on the TotalEnergies share price of a listing in New York A New York Stock Exchange listing should strengthen the share price to reach the same level as American oil companies (Exon Mobile and Chevron Corporation). The theoretical price is \u20ac104.02 for a PER of 14.\n\nWe are interested in your opinion on the upcoming listing of TotalEnergies on the New York Stock Exchange:\n\nTell us in the comments.

Swiatek loves the conditions in Doha and handles them far better than any of her rivals, but it would be very interesting to see a final against world number one Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nPeter Lynch: Daria Kasatkina may have just dropped a place in the WTA rankings, but I think the world number 12 can bounce back by going all the way in Doha, where the 10th seed is chasing a ninth tour-level title.\n\nLee Clarke: Very predictable pick from me here but I\u2019m going with Aryna Sabalenka to come through in Qatar and pick up this title.

The inauguration of an ethane cracker in 2022 followed by the start-up of a new Baystar polyethylene unit in Bayport in 2023 have significantly scaled up our petrochemical production capacity, while contributing to our growth ambition in the United States.\n\nA key refining player in the United States\n\nOver the past 30 years, TotalEnergies\u2019 Port Arthur platform has adapted to market needs and grown to become a major petrochemical platform with a crude processing capacity of 238,000 barrels per day.\n\nModernization projects including the construction of the Company\u2019s largest fluidized-bed catalytic cracker (FCC) in the 1990s, and a coker in 2011 have enabled the site to process heavy crude oil as well as lighter domestic crudes. A high-pressure distillate hydrodesulphurization unit also allows production of ultra-low sulfur diesel that meets the specification of the American market. A catalytic gasoline hydrotreater reactor started in 2020, to bring the gasoline production of the refinery below the 10-ppm sulfur mark.\n\nThe platform has also implemented several projects in recent years to increase its environmental compliance, including the largest turnaround of its history in 2023.\n\nThe Port Arthur platform, a major player in the U.S. petrochemical industry\n\nThe Port Arthur platform features a 1 million metric ton/year steam cracker through a joint venture with BASF. After undergoing adaptation work since 2013, the steam cracker now uses mainly locally produced ethane and butane as feedstock. In December 2023, for the first time in the United States, TotalEnergies converted feedstock from plastic (pyrolysis oil) into a monomer at the BTP cracker (JV BASF), then into circular polypropylene, ISCC+ certified, at the TotalEnergies La Porte plant.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the completion of two major petrochemical projects developed by Baystar, a 50/50 joint venture between TotalEnergies and Borealis, further consolidated our development in the United States:\n\nThe commissioning of a new ethane cracker with a production capacity of 1 million ton of ethylene per year at the Port Arthur site for an investment cost of USD 2 billion.\n\nsite for an investment cost of USD 2 billion. The start-up of a new polyethylene production line (\"Bay 3\") in Bayport, which is partly fed by the ethylene from the new Port Arthur ethane cracker. With a combined production capacity of more than 1 million metric ton per year, Bayport has forged its reputation as a world-class site. By choosing the patented Borstar\u00ae technology for this new unit, we are working alongside our partners in developing the production of polyethylene grades tailored for sustainable applications in the energy, infrastructure and consumer goods sectors.\n\nWe are also active in the U.S. polymers market through our polypropylene plant in La Porte (Texas), which includes a Technology Center, and our integrated styrene-polystyrene plant in Carville (Louisiana), the largest of its kind in the world.\n\nAlongside our renewables and LNG investments in the United States, these major petrochemical projects have confirmed TotalEnergies' status as a fully integrated player across the ethylene supply chain and a leader in the U.S. polyethylene market.",

I think right now I\u2019m fully recovered after that tough match.\u201dSabalenka is back competing at the Qatar Open which started yesterday for the first time since 2022. The tournament in Doha is the first WTA 1000 event of the season.After Qatar the tour\u2019s top players move on to the WTA 1000 in Dubai.

I believe I\u2019ll just take these two tournaments as a preparation for the Sunshine one, and I\u2019ll try to build my tennis, and probably take my tennis to the next level in these two events.\u201dThe Middle East swing kicked off in Abu Dhabi last week, where Belinda Bencic clinched her first title less than 10 months after the birth of her daughter Bella.\u201cThat\u2019s impressive, honestly. She just came back, I think Australian Open she had a great run (to the fourth round0, and now she\u2019s holding the trophy.

The conditions in Doha are extremely slow, the ball bounces high and the wind can occasionally be out of control. Considering all of that, this tournament can be quite gritty\u2014a reason why Swiatek has won this tournament three years in a row. So, while powerful players can absolutely have success in Doha, it is important to keep in mind that defending the baseline at a high level can be very valuable in this tournament.\n\nQatar TotalEnergies Open Players To Watch\n\nOns Jabeur (40-1): Jabeur put up a great fight in a 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (4) loss to Rybakina in the Abu Dhabi quarterfinals, and the Tunisian is starting to look a lot like the player that made it to three Grand Slam finals between 2022 and 2023. To start the 2025 season, Jabeur is 8-4 in WTA-level matches, including wins over Danielle Collins and Jelena Ostapenko.\n\nJabeur\u2019s break percentage is an outrageous 39.8% through 12 matches, so she\u2019s consistently getting into her opponent\u2019s service games. The Tunisian just hasn\u2019t been able to win points behind her first serve, doing so just 65.0% of the time. When she was at her best, that number was a little closer to 70. But Jabeur is making more first serves (60.2%) than she has in any year in her career, so it feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before she starts to figure things out. She needs to just be a little better about hitting ambitious targets, either setting up unreturnable shots or putting her in positions for serve-plus-ones. Once she does, she\u2019s going to start to be a consistent presence late in tournaments.\n\nJabeur should also benefit from the court speeds in Doha. While 2024 was a down season for her, she played her best tennis on clay. Well, these slow, unpredictable hard courts should favor that same skill set. Jabeur is also in a somewhat reasonable quarter. A second-round meeting with Zheng would be tough, but it\u2019s not crazy to think that Jabeur\u2019s best tennis would be enough there. Her peak Elo rating is actually slightly higher than Zheng\u2019s, so we\u2019re going to find out quickly whether Jabeur is fully back.",

            "content": "\u201cFrom my point of view as an industry representative, it is better to concentrate efforts on one plant than three,\u201d said CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 in an interview, as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported. What Pouyann\u00e9 is referring to is obvious: he clearly states that his priorities lie with the existing factory in Billy-Berclau. \u201cTotalenergies will concentrate on France,\u201d says Pouyann\u00e9. Building a second factory is risky when the first one is not yet fully operational.\n\nTotalEnergies holds 25 per cent of the \u2018Automotive Cells Company\u2019 through its subsidiary Saft; the other shareholders are Mercedes-Benz (30 per cent) and Stellantis (45 per cent). TotalEnergies CEO Pouyann\u00e9\u2019s statements are thus quite controversial. The smallest partner wants to concentrate on France. At the same time, Mercedes and Stellantis, with Opel and the Italian Fiat brands, are also interested in starting battery production at the former Opel plant in Kaiserslautern and the Fiat site in Termoli for political reasons. The FAZ also writes: \u201cThe scepticism from Paris makes it increasingly questionable whether battery cell production will ever see the light of day in Kaiserslautern.\u201d\n\nPouyann\u00e9\u2019s comments are likely to cause controversy within the shareholder group, as they also call into question the three-way alliance itself: If the other two ACC shareholders wanted more factories, they were welcome to them, said Pouyann\u00e9. As car manufacturers, they are not pursuing the same strategy as Saft. However, the CEO left open the question of whether Mercedes and Stellantis should then realise the other two battery plants outside ACC or whether TotalEnergies wants to hold back internally on the two projects.\n\nACC has been producing battery cells in Billy-Berclau and Douvrin for almost a year and a half, which are used in the first Stellantis models based on the STLA Medium, for example. One block is currently in operation, but there have been repeated reports of problems with the ramp-up. A second block (of five planned) will follow in 2025. In the media interview, Pouyann\u00e9 stated that he had \u201cclearly\u201d pointed out to the then Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares in autumn 2024 that the production of battery cells was complicated and required a great deal of expertise. \u201cThese are not just robots that you use like in a car factory,\u201d the manager is quoted as saying.\n\nACC officially put the plans for Kaiserslautern and Termoli on hold in the summer of 2024 to wait and see how demand develops in Europe and, if necessary, adjust the plans (for cell chemistry, for example) \u2013 the joint venture also repeated this statement when asked by FAZ. However, ACC has yet to say when a decision will be made. Only the rumour that battery cells for Mercedes luxury models are to be manufactured in Kaiserslautern is rejected as \u201cunfounded.\u201d\n\nfaz.net (in German)",

Analysis of the Tamboti-1X well revealed the presence of black oil within an 85-meter net reservoir of Upper Cretaceous sandstones, though of lower quality. A drill stem test (DST) was conducted, with data currently under review.\n\nDrilling of the Marula-1X exploration well began on February 3, 2025, in the southern part of the block. This well aims to assess Albian-aged sandstones within the Marula fan complex, with the potential to unlock additional exploration opportunities in the region, particularly in the prolific Kudu source-rock kitchen.\n\nLooking ahead, the joint venture partners plan to drill the Olympe prospect on Block 2912, targeting Albian sandstones within a structural closure, with operations expected to begin by the end of 2025.

In 2019, gas production and deliveries were suspended to allow for the field's redevelopment, which had become necessary due to natural subsidence of the reservoir. Since production was restarted in 2024, Tyra II is one of the most advanced offshore gas facilities in the world. The technologies used at the site will optimize the energy efficiency of its operations and reduce its environmental footprint.\n\nThe strategic project of redeveloping Denmark's largest natural gas field\n\nDiscovered in 1968 by Maersk Oil and operated since 1984, the Tyra field is Denmark's largest natural gas deposit, located 225 km west of the town of Esbjerg. Until 2019, its facilities processed and exported over 90% of the natural gas produced in the Danish North Sea.\n\nDue to the natural subsidence of the field after almost 40 years of continuous gas extraction, the seabed beneath the Tyra platforms had sunk by more than five meters. In 2017, the Danish Underground Consortium \u2013 a partnership between TotalEnergies, BlueNord and Nords\u00f8fonden \u2013 took the decision to rebuild and upgrade the facilities to ensure continuous and safe operations. Therefore, production was suspended between September 2019 and March 2024.\n\nTyra's redevelopment: a human and technical feat\n\nA large-scale technical and logistical effort was required to drive Tyra's transformation. The teams began by dismantling the obsolete installations. This stage was completed during the summer of 2020 and involved two of the world's largest construction and crane vessels. In total, some 50,000 metric tons of material were removed.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, eight new platforms were installed, including six wellhead and riser platforms, an accommodation platform and a processing platform. The last processing module, weighing 17,000 metric tons, was installed in October 2022, breaking a world record as heaviest crane lift at sea. After the platforms were powered up and reconnected to the existing North Sea energy infrastructure, Tyra II resumed production on March 21, 2024, with ramp-up to full technical capacity in the following months.\n\nRecycling efforts are one of the project's defining features. As a result, 98.5% of the materials from Tyra's former facilities have been recycled or reused \u2013 some even in the new design of Tyra II such as the wellheads or jackets.\n\n1/ 6- Installation of two head platforms 2/ 6- Arrival of Tyra II's new processing module 3/ 6- East Tyra II 4/ 6- View of Tyra II completed 5/ 6- View of Tyra II completed 6/ 6- Tyra Hub map Slide 1/6\n\nSlide 2/6\n\nSlide 3/6\n\nSlide 4/6\n\nSlide 5/6\n\nSlide 6/6\n\nA state-of-the-art platform with an essential role to play in Denmark's and Europe's energy security\n\n35,000 metric tons total weight of Tyra II 5.7 M m3 of gas per day produced by Tyra II >100,000 data points on the platform gathered through sensors\n\nThe new Tyra leverages state-of-the-art digital solutions and technological innovations to produce more efficiently and with 30% lower greenhouse gas emissions than the former facilities.\n\nWith the ability to produce 5.7 million cubic meters of gas and 22,000 barrels of condensates per day at plateau from Tyra\u2019s wells and five satellite fields (Tyra Southeast, Harald, Valdemar, Svend and Roar), Tyra is one of Europe's largest gas fields. It will enable Denmark to be self-sufficient in gas and become a net exporter, thus contributing to Europe's security of supply.\n\nView text version",

            "content": "Energy giant TotalEnergies has announced a reduction in its investments in low-carbon energy for 2025, in response to a less favorable energy environment than in previous years. This decision comes as the group reports a 26% decline in net profit, reaching $15.8 billion in 2024, after two years of record-breaking results.\n\nRefocusing on profitability\n\nTotalEnergies plans a net investment budget between $17 billion and $17.5 billion for 2025. However, the portion allocated to low-carbon energy is reduced from $5 billion to $4.5 billion, particularly in the electricity sector. This strategic choice aligns with a trend observed among other European oil majors like Shell, BP, and Equinor, which have also scaled back their commitments to renewable energy.\n\nCEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 justified this shift by pointing to the declining profitability of low-carbon energy, explaining that energy prices were less volatile in 2024 compared to the exceptional levels of 2022 and 2023. Refining margins also saw a significant decline, impacting the group\u2019s overall performance.\n\nShareholders remain a priority\n\nDespite lower profits, TotalEnergies maintains a shareholder-friendly policy. The group announced a 7.6% increase in its 2024 dividend and the continuation of its share buyback program, with a budget of $2 billion per quarter. This strategy, in place since late 2022, means the group will contribute to the new French tax on share buybacks, which could amount to between \u20ac100 million and \u20ac150 million.\n\nOn the fiscal front, TotalEnergies estimates its contribution to French public finances in 2024 will exceed \u20ac2 billion, including all forms of taxes and duties. However, regarding corporate tax on profits in France, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 stated that the group is unlikely to pay much, if anything, due to accumulated losses in the country.\n\nNew York listing project confirmed\n\nThe project to list TotalEnergies on the New York Stock Exchange, first mentioned in 2023, remains a strategic priority for the group. The goal is to increase stock liquidity by making it accessible to a larger number of U.S. investors. Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 clarified that this move does not constitute a dual listing but rather ensures continuity with the European market, allowing the stock to be traded seamlessly from Paris to Wall Street.\n\nThis positioning comes as oil majors seek to optimize their attractiveness to investors while adjusting their strategies in response to a shifting energy market.",

I don't want to be in the middle of a dispute with my friends, with Shell and BP,\u201d Patrick Pouyanne told the publication.\n\nVenture Global is currently embroiled in a dispute with Shell, BP, and several other European energy majors after it refused to start deliveries to them under long-term contracts in favor of selling its LNG on the spot market, making billions, according to the clients.\n\nThe LNG exporter used a legal loophole that allowed it to delay the official commissioning of its Calcasieu Pass LNG facility, which was when the long-term contracts would come into effect.\n\nBP, Shell, Repsol, and Eni are suing Venture Global, with Shell last September accusing Venture Global of earning some $3.5 billion from selling LNG on the spot market while it should have supplied it under its long-term contracts. This, Shell alleged, caused serious LNG sourcing difficulties for one unnamed company that had to resort to sourcing the gas from five other U.S. producers, incurring additional costs of $1.5 billion.\n\nBP, Shell, and Spain\u2019s Repsol, along with two other European energy companies, were foundation buyers for the Calcasieu Pass facility, meaning they provided Venture Global with the money to build the place in Louisiana in exchange for a commitment from the company to supply them with certain volumes of LNG over a long-term period.\n\nThe facility has a capacity of 10 million tons, and it started producing in early 2022\u2014right on time for Europe, which was beginning to experience a shortage. But instead of honoring its contracts with the European buyers, Venture Global chose to sell more LNG on the spot market.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

Some economists have warned this could constrain domestic supplies and lead to higher energy bills for Americans, which could then prompt Trump to reconsider his stance on LNG exports.\n\nPouyanne said that the U.S. has abundant gas supplies due to its vast shale reserves, but that the country needed to invest in pipeline infrastructure to deliver the gas to demand centers along the coasts.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the history of the evolution of the U.S. gas price, the spikes are more linked to the lack of infrastructure than the lack of resources,\u201d he said.\n\nEUROPEAN SUPPLY WORRIES\n\nEurope has become the main buyer of U.S. LNG since losing access to Russian supplies following Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nWhile Total has become a major supplier of that American LNG, the company has also continued to supply Russian LNG to Europe from that country's Yamal LNG export facility.\n\nPouyanne said Total\u2019s ability to source the superchilled gas from all geographies will help it minimize the risk to profits from tit-for-tat tariffs like those between China and the U.S.\n\n\u201cFundamentally it\u2019s a political game, because China\u2019s purchase of U.S. energy is quite limited \u2013 in fact, they purchase from portfolio companies like us. What we will do is take more LNG from Qatar or from Australia, and the US LNG we will send to other customers,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nEven so, Pouyanne cautioned Europe away from banning Russian LNG before 2027, saying the market would not be able to reroute 18 million tons of Russian supply until new projects start up worldwide.\n\nHe instead urged the European Union to negotiate with Trump for guaranteed LNG, sign more long-term contracts and to reconsider its carbon taxes, which have driven up the cost of electricity.\n\n(Reporting by America Hernandez in London; Editing by David Gregorio)",

This power comes with structuration services to transform intermittent production in a constant volume of green electricity, TotalEnergies said.\n\n\"We are delighted to sign this agreement with STMicroelectronics, which demonstrates our ability to provide long-term and innovative clean firm power solutions tailored to our customers' needs\", Sophie Chevalier, Senior Vice President Flexible Power & Integration at TotalEnergies, said. \"TotalEnergies aims to be a preferred partner to support tech industry players towards their decarbonization efforts, and this agreement showcases our commitment and capabilities\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis first PPA in France marks yet another important step towards ST\u2019s goal of becoming carbon neutral in its operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and partially Scope 3) by 2027, including the sourcing of 100 percent renewable energy by 2027\u201d, said Geoff West, EVP and Chief Procurement Officer at STMicroelectronics. \u201cPPAs will play a major role in our transition, and we have already signed several to support ST\u2019s operations in Italy and Malaysia.\n\n\u201cStarting in 2025, this PPA with TotalEnergies will provide a significant level of renewable energy for ST\u2019s operations in France, which includes R&D, design, sales and marketing, and large-volume chip manufacturing\u201d.\n\nThe PPA with STMicroelectronics follows similar contracts signed with Saint-Gobain, Air Liquide, Amazon, LyondellBasell, Merck, Microsoft, Orange, and Sasol, TotalEnergies said.\n\nTo contact the author, email andreson.n.paul@gmail.com",

            "content": "By America Hernandez\n\nPARIS (Reuters) -French oil major TotalEnergies beat expectations for fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday as higher trading profits in the gas market helped it offset some of the impact of low oil prices and weak fuel demand.\n\nAdjusted net income for the final three months of 2024 was $4.4 billion, down 15% from $5.2 billion a year previously but slightly higher than the third quarter's $4.1 billion. The results beat expectations for $4.2 billion, according to an analyst consensus compiled by LSEG.\n\nThe company said it expects higher gas prices, upstream production and power sales in early 2025. Its shares were up 1.3% at 0842 GMT.\n\nCEO Patrick Pouyanne said at a press briefing that he expects the company to be able to continue investing in renewable energy in the U.S., and added that exports of U.S. LNG are set to practically double in the coming years.\n\nThe French firm is the U.S.'s largest LNG exporter with more than 10 million tons under contract.\n\nTotal announced a 7% increase in the 2024 dividend to 3.22 euros per share, and for 2025 confirmed share buybacks of $2 billion per quarter.\n\nRBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said Total's announced dividend growth was \"higher than we anticipated\", and added that the reported 8% gearing \"should allay any concerns around debt levels\".\n\nWestern oil majors are facing reduced economic activity and competition from new African and Asian refineries, which caused profit margins for converting crude oil into fuel products to collapse last year. The trend is expected to continue in 2025.\n\nTotal's European refining margin for the fourth quarter was $25.90 per metric ton \u2014 half the $50.10 realized in late 2023 \u2014 while crude oil prices were nearly $10 per barrel lower than the previous year.\n\nLast week Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil all reported fourth-quarter earnings hard hit by the downturn in refining margins.\n\nTotal was able to end the year on a higher note thanks to its integrated LNG division, where traders captured higher profits due to market volatility and boosted earnings by 35% to $1.4 billion.\n\n(Reporting by America Hernandez and Benjamin Mallet in Paris; Editing by Jan Harvey)\n\nCopyright 2025 Thomson Reuters.",

            "content": "In the Oil & Gas business, fourth quarter production was 2.43 Mboe/d, benefiting from the ramp up of projects commencing in 2024. With oil prices down $5/b compared to previous quarter, partially offset by higher gas prices, Exploration & Production delivered a strong quarter, with adjusted net operating income of $2.3 billion and cash flow of $3.9 billion. In 2024, TotalEnergies achieved five major projects start-ups (Mero-2 and Mero-3 in Brazil, Anchor in the United States, Fenix in Argentina and Tyra in Denmark) that support 2025 production growth of more than 3%. Exploration & Production generated adjusted net operating income of $10 billion and cash flow of $17 billion. During the year, the Company sanctioned major oil projects in Suriname, Brazil and Angola, driving an outstanding reserves replacement ratio (157%) and a proved reserves life index greater than 12 years, reflecting the depth of TotalEnergies\u2019 Upstream portfolio. In 2024, TotalEnergies confirmed its low cost and low emission O&G model, with operating costs below $5/boe and GHG emissions \u2020 and notably methane emissions down 3% and 15%, respectively, over the year.\n\nIn 2024, TotalEnergies reported adjusted net income of $18.3 billion and cash flow of $29.9 billion in a softer environment mainly affected by a sharp decline in refining margins, after two exceptional years. 2024 IFRS net income was $15.8 billion (\u20ac14.6 billion). The Company achieved nearly a 15% return on average capital employed in 2024, the best among the majors for the third consecutive year. TotalEnergies continued to implement its balanced growth strategy in a disciplined manner by investing $17.8 billion in 2024, of which one third was in new Oil & Gas projects and $4.8 billion in low-carbon energies, including $3.9 billion in Integrated Power. With $8 billion in share buybacks*, payout reached 50% of cash flow. TotalEnergies ended the year with gearing below 10%, highlighting the Company\u2019s strong financial health.\n\n\"During the fourth quarter, TotalEnergies leveraged its multi-energy integrated model, benefiting notably from strong performance in Integrated LNG and Integrated Power, with $4.4 billion of adjusted net income, up 8% compared to the third quarter, and $7.2 billion of CFFO, up 5%.\n\nThe Board of Directors of TotalEnergies SE, chaired by CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, met on February 4, 2025, to approve the 4 th quarter and the full-year 2024 financial statements. On the occasion, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 said:\n\nIn 2024, in a softer environment than 2023, TotalEnergies leveraged its multi-energy integrated strategy, posting adjusted net income of more than $18B and a 14.8% ROACE, the best among the majors\n\nTotalEnergies generated $4.4B of adjusted net income, up 8%, for the fourth quarter thanks to strong performance in Integrated LNG and Integrated Power\n\nStory Continues\n\nIntegrated LNG results meaningfully increased sequentially with adjusted net operating income and cash flow of $1.4 billion, up 35% and 63%, respectively, compared to the third quarter, driven by 6% production growth, average LNG prices above $10/Mbtu and LNG trading performance back to the level of the fourth quarter 2023, taking advantage of higher market volatility. For full-year 2024, Integrated LNG generated adjusted net operating income and cash flow of $4.9 billion. The Company enriched its portfolio in 2024 with the launch of Marsa LNG in Oman, Ubeta in Nigeria, the Sapura OMV acquisition in Malaysia and the acquisition of dry gas assets in the Eagle Ford basin in Texas. Moreover, TotalEnergies continued to successfully market its LNG volumes by signing several new medium-term sales contracts (6 Mt/ year) in Asia, mostly Brent-indexed.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Integrated Power continued its track record of strong performance throughout the year with a higher adjusted net operating income of $575 million and cash flow of $604 million. Full-year 2024 cash flow totaled $2.6 billion, up 19% year-on-year and in line with annual Company guidance, and with a ROACE of 10%. Net electricity production increased 23% year-on-year to 41 TWh and contributed to reducing the average lifecycle carbon intensity of all energy products sold by the Company to its clients (-17% vs. 2015). During 2024, TotalEnergies continued to deploy its differentiated Integrated Power model in key targeted markets through strategic acquisitions: Quadra Energy and VSB that strengthen the Company\u2019s position in Germany, and gas-fired power plants in the United States and the United Kingdom that further enhance the Company\u2019s flexible generation capacity. Thanks to its portfolio, TotalEnergies anticipates growing power production to more than 50 TWh in 2025, equivalent to 10% of its hydrocarbon production.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, in a globally weak margin environment, Downstream adjusted net operating income was $680 million, up 12%, and cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 15%, following a $10/t increase in European refining margins. Full-year 2024 adjusted net operating income was $3.5 billion, down from 2023 levels due to a sharp decline (-44%) in European refining margins and downgraded operations in some units. Importantly, cash flow remained above $6 billion, demonstrating the resilience of the Company\u2019s integrated Downstream model.\n\nIn view of the free cash flow growth outlook and share buybacks executed in 2024 (5% of the share capital), the Board of Directors will propose at the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting to be held on May 23, 2025, the distribution of a final 2024 dividend of \u20ac0.85/share, resulting in an increase of 7% for the 2024 dividend to \u20ac3.22/share, compared to the 2023 dividend. Furthermore, the Board of Directors confirmed a shareholder return policy for 2025 targeting >40% CFFO payout, which will combine interim dividends increasing by 7.6% to \u20ac0.85/share and $2 billion of share buybacks per quarter, a level which will be pursued under reasonable market conditions.\"\n\n1.

Outlook\n\nAt the beginning of 2025, Brent prices remain volatile between $70 and $80/b, supported by the willingness of OPEC+ countries to balance oil markets that are facing strong supply growth from non-OPEC countries (US, Guyana, Brazil). According to the IEA, global oil demand is anticipated to grow by 1.1 Mb/d in 2025, up from a 0.8 Mb/d increase in 2024.\n\nEuropean gas prices increased at the end of 2024 and forward markets currently expect prices to be above $13/Mbtu in the first quarter of 2025, supported by high winter consumption and rapid inventory declines in Europe in the context of the interruption of Russian imports via Ukraine. Gas markets should remain in tension in 2025 due to very limited expected capacity additions related to delays of some projects. TotalEnergies expects more than 40 Mt of LNG sales in 2025. Given the evolution of oil and gas prices in the recent months and the lag effect on price formulas, TotalEnergies anticipates its average LNG selling price will be above $10/Mbtu in the first quarter 2025.\n\nIn 2025, TotalEnergies anticipates its hydrocarbon production will grow more than 3%, benefiting from the ramp-up of 2024 start-ups and production start-ups, notably Ballymore in the Gulf of Mexico and Mero-4 in Brazil.\n\nFirst quarter 2025 hydrocarbon production is expected to be between 2.5 and 2.55 Mboe/d thanks to the ramp-up of 2024 start-ups and the closing of the acquisitions of SapuraOMV in Malaysia and of interests in the Eagle Ford shale gas play in Texas that occurred during the fourth quarter 2024.\n\nThe Integrated Power segment is expected to expand in 2025 supported by electricity production growth greater than 20% to reach an annual net electricity generation of more than 50 TWh. Cash flow before working capital (CFFO) is expected to be between $2.5 and $3 billion in 2025.\n\nBy combining hydrocarbon and electricity production growth, the Company expects to increase energy production by 5% in 2025. Integrated Power production will represent 10% of hydrocarbon production.\n\nFor 2025, TotalEnergies expects net investments of $17 to $17.5 billion, of which $4.5 billion is dedicated to low carbon energies, mostly Integrated Power. Organic investments should amount to approximately $17 billion, focused on core growth projects to achieve 2030 production targets, down from the $18 billion guidance presented during the Strategy & Outlook in October 2024.\n\n* * * *\n\nTo listen to the conference call with Chairman & CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 and CFO Jean-Pierre Sbraire today at 3:00pm (Paris time), please log on to totalenergies.com or dial +33 (0) 1 70 37 71 66, +44 (0) 33 0551 0200 or +1 786 697 3501.

Acquisitions net of assets sales refer to acquisitions minus assets sales (including other operations with non-controlling interests). This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it illustrates the allocation of cash flow used for growing the Company\u2019s asset base via external growth opportunities.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Net Income. It refers to the adjusted earnings before depreciation, depletion and impairment of tangible and intangible assets and mineral interests, income tax expense and cost of net debt, i.e., all operating income and contribution of equity affiliates to net income. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to measure and compare the Company\u2019s profitability with utility companies (energy sector).\n\nAdjusted net income (TotalEnergies share) is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Net Income (TotalEnergies share). Adjusted Net Income (TotalEnergies share) refers to Net Income (TotalEnergies share) less adjustment items to Net Income (TotalEnergies share). Adjustment items are inventory valuation effect, effect of changes in fair value, and special items. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating results and to understand its operating trends by removing the impact of non-operational results and special items.\n\nAdjusted net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Net Income. Adjusted Net Operating Income refers to Net Income before net cost of net debt, i.e., cost of net debt net of its tax effects, less adjustment items. Adjustment items are inventory valuation effect, effect of changes in fair value, and special items. Adjusted Net Operating Income can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating results and understanding its operating trends, by removing the impact of non-operational results and special items and is used to evaluate the Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) as explained below.\n\nCapital Employed is a non-GAAP financial measure. They are calculated at replacement cost and refer to capital employed (balance sheet) less inventory valuations effect. Capital employed (balance sheet) refers to the sum of the following items: (i) Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, net, (ii) Investments & loans in equity affiliates, (iii) Other non-current assets, (iv) Working capital which is the sum of: Inventories, net, Accounts receivable, net, other current assets, Accounts payable, Other creditors and accrued liabilities(v) Provisions and other non-current liabilities and (vi) Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. Capital Employed can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to provide insight on the amount of capital investment used by the Company or its business segments to operate. Capital Employed is used to calculate the Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE).\n\nCash Flow From Operations excluding working capital (CFFO) is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow from operating activities. Cash Flow From Operations excluding working capital is defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital at replacement cost, excluding the mark-to-market effect of Integrated LNG and Integrated Power contracts, including capital gain from renewable projects sales and including organic loan repayments from equity affiliates.\n\nThis indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to help understand changes in cash flow from operating activities, excluding the impact of working capital changes across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance of peer companies in a manner that, when viewed in combination with the Company\u2019s results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company\u2019s business and performance. This performance indicator is used by the Company as a base for its cash flow allocation and notably to guide on the share of its cash flow to be allocated to the distribution to shareholders.\n\nDebt adjusted cash flow (DACF) is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow from operating activities. DACF is defined as Cash Flow From Operations excluding working capital (CFFO) without financial charges. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it corresponds to the funds theoretically available to the Company for investments, debt repayment and distribution to shareholders, and therefore facilitates comparison of the Company\u2019s results of operations with those of other registrants, independent of their capital structure and working capital requirements.\n\nFree cash flow after Organic Investments is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow from operating activities. Free cash flow after Organic Investments, refers to Cash Flow From Operations excluding working capital minus Organic Investments. Organic Investments refer to Net Investments excluding acquisitions, asset sales and other transactions with non-controlling interests. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it illustrates operating cash flow generated by the business post allocation of cash for Organic Investments.\n\nGearing is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is the ratio of total financial liabilities to total equity. Gearing is a Net-debt-to-capital ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of Net debt excluding leases to (Equity + Net debt excluding leases). This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to assess the strength of the Company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nNet cash flow (or free cash-flow) is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow from operating activities. Net cash flow refers to Cash Flow From Operations excluding working capital minus Net Investments. Net cash flow can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it illustrates cash flow generated by the operations of the Company post allocation of cash for Organic Investments and Acquisitions net of assets sales (acquisitions - assets sales - other operations with non-controlling interests). This performance indicator corresponds to the cash flow available to repay debt and allocate cash to shareholder distribution or share buybacks.\n\nNet investments is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow used in investing activities. Net Investments refer to Cash flow used in investing activities including other transactions with non-controlling interests, including change in debt from renewable projects financing, including expenditures related to carbon credits, including capex linked to capitalized leasing contracts and excluding organic loan repayment from equity affiliates. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to illustrate the cash directed to growth opportunities, both internal and external, thereby showing, when combined with the Company\u2019s cash flow statement prepared under IFRS, how cash is generated and allocated for uses within the organization. Net Investments are the sum of Organic Investments and Acquisitions net of assets sales each of which is described in the Glossary.\n\nOrganic investments is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow used in investing activities. Organic investments refers to Net Investments, excluding acquisitions, asset sales and other operations with non-controlling interests. Organic Investments can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it illustrates cash flow used by the Company to grow its asset base, excluding sources of external growth.\n\nPayout is a non-GAAP financial measure. Payout is defined as the ratio of the dividends and share buybacks for cancellation to the Cash Flow From Operations excluding working capital. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders as it provides the portion of the Cash Flow From Operations excluding working capital distributed to the shareholder.\n\nReturn on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. ROACE is the ratio of Adjusted Net Operating Income to average Capital Employed at replacement cost between the beginning and the end of the period. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to measure the profitability of the Company\u2019s average Capital Employed in its business operations and is used by the Company to benchmark its performance internally and externally with its peers.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe terms \"TotalEnergies\", \"TotalEnergies company\" and \"Company\" in this document are used to designate TotalEnergies SE and the consolidated entities directly or indirectly controlled by TotalEnergies SE. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" may also be used to refer to these entities or their employees. The entities in which TotalEnergies SE directly or indirectly owns a shareholding are separate and independent legal entities.\n\nThis press release presents the results for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year of 2024 from the consolidated financial statements of TotalEnergies SE as of December 31, 2024 (unaudited). The audit procedures by the Statutory Auditors are underway. The consolidated financial statements (unaudited) are available on the website totalenergies.com.

This document may also contain statements regarding the perspectives, objectives, areas of improvement and goals of TotalEnergies, including with respect to climate change and carbon neutrality (net zero emissions). An ambition expresses an outcome desired by TotalEnergies, it being specified that the means to be deployed do not depend solely on TotalEnergies. These forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of the future or conditional tense or forward-looking words such as \"will\", \"should\", \"could\", \"would\", \"may\", \"likely\", \"might\", \"envisions\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"considers\", \"plans\", \"expects\", \"thinks\", \"targets\", \"aims\" or similar terminology. Such forward-looking statements included in this document are based on economic data, estimates and assumptions prepared in a given economic, competitive and regulatory environment and considered to be reasonable by TotalEnergies as of the date of this document. These forward-looking statements are not historical data and should not be interpreted as assurances that the perspectives, objectives or goals announced will be achieved. They may prove to be inaccurate in the future, and may evolve or be modified with a significant difference between the actual results and those initially estimated, due to the uncertainties notably related to the economic, financial, competitive and regulatory environment, or due to the occurrence of risk factors, such as, notably, the price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas, the evolution of the demand and price of petroleum products, the changes in production results and reserves estimates, the ability to achieve cost reductions and operating efficiencies without unduly disrupting business operations, changes in laws and regulations including those related to the environment and climate, currency fluctuations, technological innovations, meteorological conditions and events, as well as socio-demographic, economic and political developments, changes in market conditions, loss of market share and changes in consumer preferences, or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, certain financial information is based on estimates particularly in the assessment of the recoverable value of assets and potential impairments of assets relating thereto. Readers are cautioned not to consider forward-looking statements as accurate, but as an expression of the Company\u2019s views only as of the date this document is published. TotalEnergies SE and its subsidiaries have no obligation, make no commitment and expressly disclaim any responsibility to investors or any stakeholder to update or revise, particularly as a result of new information or future events, any forward-looking information or statement, objectives or trends contained in this document. In addition, the Company has not verified, and is under no obligation to verify any third-party data contained in this document or used in the estimates and assumptions or, more generally, forward-looking statements published in this document. The information on risk factors that could have a significant adverse effect on TotalEnergies\u2019 business, financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow, reputation, outlook or the value of financial instruments issued by TotalEnergies is provided in the most recent version of the Universal Registration Document which is filed by TotalEnergies SE with the French Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers and the annual report on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Additionally, the developments of environmental and climate change-related issues in this document are based on various frameworks and the interests of various stakeholders which are subject to evolve independently of our will. Moreover, our disclosures on such issues, including climate-related disclosures, may include information that is not necessarily \"material\" under US securities laws for SEC reporting purposes or under applicable securities law.\n\nFinancial information by business segment is reported in accordance with the internal reporting system and shows internal segment information that is used to manage and measure the performance of TotalEnergies. In addition to IFRS measures, certain alternative performance indicators are presented, such as performance indicators excluding the adjustment items described below (adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating income, adjusted net income), return on equity (ROE), return on average capital employed (ROACE), gearing ratio, operating cash flow before working capital changes, the shareholder rate of return. These indicators are meant to facilitate the analysis of the financial performance of TotalEnergies and the comparison of income between periods. They allow investors to track the measures used internally to manage and measure the performance of TotalEnergies.\n\nThese adjustment items include:\n\n(i) Special items\n\nDue to their unusual nature or particular significance, certain transactions qualifying as \"special items\" are excluded from the business segment figures. In general, special items relate to transactions that are significant, infrequent, or unusual. However, in certain instances, transactions such as restructuring costs or assets disposals, which are not considered to be representative of the normal course of business, may qualify as special items although they may have occurred in prior years or are likely to occur in following years.\n\n(ii) The inventory valuation effect\n\nIn accordance with IAS 2, TotalEnergies values inventories of petroleum products in its financial statements according to the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method and other inventories using the weighted-average cost method. Under the FIFO method, the cost of inventory is based on the historic cost of acquisition or manufacture rather than the current replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on the reported income. Accordingly, the adjusted results of the Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services segments are presented according to the replacement cost method. This method is used to assess the segments\u2019 performance and facilitate the comparability of the segments\u2019 performance with those of its main competitors.\n\nIn the replacement cost method, which approximates the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method, the variation of inventory values in the statement of income is, depending on the nature of the inventory, determined using either the month-end prices differential between one period and another or the average prices of the period rather than the historical value. The inventory valuation effect is the difference between the results under the FIFO and the replacement cost methods.\n\n(iii) Effect of changes in fair value\n\nThe effect of changes in fair value presented as an adjustment item reflects, for trading inventories and storage contracts, differences between internal measures of performance used by TotalEnergies\u2019 Executive Committee and the accounting for these transactions under IFRS.\n\nIFRS requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair value using period-end spot prices. In order to best reflect the management of economic exposure through derivative transactions, internal indicators used to measure performance include valuations of trading inventories based on forward prices.\n\nTotalEnergies, in its trading activities, enters into storage contracts, whose future effects are recorded at fair value in TotalEnergies\u2019 internal economic performance. IFRS precludes recognition of this fair value effect.\n\nFurthermore, TotalEnergies enters into derivative instruments to risk manage certain operational contracts or assets. Under IFRS, these derivatives are recorded at fair value while the underlying operational transactions are recorded as they occur. Internal indicators defer the fair value on derivatives to match with the transaction occurrence.\n\nThe adjusted results (adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating income, adjusted net income) are defined as replacement cost results, adjusted for special items, excluding the effect of changes in fair value.\n\nEuro amounts presented for the fully adjusted-diluted earnings per share represent dollar amounts converted at the average euro-dollar (\u20ac-$) exchange rate for the applicable period and are not the result of financial statements prepared in euros.\n\nCautionary Note to U.S. Investors \u2013 The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to separately disclose proved, probable and possible reserves that a company has determined in accordance with SEC rules. We may use certain terms in this press release, such as \"potential reserves\" or \"resources\", that the SEC\u2019s guidelines strictly prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in the Form 20-F of TotalEnergies SE, File N\u00b0 1-10888, available from us at 2, place Jean Millier \u2013 Arche Nord Coupole/Regnault - 92078 Paris-La D\u00e9fense Cedex, France, or at the Company website totalenergies.com. You can also obtain this form from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or on the SEC\u2019s website sec.gov.\n\n(1) Refer to Glossary pages 23 & 24 for the definitions and further information on alternative performance measures (Non-GAAP measures) and to page 19 and following for reconciliation tables. * Including coverage of employees share grant plans. \u2020 Scope 1+2 of Oil & Gas operated activities (2) Some of the transactions mentioned in the highlights remain subject to the agreement of the authorities or to the fulfilment of conditions precedent under the terms of the agreements. (3) Effective tax rate = (tax on adjusted net operating income) / (adjusted net operating income \u2013 income from equity affiliates \u2013 dividends received from investments \u2013 impairment of goodwill + tax on adjusted net operating income). (4) In accordance with IFRS rules, adjusted fully-diluted earnings per share is calculated from the adjusted net income less the interest on the perpetual subordinated bonds. (5) Average \u20ac-$ exchange rate: 1.0681 in the 4th quarter 2024, 1.0983 in the 3rd quarter 2024, 1.0751 in the 4th quarter 2023, 1.0824 in 2024, and 1.0813 in 2023. (6) Does not include oil, gas and LNG trading activities, respectively. (7) Sales in $ / Sales in volume for consolidated affiliates. (8) Sales in $ / Sales in volume for consolidated affiliates. (9) Sales in $ / Sales in volume for consolidated and equity affiliates. (10) This market indicator for European refining, calculated based on public market prices ($/t), uses a basket of crudes, petroleum product yields and variable costs representative of the European refining system of TotalEnergies. (11) The six greenhouse gases in the Kyoto protocol, namely CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, with their respective GWP (Global Warming Potential) as described in the 2021 IPCC report. HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are virtually absent from the Company\u2019s emissions or are considered as non-material and are therefore not counted. (12) Scope 1+2 GHG emissions of operated facilities are defined as the sum of direct emissions of greenhouse gases from sites or activities that are included in the scope of reporting (as defined in the Company\u2019s 2023 Universal Registration Document) and indirect emissions attributable to brought-in energy (electricity, heat, steam), excluding purchased industrial gases (H2). (13) TotalEnergies reports Scope 3 GHG emissions, category 11, which correspond to indirect GHG emissions related to the end use of energy products sold to the Company\u2019s customers, i.e., from their combustion, i.e., combustion of the products to obtain energy. The Company follows the oil & gas industry reporting guidelines published by IPIECA, which comply with the GHG Protocol methodologies. In order to avoid double counting, this methodology accounts for the largest volume in the oil, biofuels and gas value chains, i.e., the higher of the two production volumes or sales. For TotalEnergies in 2024, the calculation of scope 3 GHG emissions for the oil and biofuels value chains considers product sales (higher than production) and for the gas value chain, marketable gas production (higher than gas sales either as LNG or as part of direct sales to B2B/B2C). (14) Company production = E&P production + Integrated LNG production. (15) Effective tax rate = (tax on adjusted net operating income) / (adjusted net operating income \u2013 income from equity affiliates \u2013 dividends received from investments \u2013 impairment of goodwill + tax on adjusted net operating income). (16) Sensitivities are revised once per year upon publication of the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter results. Sensitivities are estimates based on assumptions about TotalEnergies\u2019 portfolio in 2025. Actual results could vary significantly from estimates based on the application of these sensitivities. The impact of the $-\u20ac sensitivity on adjusted net operating income is essentially attributable to Refining & Chemicals. (17) In a 70-80 $/b Brent environment. (18) End-of-period data.

The hosts and Cote d\u2019Ivoire contested the final, which was won 2-1 by the North African nation.\n\nThe finals have been played every two years since then, and hosted all around the continent, including the likes of Mauritius (1993), Benin (2005), Zambia 92017) and Mauritania (2021).\n\n\n\nPAST WINNERS\n\nNigeria (1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 2005, 2011, 2015) have been the most successful nation in the competition with seven wins in total (though three since it staged with a single host).\n\nGhana (1993, 1999, 2009, 2021) and Egypt (1981, 1991, 2003, 2013) have four wins each, with no other nation managing to lift the trophy more than ounce after that.\n\nAlgeria (1979), Cameroon (1995), Morocco (1997), Angola (2001), Congo (2007), Zambia (2017), Mali (2019) and Senegal (2023) have all lifted the trophy.\n\nMOST APPEARANCES AT THE FINALS\n\nNigeria and Egypt will have each appeared at 19 tournaments when the 2025 edition is played in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, which they have each again qualified for.\n\nCameroon have been involved in 16 tournament, one more than Ghana, who are fourth on the list. There will be two debutants in the field for 2025, with Sierra Leone and Kenya both appearing for the first time. Tanzania will be making their second appearances having first qualified in 2021.\n\nSOME GREAT NAMES\n\nMany current top players have passed through the TotalEnergies CAF U20 AFCON.\n\nPremier League strikers Taiwo Awoniyi (Nottingham Forest & Nigeria) and Patson Daka (Leicester City & Zambia), as well as Ligue 1 midfielders Kr\u00e9pin Diatta (Monaco & Senegal) and Lamine Camara (Monaco & Senegal) all played in recent tournaments.\n\nGoing further back, Baffour Gyan (Ghana), Emad Moteab (Egypt), Yaya Tour\u00e8 (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) and Benni McCarthy (South Africa) were also players who passed through the tournament.",

Its role is to produce high value-added refined products from heavy crude oil. In December 2022, both partners also signed an investment agreement to build Amiral, a giant petrochemical complex, which will be integrated with the existing site. The complex will ultimately be owned and operated by the SATORP refinery.\n\nIn 2008, TotalEnergies and Saudi Aramco established the first joint venture between the two companies, culminating in the construction of SATORP, a refining and petrochemical platform located in the industrial city of Jubail on the country's east coast.\n\nSATORP, one of the most efficient platforms in the world\n\nOperational since 2014, SATORP is not only one of the largest refining and petrochemical platforms in the world, but also one of the most complex and efficient. SATORP is a full-conversion platform, meaning that it can convert heavy, high-sulfur crude oil that is especially difficult to process into high value-added refined products, without producing heavy fuel oil or bitumen. To achieve this, the refinery relies on a full range of processing units:\n\ntwo distillate hydrocrackers to convert heavy petroleum fractions into lighter, ultra-low-sulfur products;\n\nto convert heavy petroleum fractions into lighter, ultra-low-sulfur products; a fluid catalytic cracking unit that produces a wide variety of products, including very light hydrocarbons, such as propylene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); and\n\nthat produces a wide variety of products, including very light hydrocarbons, such as propylene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); and a coking unit (coking is a thermal process used to convert heavy fractions into light petroleum products and coke).\n\nThe SATORP platform's production capacity has gradually been raised from 400,000 barrels of crude oil a day in 2014 to 460,000 barrels. Its annual output is approximately 22 million tons of refined petroleum products, including 700,000 tons of paraxylene, 150,000 tons of benzene and 210,000 tons of high-purity propylene.\n\nIn addition to the SATORP platform, TotalEnergies and Saudi Aramco have strengthened their partnership by investing in a new complementary project to build a vast world-scale petrochemical complex fully integrated with the refinery. Called Amiral, this project represents an investment of $11 billion. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2023 with commercial operation planned for 2027.\n\nView text version\n\n\u00d7 Infographic presenting key figures about the SATORP refinery The SATORP refinery is located in Jubail, in Saudi Arabia. SATORP is one of the six integrated refining and petrochemical platforms of TotalEnergies. Operational since 2014. The production capacity of the SATORP site is 460,000 of barrels of crude oil per day. SATORP employs 1,200 people, of which some are seconded by TotalEnergies.\n\nA platform clearly geared towards the future\n\nSATORP is committed to championing the circular economy. In July 2022, it received the international ISCC Plus certification for its circular economy projects. This is the first refinery in the Middle East / North Africa to obtain this certification. The platform is developing various projects, including the production of circular polymers using oils from recycled plastic waste, and the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from used cooking oils. The refinery produced its first batch of recycled polymers in November 2022.\n\nSATORP is also focused on its target of reducing its carbon footprint in line with TotalEnergies' ambition to achieve net zero by 2050, together with society. Sustainable development is another cornerstone of the Amiral petrochemical project and is not only reflected in the design of its facilities, but also demonstrated in the project's execution and its construction phase.\n\nOur initiatives to promote training and local development at the SATORP site\n\nSATORP employs 1,200 people, nearly 80% of whom are Saudi nationals. They include 28 young Saudi engineers, who were given the opportunity of completing their studies in France through a partnership with IFP \u00c9nergies Nouvelles. In addition, nearly 400 Saudi operators received on-site training in a dedicated training center created by SATORP. This training strategy will be pursued as part of the Amiral project.\n\nThe SATORP platform is committed to fostering diversity. In 2014, it was the first company in Jubail's industrial zone to employ a female engineer. Since then, SATORP has been successfully leading initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion. Today, some 30 women are employed in operational or support positions.",

            "content": "IN recent years, Africa\u2019s investment climate has seen significant fluctuations, with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) declining amid widespread economic uncertainties. Nigeria, as the continent\u2019s second-largest economy, hasn\u2019t been immune to these challenges. Issues such as economic instability, currency volatility, and rising operational costs\u2014compounded by increasing inflation\u2014have made doing business in Nigeria increasingly difficult. As a result, more than 20 companies have shut down and relocated their investments to other markets between 2020 and 2024. This exodus has not only affected the business landscape but has also led to substantial job losses, further aggravating the already dire youth unemployment situation in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, in this dire strait, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited and other International Oil Companies, some of which are in Joint Venture operations with the former, offered a glimmer of hope by making Nigeria Africa\u2019s top upstream investment destination of choice in 2024.\n\nA market intelligence firm, Wood Mackenzie, in its recent report, shows that Nigeria ranks as Africa\u2019s leading destination for upstream oil and gas investment in 2024. The country accounted for three out of four Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) totalling $13.5 billion announced by global oil and gas majors in 2024.\n\nThe FIDs announced within the Nigerian market included Shell\u2019s $122 million investment in the Iseni Gas Project, TotalEnergies\u2019 $566 million commitment to the Ubeta Gas Project and Shell\u2019s approval of the Bonga North Tranche 1 project, estimated to be a $5 billion investment.\n\nIseni Gas Project\n\nShell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) and its joint venture (JV) partners, in February 2024, decided to move ahead with the development of the Iseni gas field in Nigeria to supply the Dangote Fertiliser and Petrochemical Plant.\n\nThe company\u2019s JV partners include the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, TotalEnergies EP Nigeria, and Nigerian Agip Oil (NAOC). SPDC is the operator of the JV.\n\nSPDC explained that the initiative would involve the construction of a dedicated gas facility by the JV to supply 100 million standard cubic feet of gas per day to the Dangote Fertiliser and Petrochemical Plant for 10 years.\n\nSPDC Managing Director, Osagie Okunbor, said that the FID marked a major step in underpinning the Nigerian government\u2019s \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 vision.\n\nOkunbor said, \u201cThis investment decision is a critical step in pursuing the development of the gas-rich Iseni field, which is part of the Okpokunou Cluster in Oil Mining Lease 35 located in Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.\u201d\n\nHe further said that the project would boost gas deliveries to the domestic market and contribute to driving economic growth.\n\nThe $2.5bn Dangote Fertiliser and Petrochemical Plant is said to be the largest urea complex in the African continent. Its production capacity is three million tonnes per annum, which meets 65 percent of the fertiliser requirements in Nigeria. Furthermore, the plant caters to all the key markets in the sub-region.\n\nThe Minister of State, Petroleum Resources (Gas), Ekperikpe Ekpo, said, \u201cI am extremely excited with SPDC, NNPCL, TotalEnergies, NAOC who worked assiduously for the realisation of the FID on the Iseni project that is capable of producing the equivalent of 400MW of energy, which will be delivered into the domestic market when construction is completed.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant milestone in our quest to achieve our aspirations of the Decade of Gas initiative.\u201d\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell has in January 2024 signed an agreement to divest SPDC to Renaissance, a group of four Nigeria-based exploration and production firms and an international energy group.\n\n$566 million Ubeta Gas Project\n\nThe $550 million upstream gas project between NNPC Ltd and TotalEnergies on the development of the Ubeta field took off in September 2024.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Energy, Olu Verheijen, disclosed this during an inaugural US-Nigeria Strategic Energy Dialogue, hosted by the U.S. State Department in Washington, DC.\n\nThe signing ceremony of the $550 million FID on the Ubeta Field Development Project took place in Abuja in June 2024. The Ubeta field, which was discovered in 1964, is located northwest of Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural US-Nigeria Strategic Energy Dialogue, Verheijen explained that the upstream gas project would deliver 350 million standard cubic feet of gas per day when operational.\n\nShe added that major energy reforms introduced by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu since June 2023 focused on improving energy security, attracting investments, and deepening collaboration with key partners, including the US government.\n\nShe said the key reforms had improved the viability of the gas-to-power value chain of the country.\n\nThe reforms, according to her, included initiatives to improve cash flows in electricity distribution through smart metering and the payment of outstanding debts owed to investors and to reduce carbon emissions from gas production.\n\nShe added that the President issued five new executive orders to support the reform efforts, aimed at providing fiscal incentives for investment and reducing the cost and time of finalising and implementing contracts to develop and expand gas infrastructure.\n\nThe presidential aide said the directives were aimed at immediately unlocking up to $2.5 billion in new oil and gas investments in the country.\n\nResponding, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Energy Resources, Geoffrey Pyatt, said the dialogue was apt and strategic.\n\n\u201cThe inaugural U.S.-Nigeria Strategic Energy Dialogue has set the stage for strengthened energy collaboration between the United States and Nigeria. Together, we\u2019re advancing shared energy security, decarbonisation, and economic growth goals,\u201d he said.\n\nBonga North deep-water project\n\nAlso in December 2024, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCo), a subsidiary of Shell plc, announced a final investment decision (FID) on Bonga North, a deep-water project off the coast of Nigeria.\n\nThe company said Bonga North would be a subsea tie-back to the Shell-operated Bonga Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility which Shell operates with a 55% interest.\n\nThe $5 billion Bonga North project involves drilling, completing, and starting up 16 wells (8 production and 8 water injection wells), modifications to the existing Bonga Main FPSO and the installation of new subsea hardware tied back to the FPSO, according to the company.\n\nThe project is expected to sustain oil and gas production at the Bonga facility.\n\nBonga North currently has an estimated recoverable resource volume of more than 300 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and will reach a peak production of 110,000 barrels of oil a day, with the first oil anticipated by the end of the decade.\n\n\u201cThis is another significant investment, which will help us to maintain stable liquids production from our advantaged Upstream portfolio,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Yujnovich, Shell\u2019s Integrated Gas and Upstream Director.\n\nAccording to the oil giant, Bonga North will help ensure Shell\u2019s leading Integrated Gas and Upstream business continues to drive cash generation into the next decade.\n\nSNEPCo (55%) operates the Bonga field in partnership with Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd. (20%), Nigerian Agip Exploration Ltd. (12.5%), and TotalEnergies Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd. (12.5%), on behalf of Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC).\n\nBonga is a deep-water development located in OML 118, at water depths exceeding 1,000 meters. Production at the Bonga FPSO began in 2005, with a capacity to produce 225,000 barrels of oil per day. The project produced its one-billionth barrel of crude oil in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe investment in Bonga North is expected to generate an internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the hurdle rate for Shell\u2019s upstream business,\u201d Shell said.\n\nPresident Tinubu welcomes investment\n\nPresident Bola Ahmed Tinubu welcomes Shell and its partners\u2019 announcement of the Final Investment Decision (FID) on the Bonga North Deep Offshore Field. This landmark development, Nigeria\u2019s first deepwater oil project in over a decade, underscores the transformative impact of the President\u2019s policies and reforms in attracting investments in the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe Bonga North oilfield represents an impressive estimated $5 billion investment and is expected to yield approximately 350 million barrels of crude oil.\n\nTinubu remarked, \u201cThe Renewed Hope Agenda fundamentally focuses on attracting investments to transform the Nigerian economy and deliver prosperity to our people. We designed our policies and reforms from the start of my administration to achieve this goal. Shell and its partners\u2019 decision to invest in Bonga North affirms the success of our efforts. We will continue to offer the necessary support to ensure their success and the realisation of Nigeria\u2019s energy potential.\u201d\n\nSignificant Gas Sales Agreement\n\nIn October 2024, the NNPC and three IOCs\u2014Shell Petroleum Development Company, TotalEnergies, and Eni\u2014signed a Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) for the $3.5 billion Brass Fertiliser and Petrochemical project in Bayelsa State. This agreement involves the supply of 270 million standard cubic feet of gas per day to the project, marking the largest single GSPA to any domestic gas off-taker in Nigeria. The project is expected to generate over $1.5 billion annually from exports of fertilizers, petrochemicals, and other gas-based products. The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Gas), Ekperikpe Ekpo, highlighted that this milestone demonstrated Nigeria\u2019s business-friendly environment and the government\u2019s commitment to investor-friendly policies.\n\nExperts\u2019 comment\n\nWith a total of $13.5 billion FIDs announced in Niger in 2024, the African Energy Chamber applauded the government\u2019s policy reforms and commended the nation\u2019s dedication to simplifying policies and facilitating market growth for global oil and gas investors.\n\nAccording to the AEC, the investments reflect Nigeria\u2019s ongoing efforts to unlock its hydrocarbon potential through investor-friendly policies and strategic global partnerships.\n\nThe Chamber commended the Nigerian government for its proactive legislation aimed at attracting foreign investments, streamlining project implementation and reducing bottlenecks.\n\nIn 2024, Nigeria introduced several initiatives to create a conducive environment for oil and gas investors, including new tax incentives aimed at attracting up to $10 billion in natural gas investments \u2013 offering tax relief for gas investors, reducing corporate income tax and extending capital allowance benefits \u2013 for deepwater gas projects.\n\nOther policies include the Presidential Directive on Local Content Compliance Requirements, 2024 to address reduction in oil and gas investments caused by high operating costs compared to global markets. The Presidential Directive on Reduction of Petroleum Sector Contracting Costs and Timelines, 2024 reduces time spent to award contracts for oil and gas projects.\n\nIn addition to the directives, Nigeria also launched its 2024 oil and gas licensing round, offering 19 blocks for exploration, demonstrating its commitment to continued collaboration with local, regional and international partners.\n\n\u201cWith this momentum, further FIDs are anticipated, including TotalEnergies\u2019 expected $750 million commitment to the Ima Shallow Gas Project in 2025,\u201d the AEC said.\n\nWith 45% of the Nigerian population lacking access to electricity and affordable and reliable energy, the Chamber believes the FIDs and policies are a right step in driving the country\u2019s universal energy access and socioeconomic development targets.\n\n\u201cNigeria continues to set a benchmark for investor-friendly policies, leveraging its hydrocarbon potential and government initiatives to drive sustainable development,\u201d stated NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the AEC, adding \u201cThe Chamber commends President Tinubu, Special Adviser to the President on Energy Olu Arowolo Verheijen and Nigerian energy stakeholders for fostering an environment that attracts global investments, contributing to energy poverty eradication, sustainable development and global energy market stability.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Vandals behind Buguma Wellhead fire \u2014NNPCL",

            "content": "Call on Mozambique LNG financiers to withdraw support for the project. Photo: Reclaim Finance\n\nWednesday, 22 January 2025\n\nNot one of the financial backers of the highly controversial Mozambique LNG project has agreed to publicly call for an independent international investigation into an alleged massacre of civilians, reportedly committed near TotalEnergies\u2019 premises in mid-2021 by Mozambican public security forces.\n\nToday a coalition of 126 Mozambican and international civil society organizations (1) released a letter, sent last December to the 31 financial institutions (2) involved in the Mozambique LNG project. The letter includes critical new information on the risks associated with the project and outlines key demands.\n\nThe coalition specifically asks for financial institutions to support the call (3) for an urgent independent international investigation into an alleged massacre of civilians, reportedly committed near TotalEnergies\u2019 Afungi premises between July and September 2021 by public security forces claiming to be in charge of protecting the gas site. The coalition emphasises the need for the investigation to be conducted by an international or regional intergovernmental human rights mechanism \u2013 such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights. The coalition further urges financiers to withdraw their commitments of support for the project and withhold support if the force majeure is lifted \u2013 a legal step required for the project to resume \u2013 until all facts and responsibilities are investigated, and the results of such an investigation made public.\n\nBy the deadline of 17th January, only 14 out of 31 financial institutions had responded \u2013 FirstRand, UKEF, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, JBIC, Standard Chartered, JOGMEC, Mizuho, MUFG, SMBC, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, ABSA, Standard Bank and Atradius DSB. In their answers, most institutions noted receipt, and some such as UKEF, Standard Chartered and FirstRand, noted the concerns raised in the letter, but none so far indicated support for an independent international investigation. None of the 31 financial institutions has publicly spoken out about the alleged massacre and other reported human rights violations in connection with the Mozambique LNG project.\n\nLNG operations taking place in a context of civil unrest, oppression and conflict\n\nSince mid-October 2024, Mozambique has experienced \u201can unprecedented level of public protests on a daily basis\u201d nation-wide, ignited by allegations of electoral fraud and the brutal assassinations of two senior opposition figures. (4) The response of state authorities is \u201cmarked by serious human rights violations, including murder, torture and enforced disappearances\u201d. (5) By 15 January 2025, the total number of deaths was 303, with 619 people shot and 4,228 people detained since October 21st. Civil society organisations have appealed to the United Nations for intervention.\n\nIn addition to the civil unrest, the ongoing insurgency in Cabo Delgado remains active, and regional security remained precarious throughout 2024. (6) The drivers of the insurgency as well as those of the electoral demonstrations are the same, most critically the socio-economic welfare of the people in the region and Mozambique as a whole. As multiple expert analyses indicate, the key to resolving the insurgency is to address these drivers.\n\nAnabela Lemos, with Justi\u00e7a Ambiental! / Friends of the Earth Mozambique, warns: \u201cThis project carries an extensive spectrum of risks \u2013 specifically around human rights violations. Gas development has been shown to be a catalyst for making increased funds and resources available to a government that has been inflicting violence on citizens. Neither the Mozambican government nor TotalEnergies can be entrusted to solely conduct credible and objective investigations into alleged violations that they may have links to. Financiers \u2013 out of morality and justice \u2013 must re-examine not only their support to this project but also their commitment to human rights.\u201d (Lemos is director of Justi\u00e7a Ambiental! and a 2024 recipient of the Right Livelihoods award.)\n\nFollowing the September 2024 Politico article, which reported on the alleged massacre of civilians, Mozambique\u2019s Ministry of National Defence refuted the allegations made in the article. An internal analysis by Mozambique LNG concluded that no corroborating information was identified. In late December, the Mozambique Attorney General\u2019s office was reported to have launched an investigation into the allegations, and to have held a hearing with Mozambique LNG director Maxime Rabilloud.\n\nDutch parliamentarians have raised concerns and underlined the importance of an independent investigation into the alleged massacre. However, a motion that was submitted on this last December is currently on hold, as the Dutch Parliament is awaiting a formal response (letter) by the Dutch Minister of Finance.\n\nKate DeAngelis, with Friends of the Earth U.S., says: \u201cGovernments through their export credit agencies and development finance institutions are providing key finance for the LNG development in northern Mozambique. The U.S. Export-Import Bank under the first Trump Administration approved almost $5 billion for Mozambique LNG. While Biden has not bowed to pressure from TotalEnergies' CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 and has not released the funds requested for the relaunch of Mozambique LNG during his mandate, it is likely that the second Trump Administration will ram through this finance despite the atrocities that have been committed. In this context, the other States involved in the project, including the Netherlands and the UK, have an even greater responsibility to stand up against Trump\u2019s alliance with the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\n\nResettlement violations remain unresolved\n\nThe letter to financial institutions provides detail on resettlement violations affecting hundreds of families that remain unresolved. Over 1,300 complaints have been received by local civil society organisation Justi\u00e7a Ambiental. None of the financial institutions commented on these circumstances either.\n\nAt a recent meeting that was held to attempt to come to a resolution of some of the resettlement issues, a number of community members spoke out against a proposal that would deny them any opportunities to conduct their livelihoods \u2013 including growing food. Subsequently, ten community members were summoned to hearings with the police. Justi\u00e7a Ambiental!, which provides support to communities affected by mega-projects, has noted this tactic being used in a number of other communities in the country to silence critical voices. Anabela Lemos says: \u201cIntimidation has a far-reaching impact on the sense of safety of individuals when they participate in meetings and negotiations relating to their rights, and is especially menacing in the context of ongoing regional conflict.\u201d\n\nFinanciers of Mozambique LNG urged to ensure justice for the people affected by the project and the alleged massacre\n\nTotalEnergies has been approaching the financial supporters of this project in order to secure their renewed support in view of resuming operations. The coalition that sent the letter argues that financial support cannot and should not be renewed without a thorough reassessment of the project, including the recent allegations of links to severe human rights violations.\n\nLorette Philippot, with Friends of the Earth France, says: \u201cPublic and private financial institutions are opting for a strategy of complicit silence. Since they decided to support Mozambique LNG in mid-2020, long-identified risks turned into concrete impacts, repeated human tragedies occurred and were documented, and Total has consistently proved itself untrustworthy. These banks, and in particular Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in France, must realise that this silence will not protect them: they bear the responsibility of demanding that light be shed on these unbearable violences, to ensure justice and truth for the victims and the safety of survivors, families and witnesses.\u201d\n\nContacts:\n\nFor the Mozambican socio-economic context and community impacts:\n\nDaniel Ribeiro / Justi\u00e7a Ambiental! / daniel.ja.mz@gmail.com / +258 86 620 5608\u2069 (CAT)\n\nFor private financial institutions:\n\nLorette Philippot / Friends of the Earth France / lorette.philippot@amisdelaterre.org / +33 6 40 18 82 84 (CET)\n\nRieke Butijn / BankTrack / henrieke@banktrack.org (CET)\n\nFor public financial institutions:\n\nKate DeAngelis / Friends of the Earth US / kdeangelis@foe.org / +1 202-320-4742\u2069 (EST)\n\nIsabelle Gueskens / Milieudefensie / isabelle.geuskens@milieudefensie.nl / +31621829589 (CET)\n\nNotes:\n\n(1) The letter was initially sent in December 2024 by the following organisations: Justi\u00e7a Ambiental! / Friends of the Earth Mozambique; Les Amis de la Terre France / Friends of the Earth France; Reclaim Finance; BankTrack; Urgewald; Friends of the Earth Japan; ReCommon; Milieudefensie / Friends of the Earth Netherlands; Friends of the Earth Europe; Friends of the Earth United States; Solutions for Our Climate.\n\nSee the full list of the current signatories at the end of the letter.\n\n(2) 31 financial institutions took part in the 14.9 billion dollars project financing in July 2020.

We ask that this independent investigation is conducted by an international or regional intergovernmental human rights mechanism \u2013 such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights \u2013 with the intention of ensuring justice and truth for the victims and the safety of survivors, families and witnesses. Working with an internationally or regionally officially recognised human rights body with the required expertise and mandate, is key for the protection of the victims and witnesses.\n\n(4) More information about the electoral protests: Club of Mozambique. 13 January 2025.

            "content": "Moments after he declared that the Government has \u201cnothing to hide\u201d with regards to the management of the Petroleum Sector, Minister of Natural Resources, Vickram Bharrat on Friday declined to provide the Parliamentary Committee of Supply with the names of the four companies that are expected to sign the new Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) for four of the country\u2019s lucrative offshore oil blocks.\n\nAs he was pressed for answers by APNU+AFC Member of Parliament, David Patterson, the Natural Resources Minister said when the time is right, the announcement will be made by the Government.\n\nIn the past, the Natural Resources Ministry had indicated that TotalEnergies Consortium, the International Group Investment Inc, Cybele Energy Limited and Delcorp Inc had all accepted the new Production Sharing Agreement, and were expected to sign off on the agreement.\n\nBut as he dodged questions during his appearance before the Committee of Supply, the Natural Resources Minister said when compared to the Stabroek Block 2016 PSA, the new agreements for both the Deep Water and Shallow Water Blocks, would return greater benefits to the people of Guyana.\n\n\u201cOne of the fiscal terms that have been included in the new PSA, is instead of zero percent tax in the Stabroek PSA, every other PSA moving forward would have 10% tax. Mr. Speaker, instead of 2% royalty in the Stabroek PSA, we will now have 10% royalty in any future PSAs. Mr Speaker instead of 75% cost recovery in the Stabroek Block, we will then have a 65% cost recovery. And what that means, it simply means more money up front for Guyana, while we are still paying off the cost bank or the capital investments by the companies investing,\u201d Minister Bharrat boasted.\n\nGovernment, he added, has retained the 50-50 profit-sharing after cost recovery.\n\nOutside of the fiscal terms, the Natural Resources Minister said the PSAs outline strict timelines, if breach can see operators paying hefty fees.\n\n\u201cWe have ensured that work programmes are adhered to and if the work programmes are not adhered to, there is a penalty whereby the operator or the companies must play at least half of the amount of money that was allocated towards that work programme,\u201d he explained.\n\nMinister Bharrat said while he has taken note of a commitment by the opposition to review the controversial 2016 Stabroek Block PSA signed with ExxonMobil, the Government remains firm in its position that it will not renegotiate the contract. He said Government has opted to craft the new PSAs that would govern future blocks.\n\n\u201cWe have made it clear that we are not going to renegotiate the Stabroek contract. We have made it very clear that we are not going to renegotiate the Stabroek contract but we are going to develop a model PSA that will bring additional benefits to any other PSA that will be signed with any other company including ExxonMobil, including ExxonMobil,\u201d the Natural Resources Minister said.\n\nThis year marks two years since the Government placed 14 of the country\u2019s offshore oil blocks up for auction.\n\nIn late 2023, one year after the auction was launched, the Government awarded eight of the blocks to a total of six bidders \u2013 TotalEnergies Consortium, which includes Qatar Energy and Petronas; Sispro Inc.; International Group Investment Inc. and Montego Energy; Liberty Petroleum Corporation and Cybele Energy; ExxonMobil, Hess and CNOOC; and Delcorp Inc, Watad Energy and Arabian Drillers.\n\nHowever, it is still to issue any license.",

This comes after Rybakina ended her trial period with Goran Ivanisevic following her fourth-round exit from the Australian Open last month.\n\nRybakina is currently the top seed and defending champion at the Abu Dhabi Open.

She hopes that the collaboration with Sanguinetti will be successful and that they can work together effectively.\n\nThe Kazakh player is set to compete in the main draw of the Abu Dhabi Open, where she will face tough competition from players like Paula Badosa, Daria Kasatkina, Ons Jabeur, and Emma Raducanu.

That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always been drawn to innovation, research, and finding solutions to complex problems.\n\nI manage O3C Montpellier, the control tower for all our renewable assets in France and the overseas territories. O3C monitors around 650 renewable assets, including wind, solar, and hydro. We are the first in line to spot when something happens, like a stop of production. If we are not able to remotely restart the production, then we send a local team on-site to restart it manually.\n\n\u2018Oui, hello?\u2019 So we go to Plan du Pal wind farm. We have a problem on turbine number 5. The wind sensor is defective. So we have to go and have a look and troubleshoot to see what\u2019s happened.\n\nSince using 03C, we have noted better responsiveness during interventions and also a perfectly noticeable energy gain in production. 03C allows us to intervene on-site with a feeling of security through their action and their continuous management of the power plants. 03C, at first, was just an idea. I had a mission to make it real. And today, it is real. It works. We strive to be the most reactive and responsive. These tiny incremental changes could make a big difference.\n\n03C cut 26 tonnes of CO 2 in 2023. We play our part in the optimization of production, and that\u2019s perhaps the best part of this adventure. I just hope that we will continue to grow, including more assets, more megawatts, and more gigawatts, not only in France but in other countries.\n\n03C was initially a mission given to me. I\u2019m a dreamer, and I like to reach my objectives. So in that kind of way, I\u2019m also a doer.",

Climbing is actually better done when it\u2019s a bit cool and fresh. Depending on the location, we target the time of day when it\u2019s completely in the shade. Despite all these mountains, Oman is still a dry country with very little precipitation. The demand for fresh water is much higher than what the country can naturally produce. The majority of the running water available in Oman comes from desalination, the process of taking seawater and removing the salt to produce fresh water. It\u2019s an extremely energy-intensive process, and what TotalEnergies does is install solar power at these large plants to produce sustainable power for their processes. The TotalEnergies project in Sur is one of the proudest achievements of my career. Oman is in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. It\u2019s mostly surrounded by water from the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. But despite being surrounded by all this seawater, freshwater is scarce. Currently, 86% of Oman\u2019s drinking water comes from desalination.\n\nI grew up in Lebanon. I moved to Canada when I was 17. I started my career in the mining industry and, while it was good, I didn\u2019t really feel fulfilled and I decided to do a career switch. I came full circle and moved back to the region, the Middle East, in 2015, and I\u2019ve always had a very strong connection with Oman. If desalination plants didn\u2019t exist, life here would be very different. We wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain the population and the quality of life that we have. As the population increases, the demand will increase as well. By 2025, it is estimated that 1.8 billion people will face water scarcity. We expect desalination capacity to double by 2030. There is an intrinsic need to produce sustainable power. I\u2019m very proud of the work we\u2019ve done with Veolia for the Sharqiyah Desalination Plant. The project delivers clean water for more than 600,000 inhabitants of the region. The desalination process is a very intensive process, pumping water from the sea. After pumping this water, it goes through the filtration process, filtering it through membranes to remove the salt and unwanted particles. We are working with high pressure. To develop that much of a pressure, we need HP pumps, high pressure pumps. To run those pumps, we need a lot of energy.",

The discussion, led by CEO Darren Woods, CFO Kathy Mikells and VP Jim Chapman, will be accessible via webcast or by phone. The press release and webcast details will be available at exxonmobil.com.\n\nHF Sinclair Corporation will announce its Q4 2024 results on February 20, 2025, before market opening. The Dallas-based energy company, which operates refineries and produces renewable diesel, will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET. Investors can access the webcast here.\n\nWoodside Energy reported a record annual production of 194 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), driven by strong performance at its Sangomar field. Q4 production reached 75 Mboe/day, despite a 3% decline from Q3 due to seasonal demand fluctuations. Woodside\u2019s LNG projects, including Scarborough and Trion, continue to progress, with the first LNG cargo from Scarborough on track for 2026. The company also announced an asset swap with Chevron, consolidating its focus on high-value core assets. CEO Meg O\u2019Neill highlighted the company\u2019s commitment to sustainability, with a 14% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2024.\n\nTotalEnergies is also set to report its Q4 2024 results, with hydrocarbon production expected to slightly increase within the quarterly guidance range of 2.4 to 2.45 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the company anticipates a decline in oil prices, higher gas realizations and a 6% increase in LNG production will offset some of the losses. Integrated Power results are projected to range between $500 and $600 million, aligning with TotalEnergies\u2019 full-year cash flow guidance. However, the company\u2019s downstream segment faces weaker refining margins, despite an increase in European refining margins.\n\nAs these major energy players prepare to unveil their financial results, investors will be closely watching their strategies for navigating sector challenges, including fluctuating oil prices, refining pressures and the continued push toward sustainable energy solutions.

            "content": "For the first time in 12 years, a new highly opposed natural gas drilling site is slated to break ground in east Arlington.\n\nFollowing almost two hours of comments and feedback at a Jan. 28 City Council meeting, City Council members voted unanimously in favor of the drill site. District 4 council member Andrew Piel was absent.\n\nAt the site, French oil and gas company TotalEnergies plans to drill 10 new gas wells at 2020 S. Watson Road, just down the street from The Mother\u2019s Heart Learning Center, an Arlington day care center that predominantly serves children of color.\n\nPrevious councils denied TotalEnergies\u2019 requests to drill near the day care in 2020 and 2022. City Council will now hold a second vote Feb. 25, which would confirm the company\u2019s permit to drill and operate new wells.\n\nCouncil members did not comment on the vote after hearing from speakers.\n\nBefore opening the floor to public comments, Mayor Jim Ross said the city was limited by state law in what it can do to regulate oil and gas wells in the city.\n\nHouse Bill 40, signed into law a decade ago, limits the power cities have over oil and gas well regulations at the municipal level. Council members have repeatedly cited the law when approving permits, noting their desire to avoid lawsuits from gas companies.\n\nBut several speakers against the wells said the law shouldn\u2019t stop council members from voting against the new gas wells.\n\nOpposing speakers said the council still has the power to extend the required distance between a gas well and a school or day care center. They wanted to see the city not just deny the application to drill new wells but also require a greater setback distance.\n\nIngrid Kelley, an Arlington resident, was one of the 29 people who spoke against TotalEnergies' new drill site at the Jan. 28 City Council meeting. (Fort Worth Report | Nicole Lopez) Speakers opposing the wells also told council members that allowing TotalEnergies, known in North Texas as TEEP Barnett, to drill at the site would put the health of children at risk.\n\nIngrid Kelley, an Arlington resident whose grandson attends The Mother\u2019s Heart Learning Center, told the council that approving the gas wells would be the same as selling the health of her grandson.\n\n\u201cThere is no price on my grandson\u2019s life and wellbeing, just as any parent or grandparent would agree,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nRanjana Bhandari, executive director of environmental advocacy group Liveable Arlington, told the council that the health effects of gas wells aren\u2019t acceptable and that the City Council needed to make its decision based on the well-being of residents.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re voting on today,\u201d Bhandari said. \u201cNot 10 wells, not cheap gas.\u201d\n\nSome speakers questioned whether the council serves Arlington residents or a multinational energy conglomerate from France.\n\nTotalEnergies operates 31 of 51 natural gas drilling sites permitted in Arlington. The Bruder drill site, pictured in February 2024, was criticized by west Arlington residents concerned about loud noise and pollution. (Haley Samsel | Fort Worth Report) Of the 30 speakers who addressed the council, 29 spoke in opposition. Because of the number of people who wanted to address the council, speakers were limited to two minutes each.\n\nLeslie Garvis, a spokesperson for TotalEnergies, told the council that the drill zone \u201crepresents the best location to access these minerals.\u201d\n\nGarvis said the plan presented to the council exceeded the city\u2019s minimum setback requirement by about 50%.\n\nDean Foreman, the chief economist for industry group Texas Oil & Gas Association, was the only speaker in support of the permits. He argued that the tax income from gas wells, along with mineral rights income to the city and residents, made the drilling a good thing.\n\nGarvis added that the opposition was speaking out of fear rather than science.\n\nThe vote comes after a yearslong battle between TotalEnergies and residents opposed to gas drilling. The company owns 31 of the 51 drill sites permitted to operate in Arlington.\n\nThe energy company first sought permission to drill new wells in 2020 at 2000 S. Watson Road, just hundreds of feet north of the newly approved site. City Council members denied the request, citing concerns over how gas drilling would affect nearby low-income residents and communities of color. A year later, TotalEnergies applied again to drill at the same site.\n\nIn its second application, council members gave the company preliminary approval to expand its drilling zone, but rescinded their decision in January 2022 after being confronted with a lawsuit from Liveable Arlington and the director of The Mother\u2019s Heart Learning Center.\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 third attempt to operate new gas wells began in December, when the Arlington Planning and Zoning Commission granted a specific use permit to the company.\n\nTo emphasize opposition, Liveable Arlington created and publicly screened the \u201cFaces of Fracking\u201d docuseries, six short films about gas drilling in the city.\n\n\u201cIt is our responsibility to make a positive difference in the lives of our children,\u201d said Wanda Vincent, director of The Mother\u2019s Heart Learning Center. \u201cBecause of your decision on this board, you are likewise responsible for leaving things better and for making a positive difference in this community.\u201d\n\nNicole Lopez is the environmental reporter for the Fort Worth Report.

            "content": "Julia Rose, Head of Development TotalEnergies, Offshore Wind UK\n\nHere in Scotland, you cannot deny the mighty force of the wind. And if you go out to sea, the wind blows even stronger. So if you want to harvest wind and wind energy, that's where you must go. In TotalEnergies, we've been working in the offshore territory for many, many years, and there's now an opportunity to take these skills into offshore wind, building the basis for a carbon neutral future.\n\nI've been coming up to Scotland quite frequently for work since I started in my role, and it's a very beautiful place to work. One should add that here in Scotland the weather conditions can be quite rough, but that's also the reason we're here. The UK in general obviously has a big benefit in terms of offshore wind. It's an island and it's got a lot of coastline. Wind speeds are typically higher on the sea than they are on the land simply because there are less obstructions and the flat sea essentially acts as an accelerator.\n\nWe can already see a lot of investment in offshore wind in the UK and in Scotland. UK is second only to China in terms of installed capacity of offshore wind. In fact, I think it was earlier this year that there was more electricity produced by wind power than by gas, for the very first time.\n\nMy career started in conventional power generation. I spent the first ten years or so working on gas and steam fired power plants. There\u2019s a lot of complexity to these projects. When there was an opportunity to take these skills I had learned and bring them across into the renewables industry and specifically offshore wind, I jumped on to it.\n\nTotalEnergies have many, many years of experience working in the oil and gas space, designing, building and operating big projects and facilities in this harsh offshore environment. Just over three years ago, TotalEnergies invested into the Seagreen project, together with our partners from SSE Renewables. Seagreen is around 27 kilometres off the coast of Scotland. It's now Scotland's largest offshore wind farm, with a total of 114 turbines. As of this year, Seagreen is fully operational and can supply up to 1.6 million households in Scotland with green electricity. So that's around two thirds of all households in Scotland. The scale of these projects is extraordinary. Developing, building, and operating an offshore wind farm is quite a feat and it takes a diverse team of specialists to come together to make it happen.\n\nMichelle Aitken, Head of HSE TotalEnergies, Offshore Wind UK\n\nI grew up in Norway, so I grew up right next to the sea. My parents both worked in offshore oil and gas, so I just naturally followed in that direction. And then two years ago, I made the jump into offshore wind, and it's been the best decision I ever made. Offshore wind is still a relatively new industry, so we're essentially building it from the ground up and being able to use our past background and experience to do that in a safe and responsible manner is quite an exciting project to be part of.\n\nMartin Mciver, Operations Manager TotalEnergies, Offshore Wind UK\n\nSo, I transitioned into offshore wind at the start of this year, just as the Seagreen project was ramping up. I was previously ten years oil and gas working in the North Sea. It\u2019s a very harsh environment, so we need to make sure that the foundations and the turbines are able to withstand everything the North Sea can throw at it, in the height of winter. We've looked at the design and we're at the forefront of the industry.\n\nJulia Rose, Head of Development TotalEnergies, Offshore Wind UK\n\nWe're only on the very first steps of this journey. And there's estimates that in order to reach net zero in the future, we'd have to build another 100,000 offshore wind turbines. Offshore wind has very rapidly grown to be one of the leading renewable technologies, and rightly so. It's pretty much an unlimited source of renewable power, which is absolutely instrumental to move us into a lower carbon, more sustainable future.",

Watson Road marks TotalEnergies\u2019 third attempt to drill new gas wells near The Mother\u2019s Heart Learning Center, an east Arlington day care center that primarily serves children of color. City Council members are expected to vote on the permit during their Jan. 28 meeting.\n\nThe battle between French company TotalEnergies, known in North Texas as TEEP Barnett, and residents opposed to gas drilling has continued over several years. The energy giant owns 31 of the 51 drill sites permitted to operate in the city.\n\nThat number could grow to 52 if council members approve TotalEnergies\u2019 request. While the two previous attempts would have created a new drill zone on an existing site, the current application would create the first new drill site in Arlington in over a dozen years, according to environmental advocacy group Liveable Arlington.\n\nThe energy company first sought permission to drill new wells at the east Arlington site in 2020, about 600 feet from the day care. City Council members denied the request, citing concerns over how gas drilling would disproportionately affect nearby low-income residents and communities of color. Just over a year later, the company applied again for the same site.\n\nIn the second application, council members gave TotalEnergies preliminary approval to expand its drilling zone, but rescinded their decision in January 2022 after being met with a lawsuit from Liveable Arlington and the director of The Mother\u2019s Heart Learning Center.\n\nNow, Liveable Arlington is preparing once more to convince council members to reject TotalEnergies\u2019 plans for a new drill zone. The new site, if approved, would be located at 2020 S. Watson Road, just south of the original east Arlington site.\n\nMariah Vincent, junior director of The Mother\u2019s Heart Learning Center, says she hopes City Council members will have a change of heart about TotalEnergies\u2019 drill site plans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous,\u201d said Vincent. \u201cI\u2019m hoping. We\u2019re just trying to hope and we\u2019re praying that everything will turn around. I\u2019m just not sure.\u201d\n\nHer anxieties about the drill site grew when the Arlington Planning and Zoning Commission granted a specific use permit to TotalEnergies in December.\n\nWanda Vincent, director of the learning center, is most concerned about how the proposed drill site could affect the children at her day care. The TotalEnergies site would be the second drill zone located within less than a mile from the center.\n\n\u201cAll of this does have an effect on the air quality here around the center,\u201d Wanda Vincent said in \u201cFaces of Fracking,\u201d a docuseries about gas drilling in Arlington that was publicly screened in January.\n\nTotalEnergies did not immediately respond to the Report\u2019s multiple requests for comment on the permit application. Representatives have previously said the company follows all local and state regulations and regularly monitors for air quality and noise issues near its sites.\n\nMariah and Wanda Vincent say they are going to continue working with Liveable Arlington regardless of the outcome of the council vote.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s other communities that we need to fight with, we will help. \u2026 We will just do everything we can,\u201d said Mariah Vincent.\n\n\u2018Faces of Fracking\u2019 series highlights residents\u2019 experiences\n\nThe Vincents are two of six Arlington residents featured in the docuseries, which Liveable Arlington intends to screen at the Jan. 28 meeting.\n\nThere are \u201cso many stories\u201d of Arlington residents and their experiences with natural gas drilling to be told, Liveable Arlington Executive Director Ranjana Bhandari said at the Jan. 11 debut of the docuseries.\n\n\u201cThis is all very depressing, but we always have this sense that activism is an act of hope. It\u2019s an act of optimism,\u201d said Bhandari.\n\nThe second rejection of TotalEnergies\u2019 proposal did not come without a fight, said Bhandari. It required several residents to attend City Council meetings and over 1,000 petition signatures against the application.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot, but that\u2019s where persistence comes in,\u201d said Bhandari.\n\nReminiscing on the success of the environment group\u2019s 2022 lawsuit, which the group dropped after council denied the permit, Bhandari wants to see the same effort this time around from more Arlington residents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that the day 500 Arlington residents show up at the hearing \u2026 things will start to look different,\u201d said Bhandari.\n\nIf TotalEnergies earns the approval to construct the drill zone, City Council will conduct a second vote on Feb. 25 to confirm permitting the company to drill and operate 10 gas wells.\n\nNicole Lopez is the environmental reporter for the Fort Worth Report.

Wind turbines, those majestic things\u2026 They are a massive sign of progress for me. Therefore looking at them in the morning, when I go for a run, gives me a lot of confidence in us, as a society, turning the page.\n\nThere are more options to design one particular wind farm than there are atoms in the universe. So, with Nash, it\u2019s trying to figure out, through algorithms, the optimal way to build a wind or solar farm. So you place something, let\u2019s say set a location, then you can say what the shape of the location is. You can then start to place wind turbines, make sure that distance is big enough. And then the software basically calculates everything else: energy production of the turbines, how much that energy is worth in the power markets, and gives you a full economic calculation of the wind farm.\n\nAnd if we can make renewables a more profitable investment, and that\u2019s what we aim to do, then more renewable power plants will be built, accelerating our decarbonization journey, helping us achieve net zero.

Christoph Lauenstein : We started the process of applying and then got invited to the pitch, which was a massive deal for us.\n\nDaniel Luecht : So if you apply first for the program, you\u2019re among 200 start-ups, and then it boils down to 30 pitching directly to the jury.\n\nChristoph Lauenstein : And then you have eight minutes to make a dent in people\u2019s imagination, at the end of the day.\n\nDaniel Luecht : Ten will be selected to join batch 4, batch 5 and to actually be invited to cooperate with TotalEnergies.\n\nChristoph Lauenstein : The single most critical success factor for start-ups is timing, not idea, not execution: timing. And with a program like TotalEnergies On, you can basically force timing. We went into the program as an early-stage start-up and came out as a fully integrated part of a massive company like TotalEnergies.\n\nDaniel Luecht : We got invited to the next jury session, and so we are sitting in the jury, judging, understanding, and trying to get the value out of the start-ups pitching to us. That was quite an honor.\n\nChristoph Lauenstein : Of course, it\u2019s a big thing if you are able to combine your professional life with something that has meaning. If you can also combine that with building up a company, creating employment, building up a team, you know you\u2019re doing something that has the potential, at least, to create or contribute to a better world. That\u2019s big.",

            "content": "Top Contenders for the 2025 WTA Qatar TotalEnergies Open: Who Will Come Out on Top?\n\nThe Qatar Tennis Federation confirmed that the 2025 WTA edition of the Qatar TotalEnergies Open will be graced by the World\u2019s top 10 women in the game. The annual event will take place from February 9 to 15 at the Khalifa International Tennis and Squash Complex in Doha as part of the prestigious WTA 1000 series.\n\nThe star-studded lineup headed for the tournament includes world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus, No. 2 Iga Swiatek of Poland, and Americas Coco Gauff, currently seeded World No. 3.\n\nOther top players include 4th-ranked Jasmine Paolini of Italy, Zheng Qinwen of China, Jessica Pegula of the USA, Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan, Emma Navarro of the USA, Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic, and Daria Kasatkina of Russia completing the top ten rich field.\n\nThe tournament features a 64-player singles main draw and a 32-team doubles competition, with a total prize money of $3,654,963. It is a tournament that promises an exciting week of thrilling tennis from the world\u2019s best, but who will come out on top?\n\nWagering Favorites for the 2025 WTA TotalEnergies Open in Qatar\n\nThe rich field of superstars set to compete in the 2025 edition means there will be stiff competition for the top honors. Polish girl Iga Swiatek won the women\u2019s singles in the 2024 edition, while the pair of Dutch Demi Schuurs and Brazilian Luisa Stefani took home the Women\u2019s doubles. It was Swiatek\u2019s third consecutive title after securing the 2022 and 2023 championships.\n\nLooking at the names going to Doha, it is a tough call, but luckily, there are plenty of markets to choose at the 1xBet wagering platform. New customers can obtain up to \u20ac130 in bonuses by using the code WINVIP1, with the funds going into their accounts.\n\nSwiatek remains the favorite to secure her fourth in February but will face competition from other top 10 seeds in the tournament. She saw off Elena Rybakina in the 2024 finals after a semi-finals walkover against Karolina Pliskova and Victoria Azarenka in the quarter-finals.\n\nWorld\u2019s top-ranking Aryna Sabalenka is hoping to maintain her status at the top, coming to the tournament knowing too well that her position is under threat if she doesn\u2019t win the championship. She commands a lead at the top with 8956 season points against Swiatek\u2019s 8770.\n\nDoubles\n\nDemi Shuurs and Luisa Stefani lifted the doubles title in 2024 after Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff had won the two previous editions. It is going to be another competitive doubles this time around, but given the inconsistencies in pairing, it could be anyone\u2019s title.\n\nAbout the WTA Qatar TotalEnergies Open and Past Winners\n\nThe Qatar TotalEnergies open has been hosted in Doha since 2001, featuring household names Maria Sharapova, Petra Kvitova, and Victoria Azarenka some of the previous winners. The event comes third in profile ranking, only behind the Grand Slam and WTA Finals. Winners receive up to 1000 ranking points.\n\nPrevious winners include:\n\n2024: Iga Swiatek\n\n2023: Iga Swiatek\n\n2022: Iga Swiatek\n\n2021: Petra Kvitova\n\n2020: Aryna Sabalenka\n\n2019: Elise Mertens\n\n2018: Petra Kvitova\n\n2017: Karolina Pliskova\n\n2016: Carla Suarez Navarro\n\n2015: Lucie Safarova",

            "content": "Akisha Hernandez, Strategic Asset Manager, TotalEnergies: I grew up in a military family living in a small town just kind of like this. When you\u2019re in a space that feels somewhat isolated, communities, small towns like that, develop a sense of closeness that\u2019s really hard to find somewhere else. So it\u2019s really difficult to come in as someone who\u2019s new with new ideas and start making changes. That\u2019s why with the development of this wind project, it was very important for Clearway to work with the community so they understood that it wasn\u2019t just about making renewable energy, this would create jobs and that their local community would flourish.\n\nFor us to be successful at achieving the challenge of the energy transition, it\u2019s going to take many different kinds of partnerships. Two years ago, TotalEnergies acquired half of Clearway Energy, which is one of the largest renewable companies in the US. And the Cedar Creek Wind project has been a great example that demonstrates how together we\u2019ve been able to move faster and make more progress. Idaho is very picturesque. There\u2019s so much green space. When you\u2019re installing dozens of turbines that are more than 400ft tall, it becomes a part of the landscape. It was really critical and important for Clearway to engage with the community.\n\nMatt Thompson, landowner: Nobody lives closer to the project than I do. And the wind hasn\u2019t been a big concern. Very minimal sound. Made my ranch way more accessible to me. We\u2019re able to use it for grazing, to move the cattle around more effectively with the roads they put in.\n\nAkisha Hernandez: The total investment in the Cedar Creek wind project has been $250 million, and it\u2019s created over 175 jobs. At the heart of the energy transition is successful partnerships. We have to do this together.\n\nKyle Mang, Plant Manager, Clearway Energy Group: We really tried to make an effort to use local materials, local vendors, local equipment, to try and reinforce that community partnership that we have here. We have 47 towers. That gives us capacity to generate over 150 MW. And that\u2019s enough to power about 41,000 homes. Cedar Creek is sited perfectly on top of, you know, the hills and in the valleys, it kind of funnels in the wind. Now, the remoteness of Cedar Creek presented a lot of its own challenges, building roads up here, getting the foundations dug on frozen ground and erecting towers amid heavy snowfall. Especially getting all the materials up here. It was quite the feat for us to get done.\n\nAkisha Hernandez: So often in my life, I\u2019ve felt what it\u2019s like to be the only something, right? The only woman, and the only person of color, the only engineer in a space. Building bridges and becoming a part of the community has been my way of managing that.\n\nHow\u2019s it been for things in the community since the Cedar Creek project started up?\n\nBasil Morris, Superintendent, Firth School District: So, yeah, I think that there\u2019s been some great conversations. At the beginning of the project we had a lot of donations from Cedar Creek Project, coats and gloves and hats and supplies. There will be some benefits for us as a school district financially. We\u2019ve made some plans with them to have their engineers and people from the project come and speak with our kids, talk to them about careers.\n\nAkisha Hernandez: So it sounds like Clearway has been a pretty good neighbor.\n\nBasil Morris: Yeah, they have.\n\nAkisha Hernandez: We talk about the road to carbon neutral as if there is one road to carbon neutral. And there isn\u2019t. There are many different ways to get there. Whatever path we take, we need to make sure that we are taking that path together with our communities, with the partners that we have, with our neighbors. We have to take it together so that no one and absolutely no one gets left behind. It\u2019s only by working together that I believe we\u2019ll see great progress.",

He also worked abroad, coaching Qatari club Al-Duhail.\n\nRegragui made a name for himself in his early steps as a national team coach when he led Morocco to outstanding success in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Under his leadership, the Moroccan team achieved an extraordinary run, becoming the first African team in history to reach the World Cup semi-finals. Morocco ultimately finished in fourth place, marking the best World Cup performance by an African team to date.\n\nCoaching Style:\n\nRegragui\u2019s coaching style is characterized by solid defensive organization, ensuring his defense is tightly closed off against opponents. His strategy also relies heavily on quick transitions from defense to attack, using speed to exploit gaps. He places great emphasis on utilizing the strength and pace of his attackers, pressing the ball carrier in the opponent\u2019s half and preventing them from breaking through to his defense.\n\nTotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations Experience:\n\nThis will be Walid Regragui's second participation in the continental finals with the Moroccan national team. He previously led the \"Atlas Lions\" in the 2023 Cote d\u2019Ivoire edition where they were uncharacteristically knocked out by South Africa in the Round of 16.\n\nDid You Know?

As a Moroccan, how do you feel?\n\nMustapha Hadji: I feel good, still euphoric. We have to stay positive. You know, the TotalEnergies CAF AFCON is something exceptional, an extraordinary experience. I was lucky enough to experience it as a player, and I can tell you that it is a unique event. Afterwards, I also participated in this competition as a coach, whether in Egypt or Cameroon, and as a spectator in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n\nToday, the African continent continues to progress, and the level of the spectacle is simply remarkable. The last edition in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was extraordinary, whether in terms of the public, the atmosphere or the welcome. And this year, in Morocco, I am convinced that it will be just as exceptional.\n\nMorocco benefits from an ideal geographical location. For our brothers in the African diaspora, this represents a great opportunity, travelling here will be easier. We are only two hours from Barcelona, three from Paris.\n\nFor Africans living in Europe or even Morocco, this AFCON may be the opportunity to attend such a competition live for the first time.\n\nThe TotalEnergies CAF AFCON is above all a celebration. A celebration for the whole continent, for all African children. It allows them to dream, to nurture ambitions, and above all, to have hope. You know, in Africa, football is much more than a sport. It's a real religion.\n\nThe last time Morocco hosted the AFCON was in 1988... (Hadji cuts in)\n\nThat's a long time, isn't it? Very long, even. I was 17 years old at the time. Today, with the modern infrastructure and the evolution of our country, it was time for Morocco to host this great competition again.\n\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI has contributed enormously to the development of football, not only in Morocco, but also throughout the African continent. Thanks to this vision, our country is now a key player in world football.\n\nMorocco made history recently by reaching the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup (in 2022), becoming the first African nation to achieve this feat. And, in a few years, we will be co-hosts of the 2030 FIFA World Cup. The\n\n\n\nTotalEnergies CAF AFCON 2025 is a bit like a foretaste of what awaits us: the preparations, the atmosphere, the enthusiasm.\n\nSince 1988, it has been far too long. But today, it is finally Morocco's time. As a true football country, hosting this competition is a huge honour and pride for Moroccans.\n\nWe know that expectations are enormous. So, in your opinion, what are the challenges that Morocco will have to overcome to meet them?\n\nThe challenge is immense, gigantic. We must not leave thinking that we are 100% winners. You have to respect all the opponents. African football today is full of great talents and great teams. There are no more small nations. No one can say that a match will be easy or won in advance, no matter who the opponent is.\n\nIt is true that Morocco currently has an exceptional generation, with great talents. But this will not be enough. We will have to prove it on the pitch. We will have to work hard, and this, in front of a crowd that expects a lot. Playing at home adds extra pressure. It's never easy to play at home and win a TotalEnergies CAF AFCON.\n\nWe remember the example of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where Morocco gave them a decisive hand. But the context is different. Today, we have to prepare seriously. We have great players, a great team and a President of the Federation (Fouzi Lekjaa) who is very invested in Moroccan football. Since he has been at the head of the Federation, Moroccan football has undergone a spectacular transformation, going from the darkest hours to global recognition.\n\nAll this pushes us to be up to the task. I wouldn't say it's an obligation, but we have to have a great TotalEnergies CAF AFCON.\n\nWith a Moroccan team that plays attractive and spectacular football, do you think that in order to win, it will have to put aside its playing identity and adopt a more pragmatic style, adapting to its opponents?\n\nYes, certainly. It's also the role of the coach to find this balance. It's true that we have a pleasant football, a game that deserves to be admired. But in the TotalEnergies CAF AFCON, this is not enough.\n\nAs you mentioned, the AFCON is a very physical tournament, with a repetition of demanding matches. When you face teams like Gabonese, Ivorians, Senegalese, or others, you should expect an intense athletic challenge. The road to the final is long and strewn with hardships. We will have to be ready to deal with injuries, to exhaust ourselves physically.\n\nThat said, Morocco's playing identity remains a strength. But to win this competition, we will have to go beyond what we have shown so far. That's what makes the charm of the TotalEnergies CAF AFCON: you can be the best team on paper and still get out in the first rounds. We have seen this in the past.\n\nI think that Morocco has a great card to play. But the pressure will be there, especially when playing in front of a home crowd. We will have to work even harder, surpass ourselves physically, and play at 150% of our abilities.\n\nTechnical qualities and beautiful play will not be enough. We will have to add commitment, combativeness, and an ability to adapt. It is this combination that will make the difference.\n\nWho will be Morocco\u2019s major rivals for the TotalEnergies CAF AFCON 2025 trophy?\n\nAll teams! As I mentioned before, there is no such thing as a small team. All the matches will be fiercely contested. As the football expression goes, it will be played with a knife. There are no easy matches, there are no opponents to underestimate.\n\nThere is no room for calculations. We will have to win every match and go all the way. We can't tell ourselves that we can afford to lose against a team that finished third. This is where the danger lies. If you start calculating, that's when you have to wake up and remember that every match has to be taken seriously.\n\nMaybe it's even more advantageous to play against a team that finishes third in a group than against the first. A team that finishes third will often have extra motivation. But when you face a team that finishes second or third, it can happen that you let your guard down a little, thinking that it will be easier. And this is precisely where we can make mistakes and be surprised by opponents.\n\n\n\nWhat are the best memories you have of this competition?\n\nI had the honour of competing in this competition, which holds such a special place in my heart. I love Africa. And what I love most of all is seeing the children.\n\nWhen I come out of a match and I leave the stadium by bus, and I see these children running behind the bus, it touches me deeply. It gives me goosebumps, because that's the essence of this sport: to give hope, to make people dream.\n\nTo see these young people, to see them watch the players they love, it's a magical moment. It is to offer them a dream, a place of hope. And that's the most beautiful thing.\n\nOf course, winning the TotalEnergies CAF AFCON for your people is very important, but there is nothing more precious than seeing these children dream.\n\nThey believe in these stars, these role models who show them that great things are possible in Africa. Stars offer hope to children, and that's what matters most. You can tell me what you want, but that's the beauty of this sport.\n\nWe can win the TotalEnergies CAF AFCON, we can win anything. But when you leave a stadium, when you are on a bus, and you see the smiles of the children, you see them running and happy ... that's what is more beautiful than the TotalEnergies CAF AFCON.\n\n\n\nFor more on the TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations, Morocco 2025, visit www.cafonline.com\n\nFurther Enquiries:\n\nCAF Communications\n\ncommunications@cafonline.com",

They finished top of Group B, which included Gabon, Lesotho, and the Central African Republic, with 6 wins and a perfect 18 points, making them the only team to achieve this number of victories in the qualifiers.\n\nCoach: Walid Regragui\n\nWalid Regragui, a 49-year-old former international player for the Atlas Lions is the trusted man to lead the Atlas Lions to victory. He has managed various Moroccan clubs, including FUS Rabat, Wydad Casablanca, and Qatar's Al Duhail.\n\nCoach Walid Regragui led his country to international success during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where he achieved an exceptional record. No African team had ever progressed as far as Morocco did, reaching the semi-finals and defeating several strong teams. Regragui managed to quickly form a strong unit with the \"Atlas Lions\".\n\nKey players to follow\n\nAchraf Hakimi : The star of French club Paris Saint-Germain remains one of the most prominent pillars of the Moroccan national team due to his vast experience and technical ability, which he consistently displays with both his club and national team in various competitions.\n\nBrahim Diaz : The Real Madrid player is among the most prominent figures in the Moroccan national team, with the technical staff of the \"Atlas Lions\" led by Walid Regragui placing significant reliance on him. He is always part of the coach\u2019s plans, hoping to provide the necessary contribution.\n\nTotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations campaign\n\nThe Moroccan national team has often stood out during its participation in the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations, often reaching the advanced stages of the competition. Despite being crowned continental champions only once in 1976, Morocco has reached the final twice, finished third once, and fourth twice.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\nThe Moroccan national team is expected to be one of the main contenders for the title. The team will benefit from home advantage and support from the public, which could greatly assist them in winning a title that has been absent from their trophy cabinet for 49 years.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Moroccan national team remains the only African team to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, which was achieved in the 2022 edition in Qatar. This unprecedented achievement for an African teams makes Morocco eager to prove its brilliance and move past its earlier setback in the 2023 AFCON finals held in, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.",

What would be the ideal draw for the Elephants?\n\nJean-Philippe Krasso: There is no such thing as an ideal draw. In the last AFCON, we thought we had a group where we could progress\u2014not easily, but manageably. And yet, we struggled. Today, all the qualified teams are good, so nothing will be easy. It's up to us to prepare well.\n\nCafonline.com: Since that triumph in 2023, Ivory Coast has been on a good trajectory. How would you describe the team's mindset?\n\nJean-Philippe Krasso:The mindset is very good. The group is thriving, both on and off the pitch. We rely on the things we've done well since the AFCON. Every match is taken seriously: we prepare well, give our all on the pitch, and stick together, even in defeat.\n\nYou played a key role in the qualifiers, with that brace against Zambia (2-0). How are you personally approaching AFCON 2025?\n\nJean-Philippe Krasso: My first goal is to make the squad for the AFCON. Until then, I'm focusing on my work with Paris FC and the World Cup qualifiers. I want to arrive at the AFCON in peak physical and mental condition, ready to give everything. We know we'll face strong teams, and that makes the challenge even more exciting.\n\nDo you think winning the 2023 AFCON at home adds more pressure on Ivory Coast for this edition?\n\nJean-Philippe Krasso: Perhaps more pressure, yes, especially when playing away. But it's positive pressure. We know what we've accomplished and the joy it brought to our families and the entire nation. We ask ourselves: why not experience that joy again? This pressure is motivating because we know what reward awaits at the end.\n\nJean-Philippe Krasso: If you had to describe your experience at the 2023 AFCON at home, what words would you choose?\n\nImmense pride. Experiencing an AFCON at home is incredible. You feel everything\u2014the highs and lows\u2014in real time. But in the end, it was magical, a mix of emotions. Sharing that victory with the Ivorian people made it even more special.\n\nEmerse Fa\u00e9, your coach, said of you: \"Jean-Philippe feels the game, he feels the goal.\" What do you think about that?\n\nJean-Philippe Krasso: It's flattering. I'm not a classic striker who stays up front waiting for the ball. I like to be involved in the game, play in support of another forward, or set up my teammates. But when I'm in a position to shoot, I try to use my qualities as a finisher.",

The firm cited ongoing political instability and security challenges as reasons for delays.\n\nThe project, based near Palma in the conflict-affected Cabo Delgado province, has been under force majeure since 2021, following deadly Islamist militant attacks in the region. The Mozambique LNG Project started with the discovery of a vast quantity of natural gas off the coast of northern Mozambique in 2010.\n\nThe project comprises the Golfinho-Atum gas field development in the offshore Area 1 Block of the deep-water Rovuma Basin and the construction of a 12.88 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) onshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility on the Cabo Delgado coast of Mozambique. This was to be the first onshore LNG facility in Mozambique upon completion.\n\nREAD: Angola, SUEZ sign MoU to boost water services in Luanda\n\nEffects\n\nThe project, initially expected to start LNG production in 2024, has faced repeated delays. First pushed to 2027, then 2029, the timeline is now in jeopardy, with no clear indication of when the conditions for resumption, peace, security, and reliable public services will be met.\n\nThe delay affects Mozambique\u2019s economic prospects, as the LNG project was expected to boost revenues, create jobs, and attract further foreign investment. The inability to contain insurgency in Cabo Delgado underscores broader challenges in addressing security in resource-rich but conflict-prone areas. The prolonged delay adds uncertainty to the global LNG supply chain, especially as demand rises in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe company has emphasized the need for restored stability and public services before lifting the force majeure.

Specifically, we\u2019re leveraging new technology like artificial intelligence, which is playing a critical role in our digital transformation, because it lets us explore new frontiers and expand the boundaries of what our industry can do. In 2020, we created our Digital Factory, home to 300 experts in AI and digital tech. The idea behind the Digital Factory is to develop digital solutions so we can optimize our industrial operations, offer new services to our customers (particularly when it comes to managing their energy use), accelerate our processes and reduce our environmental impact.\n\nVictor Martin / TotalEnergies has been using AI for many years in our exploration and production activities. Among other things, it\u2019s helping us forecast and refine production at oil fields, improve our predictive maintenance and detect equipment anomalies. But on top of that, artificial intelligence is now a key part of our efforts to reduce our emissions, make our facilities more energy-efficient and develop renewable energies. For example, one way the Company is using the technology is to identify the best sites for solar and wind farms and anticipate exactly how much energy they can produce. Our engineers are also using digital simulation tools to find the optimal layout for wind turbines, to prevent production losses and overuse. Artificial intelligence is also a powerful tool for boosting creativity and productivity in the workforce.

            "content": "In Davos, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, the CEO of TotalEnergies, highlighted the economic challenges faced by the European green industry. During a conference on European electricity, the executive called on the European Union to reconsider its protection policies in order to support its businesses in the global race for energy transition. According to him, despite the EU\u2019s ambitious carbon neutrality goal set for 2050, European industries are disadvantaged by increased competition, especially from China.\n\nThe TotalEnergies CEO cited several concrete examples illustrating this issue. He particularly pointed out sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and solar panels. For Pouyann\u00e9, investments in Europe to develop green technologies like SAF are in direct competition with cheap imports from China, a country that produces at much lower costs than Europe. \u201cI am not protected,\u201d he said, stressing the need for a stronger response from the EU to support its industries.\n\nTotalEnergies, which allocates one-third of its investments to renewable energies, faces a difficult reality: production costs in Europe, considered high compared to international standards, make companies vulnerable to foreign markets with fewer constraints. Pouyann\u00e9 also cited the United States as an example of effective government support. Thanks to the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d (IRA), the U.S. offers tax incentives to companies that locally produce green technologies. The French CEO illustrated his point by mentioning his investment in solar factories in the U.S., emphasizing that these incentives make the American industry more competitive.\n\nThis situation raises crucial questions for the future of energy transition in Europe. European industrial players find themselves in a delicate position: on one hand, the EU\u2019s environmental ambitions require massive investments in renewable energy, but on the other hand, global competition, particularly from China and the U.S., complicates the task.\n\nDespite these challenges, TotalEnergies continues to diversify, focusing on renewable energy while remaining one of the largest exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the U.S. However, Pouyann\u00e9 remains convinced that a solution must be found to protect European industry while pursuing the EU\u2019s climate goals.\n\nThe Economic Obstacles to Energy Transition\n\nThe CEO of TotalEnergies also discussed the need for a balance between energy transition and economic imperatives. If the EU truly aims to achieve its carbon neutrality goals, it will need to find solutions that allow its businesses to remain competitive while adhering to climate commitments. The European industry thus faces a complex dilemma: how to maintain competitiveness while reducing greenhouse gas emissions?\n\nComparison with American and Chinese Strategies\n\nThe American strategy, particularly through the IRA plan, has stimulated investment in green energy while supporting local production. This approach contrasts with that of the EU, where the lack of protections against foreign imports has exacerbated the difficulties faced by European industries. According to Pouyann\u00e9, the EU\u2019s response to foreign competition needs to be more proactive if it wishes to maintain its position in the global renewable energy market.",

According to reports from Reuters, the French oil giant had hoped to restart construction by the end of 2024, which would have allowed the project to come online by 2029. However, the company faces significant challenges, including the re-approval of a critical $4.7 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM).\n\nThe project, which has been stalled since 2021 due to violent unrest in the northern Cabo Delgado region, has yet to receive disbursements from EXIM as the loan has not been re-approved. TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne emphasized in October that force majeure could only be lifted once the financing was fully secured. Three export credit agencies have yet to confirm their loans, even after TotalEnergies renegotiated new restart costs with contractors.\n\nEXIM, which had initially agreed to finance the Mozambique LNG project under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, is still re-evaluating the amended loan package. The approval process has been delayed under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which imposed restrictions on lending for overseas oil and gas projects. The situation is further complicated by leadership transitions at EXIM following the new Trump administration\u2019s appointments.\n\nDespite these obstacles, security conditions in the region have improved, with partner Mitsui indicating in December that final preparations were underway to resume construction. However, TotalEnergies is prioritizing peace and stability in Cabo Delgado before pushing forward with the project\u2019s restart.\n\nTotalEnergies holds a 26.5% operating stake in the Mozambique LNG project, which was originally expected to transform the southern African nation into a major LNG producer.",

            "content": "Deepwater Namibia: Despite Shell\u2019s Write Down There\u2019s Still Lots of Life Left in the Basin\n\nVarious oil industry analysts including myself were shocked to hear the news on January 9th 2025 that Shell had written down its holdings in deepwater Namibia by $400 million. This has led to many analysts asking, \u201cWhatever is going on in deepwater Namibia\u201d?\n\nEarly Excitement\n\nOnly three years ago Shell electrified the world\u2019s oil industry with the announcement of the discovery of light oil and associated natural gas in the Graff-1X exploration well in the deepwater Orange Basin. The reservoirs were described as Upper Cretaceous marine sandstones. Almost immediately thereafter TOTALEnergies announced that the deepwater Venus-1X exploration well had discovered oil and associated gas in high-quality Lower Cretaceous sandstones. In 2023, Galp Energia added excitement with their announcement of the Mopane oil discovery. Following the Graff discovery, Shell announced oil and gas discoveries in the La Rona, Lesedi, Jonker and Enigma exploration wells. In total, five discoveries were made by Shell. Within a span of only three years, the Orange Basin had risen to become one of the world\u2019s top-rated areas for oil exploration.\n\nThis leads to the critical question: what new information is currently available which significantly downgrades the deepwater Namibia? Or is there still room for optimism? I had to ask myself: why does Shell\u2019s acreage in the Orange Basin have technical problems whereas these have not been reported by TOTALEnergies nor by Galp Energia?\n\nWithin the oil industry\u2019s geological community, there has been a lot of discussions on the internet about why Shell has downgraded its Orange Basin holdings. The overall consensus as summarized in the UK-based publication GEOExPro (October 2024) is that chlorite cementation probably has had a detrimental effect on the reservoir properties. Such impurities can lead to lower oil recovery rates. However, what is most puzzling is that neither Galp Energia nor TOTALEnergies have reported similar problems in their discoveries.\n\nMopane Oil & Gas Field\n\nIn mid-2024, Galp Energia completed the drilling of two wells in Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) 83 where it has a high 80% working interest. State-owned Namcor has a 10% working interest as well as Namibia-based Custos Energy with a 10% working interest. Custos Energy is a Namibian indigenous company. The initial discovery well, Mopane-1X was followed by Mopane-2X, an exploration well located eight kilometres (8km) westwards. Namcor stated that Mopane-1X had discovered \u201ca substantial column of light oil in high quality reservoir-bearing Cenomanian and Turonian age sands\u201d. Galp declared that with Monpane-2X, \u201csignificant light oil columns were found in high-quality reservoir sands\u201d. In April 2024, Galp announced that well tests in the Mopane-1X reached 14,000 barrels of oil per day equivalent which was the maximum allowable limit for testing. The oil was light oil with low viscosity, minimal CO 2 , and no H 2 S.\n\n\u201cThe statistics indicate that of twelve exploration wells drilled by Shell, TOTALEnergies, Galp and Chevron, nine wells were declared as oil discoveries and only three dry holes indicating a success rate of 75%. On a worldwide scale, such a success rate is unprecedented. The statistics indicate that of twelve exploration wells drilled by Shell, TOTALEnergies, Galp and Chevron, nine wells were declared as oil discoveries and only three dry holes indicating a success rate of 75%. On a worldwide scale, such a success rate is unprecedented.\u201d\n\nIn November 2024, Galp drilled and completed appraisal well Mopane-1A. Galp announced \u201clight oil and gas-condensate reservoir-bearing sands with good porosities\u201d. In January 2025, Galp completed appraisal well Mopane-2A and announced that the reservoir consisted of \u201cgood quality\u201d sands with \u201cgood\u201d porosities and permeabilities, high pressures and low fluid viscosities, minimum concentrations of carbon dioxide and no hydrogen sulfide. Galp also stated that \u201cin line with the previous Mopane wells, no water contacts were found\u201d. Industry watchers like myself wonder why Galp described the sands in Mopane-1A and Mopane-2A as only \u201cgood quality\u201d whereas in the first two wells the reservoirs were described as \u201chigh quality\u201d. Possibly the reservoir quality decreases in a westward and southern direction. In the meantime, Galp is now drilling Mopane-3X located about 15 km southeast of the Mopane field.\n\nShell\u2019s announcement of their write down of their Namibia holdings could be viewed by the international investors as being extremely negative for deepwater Namibia. However, Galp Energia\u2019s stock market price has held up very well, which implies that the worldwide international investment community is not overly concerned about Shell\u2019s pessimistic assessment (Figure 1). Galp\u2019s current stock market capitalization stands at a healthy Euro 11.8Billion ($12.3Billion). A similar stock market performance has been achieved by Toronto, Canada-based Sintana Energy which has a 4.9% interest in Mopane through its indirect interest in Custos Energy. Sintana\u2019s current stock market capitalization is Cdn$295Million ($205Million).\n\nCurrently, Rhino Resources is operator of PEL 85 and is drilling the Sagitarius-1X exploration well. Rhino\u2019s partners include Azule Energy which is the BP-Eni 50:50 joint venture, Namcor and the Namibian company Korres Investments. Rhino Resources is a privately owned South African company and holds 42.5% interest in PEL 85 along with Azul Energy holding 42.5%, Namcor 10% and Korres 5%. At an oil industry conference last year in Cape Town, Maggy Shino, Namibia\u2019s Petroleum Commissioner described Sagitarius as follows: \u201cThis is one of the most amazing prospects I have ever seen in Namibia. It does not get better than this\u201d. If Mopane-3X and Sagitarius-1X are successes, this would bode well for the Orange Basin. However, if either are dry holes, this would blow a cold wind over deepwater Namibia.\n\nChevron Dry Hole\n\nA cold wind did blow recently over deepwater Namibia with Chevron announcing on January 15, 2025 that their first exploration well in Namibia, Kapana-1X drilled on PEL 90 was a dry hole. This well was drilled 60 km west from Mopane. PEL 90 covers 5,433 sq km in water depths of 2,300 \u2013 3,300 metres. Chevron is operator of PEL 90 with a 90% working interest and partnered with Namibia-based Trago Energy which holds the remaining 10%. Sintana Energy has a 5% carried indirect interest in PEL 90 in the initial exploration phase. Sintana acquired its interest through its acquisition in March 2022 of 49% of Trago Energy which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Custos Energy.\n\nSummary of Drilling to Date\n\nShell: Graff-1X (Exploration), La Rona-1X (Exploration), Lesidi-1X (Exploration), Jonker-1X (Exploration), Enigma-1X (Exploration), Jonker-1A (Appraisal), Jonker-2A (Appraisal) TOTALEnergies: Venus-1X (Exploration), Mangetti-1X (Exploration), Venus-1A (Appraisal), Venus-2A (Appraisal) Galp Energia: Mopane-1X (Exploration), Monpane-2X (Exploration), Mopane-1A (Appraisal), Mopane-2A (Appraisal) Dry Holes: Shell Cullinan-1X (Dry Hole), TOTALEnergies Nara-1X (Dry Hole), Chevron Kapana-1X (Dry Hole) Current Drillers: Galp Energia Mopane-3X (Exploration), Rhino Resources Sagitarius-1X (Exploration), Total Energies Tamboti-1X (Exploration)\n\nThe statistics indicate that of twelve exploration wells drilled by Shell, TOTALEnergies, Galp and Chevron, nine wells were declared as oil discoveries and only three dry holes indicating a success rate of 75%. On a worldwide scale, such a success rate is unprecedented. However, some analysts have lingering concerns about the commercial viability of some of these discoveries.\n\nTOTALEnergies Moving Full Speed Ahead\n\nTwo weeks ago, rumours began to surface that TOTALEnergies may have a major discovery in the Tamboti-1X exploration well. This well appears to be targeting the northeastern extension of the fan complex discovered by Mangetti-1X. TOTALEnergies mentioned that the structure targeted by this well could hold one billion barrels of oil resource. A press release has not yet been issued. Last October, TOTALEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne told analysts that the first FPSO on Venus will be designed to produce 160,000 barrels of oil per day and 500 million cubic feet of gas daily. The development is expected to be sanctioned in mid-2025 and on production by 2029. Multiple FPSOs will be needed for the full development of Venus. A major challenge for the development of Venus is the need to reinject the gas at a reasonable cost. Excessive costs could conceivably make the project non-economic. This will require leading edge technology since never before has reinjection of gas been carried out in 3,000 m of water.\n\nEstimates of Oil & Gas Resources\n\nGalp estimated that the Mopane discovery holds over 10Bllion barrels of oil in-place. By using a recovery factor of 25%, my \u201cback of the envelope\u201d estimate of the recoverable resources for Mopane are 2.5Billion barrels of oil. According to Namcor, Venus holds 2Billion barrels of recoverable oil out of an in-place resource of 5.0Billion barrels. This implies a recovery factor of 40%. Namcor has also indicated that they estimate almost 9.0Trillion cubic feet of associated gas has been found by TOTALEnergies and Shell.\n\nAll of the oil discoveries throughout the Orange Basin are gas-rich so there are also concerns about what to do with the gas. Flaring is not an option. Due to the deep water which ranges from as deep as 3,000 metres for TOTALEnergies to 2,000 metres for Shell and 1,600 metres for Galp, a gas solution will be complicated and expensive.\n\nNone of the discoveries in the Orange Basin have yet been declared commercially viable. None yet can be classified as reserves since reserves are volumes of oil which have been determined to be economically producible by the operator, independent consultants, and the Government of Namibia.\n\nWhere Is This All Going?\n\nHas Shell unfairly tarnished the heretofore outstanding reputation of the deepwater Orange Basin? Perhaps Shell\u2019s corporate threshold for commercial success is much higher than that of Galp and TOTALEnergies? However, I believe there are other companies such as Petrobras, TOTALEnergies or Chevron who could be very willing to partner with Namcor and develop Shell\u2019s discoveries if Shell walks away. You can also be sure that ExxonMobil remains interested in opportunities in the Orange Basin.\n\nOne day after Shell announced the write down, Namibia\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mines issued a strongly worded two-page rebuttal which included the following: \u201cWhile the Shell write down is unfortunate, we believe that we have barely begun to scratch the surface of our country\u2019s offshore resources. We remain confident that ongoing exploration efforts will reveal commercial opportunities and look forward to delivering first oil production in the near future\u201d.\n\nFor the past fifty years I have been involved hands-on in worldwide oil and gas exploration. I have also followed the oil industry as a consultant and analyst. I fully agree with the Namibians. It is still early days in Namibia. This is classic frontier oil exploration in a minimally evaluated super-large sedimentary basin. This story is not yet finished. Stay tuned.\n\nBiography\n\nTako Koning is Holland-born, Canada-raised and resides in Calgary. He was involved with the evaluation of Namibia\u2019s Kudu gas field from 1995 \u2013 1997 when he was portfolio manager with Texaco in Luanda, Angola. At that time, Shell was operator of Kudu and Texaco had a 15% working interest in the field. Since that time, he has had an abiding interest in Namibia\u2019s oil industry. He closely follows the latest news coming out of Namibia. He has travelled several times in Namibia for business and also as a tourist. His view is that Namibia is magnificent with its deserts, spectacular coastline, wildlife, and numerous national parks.\n\nKoning has a B.Sc. in Geology from the University of Alberta and a B.A. in Economics from the University of Calgary. He worked worldwide for Texaco for thirty years and subsequently he continued to work in Angola for Tullow Oil and the consultancy of Gaffney, Cline & Associates. During his fifty-year career, he lived and worked for seven years in Indonesia, three years in Nigeria, and twenty years in Angola and the remainder in Calgary. He is pleased to share his knowledge of Namibia in this article. He has been an active member of the International Advisory Board of Africa Oil + Gas Report ever since the publication was founded in 2001 by Toyin Akinosho in Lagos, Nigeria.",

By 2002-03, he had transitioned into managerial roles, taking charge of Montevarchi.\n\nHis international coaching career began in Cameroon, where he worked with the U-20 national team before moving to Acada Sports in 2005.\n\nIn 2007, he became Technical Director for the Congolese Football Federation, overseeing all national teams.\n\nOver the years, he managed prominent clubs across several countries, including Botev Plovdiv in Bulgaria, where he coached during the 2008-09 season, and Al-Ittihad Tripoli in Libya, guiding them to a national league title in 2010.\n\nCusin\u2019s adaptability and expertise saw him work as an assistant to Walter Zenga from 2010 to 2014, notably helping Al-Nasr SC in Saudi Arabia qualify for the AFC Champions League.\n\nHis tenure as head coach of Al-Fujairah SC in the UAE led to their promotion to the country\u2019s top division. In 2015, he became the first Italian to manage in Palestine, achieving success with Ahli al-Khalil by winning the Palestinian Cup and Super Cup.\n\nAfter working with Wolverhampton as an assistant and holding managerial roles in South Africa and Iran, Cusin took on national team duties.\n\nHe coached South Sudan in 2021 and, since October 2023, has been leading Comoros in preparation for AFCON 2025.\n\nStyle of Play\n\nStefano Cusin is widely recognized for his methodical and pragmatic approach to football. His teams are built on a foundation of solid defensive organization while maintaining the capacity for fluid, creative attacking play. Cusin\u2019s system emphasizes balance, ensuring that transitions between defense and attack are seamless.\n\nKnown for his tactical flexibility, he tailors his strategies to adapt to the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents. His teams frequently exploit quick counterattacks and utilize technical players on the wings to create scoring opportunities. At the same time, Cusin emphasizes teamwork and discipline, ensuring every player understands their role within the system.\n\nAs he once remarked, \u201cFootball is a team game above all. Every player must understand their role and be ready to adapt. The key lies in balance and flexibility.\u201d\n\nExperience at the TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations\n\nThe 2025 AFCON in Morocco will be Stefano Cusin\u2019s debut in this prestigious continental tournament. As a first-time participant, he will aim to bring his extensive international experience and tactical ingenuity to guide Comoros through a challenging competition.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nStefano Cusin was born in Canada, raised in France, and comes from an Italo-French family. His multicultural background has allowed him to fluently speak multiple languages, a skill that has greatly benefited his coaching career across continents.\n\nWith AFCON 2025 fast approaching, Stefano Cusin and Comoros are eager to make their mark, fueled by his vast experience and pragmatic approach to the game.",

            "content": "TotalEnergies outlines plans to expand Libya production\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Energy Capital & Power, Pedro Ribeiro, Managing Director and Country Chair \u2013 Libya for TotalEnergies, shared the company's strategic plans to enhance field performance, increase production at Waha and Sharara and advance exploration efforts in the Murzuq Basin.\n\nWith TotalEnergies participating in approximately half of Libya\u2019s national production, how do you plan to build on this success and support Libya\u2019s ambitious goal to further increase its oil and gas output in the coming years?\n\nTotalEnergies has been present in Libya for over 60 years and is proud to have contributed, through its partnerships with the National Oil Corporation (NOC), to the development of Libyan oil and gas production and to the recent national production records above 1.4 mboe/d. Both Waha and Sharara, which TotalEnergies is a partner of, have recorded their highest daily productions over the decade, above 370 kbo/d for Waha and 300 kbo/d for Sharara. The plan of TotalEnergies to contribute to Libya\u2019s further production expansion is threefold:\n\nBy optimizing the performance of the operating fields: infills, reinstatement and maintenance of installations, wells stimulation, etc. The recent production records of Waha and Sharara have shown how significant are the outcomes of such a steady effort.\n\nBy undertaking larger scale projects, such as Mabruk, which is set for a restart in 2025 thanks to an early production facility (EPF), which will bring production initially to 25 kb/d before a ramp-up to higher rates at later stages. Other new projects in Waha and Sharara are also being evaluated.\n\nBy continuing our exploration effort. TotalEnergies, together with its partners, has resumed exploration activities in Libya\u2019s Murzuq Basin, with the drilling of the Nesser well, putting an end to a long suspension of the exploration effort around Sharara. Libya holds a strategic position in TotalEnergies\u2019 global upstream portfolio with its large, significantly untapped and low emitting resources. TotalEnergies is committed to further contribute to Libya\u2019s production expansion.\n\nCould you provide an update on the current status of the Waha production baseline and any upcoming developments in this area?\n\nA consistent and ambitious production enhancement initiative has been launched in 2023 and has been steadily continued over 2024, aimed at increasing production by up to 120 kbo/d. By mobilizing drilling and work-over rigs, drilling wells, restoring the integrity and potential of the wells, renewing equipment and piping and reinstating water injection systems, significant outcomes have been targeted and achieved. Having just recorded a sequence of daily production records over 370 kbo/d, Waha testifies the relevance of the strategy putting a strong focus on the reliability and optimization of the existing fields. A number of challenges still lie ahead, and we trust the Waha partnership will deliver further.\n\nIn addition, together with the NOC, TotalEnergies has continued to progress the ambitious North Gialo project, which has the potential to increase Waha\u2019s production by another 100 kbo/d, and plans to spud an exploration well in 2025.\n\nTotalEnergies has committed to reducing gas flaring and methane emissions in the Waha fields. Can you share more details on the specific actions being taken to achieve this and the timeline for implementation? What role do you see TotalEnergies playing in Libya\u2019s broader energy transition?\n\nIn 2023, TotalEnergies championed the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Carter (OGDC) launched at the COP28, which was signed by over 50 companies, and includes the objective of \u201cnear-zero methane emissions by 2030.\u201d Similarly, on World Environment Day (June 5th, 2023), NOC\u2019s statement announced \u201cMubadara 2030,\u201d Arabic for \u201cInitiative 2030,\u201d with the ambition of \u201cminimizing gas flaring across all fields, facilities, and oil sites\u201d with the ultimate objective of eliminating flaring by the year 2030.\n\nThroughout its Libyan activities, TotalEnergies sees its role as a promoter of the best environmental practices that will make Libyan oil and gas as low impact as possible. A number of actions have been undertaken, together with the NOC and the operating companies, aiming at reducing and eliminating gas flaring or venting through gas recovery for generation whether on-site or for routing to gas power plants, and through optimization of compressors. Two initiatives embody what TotalEnergies is promoting as a responsible energy producer:",

In the spring of 2021, Islamic State-affiliated militants raided the town of Palma in attacks that left dozens of people killed.\n\nSince 2021, TotalEnergies has waited for several conditions to be met to take a positive decision on resuming work on the project. The goal to achieve first LNG production has also slipped, first to 2027, and later, to 2029.\n\nNow the 2029 timeline is also threatened as TotalEnergies did not resume work on Mozambique LNG by the end of 2024, as planned last year.\n\nTotalEnergies confirmed to FT that its plans to restart the project by the end of last year slipped amid the disputed presidential election in Mozambique, the continued violence, and concerns about the security situation.\n\nThe October presidential election in Mozambique has been highly contested, with the opposition claiming the vote was rigged. Daniel Chapo of the Frelimo party, which has ruled the country for nearly five decades, won the election and was sworn in earlier this month, but the defeated independent candidate, Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, has rejected the result and called for nationwide strikes and protests.\n\nThese events have forced TotalEnergies to further delay the restart of the project as it needs \u201cpublic services\u201d and \u201cnormal life\u201d, the company told FT.\n\n\u201cThe priority is to restore peace and security in the Cabo Delgado and the lifting of the force majeure,\u201d said TotalEnergies.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

This project was the continent's biggest foreign direct investment (FDI) project at the time.\n\nArmed uprisings halt work\n\nHowever, the company was compelled to declare force majeure back in 2021, following insurgent attacks in Mozambique's Cabo Delgado province. These attacks took place close to a TotalEnergies site, which was expected to be used to convert gas into liquid.\n\nAlthough TotalEnergies planned to resume the project by the end of last year, the plans were delayed following increased violence and unrest after the October presidential election, the result of which remains heavily contested. Violent protests have not only led to the loss of lives but have also hit businesses and caused ports and land borders to be shut down.\n\nBack in 2021, following the declaration of force majeure, TotalEnergies said on its website: \"Considering the evolution of the security situation in the north of the Province of Cabo Delgado, in Mozambique, we confirm the withdrawal from Afungi of all personnel from the Mozambique LNG Project. This situation leads TotalEnergies EP Mozambique Area 1, Lda. (TEPMA1), as operator of the Mozambique LNG Project, to declare force majeure.\n\n\"We express our solidarity with the Government and the Mozambican people and hope that the actions carried out by the Government of Mozambique and its regional and international partners allow for the re-establishment of security and stability in the Province of Cabo Delgado in a sustained manner.\"\n\nThe company has indicated there may be hope of a turnaround soon, following Rwanda and Mozambique striking up a partnership. Rwanda has deployed thousands of troops to help Mozambique.",

File Photo by Ali Haider/EPA-EFE\n\nJan. 22 (UPI) -- An open letter Wednesday signed by 126 non-governmental organizations urged public and private lending institutions to end financing for a Mozambique liquified natural gas facility being built by France's TotalEnergies. \"It is in your hands to ensure justice for the people affected by this project, and for the survivors and witnesses of the reported massacre near the Afungi gas site,\" the NGOs said in their open letter.

However, industry experts believe that light oil, good reservoir properties, high test flow rates and very large volumes may yet restore full confidence in the Orange Basin.\n\nSupermajor TotalEnergi e s is currently drilling in Petroleum Exploration Licence (PEL) 56, along with independent Rhino Resources in PEL 85. The local industry is also keeping a close eye on Portuguese company Galp\u2019s potentially massive discovery in PEL 83 Mopane.\n\nMeanwhile, TotalEnergies and its joint venture partners appointed the Southern African Institute of Environmental Assessment (SAIEA) to host public and stakeholder engagement meetings to gather input on the environmental and social aspects of the proposed project.\n\nFollowing the Venus offshore discovery in February 2022, TotalEnergies EP Namibia, on behalf of its joint venture partners (QatarEnergy, Impact Oil and Gas and Namcor), conducted engineering studies to determine the viability of the offshore development, which could ultimately lead to commercial production at the Venus field.\n\nAccording to SAIEA representative Peter Tarr, the recent consultations mark a key step in the strategic scoping process, ensuring transparency and inclusion as plans for the potential development of TotalEnergies EP Namibia\u2019s offshore activities in the Orange Basin progress.\n\n\u201cTEEPNA has engaged SAIEA to undertake a strategic environmental and social scoping. The main objective is to gather and assess key issues, concerns and expectations among stakeholders regarding the potential operations of the joint venture. This baseline will guide the development of further consultations,\u201d he said in a statement this week.\n\nTarr added that these meetings are designed to foster dialogue and ensure all voices are heard as their input will be crucial in shaping a responsible and sustainable approach to the significant discovery.\n\nPublic consultations to collect opinions and concerns from communities likely to be impacted will take place in L\u00fcderitz, Windhoek and Walvis Bay.\n\nThe first meeting was scheduled for Monday, 20 January 2025 at L\u00fcderitz Junior Secondary School, with two sessions scheduled from 14h00 to 16h00, and 17h00 to 19h00.\n\nThe second meeting is scheduled for today in Windhoek at the F\u00fcrstenhof Hotel, with meetings in the same timeslot as L\u00fcderitz. The final consultation is scheduled for Friday at Sea Lodge in Walvis Bay, with a single session from 10h00 to noon.\n\n\u201cWe have designed the schedule to ensure stakeholders across different regions can participate at a time and place most convenient to them,\u201d Tarr said. The consultations come nearly three years after the Venus 1-X discovery, which revealed a significant light oil reservoir approximately 290 kilometres offshore. Block 2913B, covering 8.215 square kilometres, is operated by TotalEnergies (40%), alongside QatarEnergy (30%), Impact Oil and Gas (20%), and Namcor (10%).\n\nAccording to industry insiders, the Hercules semi-submersible rig has been mobilised to PEL 83 to drill Mopane-1X for Galp. In the absence of confirmed undersea production concepts and development capital expenditure, Galp is still searching for a joint venture partner, which has resulted in attracting interest from Brazil\u2019s Petrobras.\n\nTotalEnergies and BW Energy also joined the race to production, with their Venus (2022) and Kudu (1974) fields vying to be Namibia\u2019s maiden offshore development. BW is currently implementing a gas-to-power field development plan for Kudu.\n\nRecent 3D images for BW Energy have revealed a strong potential for the development of the Kudu block.\n\n\u2013 edeklerk@nepc.com.na\n\n\u2013 ebrandt@nepc.com.na",

            "content": "In an exclusive interview with Energy Capital & Power, Pedro Ribeiro, Managing Director and Country Chair \u2013 Libya for TotalEnergies, shared the company\u2019s strategic plans to enhance field performance, increase production at Waha and Sharara and advance exploration efforts in the Murzuq Basin.\n\nWith TotalEnergies participating in approximately half of Libya\u2019s national production, how do you plan to build on this success and support Libya\u2019s ambitious goal to further increase its oil and gas output in the coming years?\n\nTotalEnergies has been present in Libya for over 60 years and is proud to have contributed, through its partnerships with the National Oil Corporation (NOC), to the development of Libyan oil and gas production and to the recent national production records above 1.4 mboe/d. Both Waha and Sharara, which TotalEnergies is a partner of, have recorded their highest daily productions over the decade, above 370 kbo/d for Waha and 300 kbo/d for Sharara. The plan of TotalEnergies to contribute to Libya\u2019s further production expansion is threefold:\n\nBy optimizing the performance of the operating fields: infills, reinstatement and maintenance of installations, wells stimulation, etc. The recent production records of Waha and Sharara have shown how significant are the outcomes of such a steady effort.\n\nBy undertaking larger scale projects, such as Mabruk, which is set for a restart in 2025 thanks to an early production facility (EPF), which will bring production initially to 25 kb/d before a ramp-up to higher rates at later stages. Other new projects in Waha and Sharara are also being evaluated.\n\nBy continuing our exploration effort. TotalEnergies, together with its partners, has resumed exploration activities in Libya\u2019s Murzuq Basin, with the drilling of the Nesser well, putting an end to a long suspension of the exploration effort around Sharara. Libya holds a strategic position in TotalEnergies\u2019 global upstream portfolio with its large, significantly untapped and low emitting resources. TotalEnergies is committed to further contribute to Libya\u2019s production expansion.\n\nCould you provide an update on the current status of the Waha production baseline and any upcoming developments in this area?\n\nA consistent and ambitious production enhancement initiative has been launched in 2023 and has been steadily continued over 2024, aimed at increasing production by up to 120 kbo/d. By mobilizing drilling and work-over rigs, drilling wells, restoring the integrity and potential of the wells, renewing equipment and piping and reinstating water injection systems, significant outcomes have been targeted and achieved. Having just recorded a sequence of daily production records over 370 kbo/d, Waha testifies the relevance of the strategy putting a strong focus on the reliability and optimization of the existing fields. A number of challenges still lie ahead, and we trust the Waha partnership will deliver further.\n\nIn addition, together with the NOC, TotalEnergies has continued to progress the ambitious North Gialo project, which has the potential to increase Waha\u2019s production by another 100 kbo/d, and plans to spud an exploration well in 2025.\n\nFinally, safety is TotalEnergies\u2019 first value. We are committed to constantly improve our Safety and Environment performance, which is also the best guarantee to achieve sustainable and steady production results. An integral part of the plan is to constantly promote and diffuse a strong progress in HSE culture throughout Waha\u2019s operations.\n\nTotalEnergies has committed to reducing gas flaring and methane emissions in the Waha fields. Can you share more details on the specific actions being taken to achieve this and the timeline for implementation? What role do you see TotalEnergies playing in Libya\u2019s broader energy transition?\n\nIn 2023, TotalEnergies championed the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Carter (OGDC) launched at the COP28, which was signed by over 50 companies, and includes the objective of \u201cnear-zero methane emissions by 2030\u201d. Similarly, on World Environment Day (June 5th, 2023), NOC\u2019s statement announced \u201cMubadara 2030\u201d, Arabic for \u201cinitiative 2030\u201d, with the ambition of \u201cminimizing gas flaring across all fields, facilities, and oil sites\u201d with the ultimate objective of eliminating flaring by the year 2030.\n\nThroughout its Libyan activities, TotalEnergies sees its role as a promoter of the best environmental practices that will make Libyan oil and gas as low impact as possible. A number of actions have been undertaken, together with the NOC and the operating companies, aiming at reducing and eliminating gas flaring or venting through gas recovery for generation whether on-site or for routing to gas power plants, and through optimization of compressors.\n\nTwo initiatives embody what TotalEnergies is promoting as a responsible energy producer:\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 AUSEA technology, a drone-mounted suite of sensors ensuring access to hard-to-reach emission points while delivering readings with the highest precision, has been made available to its Libyan partnering operating companies. A concrete action to encourage the move toward zero methane emissions.\n\nThe Mabruk EPF will recover by design all the produced gas to use it for the process of heating needs. It will be the first of its kind in Libya.\n\nTotalEnergies is moving forward with its 500 MW solar PV project, in partnership with REAOL and GECOL. How do you view the potential for solar energy in Libya, and what steps is TotalEnergies taking to ensure the success of this project as a model for future renewable energy initiatives in the country?\n\nLibya enjoys a first-in-class solar irradiation, which makes solar a potential ideal substitute for fuel oil and gas for power or heat generation. Besides the resource, the development of solar projects requires several enablers that must be secured prior to launching construction: a suitable piece of land, a reliable grid connection to export the solar plant energy production to the end consumers and absorb the generated output, environmental and construction permits and an offtake contract securing the payment of the electricity produced. Together with REAOL and GECOL, and the support of the NOC, TotalEnergies is progressing in securing these enablers to make the Misrata 500 MW solar project a first of its kind in Libya.\n\nThe sunlight is readily available in Libya with spacious land. While respecting the environment, opportunities for solar projects should be contemplated to substitute and complement fuel gas in supplying Libya with clean power. TotalEnergies sees its Misrata utility-scale project as a reference project that will also be a test bench for the solar supply chain in Libya.",

He also guided Ghana to a fourth-place finish at the 2013 AFCON and a Round of 16 finish in 2019.\n\nStyle of Play\n\nA strong advocate of attacking football, Appiah\u2019s preferred 4-3-3 formation emphasizes fluidity, creativity, and relentless forward momentum. His teams are known for their organization, adaptability, and sharp tactical awareness, traits that have already begun to shine in Sudan\u2019s recent performances.\n\nRecent Impact\n\nSince taking charge, Appiah has revitalized Sudan\u2019s national team, leading them to impressive results in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, where they currently top their group ahead of heavyweights Senegal and DR Congo. Under his guidance, Sudan have lost only two of their last ten competitive matches, showcasing their newfound resilience and consistency.\n\nFun Facts\n\nAppiah\u2019s remarkable playing career and his nickname \u201cMayele\u201d stem from his memorable clashes with DR Congo legend Mayele during his days as a defender. His deep understanding of African football culture and dynamics gives him a unique edge in preparing his teams for high-stakes tournaments.\n\nVision and Goals\n\nFor the 2025 AFCON, Appiah has set his sights on the ultimate prize. Speaking to Ghanaian media outlet Akoma FM, he stated: \u201cWinning the trophy is my goal.\u201d With his vast experience, tactical expertise, and a rejuvenated Sudanese side under his wing, Appiah is ready to make history once again.\n\nSudan\u2019s fans will be hoping that their team\u2019s journey at the 2025 TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations reflects the vision and determination of their inspiring leader.",

We don\u2019t just want to drill wells; we want to optimize production at existing wells,\u201d Bravo stated, adding, \u201cIn order to have ambition, we need to have a mission.\u201d\n\nEni\n\nEni\u2019s fireside chat highlighted the company\u2019s interest in participating in Libya\u2019s 2025 licensing round, which will offer 22 onshore and offshore blocks for development. Mirko Araldi, Eni Libya Managing Director, shared plans for four exploration wells in 2025, including an ultra-deep well in the offshore Ghadames Basin, scheduled for the second half of the year in partnership with bp. \u201cExploration is a very important activity,\u201d Araldi said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a cornerstone in Eni Libya\u2019s strategy.

            "content": "The TotalEnergies CAF African Nations Championship (CHAN) 2024 provides a platform for Africa's most talented local players and their coaches to shine on the continental stage.\n\nLeading Burkina Faso\u2019s charge is Issa Balbon\u00e9, a seasoned tactician with a wealth of experience and a history of lifting his teams to new heights.\n\nTasked with bringing out a more competitive face of the Stallions, Balbon\u00e9 aims to guide his side to unprecedented success in a tournament that has historically eluded them.\n\nCoach Profile: Issa Balbon\u00e9\n\nName : Issa Balbon\u00e9\n\n: Issa Balbon\u00e9 Country of Birth : Burkina Faso\n\n: Burkina Faso Age : 51\n\n: 51 Current Team: Burkina Faso A\u2019\n\nCareer Highlights\n\nIssa Balbon\u00e9\u2019s coaching journey has been one of consistent growth and determination. As the head coach of Burkina Faso's U23 national team, he steered the side to the final of the 2015 African Games football tournament in Brazzaville, showcasing exceptional tactical acumen despite narrowly losing to Senegal.\n\nTransitioning from a playing career to coaching, Balbon\u00e9 has made significant contributions to Burkina Faso\u2019s domestic league, leading clubs such as UFSA, AS Police, and Canon du Sud to prominence.\n\nIn April 2024, he was appointed head coach of both Burkina Faso\u2019s local national team and the U23 side. His first mission was a resounding success: qualifying Burkina Faso for the CHAN 2024. This achievement was particularly impressive as it came after overturning a 2-0 first-leg defeat to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in the qualifiers. Balbon\u00e9 also serves as an assistant coach for the senior national team under Brama Traor\u00e9, underlining his importance to Burkinab\u00e9 football.\n\nPlaying Style\n\nBalbon\u00e9 is renowned for his strategic approach to games. A master tactician, he excels at reading opponents and adapting his game plans accordingly. His tactical intelligence was on full display during the CHAN qualifiers, where his team\u2019s adjustments neutralized C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s advantage and propelled the Stallions to victory.\n\nCHAN Experience\n\nThe 2024 edition marks Balbon\u00e9\u2019s debut as head coach in the TotalEnergies CAF CHAN. In Burkina Faso\u2019s previous three CHAN appearances, the team was led by different coaches\u2014Brama Traor\u00e9 (2014), Drissa Traor\u00e9 Malo (2018), and Seydou Zerbo (2021). Balbon\u00e9 will look to surpass their efforts and write a new chapter in Burkina Faso\u2019s CHAN history.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nBurkina Faso has only one victory in the final stages of the CHAN across three previous appearances. Balbon\u00e9 is determined to change that narrative and lead the Stallions to a competitive showing in 2024.\n\nOutlook for CHAN 2024\n\nIssa Balbon\u00e9\u2019s leadership represents a fresh start for Burkina Faso\u2019s CHAN aspirations. With his strategic mind, deep understanding of the game, and ability to inspire his players, Balbon\u00e9 will aim to break the Stallions\u2019 group-stage barrier and mount a strong challenge in East Africa.\n\nWith Burkina Faso placed in a tough group, Balbon\u00e9\u2019s ability to rally his side and instill confidence will be key. Fans will be hoping that his debut CHAN campaign will mark the beginning of a new era for Burkinab\u00e9 football.",

After suffering a 2-0 defeat in Abidjan during the first leg, the Stallions mounted a spectacular comeback in the return fixture. Goals from Aboubacar Traor\u00e9 and Alain Kant\u00e9 leveled the aggregate score before Burkina Faso triumphed 4-2 in the penalty shootout.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround showcased the team\u2019s resilience and provided a blueprint for tackling the challenges that lie ahead in the tournament.\n\nPlayer to Watch\n\nAboubacar Traor\u00e9 (AS Sonabel)The 26-year-old forward is a key figure in Burkina Faso\u2019s attack. Traor\u00e9\u2019s crucial goal in the qualifier against C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire underlined his ability to deliver in high-pressure moments. Known for his sharp technique, agility, and finishing prowess, Traor\u00e9 is a prolific scorer in the Burkinab\u00e9 top flight. His aerial ability adds another dimension to his game, making him a constant threat to opposition defenses.\n\nThe Coach\n\nIssa Balbon\u00e9\n\nAppointed in April 2024, Issa Balbon\u00e9 has quickly left his mark as head coach of Burkina Faso\u2019s CHAN and U23 teams. Known for his tactical adaptability, Balbon\u00e9\u2019s approach was pivotal in overturning the deficit against C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire during the qualifiers.\n\nA seasoned figure in Burkinab\u00e9 football, Balbon\u00e9 has managed top-tier clubs like USFA, AS Police, and Canon du Sud. He also serves as an assistant to Brama Traor\u00e9 for the senior national team, reflecting his integral role in the country\u2019s footballing project. His leadership will be crucial as the Stallions aim to advance beyond the group stage for the first time.\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nBurkina Faso enters CHAN 2024 with a point to prove. Despite their best efforts in three previous appearances, the team has yet to progress beyond the group stage. This year, they will rely on their tactical discipline and the experience gained from participating in the 2025 Mapinduzi Cup to refine their strategies.\n\nThe Stallions are expected to analyze past shortcomings and make the necessary adjustments to challenge for a place in the knockout rounds. Their gritty performance against C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in qualifying demonstrates their ability to rise to the occasion.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nBurkina Faso\u2019s only victory in the CHAN tournament came in the 2020 edition, where they defeated Zimbabwe 3-1 in a group-stage match at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaound\u00e9. That match also marked the first time the Stallions scored more than one goal in a CHAN fixture.\n\nOutlook for CHAN 2024\n\nArmed with determination and guided by the experienced Issa Balbon\u00e9, Burkina Faso aims to defy its CHAN history and make a significant impact in East Africa. With a blend of emerging talent and tactical acumen, the Stallions will look to turn potential into results and bring pride to their nation.",

However, Sundowns are determined to put pressure on their opponents and seize the opportunity to finish at the top of the standings themselves.\n\n\"I just think they will sit back obviously because they want to finish top in the group, but for us to finish top [of the table] we need to push ourselves. We need to win the game, score goals and that's the spirit,\" Rayners added, reflecting his side\u2019s mentality going into the crucial encounter.\n\nSundowns have already proved themselves as one of the continent's top teams, but they will need to show their full strength and tactical discipline to ensure qualification for the knockout stages.\n\nA win on Sunday would see the Brazilians leapfrog AS FAR to the top of Group B, while a draw would be enough to see them progress to the next round.\n\nThe team\u2019s focus remains clear: remain patient, stick to the game plan, and execute with precision. With the pressure mounting and the stakes high, Sundowns will be determined to showcase their quality and make a statement on home soil.\n\nThe match is set to be a thrilling encounter, with both teams vying for top spot in the group and a place in the next stage of Africa\u2019s premier club competition.\n\nFans can expect an exciting clash as Sundowns look to keep their hopes alive and push towards securing their second continental title since their maiden triumph in 2016.",

These efforts underline Masdar\u2019s central role in the global energy transition and its commitment to balanced growth.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions for Global Expansion\n\nMasdar solidified its position in European and North American markets through major acquisitions in Spain, Greece, and the United States. These initiatives enabled the company to diversify its portfolio while strengthening its presence in strategic regions.\n\nAt the same time, Masdar launched several large-scale projects, including two solar plants in Azerbaijan with a total capacity of 760MW and the Zarafshan wind farm in Uzbekistan with a capacity of 500MW, now the largest operational wind project in Central Asia.\n\nFlagship Projects and Structured Financing\n\nIn addition to its acquisitions, Masdar launched high-impact projects such as the Al Ajban Solar Project (1.5GW) in the United Arab Emirates and the Al Henakiyah Solar Plant (1.1GW) in Saudi Arabia. The recent agreement for the Sadawi Project (2GW) in Saudi Arabia also highlights the company\u2019s forward momentum.\n\nTo fund its projects, Masdar issued a second green bond in 2024, raising $1 billion with an oversubscription rate of 4.6 times. Fitch Ratings also upgraded the company\u2019s credit rating to AA-, further reinforcing investor confidence in Masdar\u2019s financial strength and strategic vision.\n\nA Key Player in Global Energy Strategy\n\nAligned with the objectives of the United Arab Emirates and international commitments, Masdar aims for a total capacity of 100GW by 2030. This trajectory is part of the global effort to triple renewable energy capacity by the end of the decade.\n\nSince its establishment in 2006, Masdar has played a pivotal role in the global energy transition, collaborating with more than 40 countries and leveraging a strategy that combines acquisitions with project development to meet its ambitious goals.",

The job has been 100 per cent guaranteed.\n\n\u201cWe have transited from Nigeria Agip Oil Company to Oando Energy Resources Limited with zero loss to membership. We have transited from Equinor to Chappal, with zero loss of membership. We just transited from Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited to Seplat Energy Producing Nigeria Unlimited, with zero loss to membership.\n\n\u201cAnd beyond zero loss to membership, the condition of service was 100 per cent protected. So, there is none of our members today that is earning less than what they were earning before now as a result of divestment. So, it is an achievement that we are extremely proud of\u201d\n\nHe expressed confidence that no job will be lost upon transition of employees from SPDC to Renaissance as the association was going to deepen the conversation with both companies.\n\nOsifo assured that no member against his own volition will lose his or her job and that the remuneration will even be enhanced.\n\nAlso, responding to THISDAY\u2019s question on the integrity of the oil bid rounds concluded in 2024 by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), the PENGASSAN president rated the commission high, describing the exercise as one of the most transparent in the history of the country\u2019s oil and gas exploration and production.\n\nHe said PENGASSAN followed and monitored the process to ensure that the process was transparent and conducted in line with best international practice.\n\nHe said the association\u2019s interest was to ensure that only competent companies that have commercial and technical wherewithal win the assets, develop them and bring them to production.\n\n\u201cWe commend the management of NUPRC for bringing about one of the most transparent bid rounds that we have ever seen in this country. Because the commercial bid was done to the public glare and at the end, we strongly believe that those that won the bid were qualified and competent.\n\n\u201cWe saw some IOCs winning the bid. We know very well that they have the right competence and technical know-how to be able to develop that field.\u201d\n\nWith Nigeria boasting of over 37 billion barrels of oil from the reserves on the ground but producing less than 2 million barrels per day, Osifo stressed the need to redouble efforts to increase the nation\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cSo what we are advocating is that as a country, we must expand our production base. We have the capacity as a country to be doing nothing less than 4 million barrels of crude production per day.\n\n\u201cAnd that is the direction that the government must think towards. That is the direction that we must continuously find ways to achieve. Because it will not just give us more revenue, it is also going to create a lot of jobs. It is going to increase our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a country,\u201d he added.",

I took over the existing staff and didn't look to change anybody.\n\nThat was, in a certain way, a challenge, because I very quickly needed to build up trust between us. But we coped very well. We had a good start with two draws in Uganda, our away game against Kenya and home match against Cameroon. It was a very important that we started in an appropriate way, and then it continued right through the brief time that it took to conclude the qualifiers. What really worked for us was that everybody was pulling in the same direction, from the players, the staff, the federation.\n\nWe broke our objectives down to smaller targets, and everybody could identify with this. I think our group was very strong, because we had two teams who had competed at the last Afcon in Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThat gave Namibia, for example, an advantage in their coaches had a lot of routine in his work, which we didn't have.\n\nSo, I think our group was very balanced, you know, with the added challenge that Cameroon is a powerhouse, with a lot of support from their government to make their campaign go smoother.\n\n\n\nHow have you built your squad?\n\nWe are team which has actually three big groups of players. A big group come from Europe, but also from USA or from Iraq. Then we have a small group from South Africa, and the third group is from Zimbabwe.\n\nSo, we are a very diverse team and it makes the logistics, the organisational things, more difficult. From a financial point of view, it\u2019s a major expense if you must fly in so many players from all around the world.\n\nWe have not been able to play at home which means the football association has limited resources. So, it was that we had to do all the planning very carefully and we couldn't make any major mistakes, otherwise we would have failed.\n\nThat made it a little bit more complex. But everyone gave their best, so it turned out a success.\n\n\n\nWhat do you see as the potential of this team?\n\nEven before I went to interview for the job I\u2019d already done my homework, so I knew quite a lot about Zimbabwe football and the enormous potential that it has. When I analysed the team, I could feel that we had challenges in the goalkeeping department and maybe in terms of a creative player. So, I recalled Washington Arubi as goalkeeper and Khama Billiat in attack.\n\nAnd I think these two were excellent in the qualifiers, performing better than expected. That just added to a very talented football team. I think it was very important to qualify for Afcon, and there was a certain pressure to do so because Zimbabwe had previously been suspended and before that struggled through the COVID crisis.\n\nSo basically, Zimbabwe football had already been, more or less, a couple of years in the desert and if we had not qualified, we would have another two years in the wilderness. That makes it very difficult then for a generation to catch up when they spend such a long way time without participating at the highest level.\n\nIt was very, very important for that reason that we break this isolation by qualifying and we achieved that with one game to spare. I think everybody was very happy and satisfied, and also with the way we played.\n\nAnd now we have a little bit more time until the Cup of Nations finals.\n\n\n\nYou also have the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers re-starting in March \u2026\n\nWell, if you look at our qualifying group, we are in the last position. We don't need to beat around the bush here, we're not in a very good position. But still, there are six games to play. And we see that as a double project.\n\nFirst, we want to do everything to turn the corner in the group and turn things for the better, but we know where we are. We know the challenges. At the same time, it's very good preparation for the Cup of Nations finals.\n\nWe will try our best, and let's see how it goes. What is more challenging is that we cannot play at home. We always have costs, logistic challenges, and no income. And we cannot play in front of our people.\n\nFor sure, this makes it very difficult, because honestly, Zimbabwe is a football crazy country. We could play any opponent right now and it would be packed any day of the week, any day of the week, anytime, any opponent.\n\n\n\nYou have Benin and Nigeria next in those qualifiers \u2026\n\nWe must take it step by step. It is dangerous to be thinking of the second step ahead of the first. We have seen Benin are very strong team. There's no doubt about that. We are in no position to think about the opponent after Benin.\n\nWe have a challenge, and we take it step by step and match by match, and actually we must take it training to training, day by day. I think we\u2019ll be well advised to approach it that way, because there's so many variables in football.\n\nIn our group, Nigeria is a wounded lion and therefore very dangerous. Their potential is definitely much better than their current position in the group. When you look at the players in Africa, definitely one of the top teams.",

            "content": "As the group stage of the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League approaches its thrilling conclusion this weekend, the spotlight is on the remaining two quarter-final spots, while battles for top positions in several groups promise high-stakes drama.\n\nSix teams \u2014 Al Hilal, FAR Rabat, Al Ahly, Orlando Pirates, Esperance, and Pyramids \u2014 have already punched their tickets to the last eight, but the fight for supremacy in their groups is far from over.\n\nGroups A and B remain wide open, with Young Africans, MC Alger, Mamelodi Sundowns, and Raja Casablanca all vying to advance.\n\nMeanwhile, Groups C and D feature intense contests to determine the top seeds, with Al Ahly, Orlando Pirates, Esperance, and Pyramids eager to finish strong and secure favourable quarter-final draws.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher as Africa\u2019s elite clubs seek to solidify their dominance, while underdogs fight to keep their dreams alive. Here's a look at the decisive final group stage matchups.\n\nGroup A\n\nYoung Africans vs MC Alger (Saturday, 1600 GMT)\n\nAll eyes will be on the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium in Tanzania as Young Africans host MC Alger. With Al Hilal already qualified, the battle for the second ticket is fierce. MC Alger sit second with 8 points, needing only a draw to progress, while Young Africans, with 7 points, must secure a win to leapfrog their Algerian rivals.\n\nYoung Africans have momentum after their stunning 1-0 win over Al Hilal in Sudan, led by the impressive Aziz Ki. Meanwhile, MC Alger\u2019s 1-0 victory against TP Mazembe, courtesy of Akram Bouras, ensures they remain unbeaten in four matches. This decisive clash promises fireworks as both sides aim for glory.\n\nTP Mazembe vs Al Hilal Omdurman (Saturday, 1600 GMT)\n\nAlready eliminated, TP Mazembe will look to salvage pride when they host group leaders Al Hilal. The Sudanese giants, who suffered their first defeat last week against Young Africans, will aim to finish the group on a high. Mohamed Abdelrahman and Jean Girumugisha have been instrumental in Hilal\u2019s campaign and will be key to maintaining their dominance.\n\nGroup B\n\nMamelodi Sundowns vs FAR Rabat (Sunday, 1600 GMT)\n\nGroup leaders FAR Rabat, with 9 points, have already secured their quarter-final spot. However, second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns (8 points) are still under threat from Raja Casablanca. The South African side will need a win at Loftus Versfeld Stadium to ensure their progression without depending on other results.\n\nBoth sides played out a 1-1 draw in their first meeting, with Khalid A\u00eft Ouarkhane and Iqraam Rayners on the scoresheet. Sundowns will rely on their home form, where they are unbeaten in 10 matches across all competitions.\n\nRaja Casablanca vs Maniema Union (Sunday, 1600 GMT)\n\nRaja Casablanca, third with 5 points, face bottom-placed Maniema Union, who are already eliminated. To advance, Raja must win and hope FAR Rabat defeat Mamelodi Sundowns. The Moroccan giants will also need to improve their goal difference to overtake Sundowns if they finish level on points.\n\nNaoufel Zerhouni and Younes Najjari are Raja\u2019s key players, while Maniema Union will look to spoil their party despite their poor form.\n\nGroup C\n\nAl Ahly vs Orlando Pirates (Saturday, 1600 GMT)\n\nThis heavyweight clash at Cairo International Stadium will determine the group winners. Both teams are through to the quarter-finals, with Orlando Pirates leading on 11 points, one ahead of Al Ahly.\n\nEmam Ashour has been the standout performer for Al Ahly, scoring four goals in the tournament, while Pirates boast a lethal duo in Relebohile Mofokeng and Thalente Mbatha.\n\nBelouizdad vs Stade d\u2019Abidjan (Saturday, 1600 GMT)\n\nWith both teams eliminated, this match at Stade du 5 Juillet 1962 is a formality. Belouizdad will aim to finish third in the group, while Stade d\u2019Abidjan search for their first win in the competition.\n\nGroup D\n\nEsperance vs Sagrada Esperan\u00e7a (Saturday, 1900 GMT)\n\nEsperance and Pyramids have already qualified, but top spot in the group remains undecided. Esperance, leading with 10 points, need a win to guarantee finishing first. The Tunisian giants are on a 23-match unbeaten streak at home and will look to extend it against third-placed Sagrada.\n\nPyramids vs Djoliba (Saturday, 1900 GMT)\n\nPyramids host Djoliba in Cairo, aiming for a win and hoping Esperance stumble to claim the group\u2019s top spot. Ibrahim Adel, with three goals, has been a standout for the Egyptian side. Djoliba, winless in the tournament, face a tough challenge.",

These would be partially compensated by higher gas realizations, TotalEnergies said.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, TotalEnergies booked earnings below expectations, due to weak refining margins, lower LNG production, and declining oil prices.\n\nThe fourth quarter for TotalEnergies could be better if LNG and gas trading manages to offset the lower oil prices.\n\nThe other supermajors have warned of weaker results for Q4 compared to the previous quarter.\n\nWeak oil trading and declining refining margins are expected to lower the fourth-quarter earnings at BP, while Shell expects its LNG production and trading and oil trading businesses to book significantly lower results for the fourth quarter of 2024, due to seasonality and timing of lifting.\n\nExxonMobil flagged a weaker profit for the fourth quarter of 2024 because of lower refining margins, estimating the size of the negative impact at $1.75 billion.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

State-owned Societe Nationale des Petroles du Congo (SNPC) has the remaining 15 percent.\n\nIn exchange the French energy major acquired an additional 10 percent stake in the Moho-Bilondo block, which consists of the Moho-Bilondo field and the Moho Nord field. Operator TotalEnergies now holds a 63.5 percent stake in the license. Trident Energy has 21.5 percent. SNPC owns the remaining 15 percent.\n\nTrident Energy expects the new acquisitions to add about 30,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) to its production.\n\nIn the Moho-Bilondo block, Moho Nord is producing with a capacity of 140,000 bopd, according to information on TotalEnergies\u2019 website.\n\nMeanwhile the mature fields Nkossa and Nsoko II, located 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) off the coast, have a combined average output of 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, according to TotalEnergies.\n\nThe transactions are \u201csignificant\u201d for Trident Energy, \u201cwhich has proven expertise in extending field life and unlocking production from mid-life assets as demonstrated by their takeovers in Brazil and Equatorial Guinea\u201d, Trident Energy said in an online statement announcing completion.\n\nTrident Energy chief executive Jean-Michel Jacoulot said, \u201cWe look forward to working with TotalEnergies Congo, the SNPC and the Congolese government to generate further value to the assets\u201d.\n\nIn TotalEnergies\u2019 announcement of its side of the transactions April 24, 2024, senior vice president for exploration and production in Africa Mike Sangster said, \u201cWith these transactions, TotalEnergies continues to dynamically manage its portfolio\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn line with our strategy, we focus on low-cost, low-emission assets, and leverage our deep offshore expertise\u201d, Sangster said then.\n\n\u201cAs a long-term partner of the Republic of Congo, TotalEnergies remains fully committed to the country through our increased stake and operatorship in Moho field, and is preparing for the drilling of an exploration well on the Marine XX license before summer 2024\u201d.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

            "content": "TotalEnergies' (EPA:TTE) stock is up by a considerable 7.0% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TotalEnergies is:\n\n14% = US$17b \u00f7 US$119b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every \u20ac1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of \u20ac0.14.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of TotalEnergies' Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\n\nTo begin with, TotalEnergies seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 32% seen over the past five years by TotalEnergies. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nAs a next step, we compared TotalEnergies' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 28% in the same period.\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is TTE worth today? The helps visualize whether TTE is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs TotalEnergies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nTotalEnergies' three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 38%, meaning the company retains 62% of its income. So it seems that TotalEnergies is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.\n\nAdditionally, TotalEnergies has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 47% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with TotalEnergies' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Bunker fuel is a critical component in the global shipping industry, which powers commercial vessels, tankers, bulk carriers, and other types of ships. The demand for bunker fuel in the Middle East and Africa is driven by the region's strategic location as a key hub for international shipping routes. Ports in the Middle East, such as those in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, serve as important refueling stations for vessels transiting between Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the region's growing oil production capacity and expanding maritime infrastructure have bolstered its position as a significant player in the global bunker fuel supply chain. As shipping traffic increases, particularly with the rise of trade routes and the expansion of shipping fleets, the demand for bunker fuel in the Middle East and Africa is expected to continue its upward trajectory. Additionally, advancements in fuel efficiency, regulations regarding sulfur content, and the growing adoption of alternative fuels such as LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) are expected to shape the future growth of the market.\n\n\n\nCountries in the region are increasingly investing in modernizing port facilities, fuel storage, and distribution networks, which will facilitate smoother and more efficient fuel supply to ships. With global trade volumes expected to rise, especially with the expansion of emerging markets in Africa and the Middle East, the Bunker Fuel Market in the region will experience sustained growth. This trend is further supported by the rise in maritime shipping activities, including the transportation of goods and raw materials, making the Middle East and Africa a key area for fuel consumption in the maritime industry.\n\n\n\nEuropean energy companies Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies, along with Japan's Mitsui, each acquired a 10% stake in Abu Dhabi's Ruwais LNG project, with Abu Dhabi's state-owned ADNOC retaining the remaining 60%. This project aims to boost the UAE's LNG production capacity to 15 million tons annually by 2028\n\n\n\nKey Market Trends\n\nAdoption of Low-Sulfur Bunker Fuels\n\n\n\nOne of the most prominent trends shaping the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market is the growing adoption of low-sulfur bunker fuels, driven by global environmental regulations and a heightened focus on sustainability. The International Maritime Organization's global sulfur cap, which came into effect in January 2020, mandates that the sulfur content in marine fuels be reduced from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent. This regulatory shift has prompted significant changes in the supply and demand dynamics of bunker fuels across the region, including the Middle East and Africa. The Middle East and Africa saw a 15-20% increase in demand for low-sulfur fuels, particularly in ports like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Suez Canal, as vessels needed to comply with the new sulfur limits.\n\n\n\nShipping companies operating in this region are increasingly adopting low-sulfur fuels to comply with the new regulations and avoid hefty fines. Consequently, bunker fuel suppliers are responding by enhancing their product offerings to meet the demand for cleaner fuels. Suppliers are investing in refining technologies to produce low-sulfur fuel oils, and some are exploring alternative fuels, such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), biofuels, and synthetic fuels, which also meet stringent environmental standards.\n\n\n\nThe transition to low-sulfur fuels has not only become a regulatory requirement but also a market differentiator for companies that prioritize environmental responsibility and sustainability. Moreover, many ports in the Middle East and Africa are upgrading their facilities to handle the increased demand for low-sulfur fuels, ensuring that their bunkering services align with global industry standards. This shift toward cleaner fuels is expected to continue as regulations tighten and pressure increases for the shipping industry to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\n\n\nIn addition to regulatory compliance, there is also an increasing demand from consumers and stakeholders for environmentally friendly shipping practices. This has prompted shipping companies to not only meet regulatory requirements but to proactively embrace cleaner alternatives in their operations, further fueling the growth of low-sulfur bunker fuels in the region. Africa's bunker fuel consumption was estimated at approximately 5-7 million metric tons in 2023, with a projected annual growth rate of 3-4% driven by increasing maritime trade and regional port development.\n\n\n\nGrowing Interest in Alternative Marine Fuels\n\n\n\nAs part of the broader shift toward sustainability and reducing carbon emissions, the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market is witnessing a growing interest in alternative marine fuels. These alternative fuels include biofuels, Liquefied Natural Gas, hydrogen, and methanol, which are seen as viable substitutes for traditional marine fuels. The demand for these fuels is primarily driven by the maritime industry's desire to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nBiofuels, in particular, have gained significant traction due to their potential to reduce the carbon intensity of shipping operations. Biofuels can be made from renewable sources such as plant oils, algae, or waste products, making them an attractive option for companies seeking to reduce their environmental impact. While biofuels are not yet widely used in the Middle East and Africa, pilot projects and partnerships are emerging across the region. Several bunkering suppliers are exploring biofuel blending with traditional bunker fuels as a transitional step towards full-scale adoption. Additionally, Liquefied Natural Gas is increasingly seen as an attractive alternative due to its lower carbon emissions compared to conventional marine fuels.\n\n\n\nIn addition to reducing carbon emissions, alternative fuels also offer shipping companies the potential to future-proof their operations. Many major international shipping companies are already investing in vessels that are capable of running on these alternative fuels. The increasing focus on decarbonizing the shipping industry is expected to drive significant growth in the demand for alternative marine fuels across the Middle East and Africa, with suppliers and shipping companies working together to establish the infrastructure necessary to support this transition. This trend is likely to continue as both environmental concerns and regulatory pressures grow.\n\n\n\nDigitalization and Automation in Bunkering Operations\n\n\n\nDigitalization and automation are emerging as key trends in the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, as companies seek to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience. The adoption of digital technologies, including data analytics, real-time monitoring, and automated fuel management systems, is transforming the way bunker fuel is delivered and consumed in the region.\n\n\n\nThrough digital platforms, bunker fuel suppliers can now track fuel consumption, monitor delivery schedules, and predict future demand, enabling them to optimize inventory and improve fuel delivery efficiency. Real-time data also allows for better decision-making, ensuring that fuel is delivered at the right time and in the right quantities, reducing waste and minimizing operational disruptions. Furthermore, digitalization allows shipping companies to have greater visibility into their fuel consumption patterns, helping them identify potential inefficiencies and implement more sustainable practices.\n\n\n\nThe use of automated systems in the bunkering process also enhances safety and reduces human error, which is especially important in high-risk environments such as refueling operations. Automation in fuel delivery, invoicing, and payment processes is making the entire bunkering process more seamless, streamlined, and transparent. Additionally, blockchain technology is being explored as a way to improve transparency in fuel transactions, ensuring that all stakeholders involved in the bunkering process have access to secure, verifiable data.\n\n\n\nAs digitalization continues to evolve, the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market is likely to see increased investment in innovative technologies, further improving the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of bunker fuel operations. This trend is expected to benefit both bunker fuel suppliers and customers, as digital and automated solutions contribute to cost reductions, better fuel management, and more environmentally responsible practices.\n\n\n\nCountry Insights\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Saudi Arabia dominated the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market and is expected to maintain its leading position throughout the forecast period. Saudi Arabia's dominance is primarily driven by its strategic geographic location along major international shipping routes, especially the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, which positions the country as a key hub for maritime fuel supply in the region.\n\n\n\nThe country's well-developed infrastructure, including major ports like Jeddah and Dammam, facilitates the efficient distribution of bunker fuel to vessels operating in these critical trade routes. Additionally, Saudi Arabia's significant oil reserves and established refineries contribute to its competitive advantage in providing reliable and cost-effective bunker fuel. The growing shipping industry in Saudi Arabia, coupled with the government's investments in port expansion and maritime infrastructure, further strengthens its position in the bunker fuel market.\n\n\n\nWhile the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are also key players, particularly in fueling international maritime traffic due to their advanced ports and oil exports, Saudi Arabia's larger fleet and proximity to major shipping lanes give it a continued edge. Egypt is another strong contender, particularly with the Suez Canal playing a pivotal role in global shipping, but its bunker fuel demand remains secondary to that of Saudi Arabia. Other regions such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Turkey are important contributors, but they do not match the scale and infrastructure dominance of Saudi Arabia. Given these factors, Saudi Arabia is poised to retain its dominance in the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market as the region's maritime activity and fuel demand continue to grow in the coming years.\n\n\n\nKey Market Players\n\nExxon Mobil\n\nBP\n\nShell International\n\nChevron\n\nTotalEnergies\n\nSaudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco)\n\nENOC Company\n\nQatarEnergy\n\nKuwait Petroleum Corporation\n\nNational Iranian Oil Company\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 133 Forecast Period 2024 - 2030 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $10.67 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030 $18.21 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 9.1% Regions Covered Africa, Middle East\n\nReport Scope:\n\n\n\nIn this report, the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market has been segmented into the following categories, in addition to the industry trends which have also been detailed below:\n\n\n\nMiddle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, By Fuel Type:\n\nIFO (Intermediate Fuel Oil)\n\nMDO (Marine Diesel Oil)\n\nMGO (Marine Gas Oil)\n\nLNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)\n\nOthers\n\nMiddle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, By Vessel Type:\n\nLarge Ships\n\nMedium Ships\n\nSmall Ships\n\nMiddle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, By Application:\n\nCommercial Shipping\n\nTankers\n\nBulk Carriers\n\nContainer Ships\n\nPassenger Ships\n\nOthers\n\nMiddle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, By End-User:\n\nShip Owners\n\nFuel Suppliers\n\nGovernment and Defense\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/43wjbl\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

TotalEnergies is the main operator of the GGIP scheme. Basra Oil Company (30%) and QatarEnergy (25%) are the other stakeholders.\n\nMEED previously reported that contractors submitted bids for the Ratawi gas processing complex project in October last year.\n\nIn addition to CPECC, the other bidders for the project are India\u2019s Larsen & Toubro Energy Hydrocarbon and South Korea\u2019s Daewoo Engineering & Construction, sources told MEED.\n\nWhen commissioned, the planned facility is expected to process 300 million cubic feet a day (cf/d) of gas. Its capacity is expected to double when a second expansion phase becomes operational in the future.\n\nThe Ratawi gas processing facility project aims to improve Iraq\u2019s electricity supply by capturing gas that would have otherwise been flared at several oil fields, including:\n\nLuhais\n\nMajnoon\n\nRatawi\n\nWest Qurna 2\n\nTuba\n\nLarge gas volumes are flared from these oil fields, causing significant environmental damage. Collecting and processing flared gas will generate increased hydrocarbons revenues and reduce ecological damage.\n\nThe gas tapped and processed from the oil fields will then be used to supply power plants, helping to reduce Iraq\u2019s power import bill.\n\nAs well as supplying to Iraq\u2019s national gas network to generate electricity, the Ratawi gas processing complex will increase the production of gas products, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and condensates.\n\nUS-based consultant KBR has performed the front-end engineering and design work on the project.\n\nGGIP projects\n\nTotalEnergies and its partners have made considerable progress with projects for the GGIP scheme, which was formalised between the Iraqi government and investors in September 2021.\n\nThe French energy major announced earlier in January that construction of a smaller-scale gas processing plant at the Ratawi field, ArtawiGas25, had started.\n\nThis project represents an investment of about $250m, TotalEnergies said, adding that the plant will process 50 million cf/d of gas from previously flared gas at the Ratawi field.\n\nThe gas will supply local power plants, meeting the demand of approximately 200,000 households in the Basra region.\n\nThe ArtawiGas25 project will be commissioned by the end of this year, and will begin reducing gas flaring before the larger gas processing complex at Ratawi enters operations.\n\n\u201cThe innovative modular design of ArtawiGas25 could also pave the way for potential replication across other Iraqi oil fields,\u201d TotalEenrgies said.\n\nArtawiGas25 will create up to 160 direct and indirect jobs for Iraqi nationals during the construction phase and 30 jobs during the operation phase, the French energy major added.\n\nThe other two projects within the GGIP programme are:\n\nTotalEnergies is expanding its activities in Iraq at a time when other international oil companies are reducing their exposure to the country.\n\nIn an interview with MEED in October, Cecile Ballantyne Jovene, the head of TotalEnergies\u2019 strategy department for gas, power and renewables, stated that expansion in Iraq is pivotal to the company\u2019s global energy business growth strategy.",

Since October 2024, protests led by presidential candidate Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane have generated instability, resulting in the closure of companies and the loss of more than 12,000 jobs.

Led by TotalEnergies in Area 1, it envisages the construction of a gas liquefaction plant in Afungi, with a production capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per year.\n\nAccording to the Global LNG database, the project was 21% complete when it was suspended. The initial cost estimated at between US$8 and 9 billion was adjusted to over US$10 billion due to changes in the engineering and construction contracts.\n\nDespite the setbacks, TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 reaffirmed in December 2024 the company\u2019s commitment to the project, considering it profitable and strategic. Pouyann\u00e9 plans to discuss with Daniel Chapo the conditions for restarting activities and securing financing through credit agencies.\n\nWith a long career at TotalEnergies, Cambefort held leadership positions on large-scale projects, such as Director of the Indonesian Projects Division between 2010 and 2014, before returning to the Paris headquarters. Since 2016, he has led several ambitious initiatives, always focused on achieving the defined objectives and maximizing the benefits expected by stakeholders.\n\nNow, alongside Maxime Rabilloud, Director of TotalEnergies in Mozambique since 2021, Cambefort will be tasked with coordinating the development of Mozambique LNG amid logistical, political and security challenges.\n\nWith the official postponement of the project\u2019s start date to the first quarter of 2029, TotalEnergies has adjusted its strategies to ensure the success of the initiative. The company expects Mozambique LNG, together with other projects such as Qatar NFE/NFS and Papua LNG, to contribute significantly to global LNG production by 2028.\n\nThe resumption of the project will not only boost Mozambique\u2019s economy, but will also strengthen the country\u2019s role as a leading exporter of natural gas on the international market. However, the future of the project depends on a combination of local and international efforts to stabilize the region and ensure the safety of operations.",

This block lies to the southeast and on trend with a number of Orange Basin oil discoveries including Venus, and is operated by TotalEnergies.\n\nThe company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Africa Oil SA Corp. (AOSAC), have completed a transaction with Eco (Atlantic) Oil & Gas Limited and Azinam Ltd, a subsidiary of Eco, whereby Azinam has transferred a 1.0% interest in Block 3B/4B to Africa Oil. In consideration, Africa Oil has exchanged the shares and warrants that it held in Eco for cancellation.\n\nAfrica Oil Chief Executive Officer, Dr Roger Tucker, commented: \u201cThis transaction is another step in delivering the strategy of increasing direct interest in Africa Oil\u2019s key assets, including our opportunity set in the Orange Basin, a region with high levels of industry interest and activity. We thank Eco Atlantic's management for their collaborative approach in working with us since 2017, and we look forward to further progress towards the drilling of the first exploration well on Block 3B/4B.\u201d\n\nAbout Block 3B/4B\n\nBlock 3B/4B covers an area of 17 581 km2 within the Orange Basin offshore South Africa in water depths ranging between 300 m and 2500 m. This block lies to the southeast and on trend with a number of oil discoveries including Venus. There is approximately 14 000 km of 2D seismic and 10 800 km2 of 3D seismic over Block 3B/4B, identifying a large opportunity set of exploration prospects, with the majority of the prospects lying in approximately 1500 m of water. On 28 August 2024, the Company announced the closing of a farm down agreement for Block 3B/4B with TotalEnergies and QatarEnergy. AOSAC retained a direct 17.00% interest and transferred the operatorship of the block to TotalEnergies, for a maximum consideration of US$46.8 million, this includes the exploration carry for its retained interest, that is expected to be sufficient for two exploration wells. AOSAC will have the benefit of exploration carry for the additional 1.00% interest assigned to it by Azinam.\n\nAn Environmental Authorisation for exploration activities (drilling of up to 5 exploration wells) was granted by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy for the Republic of South Africa on 16 September 2024. The legislative notification and appeals process is ongoing with the relevant regulatory agencies. The Africa Oil group now holds a direct 18.00% interest in Block 3B/4B. Other partners in the block are: TotalEnergies with a 33.00% operated interest; QatarEnergy with a 24.00% interest; Ricocure with a 19.75%; and Eco with a 5.25% interest.\n\nAfrica Oil\u2019s Eco Securities\n\nImmediately prior to the Transaction, the company held 54 941 744 Eco shares and 4 864 865 in Eco warrants that represented 14.84% of the outstanding common shares of Eco, 9.11% of the outstanding warrants of Eco and 15.95% of the outstanding common shares of Eco on a partially diluted basis (after giving effect to the warrants owned by Africa Oil) and represented the entire security holding of Africa Oil in Eco. The company has exchanged these securities for cancellation by Eco and no longer owns any securities of Eco. Accordingly, Africa Oil is no longer subject to the early warning reporting requirements in respect of Eco, as Africa Oil has fallen below the 10% reporting threshold. Africa Oil acquired the common shares and warrants of Eco for investment purposes. Africa Oil will review its holdings from time to time and may in the future acquire additional securities of Eco and/or dispose of such securities subject to a number of factors, including general market and economic conditions and other available business opportunities in the future.\n\nRead the latest issue of Oilfield Technology magazine for upstream news, project stories, industry insight and technical articles.\n\nOilfield Technology\u2019s November/December 2024 issue\n\nThe November/December 2024 issue of Oilfield Technology includes a report on 2024\u2019s upstream highlights from the Asia Pacific region, along with technical articles on intuitive shaker technology; reshaping OCTG and line pipe supply chains in the UAE; mercaptan removal strategies; and maximising pressure pumping with durable pump consumables.",

The project is expected to create up to 160 direct and indirect jobs during the construction phase and 30 permanent positions once operational.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to launch the ArtawiGas25 project: it will give the Iraqi people a tangible insight into the benefits of the GGIP, which will provide more energy with less emissions. We look forward to the next GGIP milestones in the coming weeks with the start of construction of the 1 gigawatt (GW) solar project,\u201d said Julien Pouget, senior vice president of Middle East & North Africa, Exploration & Production at TotalEnergies.\n\nTotalEnergies agreed with the Iraqi Government to proceed with the long-delayed $27bn energy project in 2023, a deal that is expected to boost the country\u2019s oil and gas production and enhance solar energy generation.\n\nThe project includes a large-scale gas processing plant, which aims to recover gas flared on three oil fields and supply it to power plants. It also involves redeveloping the Ratawi field and building a large solar farm and seawater treatment plant.\n\nLast October, QatarEnergy agreed to acquire a 50 per cent stake in the solar power project, while TotalEnergies will retain the remaining 50 per cent.\n\nThe solar power project, which will be one of the largest in the world upon its completion, will consist of 2 million high-efficiency bifacial solar panels mounted on single-axis trackers and can produce up to 1.25 GW.",

TotalEnergies, holding a 45% stake and serving as the operator, is spearheading this project as part of the broader Gas Growth Integrated Project (GGIP). ArtawiGas25 represents an investment of approximately $250 million and is designed to process 50 million cubic feet per day (Mcf/d) of gas from the Ratawi field that would otherwise be flared. This processed gas will power local plants, providing electricity for an estimated 200,000 households in Basra.\n\nThe GGIP, initiated in September 2021, is a $10 billion multi-energy initiative aimed at maximizing Iraq\u2019s natural resources and enhancing the country\u2019s electricity supply. It includes the development of a large-scale gas processing facility with an initial phase capable of recovering 300 Mcf/d of flared gas from three oil fields. This facility will supply gas to generate 1.5 GW of power. As part of GGIP, ArtawiGas25 is a crucial early phase, designed to significantly reduce gas flaring at the Ratawi field by late 2025. Its modular design introduces an innovative approach that could be replicated across other Iraqi oil fields.\n\nArtawiGas25 will also bring socio-economic benefits to Iraq. During the construction phase, it is expected to create up to 160 direct and indirect jobs for Iraqi nationals, with 30 permanent positions anticipated during the operational phase. The project embodies TotalEnergies\u2019 commitment to providing sustainable energy solutions tailored to the region\u2019s needs.\n\nJulien Pouget, Senior Vice President for the Middle East & North Africa at TotalEnergies, emphasized the importance of the project: \"ArtawiGas25 will offer the Iraqi people a clear demonstration of GGIP\u2019s benefits by delivering more energy with fewer emissions. This initiative underscores TotalEnergies\u2019 ability to implement impactful, fast-track solutions aligned with Iraq's governmental priorities and energy requirements. We are eager to advance the GGIP milestones, including initiating construction of the 1 GW solar project in the coming weeks.\"\n\nThrough ArtawiGas25, TotalEnergies aims to not only reduce emissions and enhance Iraq\u2019s energy infrastructure but also set a precedent for similar advancements across the country.\n\nIn 2023, TotalEnergies introduced the Gas Growth Integrated Project (GGIP) in Iraq, a comprehensive multi-energy initiative aimed at maximizing the country\u2019s natural resource potential to strengthen its electricity supply. The GGIP encompasses four key components: capturing flared gas from three oil fields in southern Iraq to power electric plants, redeveloping the Ratawi oil field, building a 1 GWac (1.25 GWp) solar farm, and constructing a seawater treatment plant.",

            "content": "As Nigeria grapples with persistent healthcare challenges\u2014from inadequate infrastructure to limited access to diagnostic tools\u2014NNPC Ltd. is redefining the playbook for Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nWith initiatives spanning cutting-edge medical facilities to grassroots health programmes, the state-owned oil giant is setting a new standard for private-sector engagement in public health.\n\nIn a sector often criticised for neglecting social impact, NNPC Ltd.\u2019s interventions signal a transformative approach to addressing societal needs at scale.\n\nNNPC Ltd., long synonymous with energy solutions, is redefining its corporate identity by addressing critical healthcare challenges.\n\nThrough its CSR arm, the NNPC Foundation, and strategic partnerships with Joint Venture (JV) partners, the company is reshaping the healthcare narrative in Nigeria.\n\nThese initiatives align with the vision of its Group Chief Executive Officer, Mallam Mele Kyari, and exemplify a profound commitment to improving the quality of life for Nigerians.\n\nOne of the most notable interventions is the recently inaugurated state-of-the-art mammography centre at the Federal University Teaching Hospital, Lafia, in Nasarawa State.\n\nDeveloped in partnership with TotalEnergies Upstream Nigeria Limited, SAPETRO, CNOOC, and PRIME 130, the facility is equipped with the Senographe Pristina 3D mammography system and stereotactic biopsy capabilities.\n\nThis advanced centre can undertake over 120 examinations daily, significantly enhancing diagnostic capacity in the North Central region.\n\nThis is the second of such centres, following a similar facility at Garkida General Hospital, Adamawa.\n\nThese projects are part of NNPC Ltd.\u2019s strategic push to improve access to early cancer detection and treatment, aiming to reduce Nigeria\u2019s high cancer mortality rate.\n\nThe Chief Upstream Investment Officer of NNPC Upstream Investment Management Services (NUIMS), Mr Bala Wunti, who was represented by the Head of Business Services, Mr. Sani Kabo, said the mammography centre was a symbol of NNPC Ltd.\u2019s unwavering commitment to enhancing the quality of healthcare in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe hope that under the stewardship of the state government, this facility will become a beacon of comfort and a critical resource for timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer,\u201d Wunti said.\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director/Chief Executive and Country Chair of TotalEnergies Upstream Nigeria Limited (TUPNI), Mr Matthieu Bouyer, who was represented by the Acting General Manager of Corporate Social Responsibility, Mrs Tonye Osifo, said TotalEnergies was committed to addressing healthcare challenges through strategic partnerships.\n\n\u201cThis mammography centre is among 84 infrastructural projects TotalEnergies has delivered since 2016. It signifies our active role in the global fight against cancer and reflects our alignment with the #WorkingWithCancer initiative, which supports recovery and retention for individuals affected by cancer,\u201d Bouyer stated.\n\nIn addition, the company\u2019s free cancer screening campaigns target 3,000 individuals across the six geopolitical zones, providing not only screenings but also health education, workshops, and consultations.\n\nTagged \u201cCancer Awareness and ZSX Screening, the campaign aimed at empowering individuals to recognise early symptoms, adopt preventive health measures, and better understand the importance of regular screenings.\n\nThe screening centres were set up in Kaduna, Rivers, Ondo, Benue, Imo, and Gombe to focus on breast, cervical, and prostate cancer, offering critical early detection support for at-risk populations.\n\nManaging Director of the NNPC Foundation, Mrs Emmanuella Arukwe, emphasised the collective effort required to combat cancer, noting, \u201cThis campaign is about more than just screening; it\u2019s about saving lives, building awareness, and creating pathways to preventive care for Nigerians who need it most.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a country of over 200 million people, too many still lack access to the early detection tools that could make a life-saving difference. NNPC Foundation is dedicated to addressing this critical gap by bringing cancer screenings directly to communities. Early detection is crucial to improving survival rates, and this campaign is a vital step towards that goal,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Union for International Cancer Control has introduced a new World Cancer Day theme for 2025-2027, which is \u201cUnited by Unique\u201d. World Cancer Day is held on February 2024 of every year and the new credo places people at the centre of care and their stories at the heart of the conversation.\n\nExplaining the theme, the UICC on its website, said, \u201cUnited in our goals, unique in our needs. That is the World Cancer Day credo that will be heard around the world in the lead up to and on 4 February 2025. Its meaning is simple: everyone has unique needs, unique perspectives, and a unique story to tell, yet people touched by cancer are united in a shared ambition to lower the cancer burden, to see cancer treated successfully, and to lead better lives with cancer.\u201d\n\nAccording to the international body, people-centred care accepts everyone for who they are, and it aims to deepen the connection not only between healthcare providers and patients but with whole communities.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why World Cancer Day counts on everyone \u2013 patients, loved ones, caregivers, friends, neighbours, practitioners, researchers, advocates, allies \u2013 to play an important role in the campaign. The campaign will explore different dimensions of people-centred cancer care and new ways of making a difference. It will offer a three-year journey from raising awareness to taking action,\u201d it said.\n\nCancer remains one of the most formidable health challenges in Nigeria, with over 79,000 cancer-related deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe most common cancers affecting Nigerian men include prostate and liver cancer, while women are predominantly impacted by breast and cervical cancers.\n\nOlufemi Soneye, the Chief Corporate Communications Officer at NNPC Ltd., explained that NNPC Ltd.\u2019 was thinking ahead by initiating the \u2018Cancer Awareness and ZSX Screening\u2019 aimed at 3,000 beneficiaries across the geo-political zones.\n\nHe described the oil giant\u2019s cancer awareness campaign as an initiative aimed at countering the trend of late-stage diagnoses, which occur frequently due to limited access to screening facilities, cultural stigmas, and insufficient awareness.\n\n\u201cThese free cancer screening campaigns reflect NNPC Ltd.\u2019s broader mission to promote health equity and enhance the well-being of Nigerians across the country through its Foundation,\u201d he had said.\n\nEqually impactful is the \u201cEye Can See\u201d programme, a JV initiative with Seplat Energy, which restores vision and hope to communities.\n\nIn the Ohaji/Egbema community of Imo State, the programme has distributed over 10,000 reading glasses, performed 639 eye surgeries, and provided essential medical consultations.\n\nCommenting on the initiative, Bala Wunti, Chief Upstream Investment Officer of NNPC\u2019s Upstream Investment Management Services (NUIMS), stated that the programme reflected NNPC Ltd.\u2019s belief that corporate structures could and should play a vital role in societal development.\n\nFurther expanding this outreach, NNPC Ltd. and its partner, SNEPCo Production Sharing Contract (PSC), launched the Vision First Programme in Lagos.\n\nTargeting the Ilaje community in Bariga, the initiative offers comprehensive healthcare services, including cardiovascular screenings, BMI assessments, and treatment for chronic diseases, alongside free eye care services.\n\nHowever, NNPC\u2019s interventions extend beyond healthcare. In collaboration with Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), the company commissioned a state-of-the-art ICT centre at Bauchi State University.\n\nThe facility includes a Wi-Fi lounge, computer laboratories, and 3D printing labs, aimed at enhancing educational infrastructure and inspiring IT ecosystem growth in the North-East.\n\nIn addition, the NNPC Foundation\u2019s Financial Literacy Programme has engaged over 284,000 corps members, equipping them with business skills and providing startup support.\n\nThese efforts, coupled with a 50% reduction in CAC registration fees for corps members, demonstrate NNPC\u2019s commitment to youth empowerment and sustainable development.\n\nAnother laudable initiative involves a joint donation of N53 million by NNPC Ltd. and First Exploration & Production Limited to NGOs addressing healthcare, education, and economic growth.\n\nBeneficiaries include organisations like the Irede Foundation, which provides artificial limbs to child amputees, and the Niola Cancer Care Foundation, which conducts colon cancer awareness and screening programs.\n\nAlso, NNPC Ltd and its Joint Venture partners in OML 18 \u2013 the Nigerian Content Development & Monitoring Board (NCDMB), SNEPCo, Total Energies EP Nigeria Ltd, Nigerian Agip Exploration Ltd, and Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria (Deepwater) Ltd \u2013 donated a 2,300-seater state-of-the-art digital library to the Niger Delta University, Wilberforce Island, Amassoma, Bayelsa State.\n\nWith 100 computer systems, e-learning and research facilities, interactive smart boards, projectors, camcorders, e-books, e-journals, e-learning portal, and reading halls, the digital library was designed to promote ICT education and provide a conducive learning environment for students and researchers.\n\nNNPC Ltd.\u2019s unwavering commitment to healthcare and community development under Kyari\u2019s leadership sets a benchmark for corporate Social Responsibility in Nigeria.\n\nBy addressing immediate needs and laying the groundwork for a healthier, more prosperous nation, the company continues to inspire and lead by example.\n\nThese interventions not only redefine corporate identity but also underscore the transformative power of strategic partnerships and holistic community engagement.",

Just two minutes later, he doubled his tally with a deft finish following sustained pressure from the hosts.\n\nBlack Bulls responded through Egaita Efone, who pulled one back in the 62nd minute with a well-placed header. However, Zamalek's Ahmed Sayed Zizo sealed the win in the 83rd minute, finishing a brilliant solo effort to extinguish any hopes of a comeback.\n\nThe result leaves Black Bulls at the bottom of Group D with four points, eliminating their chances of advancing further.\n\nStellenbosch 2-0 Stade Malien: South Africans Book Quarter-Finals Spot\n\nStellenbosch FC advanced to the quarter-finals of the CAF Confederation Cup with a commanding 2-0 victory over Stade Malien in South Africa on Sunday.\n\nFawaz Basadin opened the scoring in the 30th minute from the penalty spot with a composed finish.

With this result, Berkane now has 13 points, four points clear of Stellenbosch in second place.\n\nLuanda Sol remains winless and rooted to the bottom of the group with just two points, while Berkane and Stellenbosch have both secured their spots in the quarter-finals ahead of the final group match.\n\nUSM Alger 2-1 Orapa United: Algerians Top Group 3\n\nUSM Alger secured their spot in the CAF Confederation Cup quarter-finals with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Botswana's Orapa United on Sunday.\n\nSekou Gassama put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute, while Hossam Ghosha doubled their advantage in the 60th. Orapa United managed a late consolation goal through Kamogelo Moloi, but it was not enough to prevent their fifth group-stage defeat.\n\nUSM Alger now leads Group 3 with 11 points, sealing qualification with one game to spare, while Orapa United remains bottom with two points.\n\nConstantine Cruise Past Sfaxien to Secure Quarter-Final Spot\n\nCS Constantine confirmed their place in the quarter-finals with a dominant 3-0 victory over Tunisian side CS Sfaxien at the Hamlaoui Stadium on Sunday.\n\nZakaria Ben Chaa starred with a brace, netting in the 31st and 71st minutes, while substitute Mondher Tamine added a late third in stoppage time.\n\nThe Algerian side opened the scoring after Ben Chaa combined well with Dhib before coolly slotting the ball past Sfaxien goalkeeper Dahman.\n\nSfaxien struggled to create clear-cut chances, with their best opportunity coming early in the second half when Basha's strike was denied by goalkeeper Bouhalfaya.\n\nConstantine doubled their lead when Ben Chaa capitalized on a defensive error, finishing with precision after a neat exchange with Dhib.\n\nTamine sealed the win with a solo effort in added time, dribbling past the Tunisian defence to bury the ball into the net. Constantine now leads Group 1 with 12 points, while Sfaxien remain bottom without a single point.",

While Namibia has yet to produce any oil, Shell has said in a statement that the oil and gas resources discovered in offshore block PEL39 \u201ccannot currently be confirmed for commercial development,\u201d citing technical and geological difficulties encountered while developing offshore resources in the southern African country. All eyes were on Namibia when the breakthrough happened in February 2022, with major discoveries by Shell and TotalEnergies in the Graff and Venus blocks. This had generated significant global interest alongside a separate discovery by TotalEnergies in a nearby block.\n\nBut according to a recent assessment by the South Africa-based African Energy Chamber (AEC), Namibia \u201cstill offers substantial potential in the offshore Orange Basin, confirmed by major projects such as TotalEnergies\u2019 appraisal campaign in PEL 56.\u201d After all, other players, including Chevron, Woodside Energy, Galp and Rhino Resources continue to explore the southern African country\u2019s potential. Portuguese oil company Galp recently announced a notable discovery in a different offshore license, while Chevron said it was looking to make its discoveries in the country by 2025. While stakeholders deem Shell\u2019s $400 million write-down as a \u201cblow to the country,\u201d the AEC, which sees itself as serving as the voice of the African energy sector, considers \u201cthis merely a speed bump in Namibia\u2019s oil development rather than a road block\u201d on the long path to fully tap into the country\u2019s significant potential in the offshore Orange Basin and beyond.",

The gas will supply local power plants, covering the demand of approximately 200,000 households in the Basra region.\n\nSigned in September 2021, the GGIP project is a USD 10 billion multi-energy project designed to enhance the development of Iraq\u2019s natural resources and improve the country\u2019s electricity supply. The GGIP includes a large-scale gas processing plant, with a first phase of 300 Mcf/d that will recover gas being flared on three oil fields and supply gas to 1.5 GW of power generation capacity.\n\nIn anticipation of the start-up of this main gas processing facility, the ArtawiGas25 project will significantly reduce gas flaring at the Ratawi field as early as end 2025. The innovative modular design of ArtawiGas25 could also pave the way for potential replication across other Iraqi oil fields. ArtawiGas25 will create up to 160 direct and indirect jobs for Iraqi nationals during construction phase and 30 jobs during operation phase.\n\n\"We are very pleased to launch the ArtawiGas25 project: it will give the Iragi people a tangible insight into the benefits of the GGIP, which will provide more energy with less emissions. Through this project, TotalEnergies is demonstrating its capacity to deliver valuable and fast-track solutions in accordance with the government\u2019s expectations and the country\u2019s electricity needs. We look forward to the next GGIP milestones in the coming weeks with the start of construction of the 1 GW solar project\u201d, said Julien Pouget, Senior Vice President Middle East & North Africa, Exploration & Production at TotalEnergies.\n\n***",

Total first signed a deal with the Iraqi government in 2021 that would see Total build four oil, gas and renewables projects in southern Iraq over 25 years with an initial investment of $10 billion. Unfortunately the giant project was shelved amid disputes and squabbling between Iraqi politicians over terms of the deal. However, Iraq finally agreed to a smaller 30% stake in the project, setting in motion a deal that could lure foreign investment back into the country. In recent years, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Shell Plc. (NYSE:SHEL) and BP Plc. (NYSE:BP) have all scaled back their operations in Iraq, contributing to a stagnation in oil production after years of instability. However, Iraq has been enjoying a period of relative stability, increasing the chances of foreign investors returning to the country.\n\n\"The government of Iraq confirmed the whole contract, no modification at all ... so that was for me more than good news,\" Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne has told Reuters.\n\nMeanwhile, Iraq could resume oil exports via a pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean coast.

            "content": "TotalEnergies will start drilling for oil and gas in Block 64 offshore Suriname in May, a company executive told Reuters this week, saying the company was currently tallying the final tab for the project and organizing the future well operations.\n\nTotalEnergies has a 40% stake in Block 64, which it shares with QatarEnergy and Malaysia\u2019s Petronas, both with a 30% stake. The supermajor and its partners signed a production-sharing contract for the block with Suriname\u2019s state oil company, Staatsolie, back in 2023.\n\nThe drilling campaign is separate from a massive $10.5-billion investment plan that the French supermajor announced for Suriname last year. That investment, in partnership with APA Corp, was to focus on Block 58 offshore Guyana\u2019s neighbor. The investment plan was widely seen as TotalEnergies\u2019 attempt to repeat Exxon\u2019s success in Guyana.\n\nCrude oil discoveries in Suriname have opened access to some 2.4 billion barrels in reserves, Wood Mackenzie analysts have estimated. The consultancy also reported that the South American nation holds some 12.5 trillion cubic feet in natural gas reserves.\n\nA total of nine offshore discoveries have been made in Suriname in the last six years but commercial development of any of them is still in the future.\n\nSuriname is often seen as a candidate for a repeat of Guyana\u2019s oil boom since the two neighboring countries share one hydrocarbon basin. However, exploration efforts have taken longer in Suriname and the colossal success of Exxon with the Stabroek Block and its dozen discoveries has yet to be replicated in Guyana\u2019s neighbor.\n\nTotalEnergies\u2019 and APA Corp\u2019s investment commitment is by far the biggest one for Suriname. First oil from Block 58 is scheduled for 2028. The oil reserves in the area are estimated at some 750 million barrels, lying in depths between 100 and 1,000 meters. According to Suriname\u2019s state oil company, Staatsolie, the project could have a productive life of 20 to 25 years.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

            "content": "(Business in Cameroon) - The Cameroonian government is offering tax exemptions on electric vehicles to boost sales. Effective January 1, these vehicles are exempt from excise duties, which previously had an import rate of 12.5%. A 50% reduction in the taxable value of newly imported electric vehicles, motorcycles, their batteries, and charging stations will also be applied for the next 24 months, according to a document from the General Tax Directorate (DGI) of the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThrough these measures, the Cameroonian government aims to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles by lowering taxes on these \"clean\" vehicles, in contrast to more polluting thermal vehicles. The government intends to promote the use of electric vehicles in the transport sector \"in support of environmental protection through the fight against pollution.\" The push for electric or hybrid vehicles in Cameroon\u2019s transport sector is supported by car dealership 3S Motors and the French energy giant TotalEnergies.\n\nIn 2023, the two partners established the Cameroon Electric Mobility Promotion Association (Apeme-Cam). Its goal is to equip the country's road network with electric vehicles (both 4-wheel and 2-wheel) starting in 2025. \"This will help maintain the state\u2019s purchasing power, make it easier for Cameroonian consumers with low incomes to access new vehicles, and improve road safety,\" said Patrocle Petridis, Managing Director of TotalEnergies Marketing Cameroon.\n\nTo achieve this, Apeme-Cam encourages mass imports of electric vehicles and supports local entrepreneurs' initiatives in this sector. In 2015, French logistics company Bollor\u00e9 Africa Logistics launched the \"Blue Bus\" campus buses at the University of Yaound\u00e9 I for five years. Since then, other electric mobility initiatives have emerged in Cameroon. In 2019, Cameroonian Gaspard Mpondo, in partnership with the Chinese company S-King, launched Jengu Sarl, a company specializing in the construction of electric vehicles, motorcycles, and tricycles that also run on solar energy.\n\nHowever, according to industry professionals, the presence of electric vehicles in Cameroon faces many challenges. These include the availability of electrical power, the lack of testing and approval for these vehicles, the absence of technological options for charging infrastructure, and the need for training professionals on the technical aspects of electric vehicles, charging stations, and batteries. Currently, Cameroon has only three electric vehicle charging stations: two in Douala and one in Yaound\u00e9.",

            "content": "TotalEnergies has shut down its Gryphon floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel.\n\nThe shutdown was in line with TotalEnergies previously filed decommissioning plan from 2023, which envisioned ceasing production from Gryphon on 31 December 2024, with decommissioning activities taking place starting in 2025.\n\nThe decision was opposed by Nobel Upstream, which owns stakes in two fields tied back to the vessel.\n\nNobel Upstream CEO Larry Bates said that the \u201chostile UK policy environment from both policymakers and regulators\u201d was making investment impossible.\n\n\u201cFor years we have wanted to drill more wells in the Gryphon area but have been frustrated by the NSTA and Total in making that happen. Sadly, those wells will never be drilled as long as this draconian fiscal environment remains,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCapital that would have been invested in the UK will now go overseas, along with the British workers who provide the hydrocarbons necessary to keep homes warm, lights on and factories producing.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Gryphon shutdown means a loss of around \u00a3150 million in tax receipts by the end of 2027.\n\nThe Gryphon vessel accounts for around 1% of the UK\u2019s oil production and less than 1% of its gas production.\n\nNobel Upstream previously filed a lawsuit to stop plans to decommission the Gryphon FPSO, aiming to stop TotalEnergies from starting decommissioning work.\n\nIn its suit, Nobel said that decommissioning Gryphon would force the company to abandon two fields connected to the vessel, driving it to quit the UK North Sea.\n\nThe Gryphon FPSO is connected to five fields, including Gryphon North and South along with subsea tiebacks to the Maclure, Tullich and Ballindaloch fields.\n\nNobel Upstream holds a 7.6% stake in Maclure, with operator TotalEnergies holding 38.2%, Taqa 37% and Apache 17.2%. Nobel also holds 8% in Ballindalloch and TotalEnergies holds the 92% operating stake.\n\nGas is exported via a pipeline to Beryl A and through the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) system to St Fergus.\n\n\u201cThe Gryphon area hub produces about 12,000 boe per day. How can that volume of production be uneconomic at $70 crude?,\u201d Bates added.\n\n\u201cIf Total is incapable of maintaining economic production given their high overhead costs and massive bureaucracy, Total must step aside and allow others to continue, as specifically required by existing law and regulations.\u201d\n\nEnergy Voice contacted the NSTA and TotalEnergies for comment.\n\nThe Gryphon Alpha was the North Sea\u2019s first purpose built permanently moored FPSO, based around 100 miles southeast of Shetland. It has been continuously operating for over 30 years since being installed in 1993.\n\nFrench firm Total inherited the asset through its 2018 of takeover Maersk.\n\nThe French energy giant holds an 86.5% operating interest in the asset, alongside Sojitz Energy Development (13.5%).",

The key issue concerns the calculation of salary scales linked to experience, significantly impacting wages.\n\nOn Tuesday, management announced it would present a proposal for workers in both the petroleum and chemical sectors.\n\nThe proposal, set to be put to a referendum on 20 January, involves fully recognising \"non-relevant professional years\" after five years of service as relevant professional experience.\n\nManagement emphasises that this is a broader application of the existing collective agreement, intended as a concession to the unions.\n\nIn late December, the unions had issued a strike notice set to expire on 13 January.\n\nRelated News",

Teva Ship Charter LLC, a joint venture between Vantage Drilling International and TotalEnergies, will acquire the Tungsten Explorer from Vantage subject to customary sale and purchase conditions precedent. (File photograph)\n\nVantage Drilling International Ltd, the Bermudian-registered exempted company, has announced a joint venture with TotalEnergies, the French-headquartered multinational energy and petroleum organisation.\n\nVantage said the joint venture has been named Teva Ship Charter LLC.\n\nSubsequent to the completion of the current Tungsten Explorer contract in Congo, the company said Teva will acquire the Tungsten Explorer from Vantage subject to customary sale and purchase conditions precedent.\n\nIt added that TotalEnergies, Vantage and Teva have executed all definitive agreements in support of the rig acquisition and joint venture management including a sale and purchase agreement by which Teva will acquire the rig and a management agreement pursuant to which Vantage will operate the Tungsten Explorer for a ten-year term with the option to extend for an additional five years.\n\nIhab Toma, chief executive of Vantage, said: \u201cWe are proud to partner with TotalEnergies in this joint venture, marking a significant milestone for both companies.\n\n\u201cThe creation of Teva and the execution of all definitive agreements reinforce our shared commitment to value creation through collaboration and creative business models in offshore drilling.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to leveraging our expertise to ensure the long-term success of this partnership.\u201d\n\nVantage is an offshore drilling contractor whose primary business is to contract drilling units, related equipment and work crews primarily on a day rate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells globally for major, national and independent oil and gas companies.\n\nThe company also markets, operates and provides management services in respect of drilling units owned by others.\n\n***\n\nVantage has announced that William L. Thomson will assume the additional role of chief operating officer.\n\nMr Thomson, who will report directly to Mr Toma, will continue to be based in Vantage\u2019s Dubai office.\n\nThe appointee, who is the company\u2019s chief commercial and chief technology officer, has been with Vantage since 2008 serving in several capacities in engineering/projects, technical support, marketing and managed services.\n\n***\n\nBermudian-based Golden Ocean Group Ltd, the world\u2019s largest listed owner of large-size dry bulk vessels, has purchased 80,000 of the company\u2019s own common stocks on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\n\nFollowing completion of the transactions, GOGL owns 1,787,328 of its own shares, corresponding to 0.89 per cent of the company\u2019s share capital.\n\nThe purchases were made for an average price of 99.15 Norwegian krone (approximately $8.72) per share.\n\nGolden Ocean announced in October that it had renewed its share buyback programme of a maximum $100 million to purchase up to an aggregate of ten million of the company\u2019s common shares in a 12-month period from the announcement.\n\n***\n\nSeadrill Ltd, the Bermudian-based offshore drilling company, has completed the sale of the jack-up rig West Prospero for cash proceeds of $45 million.\n\nPresident and chief executive Simon Johnson said: \u201cWith the sale of the West Prospero, we have monetised a noncore asset that has been stacked since 2016 and successfully executed on our strategy to exit the benign jack-up market.\u201d",

The Namibian oil boom, if sustained, could inject new life into exploration investments, potentially influencing global oil prices in the years ahead.\n\nBy Alan Livsey\n\nLaw of averages could catch up with explorers, as typical success rate for a series of offshore wells is around a third ___STEADY_PAYWALL___\n\nThose arguing that higher oil prices are ahead often point in evidence to a chronic lack of investment in oil exploration of late. Without sufficient capital put into large, offshore projects, crude supply will wither, they say. In fact, there have been very large oil discoveries including in the Norwegian North Sea, offshore Guyana (11bn barrels of oil) and, most recently, offshore Namibia.\n\nShell, TotalEnergies and Portugal\u2019s Galp have made a series of discoveries of oil (and some gas) off the coast of the south-west African country in the past two years. Together these could produce hundreds of millions, if not billions, of barrels of oil.\n\nIf anything, a surprisingly high success rate could spur more activity. Of 17 pure exploration wells since February 2022, there have been 15 confirmed discoveries of commercial quantities of oil or gas.\n\nCertainly Chevron has confidence in this outcome. In October 2022 America\u2019s second-largest oil company announced that it had acquired 80 per cent of an offshore licence from the Namibian affiliate of Toronto-listed explorer Sintana. Junior explorer Sintana was an early buyer of licences to drill off the Namibian coast.\n\nChevron\u2019s acquired acreage is just west of Galp\u2019s. The American oil company has announced it will drill 10 wells starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Investors in Sintana, with a C$122mn market value, have done well. Its share price has more than tripled over the past year.\n\nOf course, the law of averages could soon catch up with these explorers. The typical success rate for a series of offshore wells such as these is around a third. Such a high hit rate (88 per cent so far) might mean that this Orange basin in Namibia could be highly prolific. But history suggests this kind of success rate will tail off in the next couple of years.\n\nThese wells cannot be cheap. Some are being drilled in 5,000 metres of water, before going even deeper through the seafloor. Galp had budgeted $200mn-$300mn for its first two successful wells back in October. Even if those costs come down over time, a few \u201cdry\u201d wells could cause some of these oil companies to rethink their plans.\n\nIt is too early to tell whether the Namibian offshore oil play will turn into another large source of oil. But early indications suggest large finds in the hundreds of millions of barrels of recoverable oil, at least. Inevitably, the successes of Total, Shell and Galp will encourage large oil companies to direct more investment into exploration.\n\nThat impetus, as well as the potential added supply if significant, could help keep a lid on oil prices in the years to come.\n\nRead also:\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Financial Times Ltd.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Despite the challenges surrounding Sudan, more especially the ongoing civil war, head coach of Al Hilal, Florent Ibenge insists that the team\u2019s dedication and hard work is fuelled by making their people proud.\n\nThe tactician attributes Al Hilal's competitiveness to the opportunity to participate in a structured championship in Mauritania.\n\nThe coach highlights the central role of Al Hilal and Al Merreikh in the success of the national team, qualified for the CAN and at the top of the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nSpeaking to CAFOnline on the sidelines of this side\u2019s preparation for their next TotalEnergies CAF Champions League group match against MC Alger, Ibenge reflects on the team\u2019s impressive form, life as a coach as well as the challenges faced by the country.\n\nAl Hilal currently top their group in the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League, what do you think attributes to this good form in such a tough competition?\n\nWe decided this year that we had to do better than last year [editor's note: the team was eliminated in the group stage]. From the start, we had set our goal: this year, it was absolutely necessary to qualify for the quarters. We worked for that. It's a little beyond what we had imagined but our hard work has paid off.\n\nWe won all three games, but always with the same thought that nothing has been done yet. Until now, the goal remains to qualify for the rest of the knockout stages.\n\nSudan is going through a trying period as a country. How has this affected your preparations and travels for the games?\n\nA lot, especially last year. This year, it's a bit less complicated, since we are in Mauritania. We thank the President of the Mauritanian federation, Ahmed Yahya, for his invitation to participate in their Championship.\n\nWe are living at a hotel, which is not quite \"normal\". Normal is being at home. But at least we can play in a championship and remain competitive. I think this also explains Sudan's good results in the African Cup of Nations [qualifiers].\n\nWhat specific strategies have you put in place to keep your players motivated despite external difficulties?\n\nWe thought we shouldn't mix the field and what's going on outside. Once on the field, you have to give 200%. That's what we do: we work hard, really hard.\n\nIn addition, we listen to the players, playing both the role of father and mother for them. It is an extraordinary group, because despite what they are going through, when they are on the field, they remain focussed, attentive, and give the best of themselves.\n\nDo you think this difficult situation has strengthened the mind and solidarity of your group?\n\nCompletely! We used a psychologist during the preparation. He has been very useful to us, and we continue to apply some of the techniques he taught us. It helps us a lot.\n\nYour experience as a coach has led you to a variety of environments. How is this stint with a Sudanese side unique to you professionally and personally?\n\nOn a personal level, I often say: what I will remember when I stop my career are human relationships. These are not necessarily the trophies won, but rather the shared experiences, the adventures lived together. And here, I live a totally different adventure, where we don't just play football.\n\nWe learn every day to manage particular situations. Regarding the work, it is adjusted, because the dynamics are different from last year, when we did not have a championship. The goal is to keep players competitive.\n\nSo it is necessary to slightly modify our training methods. This is a learning experience, and it is an extremely rewarding experience.\n\nWhat message do you want to convey to the Sudanese people who support the team despite the trials?\n\nI would like to tell them that we are constantly thinking about them. Not a day goes by without us having a thought for the Sudanese people, because the situation remains very difficult.\n\nThe family of the majority of my players are in Sudan, and we receive news every day. It affects us a lot. For example, recently, one of our players learned that his two brothers had been arrested. In these moments, it is very difficult to live as normal but it also strengthens the solidarity of the group, because everyone supports the person concerned.\n\nSudanese football is also doing well with the national team qualified for the TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations and at the top of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers group. How do you explain the good form of Sudanese football?\n\nThe backbone of the success of Sudanese football is essentially based on two pillars: Al Hilal and Al Merreikh, two clubs that are distinguished by their competitiveness. In terms of the national team, the backbone of the selection is largely made up of players from these two clubs. That is why the better these two clubs do on the continent, the beneficial it is to our senior national team.\n\nAfter this impressive group stage phase, what are your goals for the rest of the competition?\n\nThe priority is first to qualify for the next phase. Once this goal is achieved, it is necessary to move step by step. We were not among the favourites at the beginning, and we are still not.\n\nHowever, we managed to be among the last 16 clubs in the running. Now, the ambition is to join the remaining eight teams. At this point, each game becomes crucial. You have to win to move forward. The short-term goal is ther",

They've skipped the Giro d'Italia for the past two seasons and will do the same in May 2025.\n\nAfter having to downsize due to losing a title sponsor in Dstny and key riders such as Maxim van Gils and Victor Campenaerts, Lotto will be looking to again punch above their weight in 2025. However, to do this best, they have to get their calendar right, as they have in 2023 and 2024.\n\nSince going down, they've scored very well and look almost certain for a jump back to the WorldTour level in 2026, after ending last season as the ninth-ranked team, well above the 18th place they would have to finish to ensure they get promoted.\n\nThey will focus on one-day races and smaller stage races to maximise their points gain and utilise their young squad best, with key leaders Arnaud De Lie and Lennert Van Eetvelt likely to score the majority of the team's points as they did in 2024.\n\nAlongside their racing focus, Lotto and their team manager St\u00e9phane Heulot will be looking for a second title sponsor to come on board for their probable return to cycling's top division.\n\nGet The Leadout Newsletter The latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!

Comoros went through the three-month campaign unbeaten with three wins and three draws, with their 2-1 victory in Tunisia one of the best results they have attained in some two decades of international competition. In March, they resume World Cup qualification in top place in Group I with home games against Mali and Chad. Comoros\u2019 women\u2019s team competed at the 2024 COSAFA Women\u2019s Championship in South Africa, picking up invaluable experience, but not have entered the qualifiers for the TotalEnergies CAF Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations Morocco 2026.\n\nCLUBS\n\nUS Zilimadjou participated in the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League for a second time, after their initial appearance in the 2020-21 campaign, when they were drawn against Nigeria\u2019s Enugu Rangers in the first round of the 2024-25 edition. They forfeited home advantage with both legs of the tie hosted in Uyo but despite the disadvantage did themselves proud as they were eliminated only 2-1 on aggregate after the two matches. In the TotalEnergies CAF Confederation Cup, Alize Fort made their debut in continental club competition but were heavily beaten 11-0 on aggregate by Black Bulls of Mozambique. Both legs were played in Maputo.\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSaid Ali Said Athouman was elected as President of the Comoros Football Federation in 2012 and has won much praise for his role in the success of men\u2019s national team plus the building of new technical training centre after the ravages wrought by Cyclone Kenneth in 2019. Athouman also works as the secretary-general of the Chamber of Commerce in the Comoros.\n\nHISTORY\n\nOne of the pivotal figures in the history of the Comoros football must be Amir Abdou, who served as national team coach for eight years from 2014 to 2022 and took the island country to their first Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon. He came to the attention of the Comoros federation through his work mentoring children, notably among the island\u2019s large emigrant community in Marseille, and was invited to serve as assistant to Henri Stambouli, the former Olympique de Marseille tactician who was earmarked as the first foreign coach of the Comoros team. But at the last minute, Stambouli chose to take up an offer to run Montpellier\u2019s training centre instead and Abdou was suddenly thrust onto the international stage. He persuaded players from the Diaspora to commit to the team, steadily growing the standard of the side, culminating in qualification for the TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon, where a 3-2 win over Ghana in Garoua in January 2022 ranks as one of the great upsets in the history of the competition.",

            "content": "Sudan officially secured their ticket to the TotalEnergies CAF African Nations Championship, capping off some much-needed positivity for the northeast African nation currently experiencing a civil war.\n\nSudan secured their ticket to next year\u2019s competition scheduled for 01 \u2013 28 February in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya courtesy of their second leg 2-1 win over Ethiopia, making them the first nation to secure their ticket to the continental showpiece.\n\nThe eighth edition of the TotalEnergies CHAN competition marks the Crocodiles of the Nile\u2019s fourth participation, which is also their second consecutive appearance following their participation in the Algeria edition in 2022.\n\n\n\nReturn to the TotalEnergies CAF AFCON\n\nNext year\u2019s TotalEnergies CAF CHAN competition comes at the right time for Sudan following their qualification to the TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations Morocco 2025 set to take place between 21 December \u2013 18 January 2026 in Morocco.\n\nCoached by Ghanaian legend Kwesi Appiah, Sudan finished second in Group F behind Angola ahead of Niger and Ghana in the qualifiers to secure their ticket to Africa\u2019s biggest football competition, having missed out in the Cote d\u2019Ivoire edition earlier this year.\n\nThe Kwesi Appiah effect\n\nAppointed in September 2023, Kwesi Appiah has instilled a much-needed sense of self-belief and grit into the Sudanese national team. It is under the Ghanaian legend\u2019s tutelage that Sudan have two CAF national team competition qualifications under their belt following a disappointing spell before Appiah\u2019s arrival.\n\n\n\nAl Hilal Omdurman impresses in the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League\n\nAnother indicator of the progress of Sudanese football in 2024 is the performance of Al Hilal Omdurman in the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League.\n\nAl Hilal currently leads a tough Group A consisting of five-time champions, TP Mazembe, Tanzanian giants Young Africans as well as MC Alger of Algeria.\n\nWith three group matches played so far, Al Hilal have had a clean sweep of points, defeating all three opponents in the first leg and well on course for a place in the knockout stages.\n\nSuccess under challenging circumstances\n\nFootball, like it is for many African nations has truly been a beacon of hope for Sudan.\n\nCurrently experiencing a heart-wrenching civil war that has forced Al Hilal to play their football in the Mauritanian Championship, the nation\u2019s remarkable achievements for the year has certainly not gone unnoticed across the continent.\n\nSuch an achievement under challenging circumstances has taken the national team and club football determination to even greater heights ahead of what promises to be an exciting year for Sudanese football.",
