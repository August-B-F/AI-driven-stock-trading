This process ensures that functional components are utilised rather than discarded.\n\nCommodity items such as batteries and wheels will be assessed for remanufacturing, repurposing, or recycling based on their condition and potential for reuse.\n\nRaw materials, including copper, aluminium, steel, and plastic, will be recovered and processed to replace virgin materials in new vehicle production whenever possible.\n\nTME vice president of circular economy Leon van der Merwe said: \u201cWe initially anticipate recycling around 10,000 vehicles a year in our UK facility, which will give new life to 120,000 parts, recover 300 tonnes of high-purity plastic and 8,200 tonnes of steel, among other materials.\n\n\u201cAs a next step, we plan to roll out similar operations across Europe. And we\u2019re not stopping at our own facilities \u2013 we are eager to collaborate with other organisations who share our passion for circularity and commitment to carbon neutrality.\u201d\n\nThis initiative is part of Toyota\u2019s broader sustainability goals, aiming to reduce emissions associated with vehicle manufacturing.\n\nToyota is committed to achieving carbon neutrality in all its owned facilities by 2030 and across its European product line-up by 2035.\n\nThe company\u2019s global and European sustainability objectives include being fully carbon neutral by 2040.\n\nAlso, TME has unveiled the FT-Me, an electric micromobility concept for urban commuters.\n\nThe compact two-seater features a premium yet affordable design, using recycled materials to reduce its carbon footprint by 90% compared to current city vehicles.",

            "content": "[UPDATE] Toyota has announced production of the Supra A90 Final Edition will be split evenly between Europe and Japan. Each region will get 150 units. In its domestic market, the sports car costs 15,000,000 yen, which works out to \u20ac92,500 at current exchange rates. The JDM model is far cheaper than the same vehicle sold in Germany and France. Japanese buyers must enter a lottery to win the right to buy one.\n\nToyota has several reasons for charging a lot more for the Supra A90 Final Edition. Not only is it the end of the line for the current sports car, but it also brings a significant boost in power, among other hardware tweaks. With production capped at 300 units for Europe and Japan, the exclusivity factor shouldn\u2019t be ignored either. Given increasingly stricter emissions regulations in Europe, there may never be a car like this.\n\nNevertheless, is it worth a nearly 100 percent premium over a standard six-cylinder model? Pricing for the Supra\u2019s swan song is out in Germany, where customers must fork out \u20ac142,800. For reference, the regular 3.0-liter model begins at \u20ac73,250, while the entry-level 2.0-liter version costs \u20ac63,250. The Final Edition\u2019s pricing is definitely not a typo. Heck, the car is even more expensive in France, at \u20ac144,000. French buyers must win the right to buy the vehicle by entering a lottery.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nThere are a lot of nice cars you could buy with that kind of money. A fully loaded BMW M4 Competition xDrive is still cheaper than the Supra A90 Final Edition in Deutschland. We can say the same for a Toyota V-6-powered Lotus Emira with all the bells and whistles. Even a Porsche 911 Carrera T is more affordable, kicking off at \u20ac141,700 in Germany. A quick search on Mobile.de will reveal that kind of money can also buy you a Ferrari 458 or an Audi R8 with its glorious naturally aspirated V-10.\n\nNevertheless, the last hurrah for the fifth-generation Supra is still a bargain (well, not really) compared to the Alpine A110 R Ultime. Renault\u2019s performance branch wants a ludicrous \u20ac330,000, making it the most expensive four-cylinder new car ever.\n\nAs a refresher, the Supra A90 Final Edition doesn\u2019t get BMW\u2019s superior S58 engine. It utilizes an upgraded B58, now making 429 hp instead of 382 hp. Torque rises from 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) to 420 lb-ft (570 Nm). The turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six is more potent than in any BMW application to date, which seems a bit odd.\n\nToyota throws in bigger Brembo front brakes, an Akrapovi\u010d titanium exhaust, and an adjustable KW suspension. Those 300 buyers also receive staggered wheels with Gazoo Racing branding, measuring 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the back. GR mounts 265/35Z1R19 front and 285/30ZR20 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, which are 10 percent wider.\n\nThe Supra\u2019s epilogue also has a new aero pack with a carbon fiber front spoiler and rear swan-neck wing. The hood duct is made from the same lightweight material and can be removed during a track day when extra cooling is needed. Sold only with a six-speed manual, the car gets the Supra GT4\u2019s aluminum mount for the rear subframe. Other goodies include carbon fiber Recaro bucket seats with red seatbelts and plenty of Alcantara.\n\nToyota has yet to announce an equivalent of the Supra A90 Final Edition for the United States, but logic tells us that an immensely expensive finale is coming.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nSource: Toyota\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "In the ongoing conversation on cleaner fuels, Toyota has been a long-standing hydrogen advocate as the clean energy of the future. But now recent developments show that the automaker is changing its plan when it comes to hydrogen.\n\nDuring the 2025 Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Seminar, Toyota revealed what it wants to do. Toyota said that it was shifting its focus away from passenger cars (like this one) to commercial vehicles, industrial applications, and power generation.\n\nToyota takes a sober look at hydrogen\n\nThe company\u2019s hydrogen promise is still there but is just getting a bit more pragmatic and strategic. Hydrogen fuel cell technology has not adopted mass consumer usage in mass-market vehicles. The infrastructure challenges and cost have been the main factor in stopping consumers from switching.\n\nToyota is now accepting these realities and so it is expanding its hydrogen vision beyond just personal mobility. Toyota\u2019s new strategy really does focus mainly on heavy-duty trucks, stationary power, and industrial applications. Toyota feels that these markets will see more of hydrogen\u2019s benefits.\n\nHydrogen trucks can refuel and drive long distances without having to carry the weight of large batteries around. Toyota expects hydrogen to help to bridge the gap in markets where electric batteries don\u2019t make sense.\n\nToyota is also developing hydrogen\u2019s potential to produce power. Fuel cell systems can be utilized to produce stable electricity to fuel buildings and off-grid locations. Toyota has already started installing these systems in actual real-world uses.\n\nToyota builds the Tri-Gen facility in Long Beach\n\nPerhaps Toyota\u2019s biggest hydrogen initiative is likely its Tri-Gen facility in Long Beach, California. This facility will takes renewable biogas and convert it into three products: hydrogen, electricity, and water.\n\nEvery day, it produces 1,200 kilograms of hydrogen, 2.3 megawatts of electricity, and 1,400 gallons of water. The produced hydrogen is used to fuel around 30 fuel-cell trucks at the port.\n\nThe Tri-Gen plant is just one of Toyota\u2019s bigger ideas (this might be the biggest though). Instead of leveraging available infrastructure, Toyota is actually opting to construct hydrogen ecosystems from the ground up. It is trying to create similar projects in other parts of the world to show hydrogen\u2019s practicality in other industries.\n\nSo of course, by default, one of the biggest focus areas in Toyota\u2019s new hydrogen plan is trucking. Heavy trucks have a number of their own challenges for reducing emissions. Battery electric trucks take a long time to recharge and require huge battery packs, which take away from cargo capacity.\n\nBut Hydrogen fuel cell trucks can offer a better alternative. They can be refueled in approximately 15 to 20 minutes, similar to diesel trucks. They also have extended driving ranges.\n\nToyota has been testing hydrogen-powered trucks in the United States for quite some time now. The results have actually been quite good. The automaker is now scaling up to bring fuel cell trucks into the mainstream. Partnerships with truck manufacturers and logistics companies are helping along the way.\n\nGoing a bit further than just mobility\n\nToyota\u2019s hydrogen ambitions are for so much more than just its cars. The company is developing stationary fuel cell systems that will power buildings and factories.\n\nOne of these systems is already powering a Pacific Northwest hospital as backup power in the event of an emergency. Another Toyota fuel cell generator powered the Detroit Christmas tree lighting. Toyota also partnered with the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado to use a one-megawatt stationary fuel cell system.\n\nThe project showed the ability of hydrogen to provide clean and reliable energy to large buildings. Toyota sees such systems as critical to its future plans for hydrogen.\n\nWhile promising, hydrogen still has quite a few hurdles to cross. The biggest one is infrastructure. Hydrogen fueling facilities are not everywhere, and it will be difficult for customers to adopt hydrogen vehicles.\n\nToyota is working with governments and industry stakeholders to expand hydrogen infrastructure. It is convinced that focused investment in a few areas will help with broader adoption.\n\nA second problem is expense. Production, storage, and distribution of hydrogen is still just so pricy. Toyota is investing in advancing technologies so hydrogen will become less expensive. It expects the costs to drop once the technology ramps up and expands, then the price will begin to rival alternative energy.",

            "content": "For decades, we\u2019ve all heard the same story \u2014 Americans love their giant vehicles.\n\nFor more than a decade, the three best-selling models in the United States were consistently the full-size trucks built by the Detroit Three automakers. The Ford F-Series has been America\u2019s best-selling vehicle for nearly five decades. The Chevrolet Silverado has consistently held second place for more than a decade, usually followed by the Ram 1500.\n\nThe midsize SUV overtook the midsize car as America\u2019s family car of choice, and those have been growing. Even the compact SUVs of today would have qualified as midsize when George W. Bush was president.\n\nBut, beginning last year, a new trend has emerged.\n\nAmericans are starting to choose smaller vehicles again.\n\nData from Kelley Blue Book parent company show that, since 2019, Americans have begun choosing smaller vehicles.\n\nThe Rise of the Compact SUV\n\nCompact SUVs took over as America\u2019s best-selling type of vehicle in 2020. Since then, the number of compact SUVs sold has grown while midsize SUV sales have retreated. Three compact SUVs overtook the Ram truck in sales in 2025. The Toyota RAV4, Tesla Model Y, and Honda CR-V all outsold Ram\u2019s full-size truck.\n\nIncredibly, the same is now true for trucks. Full-size trucks still outsell midsize trucks, but full-size truck sales have been shrinking since 2020. Midsize truck sales now show consistent growth.\n\nThis could raise alarm bells in Detroit, where automakers have focused their efforts on full-size models. Ram does not currently build a midsize truck for the U.S. market, though rumors persist that the Dakota name could come back on a smaller truck soon. In the meantime, its sibling brand, Jeep, does offer the Gladiator midsize pickup.\n\nChevrolet\u2019s Colorado and Ford\u2019s Ranger, meanwhile, now come only in a 4-door (crew cab), short-bed configuration. Toyota dominates sales in the growing midsize truck category and builds its Tacoma in combinations of extended and crew cabs with short and long beds. Nissan is another manufacturer that makes its midsize truck, the Frontier, in multiple configurations. Nissan also discontinued its Titan full-size pickup, after the 2024 model year, which struggled to gain traction in the market.\n\nIn 2022, the Ford Maverick and the Hyundai Santa Cruz compact trucks debuted to strong sales, emerging from their respective shared platforms with the Ford Escape and Hyundai Tucson compact SUVs.\n\nEven among cars, small is making a comeback. Both compact and subcompact car sales have been increasing since 2022. Automakers have nearly abandoned the subcompact car category. Only Nissan builds one in 2025, its Versa sedan. Mitsubishi dealers still have some 2024 Mirage hatchbacks and Mirage G4 sedans on lots, but there is no 2025 Mirage.\n\nOther competitors have left the ultra-small market completely. The Chevy Spark, America\u2019s least-expensive new car for several years, left the market in 2022. So did the Hyundai Accent. Then, the Kia Rio.\n\nA Pricing Problem\n\nThe rise of smaller vehicles may be a consequence of bigger prices.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic changed America\u2019s shopping habits, automakers understood that only wealthier, better-credit shoppers could easily car shop. They tailored their lineups to attract them, canceling inexpensive models and adding more alternatives at luxury car prices.\n\nThat has helped to bifurcate the car market. Last month, the average new car sold for $48,039. But that average was misleading. Buyers clustered at two ends of the scale.\n\nAt the low end, compact SUVs outsold all other vehicles, with an average sale price of $36,198. At the other end, Americans bought a record number of cars priced above $100,000.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem for dealers, who increasingly find themselves with few inexpensive models to offer.",

            "content": "Every now and then I encounter something that genuinely makes me take a moment and reflect on just how damn clever human beings can be. Usually when I get this sort of feeling it\u2019s in response to something pretty simple as opposed to some colossal engineering project. Something like how old air-cooled Volkswagens powered their windshield washers with air pressure from the spare tire. That\u2019s clever and unexpected! Just like how this \u201970s to \u201980s French Toyota brochure I want to show you is clever and unexpected, because the thing turns into a damn working phonograph!\n\nI was sent a video of this thing (by Joshua, so thank you for that) being unfolded and working, and I\u2019ve been obsessed ever since. The problem is I just can\u2019t seem to find more information about it anywhere! I\u2019m not even entirely sure what year it may be from, but I have a guess, which we\u2019ll get into soon.\n\nFirst, though, you need to see what the hell I\u2019m talking about, so, please, watch:\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Jean Pierre de Oliveira (@jp_dolv)\n\nPutain de merde, right? This is one of the coolest assemblages of paper, wire, and plastic I think I\u2019ve ever seen. I know now it would be possible to have a little digital audio chip with flash memory and a small battery and speaker that could likely reproduce much better audio, but there\u2019s something downright magical about being able to play back recorded sounds with zero electronics, just using your finger, a needle, some groves pressed into a disc, and a bit of cardboard.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLet\u2019s look at this thing. Folded up, it\u2019s quite flat, with some one-color (reddish) printing on gray cardstock, and that record disk peeking through, with the suggestion to \u201clift gently\u201d at the corner, promising instructions on the back.\n\nIt\u2019s also telling us that the new Carina and Celica are beautiful, and we should come see them and that Toyota is worth trying! When we open it, the instructions tell us how to place the needle on the record to make the magic happen, magic which I\u2019ll break down here, though I\u2019m about certain all of you know how this works:\n\nI mean, the whole process of phonography is so clever and straightforward it makes me dizzy. A small needle follows specially-placed grooves in a vinyl record, creating physical vibrations that become sound waves. I love it. And this is such a fabulous use of this phenomenon, as that voice tells us how great the Celica and Carina are.\n\nThis sort of thing wasn\u2019t unheard of, of course; cereal boxes had cardboard records on them for years, though, unlike this Toyota brochure, they had no means to play the record, relying on the cereal/music-enjoyer to have a record player of their own (a chimp was nice to have, too, but not strictly necessary):\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo, when was this thing likely made? I think we have a clue based on the drawings of the cars, which look to be second-generation Celicas and Carinas. The Carina, by the way, was not something we ever got in America; it was essentially the sedan version of the Celica.\n\nAnyway, the second generation of these cars was introduced in 1977, and since the copy on the brochure refers to the cars as \u201cles nouvelles\u201d I take that to mean they were new then, so my guess for this thing is around 1977.\n\nThose do seem to be the cars shown in the illustrations. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re looking at something from 1977, perhaps 1978 here. But I\u2019m not certain.\n\nI\u2019m reaching out to Toyota as well to try and get some more information; if anyone in the vast Autopian Brain Trust knows anything, I\u2019d love to hear it, too.\n\nPhonographic recording in the automotive world had a sort of mild renaissance in the late 1970s and early 1980s for Japanese brands; aside from this charming brochure, we had Nissan\u2019s phonograph-operated voice alert system:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmazing stuff.\n\nI really hope I can find out more about this; was this the only one? Did other manufacturers use similar setups for their brochures? How many of these were made? Was this a French-market only thing? I want to know.\n\nTop Image: Toyota/JP_dolv (Instagram)",

The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.22%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.33%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the company had gained 7.24% over the past month, outpacing the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 20.08% and the S&P 500's loss of 7.48% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Toyota Motor Corporation in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.19, reflecting a 56.11% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $75.52 billion, up 1.28% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $21.01 per share and a revenue of $309.97 billion, indicating changes of -17.12% and -0.68%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Toyota Motor Corporation. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 6.29% increase. Currently, Toyota Motor Corporation is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Toyota Motor Corporation is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 9.19. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 7.29, so one might conclude that Toyota Motor Corporation is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nWe can also see that TM currently has a PEG ratio of 0.35. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Automotive - Foreign industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.13.",

The entry period will run from today to April 13, with winners being announced on May 9.\n\nIn 2019, driven by the strong desire of Chairman Akio Toyoda, aka Master Driver Morizo, the Supra stormed back after a 17-year absence. Said Chairman Toyoda upon its release: \"Back in the day, I spent countless hours driving an old Supra at N\u00fcrburgring to become a master driver. Supra is like an old friend that holds a special place in my heart. While other manufacturers were putting their beautiful new prototypes which they were going to introduce through the paces, I was driving an old Supra that was no longer in production. So even though Toyota had no plans to make a new Supra, just like a lot of other die-hard Supra fans around the world, I secretly wanted to make it happen. The new GR Supra was born through testing at N\u00fcrburgring, and I can honestly say that it is a car that is fun to drive and better than ever.\"\n\nThe current Supra has continued to evolve since its launch, with partially upgraded models released in 2020 and 2022.

            "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Toyota Boshoku ( ) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Toyota Boshoku, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.072 = JP\u00a554b \u00f7 (JP\u00a51.1t - JP\u00a5367b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nTherefore, Toyota Boshoku has an ROCE of 7.2%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Auto Components industry average of 6.2%.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Toyota Boshoku compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Toyota Boshoku, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 7.2% from 12% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nIn summary, Toyota Boshoku is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has gained an impressive 90% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.\n\nIf you want to continue researching Toyota Boshoku, you might be interested to know about the that our analysis has discovered.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free\n\nIf you're looking to trade Toyota Boshoku , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

Now, $10,000 will be up for grabs for the highest finishing Classic competitor driving a 2021 or newer Toyota tow vehicle through Toyota\u2019s popular contingency program \u201cBonus Bucks\u201d.\n\nThis payout has increased for the 2025 Classic, up from $7,500 in past years. Also new for 2025, the second and third highest finishing Classic competitors driving a Toyota will earn $5,000 and $3,000 payments, respectively.\n\nElite Series pro John Cox has capitalized on Bonus Bucks rewards numerous times throughout his 14-years as a full-time professional fisherman and has his eyes on the prize this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to win quite a bit of money through Bonus Bucks and I want to get my hands on this \u2018Happy Gilmore\u2019 check,\u201d Cox joked. \u201cLast year I was the second highest Toyota driver in the Classic and the first highest in REDCREST. I actually used that money on a down payment for my new Tundra this year, which was so nice. I\u2019ve been handing down my old trucks to my kids, cause they are all driving now, so we just keep adding them to the family.\u201d\n\nHe and his wife, Melissa, have a driveway full of Toyota tow-vehicles at their Florida home and value the added opportunity from Toyota as well as the brand\u2019s steadfast support of tournament bass fishing. Melissa has spent plenty of time behind the wheel of her husband\u2019s trucks, as she often has had to serve as John\u2019s driver and teammate, helping him manage a famously jam-packed tournament schedule.\n\n\u201cWe love the trucks, and I definitely love the extra bonuses,\u201d Melissa Cox said. \u201cWe have four Toyotas in our driveway at home, three Tundras and a 4Runner. Obviously, Toyota isn\u2019t a sponsor of John\u2019s but through Bonus Bucks we\u2019ve really felt the love from the brand, and everyone feels like family.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned what they\u2019d spend this year\u2019s increased Classic Bonus Bucks payout on if they were to win it, Cox was quick to consider a high-dollar cleaning service for his fishing-tackle-filled garage. What Cox lacks in tackle organization, he makes up for with humor and his uncanny ability to catch bass in shallow water and notch top finishes regardless of the fishery or time of year.\n\nWhile Cox was quick to admit he did not have a stellar practice on Lake Ray Roberts, it would surprise no one to see his name near the top of the leaderboard as the 56th annual Super Bowl of Bass Fishing plays out.\n\nToyota Bonus Bucks rewards far more than just Classic competitors. With over 620 supported tournaments, including team trails, college and even kayak events, you can reap the rewards of Bonus Bucks just like the pros.

            "content": "Toyota, which has hung back from rivals in proliferating battery-electric vehicles, is moving ahead with new BEVs, including a new pickup truck.\n\nAt a Brussels event, the Japanese automaker talked up an updated bZ4X, an all-new model called the C-HR+, as well as the recently launched Urban Cruiser. But the company also showed silhouettes of three new BEV models to tease audiences, including what is clearly a pickup truck and a three-row SUV that could find there way to the U.S\n\nToyota said in Brussels that the models were aimed at the European market. Toyota officials would not confirm any hard plans for future BEVs for the U.S. and said the teaser photo speaks for itself.\n\nLater this year, the automaker is set to launch an electric version of its Hilux pickup, sold in Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania and Latin America. That Hilux is priced to appeal to commercial-truck owners in European, Asian and Middle East cities with just 124 miles (200 km) of range. The teased BEV truck, though, appears to be a double-cab design with U.S. market appeal. It resembles the EPU Concept truck shown at the 2023 Tokyo Motor Show.\n\nThe EPU was pitched as a \u201clifestyle\u201d vehicle and appropriate for commercial customers, a lighter-duty truck than the Tacoma, which is sold in North America.\n\nRelated:2025 A6 e-tron is Audi\u2019s Longest-Range BEV in U.S.\n\nToyota also showed the Land Cruiser Se concept in Brussels, an EV version of the new Land Cruiser, launched this year in the U.S.\n\nBEVs are more easily extended into the U.S. where Toyota has an large and flexible manufacturing footprint. The wildcard is how much tariffs and a possible elimination of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs complicates demand.\n\n\u201cBEVs will become an ever-more accepted part of life,\u201d says Yoshihiro Nakata, president and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe. \u201cNow, without giving too much away, these next three parts (of Toyota\u2019s EV strategy) will focus on enhancing the customer\u2019s lifestyle just as powerfully as they enhance our carbon neutrality goals.\u201d\n\nBEV sales in the U.S. last year were split with SUVs, CUVs and pickups sharing 80% of the market, with 20% of sales going to sedans, per J.D. Power.\n\nThe Toyota pickup, which analysts expect to slot below the Tacoma, would compete most directly with the Ford Maverick.\n\nWhen Ford launched the Maverick, a compact hybrid pickup, skeptics doubted its appeal in a market dominated by full-size trucks. Yet, its affordable price, impressive fuel economy (with an HEV option), and practical design struck a chord with urban drivers and budget-conscious buyers. Demand surged beyond expectations, forcing Ford to pause orders multiple times as supply struggled to keep up.\n\nRelated:Lotus' Historic Turbo SE Nameplate Takes Flagship Spot\n\nTraditional truck buyers and even sedan owners embraced the Maverick as a versatile, everyday vehicle. What started as a niche experiment quickly became one of Ford\u2019s hottest-selling models, indicating that small trucks have a big future.",

When that much capability isn\u2019t needed, midsizers provide a more maneuverable, more affordable alternative.\n\nThe smaller trucks have plenty of fans, as evidenced by the popularity of the 2025 Toyota Tacoma. Toyota\u2019s midsize truck has a wide range of models, too, including several off-roaders and a hybrid powertrain.\n\nThe 2025 Nissan Frontier, on the other hand, offers a smaller lineup with just a single powertrain. It also offers an off-roader, but just one. It appeals as a more affordable choice, though, and it offers more towing capacity.\n\nBoth trucks go up against competitors that include the Chevrolet Colorado and Ford Ranger. Compared to each other, though, what\u2019s the better choice, the Frontier or Tacoma?\n\n2025 Nissan Frontier 2025 Nissan Frontier 2025 Nissan Frontier 2025 Nissan Frontier\n\nFrontier vs. Tacoma prices and features\n\nBase Frontier costs about $33,000\n\nBase Tacoma costs about $33,000\n\nBest picks: Frontier SV, Frontier Pro-4X, Tacoma SR5, Tacoma TRD Pro\n\nHow much is a Nissan Frontier\n\nNissan sells the Frontier in S, SV, SL, and Pro-X/Pro-4X trim levels. The base Frontier S King Cab (extended cab) starts at about $33,000, and comes standard with basic necessities that include cloth upholstery, manually adjustable front seats, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, wired Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, power features, a urethane steering wheel, a four-speaker audio system, a sliding rear window, a composite front skid plate, and 16-inch steel wheels.\n\nThe Crew Cab body style adds $1,300 and four-wheel drive adds $3,000.\n\nThe 4x4 SV model with the crew cab seems worth the money at about $40,000. It adds a 12.3-inch touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, power-adjustable exterior mirrors, an eight-way power driver\u2019s seat with two-way lumbar adjustments, a six-speaker audio system, a satellite radio trial, a steel front skid plate, and 17-inch alloy wheels.\n\nWe\u2019d also be interested in the crew cab Pro-4X at just over $43,000. It\u2019s built to go off-road with Bilstein shock absorbers, an aluminum front skid plate, skid plates for the transfer case and fuel tank, and all-terrain tires.\n\nAt the top of the lineup, the 4x4 crew cab SL model runs more than $46,000. It comes with leather upholstery, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, navigation, a wireless smartphone charger, a 120-volt outlet, a 10-speaker Fender audio system, remote start, a Class IV tow hitch, under-rail LED cargo bed lights, a bed tie-down system with two adjustable cleats, a sunroof, and a surround-view camera system.\n\nThe Frontier carries a basic 3-year/36,000-mile warranty.\n\nHow much is a Toyota Tacoma?\n\nToyota\u2019s range of Tacoma models is far more expansive than the Frontier\u2019s. It includes the SR, SR5, TRD PreRunner, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, Limited, Trailhunter, and TRD Pro.\n\nThe base Tacoma SR model runs about $33,000 and comes standard with cloth upholstery, manually adjustable seats, an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, power features, and 17-inch steel wheels. Toyota offers four-wheel drive for $3,200 and the crew cab body style (with the short bed combo) costs another $2,200\n\nWe recommend spending about $42,000 for a 4x4 SR5 crew cab with the long bed. It gets LED fog lights, alloy wheels, a deck rail system, a coil-spring rear suspension, and blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts.\n\nWe\u2019d also be tempted by the TRD Sport i-Force Max for about $48,000. For that money, you get the hybrid drivetrain and a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, LED bed lighting, and 18-inch wheels, plus access to the optional cooled synthetic leather seats, a sunroof, and a towing package.\n\nThe Tacoma lineup stretches up much higher than the Frontier\u2019s. The TRD Pro runs about $65,000, and adds a 14.0-inch touchscreen, heated and cooled front seats, premium audio, and lots of off-road hardware.\n\nThe Tacoma also has a 3-year/36,000-mile warranty, but Toyota adds 2 years/24,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance.\n\nAdvantage: Toyota Tacoma for features, lineup, and options, but the Frontier for price.\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter 2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter 2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter 2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter\n\nFrontier vs. Tacoma performance\n\nThe Tacoma offers hybrid performance\n\nThe Frontier comes only with a strong V-6\n\nTowing and hauling are a draw\n\nThe Tacoma has a weaker base engine. It\u2019s a 2.4-liter turbo-4 that makes 228 hp, which is decent for a midsize truck. Toyota teams it with a responsive 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual. A step-up version gets 270 or 278 hp in higher-line models. It has some diesel-like clatter, but it offers the power most buyers will want, works well with the automatic transmission, and has a responsive throttle pedal.\n\nToyota also offers a hybrid version of the uprated turbo-4 that spins out 326 hp and a strong 465 lb-ft of torque. It improves the power and towing confidence, but it only gets 23 mpg combined.\n\nThe Frontier features only a 3.8-liter V-6 that makes 310 hp and 281 lb-ft. It\u2019s teamed with a 9-speed automatic transmission. It delivers strong, consistent power that makes passing a no-fuss proposition, and the transmission has smooth shifts.\n\nTowing capacity for the Frontier rises to a maximum of 7,150 pounds for model year 2025, 500 more than it had been. Payload tops out at 1,620 pounds. The Tacoma can tow 6,500 pounds and haul 1,710 pounds. That means the Frontier wins for towing capacity, but the Tacoma is the winner for payload.\n\nThe Frontier has a leaf-spring rear suspension and front double wishbones. The Tacoma also has rear leaf springs and a solid rear axle in its base models, and both get the resulting choppy ride. However, the Toyota has a multi-link rear suspension and rear coil springs on all crew cab models to smooth out the ride. Both also offer off-road suspensions, but Toyota has far more off-road choices.\n\nAdvantage: Tacoma for advanced powertrain and suspension options.\n\n2025 Nissan Frontier 2025 Nissan Frontier 2025 Nissan Frontier 2025 Nissan Frontier\n\nFrontier vs. Tacoma off-road and 4x4 systems\n\nThe Tacoma offers more off-road models\n\nThe Frontier has just the Pro-X and Pro-4X\n\nBoth offer part-time four-wheel-drive systems\n\nRear-wheel drive comes standard on both trucks, and both offer a part-time four-wheel-drive system with a 2-speed transfer case. The Frontier\u2019s four-wheel-drive system is controlled by a knob on the center console. For best off-roading, go for the Pro-4X model, which gets a locking rear differential, all-terrain tires, and a 9.5-inch ground clearance versus 8.9 inches for a rear-drive base model.\n\nThe Tacoma has more off-road choices, and its hybrid Limited model gets a full-time four-wheel-drive system. Also available are a variety of off-road modes, an electronic locking rear differential, and a crawl feature.\n\nThe TRD Off-Road rises 11.0 inches off the ground, sits on 32-inch all-terrain tires, and offers an optional disconnecting front sway bar. The TRD Pro adds stronger skid plates, Fox shocks, and a raised ground clearance. The Trailhunter is outfitted as the slow rock crawler versus the TRD Pro\u2019s high-speed desert runner.\n\nAdvantage: Toyota Tacoma for more capability, options.\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma 2024 Toyota Tacoma 2024 Toyota Tacoma 2024 Toyota Tacoma\n\nFrontier vs. Tacoma size, space, and seating capacity, and bed space\n\nFrontier\u2019s extended cab has small rear seat\n\nTacoma\u2019s extended cab has no rear seat\n\nTacoma is slightly longer\n\nHow big is the Nissan Frontier?\n\nNissan offers the Frontier in four-passenger extended cab form with a 6-foot bed, or a five-passenger crew cab body style with a 5-foot or 6-foot bed. It rides a wheelbase of 126.0 or 139.8 inches, stretches 210.2 or 224.1 inches long, and the bed floor is either 59.5 or 73.3 inches long.\n\nThe Frontier\u2019s bed comes standard with four tie-down hooks, and it offers a spray-in liner, a 120-volt power outlet, under-rail lighting, and a track system with two cleats.\n\nIn the cab, the Frontier is less than dressy, with numerous hard-plastic surfaces. While the front seats have good space, both cab styles have tight rear-seat space. With 33.2 inches of rear legroom, the crew cab will fit a pair of adults for short trips, but the double cab\u2019s 26.8 inches of legroom means it\u2019s best used for packages.\n\nHow big is the Toyota Tacoma?\n\nThe Tacoma comes as a two-passenger extended-cab with a 6-foot bed or a five-passenger crew cab with a 5- or 6-foot bed.\n\nFront-seat space is plentiful, and the bucket seats are comfortable. It also has good small-items storage, including Molle pockets on the doors and center console. The extended-cab, which Toyota calls an Xtracab, substitutes small storage compartments for rear seats. The crew cab, or Double Cab in Toyota-speak, has 33.7 inches of rear legroom, slightly more than the Frontier. Those rear seats sit rather upright, and the seat bottoms fold up for more storage space.\n\nThe Tacoma\u2019s long bed has a 73.5-inch floor, and the short bed is 60.3 inches long, both slightly longer than the Frontier\u2019s bed. The extended cab body style is 213.0 inches long and rides a 131.9-inch wheelbase. The crew cab with the short bed has the same dimensions, but the crew cab with the long bed is 226.2 inches long and has a 145.1-inch wheelbase. All those figures are greater than the Frontier\u2019s.\n\nEvery Tacoma but the base model comes standard with a rail system with four tie-down cleats. Also available are LED bed lighting and a bed storage box. Toyota also offers numerous bed accessories, including bed liners, a bed extender, and tie downs.\n\nAdvantage: Tacoma for more space inside and in the bed.\n\n2025 Nissan Frontier 2025 Nissan Frontier 2025 Nissan Frontier 2025 Nissan Frontier\n\nFrontier vs. Tacoma styling\n\nFrontier has a blocker exterior\n\nTacoma has a chunkier interior design\n\nBoth incorporate screens well inside\n\nThe Frontier and Tacoma represent two takes on the same theme. Both are influenced by their full-size counterparts. In both cases, these trucks have styling that\u2019s clearly inspired by full-size trucks.\n\nThe Frontier is slightly blockier, with pronounced upper character lines that read as extensions of the fender flares below them. A lower character line on the doors teams with the flares to suggest a Coke-bottle shape. A high, upright grille leads into rectangular headlights that add more shape with their available flourishing LED light signatures. Pro models get their own grille and a taller ground clearance, and Nissan offers exterior packages including a take on the 1980s Hardbody look.\n\nThe Frontier\u2019s interior is all business with the modern convenience of a sizable center screen. The controls are large and easy to reach. Nissan offers any interior color as long as it\u2019s black (well, charcoal).\n\nOver at Toyota, the grille is similarly bold but it doesn\u2019t rise up as high into the hood. The flanks feature more angular wheel flares, and a lower character line rises from each front wheel well then falls toward the rear. The look is similarly upright and purposeful.\n\nInside, the Tacoma has a chunky look, with big dials, and blocky details. It\u2019s also mostly black, though body color trim is also available. It sports two digital screens, and the center screen pops out of the center stack rather than being more integrated. Toyota\u2019s big screen is 14.0 inches while the Frontier\u2019s is 12.3 inches. Plastic surfaces abound here, too.\n\nAdvantage: Draw.\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma 2024 Toyota Tacoma 2024 Toyota Tacoma 2024 Toyota Tacoma\n\nFrontier vs. Tacoma safety\n\nNeither truck has full crash-test scores\n\nBoth have a good set of standard safety features\n\nHow safe is the Nissan Frontier\n\nThe Frontier has middling and incomplete crash-test scores, with five out of five stars from the NHTSA in the side crash test but only three stars in the rollover test. From the IIHS, it gets a mix of \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cAcceptable\u201d IIHS scores that don\u2019t earn it an award from that organization. However, Nissan outfits it with lots of standard safety features, including automatic emergency braking front and rear with pedestrian detection, blind-spot monitors, lane-departure warnings, rear cross-traffic alerts, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, and rear parking sensors. A surround-view camera system is also offered.\n\nHow safe is the Toyota Tacoma?\n\nThe IIHS has yet to crash test it, and in limited NHTSA testing it received three stars for frontal crashes and five stars for side crashes. It comes standard with automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high beams. Blind-spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alerts, front and rear parking sensors, and a surround-view camera system are available either on higher line models or as options.\n\nAdvantage: Draw.\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma\n\nWhich is better: Frontier or Tacoma?\n\nThe Tacoma wins here with a TCC Rating of 6.3 out of 10 compared to 5.5 out of 10 for the Frontier, even though Toyota's no longer the most reliable car brand.

The Tacoma is a more modern truck, with more interior technology, an available advanced suspension, and an available hybrid powertrain. It also has a larger and more varied lineup, though the Frontier appeals for price (in some versions) and can do just as much or more work than the Tacoma. We recommend the Toyota, but we understand if the Frontier is more in your budget.\n\nWinner: The Tacoma.",

            "content": "What sort of fuel economy can you expect with the 2025 Toyota 4Runner?\n\nWe\u2019ve been putting Toyota\u2019s all-new, sixth-generation 4Runner through its paces off the pavement in Moab (including against the Land Cruiser) and on the Ike Gauntlet. We also put it up against our \u201ccheap\u201d Jeep Warngler Sport, and Tommy gave a general update on the ownership experience after its first couple weeks in the TFL fleet. In today\u2019s video, we\u2019re taking a closer look at one element of the most impactful pieces of that experience over the long-term: fuel economy.\n\nYou see, while the 2025 Toyota 4Runner has undergone a host of styling and technological updates \u2014 and after 15 years of fifth-generation models, it\u2019s high time we finally get a complete overhaul \u2014 but a lot of the conversation has centered around its new powertrain. Instead of a almost bombproof 4.0-liter V6, Toyota\u2019s introduced a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine to the lineup, with and without hybrid assistance. That\u2019s been one of the most contentious parts of the launch, since it\u2019s a seismic change from the automaker\u2019s old approach of fitting large, naturally aspirated engines to something (relatively) unproven.\n\nWith 278 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque on tap, the downsized engine makes better power, obviously thanks to forced induction. With an equally-new 8-speed automatic transmission, the 4Runner can also make better use of what power is available, or manage better fuel economy thanks to having more ratios at its disposal than the absolutely ancient, but decently bombproof, 5-speed automatic.\n\nThe new 4Runner hybrid model sandwiches an electric motor between the engine and transmission. That allows for limited electric driving capability and more power, with the overall output bumped up to 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. Despite the added grunt and being a hybrid, its EPA rating is just 23 mpg, so you\u2019re slightly better off for fuel economy sticking with the standard engine, at least on paper. (We\u2019ll also test the hybrid 4Runner when we have the opportunity.)\n\nAccording to official EPA figures, the 2025 Toyota 4Runner should do markedly better than it\u2019s forebear \u2014 not that it faces a high bar in the first place. The old model managed 16/19/17 City/Highway/Combined mpg, while the new 4Runner (with the standard engine, mind you) should get 19/25/21 City/Highway/Combined. Apart from just having the new engine, Toyota also fitted a massive air dam below the front bumper to aid aerodynamics. It doesn\u2019t exactly make this sixth-gen SUV into a wallflower, but will it actually help on a longer-distance MPG run?\n\nThat\u2019s what Tommy aims to find out in the video below. We\u2019re running our Denver 100 MPG loop, which mostly runs at highway speeds around the Denver metro area (with a bit of mixed driving on surface streets), to see how different vehicles perform. Check out how it does, then watch another video below the MPG run for a broader take on the new 4Runner as a whole:",

            "content": "Honda Motor will begin sourcing hybrid vehicle batteries from Toyota\u2019s U.S. plant in a strategic shift to protect its supply chain from new tariff policies under President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies, according to reports from NikkeAsia.\n\nStarting in fiscal 2025, Honda will procure batteries from Toyota\u2019s $14 billion North Carolina facility, which is set to begin shipments in April. The agreement will provide batteries for roughly 400,000 vehicles annually\u2014enough to power all of Honda\u2019s hybrid sales in the U.S. The move comes as Honda braces for potential tariffs that could significantly increase costs for Japanese automakers exporting to the U.S.\n\nSign up for CBT News\u2019 daily newsletter and get the latest industry stories delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nOn March 4, the U.S. imposed an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China, following a previous 10% tariff in February. President Trump has also signaled plans to raise tariffs on auto imports from Japan to 25%- a sharp increase from the current 2.5%. If enacted, the tariffs could cost Japanese automakers operating in the U.S. an estimated $20 billion in additional levies, affecting a wide range of companies, including hybrid batteries.\n\nHonda, which has traditionally sourced batteries from Japan and China, is now restructuring its supply chain to mitigate these risks. The company has already shifted production of its next-generation Civic hybrid from Mexico to Indiana to avoid potential tariffs. Additional plans include moving some production from Canada and Mexico to the States, which could save Honda roughly $4.7 billion annually in tariff costs.\n\nFor Toyota, the partnership with Honda offers significant benefits. Toyota aims to increase the share of electrified models\u2014including hybrids\u2014in its North American sales from 40% in 2024 to 80% by 2030. Adding Honda as a battery client will help the automaker offset the massive investment in its North Carolina battery plant by increasing production volume and reducing costs.\n\nFurthermore, Hybrid vehicle sales in the U.S. are growing as demand for EVs slows. S&P Global Mobility projects that U.S. hybrid sales will reach 4.12 million units by 2030\u20142.5 times higher than in 2024\u2014accounting for 25% of all new car sales. Honda has already seen hybrid sales climb, with 308,000 hybrid vehicles sold in 2024, making up 22% of its U.S. sales. The company aims to increase global hybrid sales, excluding China, by 50% from 2024 levels to 1.3 million units by 2030.\n\nThe broader auto industry is also adjusting supply chains in response to shifting U.S. trade policies. For instance, General Motors recently scaled back EV production at its northern Mexico plant, while Stellantis suspended operations at its Ontario facility and reopened a closed factory in Illinois to manufacture midsize pickup trucks.\n\nAs automakers navigate the changing landscape, Honda\u2019s collaboration with Toyota underscores the industry\u2019s push to secure domestic supply chains and minimize financial risks amid uncertain trade policies.",

Radius, formerly known as Schnitzer Steel, operates more than 100 sites across 25 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and parts of Western Canada.\n\nThe purchase price for the deal is roughly $907 million, according to a release from Toyota Tsusho. The buyer expects to complete the deal in the third quarter of this year.\n\nToyota Tsusho plans to invest in Radius' business in North America, including its electric arc furnace mill in McMinnville, Oregon. Radius processed about 4.5 million long tons of ferrous recycled metal and 334,000 long tons of nonferrous recycled metal in 2024.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFounded in 1906, Radius is the second largest independent recycler in the U.S., according to investor materials from Toyota Tsusho. The company is focused on recycling end-of-life vehicles and metal scrap to manufacture recycled steel products like rebar. It also resells used car parts through its Pick-n-Pull used parts division.\n\nThe deal comes as U.S. manufacturers have grown increasingly wary of tariffs\u2019 impact on material prices, including for steel. Metal recyclers are seeing higher scrap metal prices and larger product orders in this environment, experts say.\n\nRadius Recycling reported revenue of $2.74 billion in August 2024, down from a high two years prior of $3.49 billion. Its stock price similarly reached a high in 2022 before following a multiyear decline to the present day. The value of Toyota Tsusho's acquisition will be a 115% premium on Radius' stock price as of market close on March 12, which was $30.\n\n\"We are excited to have reached this agreement with TTC,\" Radius Chairman and CEO Tamara Lundgren said in a statement. \u201cLike Radius, TTC is a proven leader in metals and automotive recycling services and solutions, and we look forward to enhancing and expanding our offerings as part of their larger organization while continuing to drive our strategy forward.\"\n\nToyota Tsusho said the deal would allow it to expand its circular economy strategies for materials. The company has had sustainability goals for decades and pursued alternative uses for materials like automobile shredder residue generated during the disposal process, which is otherwise destined for disposal.\n\nToyota Tsusho plans to harness Radius' collection network to expand its ability to supply automotive manufacturers with \"green steel\" made from recycled metal. It also anticipates increasing its collection volume of precious metals from catalytic converters and creating a closed loop recycling platform for batteries.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to collaborating with Radius, whose position as one of North America\u2019s leading recycling companies aligns with our efforts to holistically improve recycling across the supply chain,\u201d Ichiro Kashitani, president and CEO of Toyota Tsusho, said in a statement, adding that the company aims to \u201camplify and grow Radius\u2019 robust networks and integrated operations.\u201d",

Securing Honda as a buyer will already help Toyota cut costs as it ramps up output.\n\nToyota plans to ramp up electrified vehicle (EV, PHEV, and hybrid) sales in North America from around 40% last year to 80% by 2030.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs are already causing havoc, with nearly every automaker warning that they put the US further behind. Overseas automakers are not the only ones feeling the heat, either.\n\nThe \u201cBig Three,\u201d GM, Ford, and Jeep maker Stellantis all build vehicles in Canada and Mexico. GM cut output at its plant in Mexico in January, where the electric Chevy Equinox, Blazer, and Honda Prologue are made. Stellantis halted operations at its Brampton Assembly Plant in Canada last month, where it was expected to launch the Jeep Compass EV production. What\u2019s next?\n\nFor Toyota, it looks like its $14 billion bet to build batteries in the US is already paying off. Now, we just need it to introduce more EVs.\n\nAfter unveiling three new electric SUVs in Europe last week, including the updated bZ4X, Toyota hinted more is on the way for the US. Check back soon for updates.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you want to see more Toyota EVs in the US, like the new C-HR+? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",

Honda sold 308,000 hybrids in the U.S. in 2024, accounting for 22% of its overall sales, so this would effectively cover all of its hybrid-battery needs for this market, Nikkei noted.\n\n2025 Honda CR-V\n\nHonda has been sourcing batteries for its hybrid models from Japan and China, but is looking for alternatives to avoid current and potential tariffs, the report said. On Mar. 4 Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, on top of a 10% tariff imposed a month earlier. Trump is also expected to raise tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 2.5% to 25%.\n\nBatteries for Honda hybrids could be produced at Toyota's new plant in North Carolina, announced in 2021, that's scheduled to come online this year. In 2022, still during early days of work on the factory, Toyota announced a $2.5 billion expansion to add EV battery manufacturing capacity. In February the automaker also indicated it would shift a $1.5 billion battery order to an LG plant in Michigan to keep it afloat after General Motors backed out of an investment in the plant.\n\n2025 Honda Accord\n\nHybrids will likely do the heavy lifting in getting Toyota to its goal of having \"electrified\" vehicles\u2014including EVs, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles\u2014account for more than 50% of its U.S. sales this year. Honda has already seen hybrids grow to half the sales mix for some popular models like the Accord sedan as it looks to potentially outpace all but Tesla in U.S. EV production with a ramp-up scheduled to begin later this year at its Ohio manufacturing hub.\n\nHonda is looking to shift even more production to the U.S., as well as rejigger supply chains, to avoid 25% reciprocal tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, which it estimates could cost around $4.7 billion annually, according to Nikkei. The automaker is also looking to further improve its hybrid tech, although their will be less need for it in the U.S., in the near term at least, if Trump follows through on plans to lower emissions standards.",

            "content": "Ferrari\u2019s latest flagship, the F80, arrives in the next couple of years with a staggering 1200 hp output. That\u2019s nearly two Enzos worth of Maranello-born prancing stallions, and with active aerodynamics and suspension, it\u2019s sure to be wickedly quick. But behind all that technology and power, the F80 is, at heart, powered by a hybrid V-6. Try going back in time and telling someone from 2004 that the then-new second-generation Toyota Prius would have something in common with the Ferrari that\u2019s supposed to fill the shoes of the F40.\n\nBut if it was a Toyota engineer you spoke to, perhaps they wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Nor would they be shocked to learn that both McLaren and Lamborghini offered mid-engined cars with hybridized powertrains, and Porsche had figured out how to hybridize even the turbochargers in its 911. And if you started telling this fictional engineer about the five times in a row that Toyota has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans, he might even start looking a bit smug. Called it. Told you so. We even built it.\n\nItaldesign\n\nThis is the Toyota Alessandro Volta, a concept car that presaged the coming of the hybrid supercar era over two decades ago. Possibly you can see a little of the GR86\u2019s lower valence, but this certainly didn\u2019t look like anything else in the Toyota range when it was rolled out at the Geneva Motor Show. Imagine parking this scissor-doored three-seater between a beige Highlander and an anonymous silver Lexus RX400h and pointing out that all three shared the same basic powertrain. At that point, at least, hybrids weren\u2019t supposed to be fun. They were supposed to save fuel and also kinda be boring to drive\u2014and much of the time, they still are. But the Volta proved that wasn\u2019t going to always be the case.\n\nToyota wasn\u2019t first to enter the U.S. market with hybrid power\u2014that was Honda with the funny little Insight. These lightweight two-seaters are pretty fun looking machines, but a bit more of a science project than a rational car. By contrast, the first-generation Prius was a practical four-door, and if it made sounds like a gasoline-powered dishwasher and accelerated like a half-tranquilized tortoise, it did at least deliver on fuel economy.\n\nThe second-generation Prius was better resolved but hardly exciting. It made a good taxi cab or sensible commuter, an efficient hatchback with a complex drivetrain that didn\u2019t require you to spend one second thinking about what was going on under that truncated hood. Put in fuel, get good mileage, rinse, and repeat.\n\nWith a reputation for green motoring making the Prius popular among the Hollywood set, it didn\u2019t need to be exciting to drive. However, hybrid versions of other Toyota products represented an additional expense over the standard models (that RX400h was the top of the range at the time), so Toyota figured it would show that hybrid power was both sensible and potentially thrilling. The call went out to Italdesign.\n\nItaldesign had done some design work for Toyota before, notably the original Lexus GS sedan. However, what was wanted in this case was the firm\u2019s expertise with mid-engined cars: the AMC AMX/3, the Maserati Boomerang, BMW\u2019s production M1 and Nazca C2 concept. At the tail end of the 1990s, Italdesign had debuted a series of W12-powered Volkswagen supercar concepts, one of them fitted with all-wheel-drive. Toyota wanted something similar, but with hybrid power.\n\nThings kicked off with the most powerful Toyota hybrid powerplant then available, the 3.3-liter V-6 from the Lexus RX400h. As fitted to the crossover, combustion engine and electric motor combined for a fairly dozy 268 hp. For Toyota\u2019s would-be hybrid supercar, electric motors were mounted on the front and rear axle, and the V-6 placed amidships, functioning as a power unit rather than directly driving the wheels.\n\nItaldesign\n\nTotal power now up reached 402 hp, not far off a contemporary 911 Turbo. Even better, the practicalities of mounting twin electric motors meant no driveshafts were needed, so the floor of the car could be very low, and weight and complexity was reduced. Despite being nearly five times as powerful as a Prius from the same year, the Alessandro Volta was over a hundred pounds lighter. In fact, it was lighter than even the modern GR86 is now.\n\nPart of that feathery weight was due to Italdesign\u2019s use of carbon fiber throughout, as you\u2019d expect from a supercar concept. But the battery pack was kept small at just 154 lbs, and mounted up front for better balance. Racing-style pushrod suspension and double wishbones had the potential for great handling characteristics.\n\nThe name, Alessandro Volta, came from the eighteenth century Italian inventor of the electric battery. Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta was a pioneering chemist of noble birth, and he was one of the earliest to experiment with static electricity and also discovered methane. For his work, the standard unit for electric potential, the volt, was named after him.\n\nItaldesign Italdesign Italdesign Italdesign\n\nA fitting title, then, for an electrified supercar. And the Volta was lightning quick too, capable of 0-60 in around four seconds and a theoretical top speed of 155 mph. At just over 2700 lbs, it was many hundreds of pounds lighter than the 911 Turbo, yet still offered four-wheel grip and plenty of electric torque.\n\nFurther, in a typical concept flourish, Italdesign took advantage of the drive-by-wire setup allowed by a hybrid drivetrain to give the Volta an incredible party piece. The three-seater layout sat on a completely flat floor, and the steering wheel and pedal box could be slid in front of any of the seats. It could be left-hand-drive, right-hand-drive, or center steer. You could theoretically drive from the U.K. to France and just switch the driving position based on country.\n\nItaldesign Italdesign\n\nEven more tantalizing are the details that would happen years later in Japan\u2019s Super GT series. There, a privateer team actually entered a racing Prius in the GT300 class. The car was heavily reworked, with a Toyota-sourced 3.4-liter engine driving the rear wheels, but it was still a hybrid using Toyota road-car parts. More than just an experiment, it managed several podiums and a win, and was tremendously popular with the crowds. Who doesn\u2019t want to see a Prius beat a Lamborghini on the racetrack?\n\nSo possibly, with a little further development, the Alessandro Volta might have worked as an actual road car. After all, Honda did eventually build its second-generation NSX as a hybrid, and while that car might not have been a wildly commercial success, it is technologically impressive.\n\nItaldesign\n\nAnd the Volta may yet get its day in the sun. Lexus is currently working on a followup to the mighty V-10-powered LFA, possibly called the LFR. Prototypes have been spotted testing at the Nurburgring, and the powertrain appears to be based around a hybridized V-8, possibly turbocharged.\n\nPurists, of course, would probably have a lighter first-generation NSX over a later hybrid one, or possibly a stripped-down MR2 with V-6 power. But to get to that bleeding edge of the performance envelope for a roadcar these days, a hybrid is what\u2019s required. Everyone, even Ferrari, knows it now. But Toyota guessed it first.",

The bZ4X compact SUV received a facelift and more power, the Lexus RZ luxury SUV gained an F Sport variant and steer-by-wire technology, and the tiny FT-Me concept signaled Toyota's intention to expand electric mobility to a wider audience. At the same event, Toyota declared plans to launch three more new EVs in Europe by 2026, including one pickup truck and an SUV that may be an electric Land Cruiser.\n\nToyota\n\nToyota didn't provide any details about the three EVs coming in the next two years, but a teaser image with silhouettes gives us a sense of what to expect. We'll start on the right, with an SUV that features a boxy profile and a distinctive dip in the roofline at the rear. This silhouette appears to be incredibly similar to the Land Cruiser Se concept that was revealed in 2023. Toyota released minimal information about the Land Cruiser Se at the time, other than that it featured three rows of seats, had an electric powertrain, and was nearly 10 inches longer than the hybrid Land Cruiser.\n\nIn the middle is clearly a pickup truck, and Toyota has hinted at its desire to launch an EV truck multiple times. In 2023, Toyota showed the EPU concept, but that compact truck's stubby shape doesn't match this teaser. Instead, it is likely an electric version of the Hilux, Toyota's global mid-size truck offering. The United States has its own mid-sizer (the Tacoma) and showed an electric truck concept back in 2021 that ultimately previewed the styling of the current Tacoma. We wouldn't be surprised if the underpinnings of an electric Hilux ended up being shared with an electric Tacoma to minimize costs.\n\nToyota\n\nThe final SUV (on the left) is a bit of a mystery. The sleeker front end and lower, wagon-like roofline is reminiscent of the current Crown Signia. This could be a production version of the bZ Large SUV concept shown in 2021, which we originally thought might be called the bZ5X, although Toyota is moving away from the \"bZ\" naming scheme.\n\nLexus will also gain two more electric models in Europe following the updated RZ. There were no hints at what these might be, but several Lexus EV concepts were also shown in 2021 that could indicate what's coming. One was an electric sedan that had design cues that echoed the compact IS sedan, and there was also a three-row SUV. The production models will likely take on some of the cues seen on the 2023 LF-ZC concept and LF-ZL concept.\n\nIt isn't clear which, if any, of these models will come to the United States, but we wouldn't be surprised to see a production version of the Land Cruiser Se and an electric truck make an appearance stateside. More information should arrive within the next year.\n\nYou Might Also Like",

Everyone (at least, those who live on the World Wide Web) can\u2019t get enough the 2025 Camry, which, for this year, is a hybrid only.\n\n(Last-minute note: There is currently a recall on 2025 Camry cars for a defective rear seatbelt. Other Toyotas are also being recalled for similar issues.)\n\n\u201cPeppy, efficient powertrain, balanced ride and handling, comfortable well-built interior\u2026\u201d Those are just some of the nice things that U.S. News and World Report has to say about the 2025 Camry, which ranked it Number 1 for Hybrid Cars.\n\nThis fully-redesigned Camry has so much going for it, it\u2019s almost easier to say what\u2019s wrong with it: limited rear seat headroom and an engine that can drone on a bit when pushed. Other than that, truly, fasten your seatbelts and drive.\n\nThis small-to-midland sedan starts at around $28K (check local dealer lots for excess inventory) and gets an average 43 city / 51 highway. It comes in cheaper than close competitors Honda Accord hybrid and Honda Civic hybrid.\n\nFront-Wheel Drive is standard; if you want All-Wheel Drive (which you really should have), you will need to go up the food chain from the base LE trim to the XLE or the XLS trim (which is what I tested, pictured here).\n\nNavigation and technology on this Camry are truly a slice of birthday cake. The center screen is more than a foot long (measured diagonally), and for those (like me) who want physical buttons and dials, they are all there, right underneath the touchscreen. Pairing your devices will be much easier than setting up your Commodore 64 was, even if you did get it fully-loaded, ready-to-go from Radio Shack.\n\nThis really is a great sedan that you should test-drive (and I do mean get in the car and see how your arse feels). \u201c[There is] just enough athleticism and style to make it not boring; It\u2019s a great pick for a midsize sedan, according to Edmunds.com.\n\nEconomic hardships will continue, and now, unfortunately, the entire world may get in on the depression that started here in the colonies.\n\nOf course, I want you to have a new car and enjoy the touch and thrill of having all that fresh-off-the-factory-floor feeling. But I also realize that your Hus-Bear and your wallet may have you leaning toward a used vehicle. Click here for a good guide from Consumer Reports on how best to shop for a used car, and please note, you will have to stay awake and with your guard up when getting anywhere near a used vehicle.\n\nCall me crazy, but after seeing a rash of White House missteps, like the ban on gender-affirming healthcare being ruled unconstitutional, I am feeling a bit more optimistic about our Bear future. Yet, I do feel that everything will get tougher before it gets better, as evidenced by the Trump tariffs that will raise car price by as much as $12,000 US.\n\nThis is what people who voted for a convicted felon get, and much like in school, we will all suffer because of the few who did not care about anyone else, including themselves.\n\nAnd all because most who voted could not trust nor respect one of the most qualified public servants in history, who just happens to be Black and a Woman.\n\nLet this be a lesson, boys: There are women in your life who can make it better. Much better.\n\nDo not let your opportunity to gain from their knowledge and courage evade you.",

I'm sharing my experiences with new vehicles after living with them for a few days or revisiting them after a few months.\n\nCar of the week: The 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser SUV, the brand's oldest truck nameplate. I wrote about it last April.\n\nWhat it is: The 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser is a full-size four-door, five-passenger SUV with a standard hybrid engine and four-wheel drive. Toyota\u2019s Land Cruiser dates to 1958. The new model that debuted as a 2024 model got a hybrid engine and shares its basic engineering with the Tundra and Tacoma pickups and 4Runner SUV.\n\nHow much you'll pay for the Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nPrices start at $56,700. The Land Cruiser FE model I tested stickered at $75,430. Prices exclude $1,395 destination charge.\n\nHow's it selling?\n\nToyota sold 29,113 Land Cruisers in 2024.\n\nWhat I liked most the first time I drove a Land Cruiser\n\nIn a brief off-road test last year, the Land Cruiser's hybrid drivetrain proved very capable on steep, unpaved trails. Available off-road features include locking rear and center differentials and disconnecting front stabilizer bar. The Land Cruiser\u2019s tidy proportions make it manageable on trails and easier to park than larger SUVs like the Chevy Tahoe and Ford Expedition.\n\nIn case you missed it: Toyota teases smaller, cheaper compact EV SUV\n\nLand Cruiser competitors\n\nChevrolet Tahoe\n\nJeep Grand Cherokee\n\nFord Expedition\n\nNissan Armada\n\nWhat I love about this Toyota now\n\nThe Land Cruiser looks ready for any adventure. It\u2019s loaded with advanced features for off-roading, but is still a comfortable daily driver \u2015 even over uneven pavement. The passenger compartment is roomy and well-appointed, with controls that combine physical buttons and dials with a 12.3-inch touch screen and virtual assistant. Other goodies include an available JBL audio system. It's a delightful full-size SUV, though prices rise fast as you add features.\n\nWhat could be better about this Toyota SUV?\n\nDespite its fuel efficiency, the 2.5L turbocharged hybrid power plant needs premium gasoline to achieve its rated power and fuel economy. That will make it more expensive to run than the V6 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which runs fine on regular, per EPA estimates.\n\nApple CarPlay refused to work a few times during my test, despite initially connecting easily.\n\nThings I\u2019m not sure about the Land Cruiser\n\nThe Land Cruiser's size and price get very close to Toyota\u2019s 4Runner SUV, which is new this year, and slightly longer than the Land Cruiser, Toyota\u2019s flagship SUV. Does Toyota need two SUVs so similar?\n\nKey features of the Toyota Land Cruiser SUV\n\nSeats five\n\nRear- or four-wheel drive\n\nStandard hybrid power: 326 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque\n\n6,000 pounds towing\n\n2.4L turbocharged engine, Eight-speed automatic transmission\n\nEstimated fuel economy: 22 mpg city/25 highway/23 combined.\n\nContact Mark Phelan: 313-222-6731 or mmphelan@freepress.com.

            "content": "Independent artist Theottle imagined a fully electric Toyota bZ86 sports car study.\n\nThe concept uses GR86 proportions while integrating Toyota\u2019s EV styling language.\n\nIt has been imagined with a 338-hp dual-motor setup, offering over 326 miles of range.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of chatter about the expanding future of Toyota\u2019s GR lineup, which is expected to include an array of high-performance sports cars ranging from a new Celica and MR2 to the next Supra and even a GR supercar. While many of these machines will be powered by traditional gasoline engines and hybrids, an independent digital artist has introduced a completely electric twist to the mix.\n\nEnter the Toyota bZ86, a fictional creation by digital artist Theophilus Chin. The idea behind the this coupe study is to retain the sporty proportions of Toyota\u2019s current GR86, but with an entirely new, electrified twist.\n\nMore: These Are All The Future Sports Cars Coming From Toyota GR\n\nDespite borrowing the GR86\u2019s general shape, the bZ86 adopts a completely different design language. In keeping with its electric nature, Chin took inspiration from the recently revealed Toyota CH-R+ crossover and the facelifted bZ4x, resulting in a sleek, futuristic look.\n\nAt the front, the electric sports car features a hammerhead-like nose, flanked by sharp headlights and wide bumper intakes. The side profile is aggressively sculpted, with a bi-tone finish on the roofline and side skirts adding a touch of flair. And, of course, the oversized charging port on the front fenders leaves no doubt\u2014this coupe needs to be plugged-in.\n\nA Familiar Rear with a Fresh Twist\n\nThe rear of the bZ86 borrows heavily from the CH-R+ crossover, with its full-width LED taillights and sloping rear glass. While the plastic cladding on the rear bumper may not be to everyone\u2019s taste, it\u2019s balanced out by the addition of a sporty diffuser. That said, the placement of the license plate holder could use a little more subtlety.\n\nMore: Mazda Inline-Six Rumor For New GR Supra And RX-7 Sounds Too Wild To Be True\n\nSince this is purely a digital concept, there are no hard specs to go on. However, the dual-motor setup from the C-HR+, which puts out a combined 338 horsepower (252 kW / 343 PS), could easily serve as the basis for an electric equivalent of the GR86. Pair that with the crossover\u2019s 77 kWh battery pack, and you could expect a range north of 326 miles (525 km) in a more aerodynamic coupe form.\n\nDespite the cool factor of the project, Toyota Gazoo Racing has no plans of introducing an electric sportscar \u2013 at least in the near future. The truth is that most buyers will be better off with the upcoming gas-guzzling Celica, MR2, GR86, and GR Supra, temporarily leaving the concept of electric mobility to the hands of family-focused SUVs.\n\nWhile the bZ86 is an undeniably cool proposal, Toyota Gazoo Racing has no plans to bring an electric sports car to life\u2014at least not anytime in the near future. For now, most enthusiasts will have to do with gasoline-powered options, such as the upcoming Celica, MR2, GR86, and GR Supra, leaving the world of electric mobility to Toyota\u2019s family-friendly SUVs.",

Built as either a sedan or 5-door wagon, the Altezza never actually made it to the US \u2014 at least, not badged as a Toyota. Rather, the US equivalent is the first-generation Lexus IS (codename XE10), more specifically the IS 200 and IS 300, designating the engine displacement of either 2.0L or 3.0L. Other than some minor details, the Altezza and IS remain identical in almost every other way, with both models featuring the same platform, general bodywork, and mechanical underpinnings. And, of course, its distinctive taillights, which gave rise to the \"Altezza lights\" fad of the mid 2000s where people fit clear acrylic housings to their car's taillights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd let's not forget about the other clear distinction between the JDM and USDM models: the name. The word \"Altezza\" is actually Italian, meaning \"height or nobility.\" In the context of the language, \"altezza\" translates more closely to a phrase like \"highness\" or \"important stature,\" and as such, it reflects a vehicle of higher status. This also fits right in with the brand image of Lexus, being a marque closely associated with luxury vehicles. The reason for this naming difference comes down to the brand of Lexus itself. Unlike in US markets with both Lexus and Toyota coexisting, Lexus never actually had a presence in Japan until 2005, hence the need for Toyota to market the car as a Toyota despite its more luxury appeal. Many Lexus models followed this trend, such as the Lexus LS becoming the Toyota Celsior, for example. As for the Altezza, it remains one of the most criminally underrated JDM tuner cars ever produced. Let's check out some basic facts about this platform and why you might see one or two in the US today.\n\nAdvertisement",

This extra energy source can generate 20 to 30 kilometers of additional range per day. In this way, there\u2019s minimal need for external charging and even daily usage. Aside from that, the Toyota microcar with solar panel roof is lightweight and features an efficient propulsion system. The latter allows the concept vehicle to consume \u2018three times less energy per kilometer than a high-capacity battery electric car,\u2019 the company says.\n\nThe FT-Me is suitable for individuals with entry-level driving licenses. In some countries then, drivers as young as 14 years old can take the concept electric Toyota microcar with a solar panel roof on a city getaway. The interiors are modular and customizable as well. In fact, the passenger seat can fold down and offer more storage space for a wheelchair to fit in. The large windows allow for 360-degree visibility, so the driver can see what\u2019s happening around them as they go. The vehicle also integrates connectivity. In this way, the driver can pair their smartphone and use it to enter the vehicle without needing a physical key.\n\n\n\nall images courtesy of Toyota Motor Europe\n\nConcept vehicle that occupies only half a parking space\n\nThe all-electric microcar FT-Me of Toyota Motor Europe is ideal for congested and urban areas. It accommodates two people, including the driver, and measures less than two and a half meters in length. The company says it\u2019s easy to maneuver, especially in dense environments. It also occupies only half a parking space and can fit into a third of a space when perpendicular parking is available. The frame of the Toyota microcar with solar panel roof is geometric. In fact, the team draws its design from a jet helmet, hence having a black and white bi-tone exterior.\n\nThe styling choice lets the concept vehicle be visible on the road, even at night. Inside, the FT-Me maximizes the available space within its compact frame. The layout is designed for efficiency, ensuring ease of movement and intuitive access to controls. Toyota Motor Europe says it builds the concept microcar with solar panel roof on the company\u2019s mobility solutions. These are the ones they developed for the Tokyo 2021 and Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. They aim to meet the changing needs of city residents with a compact, efficient, and accessible mode of transport.

As a result, if the bolts are loose, the seats might not stay in place as they\u2019re supposed to in a crash, which could put passengers at risk.\n\nToyota has reported that it found the issue with the bolts during a routine check. During testing, it was found that, in a case of a collision, the seats may not adequately support the passenger, and it will be more likely for an injury to occur to anyone occupying the rear.\n\nThis issue traces back to a defect at the factory of a specific supplier, when the Sienna was revamped for the 2021 model year. Toyota revamped the minivan to include a hybrid powertrain and improved looks, so it could be a strong contender for awards like The Car Connection\u2019s Best Car to Buy 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s safety first, so this is why the recall has to be done\n\nToyota puts the number of recalled Siennas with this problem at just 1%, but they\u2019re not taking any chances. For the Japanese carmaker, it is safety first, so they\u2019re attempting to fix all of the vans that might be affected as a precautionary measure.\n\nToyota has confirmed that it will send formal letters to owners of the affected Siennas starting 31 March 2025.\n\nOwners who receive this letter can take it to a Toyota dealership, where bolts will be checked and tightened if needed\u2014at no cost to the owner. Toyota has also said that those owners who discovered or experienced this issue earlier on and paid to have it fixed will be eligible for a reimbursement from the company.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure if your car is included in the recall, you can call Toyota\u2019s customer service at 1-800-331-4331 and ask. The reference number for the recall is 25TA05.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Toyota\u2019s first recall\n\nToyota recently recalled over 106,000 of its 2024 and 2025 model year Tacoma pickup trucks. The issue there was the rear brake hoses, which are prone to being damaged and leak brake fluid. Leaking brake fluid generally makes it harder to stop a car, which is a pretty serious safety issue. The fix for this issue was free brake hose replacement at dealerships.\n\nThe Tacoma recall happened only weeks prior to the Sienna recall, and therefore it was one of the newest Toyota safety campaigns. Toyota has assured its customers that it is keeping its vehicles under constant surveillance and responding in a timely manner to potential safety issues.\n\nOther recalls in the past year\n\nToyota has had a number of other recalls in recent years:\n\nSeptember 2024: Over 43,000 Sequoia Hybrid SUVs were recalled because their tow hitches were not adequately secure.\n\nwere recalled because their tow hitches were not adequately secure. November 2024: Around 8,000 2023 and 2024 Corolla models were recalled due to a steering shaft issue. Some shafts had hairline cracks that would spread over time, causing the driver to lose control of the steering.\n\nToyota\u2019s approach to safety\n\nRecalls are a hassle, but they are extremely necessary to address factory issues before they become actual hazards on the road.\n\nOne of the most deadly automotive factory faults in history was the 2004 Saturn Ion. It was only in 2014 that General Motors discovered that it had a faulty ignition switch that could lead to a sudden loss of power and disable safety systems like airbags.\n\nMeanwhile, prior to this, the defect was linked to over 100 fatalities.\n\nFor owners whose vehicles are part of a recall, it\u2019s always better to move fast.",

For those considering the Ranger or Tacoma, though, which is the better choice?\n\nRanger vs. Tacoma prices and features\n\nBase Ranger costs about $34,500\n\nBase Tacoma costs about $1,000 less\n\n4WD adds at least $3,200 to either\n\nBest picks: Ranger XLT, Tacoma SR5, Tacoma TRD Pro\n\nHow much is a Ford Ranger?\n\nFord offers the Ranger in XL, XLT, Lariat, and Raptor models. The base Ranger starts at about $34,000, and comes standard with cloth seats, vinyl floors, power features, an 10.1-inch touchscreen, and cruise control.\n\nIt rolls on 17-inch alloys.\n\nFour-wheel drive adds about $3,500. Toyota charges $3,200 for its four-wheel-drive system.\n\nWe\u2019d move up to the XLT 4x4 for about $40,000. It adds blind-spot monitors, wireless smartphone charging, remote start, and LED bed and interior lighting. It also comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as satellite radio hardware.\n\nThe $45,120 Lariat has power front seats, 10-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound, a surround-view camera system, twin 12.0-inch displays, and adaptive cruise control. At the peak of performance, the $56,960 Ranger Raptor gets Lariat gear plus a slew of mechanical upgrades as well as a towing package.\n\nAll Rangers carry a basic 3-year/36,000-mile warranty.\n\nHow much is a Toyota Tacoma?\n\nToyota offers a wider range of models for the Tacoma. The models include the SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, Limited, and TRD Pro.\n\nThe base Tacoma costs about $33,000. It includes cloth upholstery, power features, and an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Four-wheel drive costs $3,200 more and the crew cab/short bed combo adds $2,200.\n\nWe like the $39,195 4x4 SR5 Double Cab with the long bed\u2014or the TRD Sport, which for about $48,800 gets the hybrid drivetrain and a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, as well as options for a sunroof, cooled synthetic leather seats, and a towing package.\n\nThe $65,985 TRD Pro and its off-road hardware also come with a 14.0-inch touchscreen, heated and cooled front seats, 18-inch wheels, and premium audio.\n\nThe Tacoma has the same warranty as the Ranger, but Toyota includes two years/24,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance.\n\nAdvantage: Toyota Tacomas price out lower\u2014but the wicked Ranger Raptor has no direct rival.\n\n2024 Ford Ranger Raptor 2024 Ford Ranger Raptor 2024 Ford Ranger Raptor 2024 Ford Ranger Raptor\n\nRanger vs. Tacoma performance\n\nThe Tacoma now offers hybrid performance\n\nThe Ranger has a strong turbo-4 or turbo-6\n\nThe Ranger outpoints in towing and payload\n\nThe Tacoma\u2019s base 2.4-liter turbo-4 and its 228 hp offer plenty of power for a midsize truck, whether equipped with the 8-speed automatic or the 6-speed manual. They\u2019re a massive upgrade over the puny 159-hp inline-4 in the last-gen Tacoma. An uprated version of the engine checks in at 270 to 278 hp; it\u2019s offered in higher-spec trucks. Though it clatters with diesel-like noise and vibration, it\u2019s teamed (mostly) with a whip-smart automatic transmission and great throttle and brake tuning.\n\nWith a hybrid motor and battery system grafted on, the Tacoma makes 326 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque, great for towing and off-roading applications\u2014but in the end, not a huge differentiator in fuel economy, which peaks at 23 mpg combined.\n\nThe base Ranger comes with a 2.3-liter turbo-4 that makes 270 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque, which bests the base Toyota engine. It also uses a more modern 10-speed automatic transmission that shifts smoothly but can hesitate to find the perfect gear. A 2.7-liter turbo-6 spins out 315 hp but 400 lb-ft, a boon to those who need to tow. The Raptor\u2019s twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 throws off 405 hp, enough to vault it to the top of the ranks among all these trucks.\n\nThe Ranger can also tow 7,500 pounds, beating the Tacoma by 1,000 pounds in its optimal configuration. And it has a trailer-backup assist that works like a video game. The contest is closer in payload capacity, where the Ranger can haul up to 1,805 pounds in its bed, while the Tacoma tops out at 1,710 pounds.\n\nBoth trucks use rear leaf springs and solid rear axles that create choppy rides in lower-end models. The Ranger\u2019s improved Raptor suspension doesn\u2019t relieve the trucky feel of the other versions\u2014but Toyota swaps in coil springs and a multi-link rear suspension on all Double Cab versions for a much more composed ride.\n\nAdvantage: Ranger for power, but the Tacoma Double Cab rides more smoothly.\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter 2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter 2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter 2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter\n\nRanger vs. Tacoma off-road and 4x4 systems\n\nThe Tacoma has more off-road-oriented models\n\nThe Ranger Raptor has landed\n\nBoth have part-time four-wheel drive available\n\nThe Ranger offers a part-time four-wheel-drive system and a pair of packages for those who want to go off-roading. The Raptor gets a full-time setup with a 2-speed transfer case. It also has Fox shocks, 17-inch wheels with 33-inch all-terrain tires, electronic locking differentials front and rear, and a Watts link rear suspension with coilovers for better body control at Baja speeds. So blessed, it\u2019s an amazing, entertaining off-road specialist\u2014quicker than anything in the Tacoma family.\n\nThe Tacoma also offers a simple part-time four-wheel-drive system, as well as three off-road-focused models and a full-time system on its hybrid Limited editions. Additional off-roading equipment includes a locking rear differential, several traction control modes, and a low-speed crawl feature that keeps the truck moving in a controlled manner in tight or steep off-road situations.\n\nThe TRD-Off-Road sports 11.0 inches of ground clearance, 32-inch all-terrain tires, and an available sway-bar disconnect setup. The TRD Pro gets its own more substantial skid plates, a taller ride height, and its own Fox shocks, along with Mud, Dirt, and Sand drive modes\u2014while the Trailhunter can be fitted with a longer pickup bed, the slow-going rock crawler to the TRD Pro\u2019s higher-speed off-road cruiser.\n\nAdvantage: Toyota Tacoma for variety, the Ranger when in Raptor spec.\n\n2024 Ford Ranger 2024 Ford Ranger 2024 Ford Ranger 2024 Ford Ranger\n\nRanger vs. Tacoma size, bed space, and seating\n\nRanger has more rear seat space\n\nTacoma offers longer, larger bed\n\nFord offers only one bed length\n\nHow big is the Ford Ranger?\n\nThe Ranger comes only as a five-seat crew cab with a 5-foot bed. Inside, it\u2019s marginally larger than before, with almost one more cubic foot of space. It\u2019s fine in front, with softly padded seats and good small-item storage that includes a dual glovebox on top editions and deep door pockets on all. In the rear, the vertical seatbacks and a narrow body limits its utility for those five passengers. Four will do better, and with 34.6 inches of rear-seat legroom they fare a little better than they might in the Tacoma.\n\nThat bed has gained some interior width: it\u2019s now 48.2 inches so that it can carry plywood sheets. While it doesn\u2019t have a trick tailgate like its F-150 kin can, the Ranger\u2019s tailgate builds in a ruler and bottle openers, and the bed has six clamps and fender steps for utility.\n\nHow big is the Toyota Tacoma?\n\nIt can be had either as an extended-cab or as a crew-cab truck, with a 5-foot or 6-foot bed, depending on the model. The front seats in both versions have more than enough space\u2014and the passenger space has been laid out in much more comfortable proportions. The old Tacoma legs-out seating position is long gone. Seat comfort in front has improved and small-item storage ranges from dash-mounted storage bings to door and console Molle pockets.\n\nHowever, the rear seat in the Tacoma\u2019s extended-cab Xtracab is best left to dogs or packages. Double Cabs fare much better, with 33.7 inches of rear legroom, but that\u2019s slightly less space than in the Ranger. The rear seatbacks still have a more vertical angle than we like, but fold up to create more usable storage thanks to a longer wheelbase.\n\nThe Tacoma\u2019s 6-foot bed actually measures in at 73.5 inches of interior length; the 5-foot bed overperforms as well, with 60.3 inches of space. The Tacoma offers the usual host of accessories, from bed liners to power outputs\u2014as well as a quick-release tailgate feature.\n\nAdvantage: Tacoma.\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma 2024 Toyota Tacoma 2024 Toyota Tacoma 2024 Toyota Tacoma\n\nRanger vs. Tacoma styling\n\nRanger has slightly softer styling\n\nTacoma more squared off and upright\n\nBoth go all-in on big digital displays\n\nIn both cases, these trucks have styling that\u2019s clearly inspired by full-size trucks.\n\nThe Ranger has slab sides and curved wheel flares like the F-150, but it\u2019s more restrained with some curves in place of blockier elements. It\u2019s gone all-in, though, on the bigger truck\u2019s C-clamp headlights and grille. Inside, the Ranger has a new dash with big digital displays and a no-fuss grade of interior materials.\n\nMeanwhile, the Toyota is blockier, with more angular body panels and a much chunkier stance than before. Leaning on the brand\u2019s vintage HiLux trucks, the new Tacoma gets a tall front end with a blocky grille and lots of overstated details. Somehow, it all works\u2014better than the interior, we think, which has chunky control dials and big digital displays, but lapses in its most expensive models into very artificial-looking plastic trim.\n\nAdvantage: The Tacoma.\n\nRanger vs. Tacoma safety\n\nThe IIHS gives the Tacoma a Top Safety Pick award\n\nThe Ranger earned a low three-star rollover rating from the NHTSA\n\nAutomatic emergency braking comes standard on both\n\nHow safe is the Ford Ranger?\n\nThe Ranger performed poorly in the NHTSA\u2019s rollover crash tests, earning three stars that sunk its overall rating to four stars. It comes with automatic emergency braking, automatic high beams, and active lane control. Adaptive cruise control, a surround-view camera system, and blind-spot monitors can be fitted to some models\u2014but not Ford\u2019s adept BlueCruise hands-free driver assistance.\n\nHow safe is the Toyota Tacoma?\n\nThe Tacoma earns a Top Safety Pick award from the IIHS, but the NHTSA hasn\u2019t checked in on it.\n\nToyota outfits every Tacoma with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, active lane control, and automatic high beams. Blind-spot monitors and a surround-view camera system are options where not standard on some trims.\n\nAdvantage: The Tacoma.\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma\n\nWhich is better: Ranger or Tacoma?\n\nLast year\u2019s close race has become a romp for the Tacoma. We give the Ranger a TCC Rating of 5.5 out of 10\u2014but the Tacoma scores a 6.3 out of 10. (Read more about how we rate cars.)\n\nWhy? The Ranger has good interior space and strong powertrains, but only one bed size and less comfortable seats. The Tacoma offers more off-road variety, vastly improved interior comfort, and hybrid powertrains.",

            "content": "Toyota\n\nEarly Wednesday morning in Europe, Toyota unveiled four new or significantly updated electric vehicles \u2014 and Lexus managed to sneak one in, too. Even more enticing than the new product, though, was the teaser that came along with it: a shadowy image that previewed an upcoming electric pickup truck and electric Land Cruiser-esque EV while suggesting both would be revealed by the end of 2026.\n\nThe biggest downside to this teaser \u2014 apart from the shadows obscuring the images \u2014 is that Toyota specifies the vehicles in it are destined for the European market, offering no word on U.S. availability. Toyota didn\u2019t provide model names for the teased vehicles either (although Toyota Motor Europe director of marketing and product development Andrea Carlucci did tell Autocar that the automaker will use \"familiar\" names from \"current cars\" for its upcoming EVs), and while the pickup gives the impression of being Tacoma-sized, it doesn't match the silhouette of what Toyota previewed as the electric Hilux years ago.\n\nThe SUV to the right of the pickup, however, is more easily identified as the Land Cruiser Se revealed in 2023. Its proportions are virtually identical to that concept, but Toyota is leaving us with just as few details today as it did with the car\u2019s initial debut. For now, we know that it will be a European debut, and its future presence in the U.S. is unclear.\n\n\n\nToyota bZ4X\n\nToyota\n\nAs for the new EVs Toyota fully revealed, let\u2019s start with the refreshed bZ4X. The big update in this mid-cycle refresh are new electric motors making significantly more power. Toyota\u2019s dual-motor version goes from a paltry 215 horsepower to a strong 343 ponies, while the single-motor version sees a 23-horse increase up to 224 hp. Battery updates see the model add a preconditioning function for better winter charging performance and a new 22 kW AC charger for faster home charging.\n\nToyota tweaked both the exterior and interior designs, though the differences are minimal with the biggest change being a new design for the center console that now houses two wireless phone chargers. Lastly, Toyota promises better driving dynamics and less cabin noise thanks to suspension improvements. Sadly, however, it's sticking with its unusual name.\n\nLexus RZ\n\nLexus\n\nThe Toyota\u2019s Lexus cousin is the RZ, and it enjoys a thorough update that focuses even more on driving performance and engagement. Notably, Lexus is introducing something it calls Interactive Manual Drive; like the system in the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, it simulates an eight-speed paddle-shifted transmission and provides feedback via replicated engine sounds and visuals in the form of a \"shift guide meter\" (which sounds a whole lot like a tachometer). Torque output is calculated to correspond with that of a combustion engine, and there\u2019s even a \u201crev limiter\u201d you can run into if you don\u2019t shift.\n\nLexus\n\nThe RZ also gets more powerful, with up to 408 horsepower for the new RZ 550e F Sport model. This model also enjoys unique styling and a retuned suspension for sportier handling. Meanwhile, the whole lineup is treated to both rigidity improvements and AWD system enhancements. Lexus previewed its steer-by-wire yoke system years ago, but says it\u2019s finally coming to the market with this update, too.\n\nBattery pack (now a 77 kWh unit) and electric system upgrades enable a range increase of up to around 62 miles, depending on the model. Plus, the same preconditioning update and AC charging speed increase to 22 kW as seen on the bZ4X apply to the RZ.\n\nToyota C-HR+\n\nToyota\n\nNext up is the fully-electric Toyota C-HR+ that sits just below the bZ4X, coming in about six inches shorter. One look at its styling sure makes it seem like a chip off the bZ4X\u2019s block, though, and its specs suggest the same. Two battery pack options \u2014 a 57.7 kWh and 77 kWh \u2014 are available, and you can choose between either front- or all-wheel-drive versions. Output is the same as the bZ4X, and its charging specs mirror the larger SUV, too, with DC fast charging maxing out at 150 kW. Even the interior looks the same as the bZ4X with the same odd cluster positioning and identical console/center stack arrangement. Like these last three cars, though, don\u2019t expect to see the C-HR+ EV in America.\n\nToyota Urban Cruiser\n\nToyota\n\nThe Toyota Urban Cruiser is an extra-small SUV, and is a totally new model this year. It shares the bZ4X\u2019s penchant for excessive body cladding, and its size is most similar to that of a Yaris Cross Hybrid, Toyota says. The Urban Cruiser is built on a new EV-dedicated platform and offers two battery pack options, the basic one being 49 kWh and the upgrade being 61 kWh.\n\nBoth FWD and AWD are available, with the dual-motor AWD version offering up 184 horsepower. You even get a Trail Mode and Downhill Assist Control with the AWD version. Tech is plentiful, too, as the Urban Cruiser gets both a 10.3-inch digital cluster and 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment.\n\nToyota FT-Me Concept\n\nToyota\n\nThe last Toyota to know about from today is the FT-Me concept. It\u2019s a two-seater designed for folks with entry-level driving licenses in Europe, allowing people as young as 14 to legally pilot it. Toyota says it features a solar panel system that can supply as much as 18 miles of range in a day. (Of course, that would require city dwellers to park in areas that see a lot of sunlight, which isn\u2019t always super-common in dense urban environments.) The FT-Me is also designed for accessibility, as it can be driven purely via hand controls on the steering wheel.\n\nYou Might Also Like",

The move will enable Toyota to meet stricter emissions regulations in both road car and motorsports applications.\n\n\u201cWe can use hybrid for future cars,\u201d Yamada is quoted as saying. \u201cThis technology we create we will apply to both motorsports and passenger engines.\u201d\n\nToyota GR Yaris M prototype\n\nThe 2.0-liter turbo-4 was announced in January during the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, with Toyota revealing it in a mid-engined GR Yaris prototype that rumor has it could be an early test mule for a potential modern-day MR2 sports car. A modern Celica may also be a recipient for the engine.\n\nAccording to Autocar's report, the engine features a compact, lightweight design thanks to a shorter piston stroke, and both mild hybrid and plug-in hybrid configurations are supported\u2014with outputs as high as 400 hp possible. Timing for the engine's market launch, whether as a sole power source or forming part of a hybrid setup, is unknown.\n\nGR is also thought to be developing an electrified V-8 engine for a new sports car that will likely end up marketed as a Lexus. This sports car has already been spotted testing and is expected to hit the market next year.",

And it doesn\u2019t even seem weird!!\n\nIs that really a thing? I often fell asleep in cars as a kid, but I had to propel myself to bed once the family got home. Have a great evening, everyone.",

Toyota is hinting that EV versions of the popular pickup and SUV could be coming to the US.\n\nIs Toyota launching Tacoma and 4Runner EVs?\n\nToyota took the spotlight this week in Brussels, unveiling three new electric SUVs set to arrive in Europe by the end of the year.\n\nAlthough the event was heavily focused on its European lineup, we are learning a little more about what to expect in the US.\n\nFor one, Toyota unveiled the new bZ4X. In its first major refresh since launching in 2022, the electric SUV now has more range, faster charging, dedicated EV features, and a new look inside and out.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nAlthough US specs were not revealed, the new Toyota bZ4X has a bigger 73.1 kWh battery, providing up to 573 km (356 miles) WLTP driving range. On the EPA rating system, it\u2019s expected to see around 270 to 280 miles range, up from 252 miles in the 2025 bZ4X.\n\nToyota\u2019s new bZ4X AWD model (Source: Toyota)\n\nDuring the event, Toyota\u2019s chief branding officer, Simon Humphries, stressed the company\u2019s focus on creating \u201cever-better\u201d cars specifically tailored to buyers in the region.\n\nIn Europe, Toyota is launching the new bZ4X, C-HR+, and Land Cruiser electric SUVs.

The 4Runner was its third best-selling SUV (92,100), behind the RAV4 (475,200) and Corolla Cross (93,000).

            "content": "Toyota is the world\u2019s largest automaker by sales and enjoys a strong reputation with American consumers. But the brand\u2019s first mainstream electric vehicle (EV) in the U.S. has not been met with buyers\u2019 usual enthusiasm.\n\nThe Toyota bZ4X suffers from a low range (just 252 miles in its longest-range version) and slow charging times, limiting its appeal. That may get much better for the 2026 model year.\n\nToyota hasn\u2019t officially revealed the 2026 bZX for American consumers yet. However, the brand raised the curtain on the version Europeans will get at an event in Brussels this week. Historically, the company sells virtually identical models on every continent. So, we anticipate the changes in store for Europe heading stateside soon.\n\nNew Battery Tech\n\nThe headline is a new set of batteries from a new supplier. They\u2019re technically smaller but more energy-dense, so they should boost the car\u2019s range at every trim level. They\u2019re also capable of charging faster.\n\nEurope and the U.S. use vastly different calculations to predict the range of electric vehicles. European formulas tend to predict much longer ranges. In Europe, Toyota claims the 2025 bZ4X is good for up to 320 miles. The 2026 model, they say, will get 356.\n\nA similar 11% boost in U.S. ratings would increase the car\u2019s range to 280 miles, which is more competitive. However, with 300-plus mile ranges becoming common, that would still leave Toyota\u2019s entry with a competitive problem.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, owners wouldn\u2019t have to wait so long to recharge it. Toyota has finally added battery pre-conditioning, a system that can make charging much more efficient. Toyota claims \u201ca development target of rapid charging in approximately 30 minutes under cold conditions.\u201d\n\nNew Motor Tech\n\nThe company also says the 2026 bZ4X will get new motors (\u201ceAxles,\u201d in Toyota\u2019s term). Single-motor models currently boast 201 horsepower. If they follow the Euro example, that figure should jump to 221.\n\nDual-motor, all-wheel drive (AWD) editions will jump from 214 hp to 338. That would likely make it the quickest compact SUV Toyota builds, exceeding even the 302 hp of the RAV4 plug-in hybrid.\n\nWe expect to learn whether the changes will come to the U.S. model shortly, but we\u2019d be surprised to see Toyota build a less powerful, lower-range model for the U.S. market.",

            "content": "However, besides technology, there are some business models that also allow for strong profitability and cash flow. First, there are energy leaders who are literal cash cows and generate tens of billions of dollars annually from energy operations, which are vital to the world economy and are unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon. Second, there is the financial sector, and particularly banks, which are considered the blood of the world economy \u2013 by intermediating operations worth trillions of dollars annually, the leading banks can capture a tiny share of those transactions, which overall results in giant amounts of net profit. Last but not least, some of the most profitable companies in the world can be found even in more competitive sectors like consumer discretionary.\n\nIn the last decade, the most profitable large cap stocks have mostly clustered in the technology sector, leveraging such factors as the giant global total addressable market and wide margins allowed by the technological advantage. Furthermore, some of these companies took the center of the stage during 2023-2024, a time when the AI megatrend opened a new growth frontier and led to rising stock market concentration; in other words, the most profitable companies became even more profitable. This trend has resulted in a widening gap between the leading tech giants and other sectors, as investors increasingly flock to these high-growth stocks, anticipating continued dominance and innovation.\n\nThe most profitable large-cap stocks, in terms of absolute net profit, are typically concentrated in industries with relatively high barriers to entry and substantial global demand. These include sectors like technology, healthcare, energy and consumer goods, where leaders can benefit from strong market positions, innovation and economies of scale. Furthermore, strong profitability usually translates very well into cash flow, which gives a lot of flexibility with capital allocation \u2013 the companies can either reinvest in growth during favorable times or support the stock price through repurchases when the market is less favorable. Consequently, the advantages of investing in such companies include stability, the potential for consistent revenue growth, and resilience during economic downturns.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) stands against other most profitable large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe believe that the most profitable companies can enter the spotlight again at a time when the US and global economy are at an important crossroads. Not only are these companies immune to tariffs and less sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, interest rates, and consumer health, but they also generate tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow every year, which gives them flexibility to adjust to a new regime. Investor sentiment has shifted to a pronounced bearish, as the US stock market officially entered correction mode, with more than a 10% contraction since the February peak. It appears that the fears of Trump tariffs staying for the long-term, as well as the negative impact on GDP growth from major cuts in public funding, are finally hitting the markets. Going forward, as smaller-cap stocks are pressured by uncertainty and deteriorating consumer confidence, profitable large caps can become safe havens and attract capital. The key takeaway for investors is that if one wants to stay invested in the US equity market amid the current turbulent times, they\u2019re better off sticking to the widest moat and most profitable names out there.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of most profitable large cap stocks, we searched for the publicly traded companies with the largest amount of net income generated in the latest financial year and ranked them accordingly. For each company we also include the number of hedge funds that own the stock, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) the Most Profitable Large Cap Stock to Buy Now?\n\nWorkers assembling a car in a modern manufacturing plant, emphasizing the company's sense of progress.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 13\n\nLast year net income: $33.50 billion\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) is a global automotive manufacturer that designs, produces, and sells passenger vehicles, trucks, and hybrid and electric vehicles. Its product lineup includes popular models under the Toyota and Lexus brands, with a strong presence in hybrid technology through its Prius and other electrified vehicles. TM operates worldwide, with manufacturing plants and sales networks across multiple regions. The company is involved in vehicle electrification, hydrogen fuel cell technology, and autonomous driving research, and also provides financial services, including vehicle financing and leasing, to support its global customer base. The Japanese company ranked seventh on our recent list of 7 Cheap Global Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)\u2019s financial performance reflects successful improvement efforts, including price revisions, controlled incentives, and expanded value chain profits. The company\u2019s success is attributed to recovered and stabilized production levels, continuous maintenance of high product strength through \u201cever-better cars\u201d manufacturing and coordinated regional activities leading to customer satisfaction. TM has increased its investment in human resources and growth areas to 830 billion yen this fiscal year, focusing on workplace environment improvements and work style reforms. Significant strategic developments include the establishment of a new BEV and battery development facility in Shanghai, with planned production capacity of 100,000 units and 1,000 new jobs after 2027. Additionally, Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina (TBMNC), representing a $14 billion investment with 5,000 planned jobs, will commence battery shipments in April, strengthening the company\u2019s multi-pathway strategy through local production.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) emphasizes that these financial results stem from customer support, with a focus on mass-producing smiles and happiness for customers through engaged employees, suppliers, and dealers working with purpose and enthusiasm. Management remains committed to active investment in people and growth areas to ensure continued development with all stakeholders. With more than $33 billion net profit in 2024, TM is one of the most profitable large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nOverall, TM ranks 8th on our list of most profitable large cap stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of TM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

This model blends the best of a wagon and an SUV, and offers a choice between a hybrid or a plug-in hybrid powertrain.\n\nWith the launch of the Crown Estate in Japan, the full Toyota Crown lineup is now complete, adding to the Crossover, Sport, and Sedan models. Of all these variants, the Estate is probably the one you\u2019ll actually want if practicality is your thing. Measuring 194.1 inches (4,930 mm) long, 74 inches (1,880 mm) wide, and 64 inches (1,625 mm) tall, it sits comfortably between the RAV4 and Harrier in Toyota\u2019s Japanese lineup\u2014think of it as the \u201cmiddle child\u201d of the bunch.\n\nMore: Toyota Debuts Surprise Crown Crossover Four-Door Convertible One-Off\n\nVisually, the Japanese-spec Crown Estate closely mirrors the design of the US-spec Crown Signia, featuring the signature hammerhead-style front. The only noticeable difference is the absence of amber indicators and the rear badging.\n\nInside, you\u2019ll find a familiar digital cockpit with dual 12.3-inch displays and a steering wheel adorned with the Crown emblem. The SUV offers a five-seater layout and a 570-liter (20.1 cubic feet) boot. For even more space, the rear bench can fold flat, expanding the cargo capacity to 1,470 liters (51.9 cubic feet).\n\nFurthermore, an optional pull-out deck chair and table make it more suitable for outdoor activities, especially when combined with the available soft luggage mat. Keep in mind, though, that these camping-friendly features aren\u2019t available for the US-spec Crown Signia. The same goes for the sporty body kit and eye-catching 21-inch wheels by Modellista, which are offered as optional extras in Japan.\n\nThe color palette offers five solid options, plus five two-tone finishes. The exclusive Precious Metal and Massive Gray combo is available only on the Crown Estate PHEV, paired with distinct 21-inch alloy wheels. Inside, Toyota presents three upholstery choices: Black, Saddle Tan, and a nostalgic Grayish Blue with vintage-style cloud patterns.\n\nPHEV Option With 302HP and 55-Mile EV Range\n\nAs with the rest of the Crown lineup, the Estate rides on the TNGA-K architecture, featuring adaptive variable suspension and Dynamic Rear Steering for greater comfort and maneuverability. However, unlike the Crown Signia, which is exclusively available with a self-charging hybrid system, the Crown Estate offers the option of a more powerful plug-in hybrid setup.\n\nMore: Toyota Working On Mystery Electric Pickup\n\nBoth the HEV and the PHEV powertrains feature a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter gasoline engine aided by dual electric motors offering all-wheel-drive (E-Four). The ICE alone produces 188 hp (190 PS) in the hybrid and 174 hp (177 PS) in the plug-in hybrid. The front electric motor offers approximately 50% more power compared to the Crown Crossover and Crown Sport, generating 180 hp (182 PS), while the rear electric motor is good for 53 hp (54 PS), for a combined output of 302 horsepower.\n\nThe big difference is that the plug-in hybrid is equipped with a larger 51 Ah lithium-ion battery allowing up to 89 km (55 miles) of EV-only range, according to the WLTC standards. The battery pack is mounted under the floor so interior space over the HEV is not compromised.\n\nFuel efficiency is pretty solid, with Toyota claiming 47 mpg (5 lt/100 km) for the HEV and 47.75 mpg (4.9 lt/100 km) for the PHEV.\n\nThe Toyota Crown Estate is already available for order in Japan, with the hybrid version starting at \u00a56,350,000 ($42,900). The plug-in hybrid comes in at \u00a58,100,000 ($54,700). For reference, the US-spec Toyota Crown Signia (HEV) starts at $43,590.\n\nToyota",

The new bZ4X now has a bigger battery for more range, faster charging, dedicated EV features, a stylish facelift, and much more. Here\u2019s our first look at the new Toyota bZ4X.\n\nToyota unveils new bZ4X with significant improvements\n\nThe bZ4X launched in 2022 as Toyota\u2019s first fully electric SUV. Although it was expected to rival the Tesla Model Y and other top-selling electric SUVs, the bZ4X failed to live up to the task.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that we experienced a few bumps in the road during the launch,\u201d Toyota\u2019s chief branding officer, Simon Humphries, said during the company\u2019s premiere event in Brussels this week.\n\nToyota listened to feedback from drivers, retailers, and journalists who experienced the bZ4X and delivered with the upgraded model.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nThe new electric SUV has more driving range, up to twice as fast charging, and double the towing capacity. But, that\u2019s not all. The bZ4X has been updated inside and out. The interior is completely redesigned with a new 14\u2033 infotainment and instrument display panel.\n\nToyota\u2019s new bZ4X AWD model (Source: Toyota)\n\nToyota finally added a battery pre-conditioning feature as standard. For the first time, Toyota said the bZ4X can now fast charge in around 30 minutes in cold weather. Maximum DC charging power is still 150 kW.\n\nA new route planning function that automatically selects the best charging station is also included. Toyota said the feature is available through an OTA update for current bZ4X drivers.\n\nThe new bZ4X has two battery options, 57.7kWh and 73.1 kWh. The smaller battery will be available exclusively in FWD while the larger battery has FWD and AWD configurations.\n\nWith up to 338 hp (252 kW), the upgraded AWD model is one of the most powerful Toyota vehicles in Europe. Its towing capacity has doubled to 1,500 kg.\n\nCombined with an upgraded eAxle, the new long-range bZ4X has a WLTP driving range of up to 573 km (356 miles). That\u2019s a significant improvement from the outgoing model\u2019s range of up to 516 km (320 miles).\n\nAlthough US specs have yet to be revealed, the 2025 bZ4X is rated with up to 252 miles on the EPA rating scale. When it arrives in the US, you can expect to see upwards of around 270 to 280 miles.\n\nToyota will launch the updated bZ4X in Europe later this year, one of three new EVs arriving by the end of 2025. The smaller Toyota C-HR+ and Urban Cruiser electric SUVs will join the updated model in Toyota\u2019s growing European EV lineup.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nThis evening, I was scrolling through the \"2016 Thru 2023 Toyota Tacoma Owners\" group on Facebook and came across a post by Matt Homol that sparked an intense debate. Matt decided to switch his Tacoma\u2019s oil from the recommended Mobil 1 0W-20 to Royal Purple 5W-30, and his experience was nothing short of game-changing. According to Matt, \"After switching to Royal Purple 5W-30, the difference is night and day. My truck feels more solid, with less slipping off the line, less gear hunting, and an overall quieter tick. Despite what Toyota and the EPA recommend, I think 5W-30 is the way to go for better performance.\"\n\nThe Great Oil Debate: Is Toyota\u2019s Recommendation the Best Choice?\n\nToyota specifies 0W-20 for modern Tacomas primarily because it optimizes fuel efficiency, minimizes internal friction, and ensures proper oil flow during cold starts. This aligns with North American emissions and efficiency regulations. However, Matt\u2019s experience raises an important question, does the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation always equate to the best real-world performance?\n\nRoyal Purple is known for its high-quality synthetic oil formulations, boasting superior protection and better engine performance. Many Tacoma owners, like Matt, have experimented with different viscosities and reported improvements in drivability. The key argument against Toyota\u2019s 0W-20 recommendation is that while it enhances efficiency, it may not provide the best performance under all driving conditions.\n\nWhat Tacoma Owners Have to Say\n\nThis debate didn't go unnoticed in the Facebook group, and several Tacoma owners chimed in with their thoughts.\n\nHunter weighed in with a different perspective, stating, \"Mobil 1 is better than Royal Purple, haha. I run Mobil 1 5W-30, and it\u2019s guaranteed for 20,000 miles. While I still change it every 5,000 miles, I wouldn\u2019t call it trash. I just swapped from their 0W-30, and even after going about 7,000 miles, it was still clear on the dipstick.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Danaan took a more skeptical stance, saying, \"We may disagree on where the buttons should be for the volume on the steering wheel or whether or not you let the gas cap dangle when you fill the tank, but at least we all agree that this is nonsense. It\u2019s a regular hallmark moment. Honestly, I\u2019m glad this post exists. With all the varying points of view here, we can all come together over the fact that this post is simply confidently written misinformation.\"\n\nThen Matt himself provided a more nuanced take, explaining, \"Toyota specifies 0W-20 for its modern engines because it optimizes fuel efficiency, reduces internal friction, and ensures proper oil flow during cold starts, particularly in compliance with North American emissions and efficiency standards. While switching to 5W-30 can provide a thicker oil film at operating temperatures, reducing valvetrain noise and potentially offering slight improvements in wear resistance under heavy loads, it also increases oil pressure and slightly reduces efficiency. The perceived 'solid drive' and reduced gear hunting are likely due to minor changes in VVT-i and timing chain lubrication rather than actual performance gains. Although 5W-30 is used in some global markets, deviating from the manufacturer\u2019s recommended viscosity can impact long-term engine wear, oil pump strain, and warranty coverage, making it a trade-off rather than a clear upgrade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Some Tacoma Owners Are Making the Switch\n\nMany Tacoma owners who push their trucks beyond standard city commuting, whether towing, off-roading, or hauling heavy loads, have found that a slightly thicker oil like 5W-30 provides additional protection and stability. The argument is that while 0W-20 is designed for optimal efficiency, it might not be the best choice for owners who demand more from their trucks.\n\nInterestingly, in certain markets outside North America, Toyota does indeed recommend 5W-30 for the same engines. This raises an important question: Is Toyota\u2019s North American oil recommendation purely based on regulatory compliance rather than performance?\n\nWhat\u2019s the Risk of Deviating from 0W-20?\n\nBefore you rush to swap your oil to a thicker viscosity, it\u2019s important to consider the potential risks.\n\nWarranty Concerns : Using an oil viscosity not specified by Toyota could potentially void your powertrain warranty.\n\n: Using an oil viscosity not specified by Toyota could potentially void your powertrain warranty. Fuel Economy : Thicker oil can create more resistance in the engine, leading to a slight decrease in fuel efficiency.\n\n: Thicker oil can create more resistance in the engine, leading to a slight decrease in fuel efficiency. Cold-Weather Performance : In colder climates, 0W-20 flows better during start-up, reducing engine wear.\n\n: In colder climates, 0W-20 flows better during start-up, reducing engine wear. Oil Pump Strain: Higher viscosity oil requires more force to circulate, which can put additional strain on the oil pump over time.\n\nMore Real-World Tacoma Experiences\n\nSome Tacoma owners are so committed to their trucks that they can\u2019t imagine driving anything else. One owner even stated, \"I am on my second 2024 Toyota Tacoma this year, and I will always own a Tacoma for the rest of my life.\" This level of loyalty speaks volumes about the Tacoma\u2019s reliability and performance.\n\nFor others, choosing the right Tacoma model isn\u2019t so simple. Some have found that the 2023 Tacoma TRD Off-Road left them reconsidering an older model. If newer models don\u2019t deliver the same driving feel as past generations, what does that say about Toyota\u2019s evolving design choices?\n\nAnother common debate is whether to stick with an automatic transmission or go for the classic manual. Many Tacoma enthusiasts find themselves torn between these two options. With the manual offering a more engaging drive and the automatic providing convenience, it\u2019s no surprise this discussion continues.\n\nFor first-time truck owners, the excitement of purchasing a Tacoma can sometimes turn into uncertainty. One owner shared their experience of ordering a 2024 Tacoma and feeling nervous about their decision. These real-world insights help prospective buyers make informed choices.\n\nMy Take on the Oil Debate\n\nAfter hearing all these perspectives, I can\u2019t help but see both sides of the argument. On one hand, Toyota engineers spend years developing these engines and choosing the best oil for efficiency and longevity. On the other, real-world experiences from Tacoma owners suggest that using a slightly thicker oil can yield tangible improvements in how the truck drives. Personally, if I owned a Tacoma and used it for towing or off-roading, I\u2019d be tempted to try 5W-30 to see if it made a difference. However, I\u2019d also keep in mind the risks of straying from manufacturer guidelines. In the end, it all boils down to your driving habits and how much risk you\u2019re willing to take for performance.\n\nYour Turn: What\u2019s Your Take?\n\nNow, it\u2019s time for you to weigh in. Have you experimented with different oil viscosities in your Tacoma? Did you notice a difference in performance, efficiency, or overall feel? Share your experience in the comments below!\n\nAdditionally, do you believe automakers prioritize regulatory standards over real-world performance, or do you think Toyota's recommendations are truly optimal for all drivers?

However, the two-seater electric vehicle for the city is still in the design study stage, but it brings some very interesting ideas to the table.\n\nWith a length of less than 8 feet (2.50 meters), the FT-Me is very maneuverable and easy to park. According to Toyota, it requires only half the parking space of a conventional electric car, and only a third when parked crosswise. The angular, black-and-white design is said to be inspired by a jet helmet, i.e. a motorcycle helmet without the chin guard of full-face helmets.\n\nAccording to Toyota, the FT-Me is ideal for people who have not had their driver's license for long. With the appropriate driving license, the vehicle can be driven from the age of 14 in some markets. The manufacturer promises good all-round visibility, which increases safety in the hustle and bustle of the city and reduces the risk of damage when parking and other maneuvers.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota The first picture of the interior shows a rectangular steering wheel and a channel for placing the smartphone\n\nThe new EV should also have good software and connectivity options. For example, your smartphone replaces the vehicle key and provides access to various functions and services. Another special feature: the FT-Me is controlled and operated exclusively by hand via the steering wheel, and there are apparently no pedals. This means that the vehicle can be used by wheelchair users without any modifications.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Lightened proof image: There are actually no pedals, the speed is probably controlled via sliders on the steering wheel\n\nPredominantly recycled materials are used, which should reduce the CO 2 footprint by 90% compared to today's city vehicles. The electric drivetrain also consumes three times less energy per kilometer than a normal electric car. The solar panel integrated into the roof charges the vehicle with solar energy and provides an additional range of 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 18 miles) per day. Depending on the weather and surroundings, this should even make charging at the socket completely unnecessary.\n\nIn addition to younger drivers and people with physical disabilities, the FT-Me is also aimed at people who want to drive less for environmental reasons, according to Toyota. The automaker is not yet revealing the technical data of the drive and battery or the range.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nThe electric future of Toyota\n\nToyota also revealed a few things about its electric car plans. Toyota plans to introduce six new battery-electric models by the end of 2026. Like the Urban Cruiser and the C-HR+, these will have more traditional names, meaning they will no longer fit into the bZ nomenclature.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Toyota Land Cruiser Se Concept (2023): An off-roader with electric drive\n\nApparently, a production version of the Land Cruiser Se Concept presented in 2023 is in the cards. If it's true to the concept, this familiar off-road SUV gets a futuristic form to go with its electric drivetrain.

And it's this stability that allows us to challenge the future from a position of strength.\n\nNow much of our stability is the result of a mantra that Akio Toyoda instilled in us over a decade ago: \"Ever-Better Cars.\"\n\nIt sounds so obvious that it should go without saying. But some of the most important principles in life are the most simple\u2015and the easiest to take for granted.\n\nIn his own telling, it was purposely fundamental, but also purposely vague. He wanted us, as designers, engineers, and planners, to have the freedom to interpret what \"better\" really means.\n\nAnd over the last 10 years, we, together with Akio and everyone else in the company, have worked to interpret this into reality.\n\nNow if I were to offer an insight into what that actually means, I'd have to say that it all starts with seeing things from the customer's point of view.\n\nIt's about creating aspirational experiences\u2015from the down-to-earth opportunities that the Hilux Champ creates for everyday working people in Thailand, to the redefinition of mobile space that is the Alphard in Japan.\n\nBut it's also about ensuring that our products are honest. Now, I have been in charge of Toyota and Lexus design for quite a few years, and I am often asked, \"Why don't you make all your cars more consistent in the way they look?\"\n\nBut I believe that each car should be an honest representation of its specific concept, or value to the customer.\n\nThe new Land Cruiser finds its truth in its origins: a car that gets you anywhere, but most importantly gets you back again; a design that emphasises the beauty of functionality.\n\nPrius, on the other hand, shows that efficiency can also be sexy.

Its design and craftsmanship draw from all sides of Japanese expertise: from the deepest cultural roots, to cutting edge modern technology.\n\nSo, from Century to Yaris, every customer can choose their car on its own merits, with the feeling that it was designed specifically for them.\n\nAnd in turn, this facilitates an agile approach to product planning, an agility that also applies on a regional level\u2015respect for all our regions is central to creating ever-better cars.\n\nIn China, the bZ3X bZ3C, and the bZ7 are all dedicated models, designed specifically for Chinese customers seeking an oasis in their busy everyday lives.\n\nOr maybe, it's about the unbridled opportunities for recreation in America, with the Tacoma and 4Runner.\n\nAnd to come full circle, here in Europe the Aygo Cross brings funky dexterity to European streets.\n\nWith 380,000 Toyota employees globally, 22 R&D sites, and 69 manufacturing sites all around the world, we respect the cumulative knowledge, experience and culture of all regions. We will always seek to be best in town, wherever that might be.\n\nNow all this adds up to 10 million vehicles from three brands. And each brand has a distinct belief and role, resonating with customers in a broader sense.\n\nLexus is all about discovery. The LF-ZC that I presented to you here last time, is a showcase for technology that enables you to discover an immersive future.\n\nWe hope to push boundaries to create inspirational new experiences for all our customers, and that's a future that begins today, through the steer-by-wire and virtual gear shifting that you'll see in the new Lexus RZ later on.\n\nNow, GR is all about passion. Motorsports pushes our cars and our engineers to the limits, and this translates into authentic race-bred performance for customers. And it's also a development advantage for us as a company.\n\nFinally, the Toyota brand is all about mobility for all. All customers should feel empowered to make the right choice for themselves.\n\nProviding choice and opportunity is at the heart of ever-better cars...and everything we do, and that includes the path to sustainability.\n\nWhich brings me to the elephant in the room\u2015powertrain. Now you've seen this graphic many times before: a full palette of powertrains.\n\nWe don't claim to be original in our way of thinking. The idea that multiple propulsion systems can exist together is as old as the car itself. And as I stand here today, there is still no single answer.\n\nThe breadth of our multi-pathway strategy is all about being ready to address regional needs, as and when they evolve.\n\nWhether it's a new flex-fuel hybrid in South America, a new fuel cell sedan in Japan, or here in Europe three new production B.E.V.s that we will present to you today.\n\nIn 2022, the bZ4X was released. Its drivability, its offroad and snow performance, its packaging, its styling, it presented an opportunity that only a mature automotive company could offer.\n\nBut I think it's fair to say that we experienced a few bumps in the road during the launch.\n\nSo, we went back to time-tested Toyota principles. We listened to our customers, our retailers, and the journalists who were testing our products.\n\nIt wasn't an easy process, but our kaizen, or continuous improvement, paid off. And we are really proud that in Norway, where B.E.V.s are dominant, the bZ4X is currently No.1 in sales.\n\nAnd now, it's getting even better. Ladies and gentlemen, the new, further improved bZ4X...\n\nSo what do you think?\n\nIt's more powerful, it's sportier...And it's not just the looks. Increased range goes without saying. It's also got up to 50% more power, charging times that are up to twice as fast, and double the towing capacity.\n\nThe interior is also completely reworked, including a new 14-inch multimedia display and new software that will ease journey planning, strengthening everything that has made bZ4X a car for an active carbon neutral lifestyle.\n\nAnd our journey today continues with invention. We are inventing a new path together with all our regions, and nothing represents that better than C-HR.\n\nThe original C-HR showed that success can come by surprising customers, and when it was first launched, it caused quite a stir. Born in Europe for Europe, it carved out a new market to become a million unit, best-selling car.\n\nThe 2nd generation continued that innovation, a radical fashion statement that stood out from the crowd for customers who wanted to do the same.\n\nIt is the perfect model to now bring B.E.V. to the core of our portfolio.\n\nNow, the eagle-eyed amongst you may remember that the electric C-HR was first presented by Akio Toyoda at our EV showcase in 2021. I remember Akio saying at the time that it looked like a car with attitude, a car you'd want to get behind the wheel of.\n\nIt's an electric car true to the ever better cars philosophy. And now, with up to 600 km of range, over 340 horsepower, and 0-100 in just 5.2 seconds\u2015all enabled by the eTNGA platform\u2015it's got surprising dynamics, surprising agility, and surprising practicality.\n\nWe believe this is a car that will create the next aspirational experience, one that is truly relevant to the region in which it originated.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the all-new C-HR+...",

            "content": "Brussels, 12 March 2025 \u2013 Toyota Motor Europe (TME) unveils the FT-Me, a groundbreaking concept as a vision for all-electric micromobility that combines premium design with affordability. Inspired by the success of Toyota\u2019s mobility solutions developed for the Tokyo 2021 and Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the FT-Me aims to address the evolving needs of city dwellers and the challenges of modern urban environments.\n\nThe FT-Me is a compact, yet spacious 2-seater vehicle, measuring less than two and a half metres in length. Its design emphasises manoeuvrability, occupying only half a parking space, and even one-third when perpendicular parking is available. The vehicle's styling, inspired by a jet helmet, combines contrasting black and white bi-tone to convey a sense of safety, robustness, and a lightweight, go-anywhere attitude.\n\nThe FT-Me offers accessible mobility for people with entry-level driving licences, including those as young as 14 years old in some markets. Its enhanced versatility is designed to cater to diverse user needs, offering customisable options for both teenagers and professionals and an innovative 360-degree visibility concept ensures maximum eye-contact with other road users, enhancing safety and manoeuvrability. The vehicle is also equipped with advanced connectivity features, allowing seamless integration with smartphones for keyless entry and service provision. The FT-Me can be driven solely by hand commands on its innovative steering wheel which also makes it usable to wheelchair users without any aftermarket modification.\n\nToyota's commitment to sustainability is evident in the FT-Me's design. The vehicle maximises recyclability and uses recycled materials, aiming for a 90% reduction in carbon footprint compared to today's city vehicles. The FT-Me's efficient propulsion system consumes three times less energy per kilometre than a high-capacity battery electric car. Additionally, the FT-Me features leading-edge solar panel roof technology that can charge the main battery, adding 20 to 30 km of range per day in urban settings easily covering the expected daily usage, which depending on the weather, removes the need to plug-in for many users.\n\nThe FT-Me concept embraces Toyota\u2019s \u2018Mobility for All\u2019 philosophy, embracing both younger drivers as well as those wanting to downsize in the changing urban landscape. As cities continue to evolve, the FT-Me provides a versatile, sustainable, and stylish solution, and another step towards creating an all-inclusive mobility ecosystem for people, goods, and services.",

            "content": "It\u2019s unknown if the Toyota C-HR+ electric crossover will come to North America\n\nIt leads the charge of six new EVs for Toyota, including the Urban Cruiser in Europe\n\nToyota also showcased updates to the Toyota bZ4X and Lexus RZ electric crossovers\n\nToyota is responding to calls for EVs with six full battery electric vehicles launching by the end of 2026, in European markets, anyway.\n\nAt a brand overview in Brussels, Belgium, last week, Toyota dropped the sheath on the spearhead of that EV assault, the new C-HR+ small crossover.\n\nThe C-HR+ arrives as a fully electric version that shares only a name with the gas-powered C-HR sold as a hybrid and plug-in hybrid, and whose popularity in Europe helped fuel more than one million units globally in the two generations since it launched in 2016. With its curved roofline and tucked hatch, it looks more like a Lexus, yet it shares much under the smooth skin with the refreshed Toyota bZ4X.\n\nThe updated bZ4X and related Lexus RZ models were also shown, as was the Urban Cruiser small crossover that moves from concept to reality and slots into the B-segment (subcompact) in Europe. A silhouette of the three unannounced forthcoming EVs included a pickup truck, presumed to be an Hilux EV; a larger crossover, quite possibly the Land Cruiser EV that has been showcased in concept form since 2023; and a smaller crossover that may have been previewed by the Sport Crossover Concept in 2023. Any of the three could be the vessel for Toyota\u2019s much-anticipated solid-state battery EV anticipated in 2027.\n\nToyota Urban Cruiser\n\nOnce criticized for its slow, exploratory approach to launching electric vehicles, especially in North America, the world\u2019s largest automaker continues its multi-pathway approach to electrification with hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, and even fuel-cell vehicles as it aims for carbon neutrality in Europe by 2035. The newest EVs are a core part of that strategy. Underpinning its EV strategy is a guarantee that the battery will retain at least 70% of capacity in the first decade of the EV\u2019s life, and the warranty covers eight years or nearly 100,000 miles (160,000 kilometers), while the high-voltage battery is covered for 10 years or 621,371 miles (1 million kilometers).\n\nExpect more info later this spring on what parts of this product launch will come to North America, but here\u2019s what we know about the models launching in Europe this year that may migrate this way eventually.\n\n2025 Toyota C-HR+\n\nToyota C-HR+ electric crossover\n\nThe C-segment entry builds off of the refreshed Toyota bZ4X but ditches the overly styled black gloss plastic panels for a sleeker, smoother, more sophisticated take that looks more like a Lexus. It embraces the curved coupe-like roofline that\u2019s popular in Europe but limited in practicality, trimming rear cargo space to about 14.7 cubic feet. Like the gas model, the rear door handles hide in the window frames, not on the smooth door sides.\n\nEven though it shares a name with the C-HR that\u2019s sold as a hybrid and plug-in hybrid in Europe, it\u2019s built off the e-TNGA platform shared with the bZ4X. It measures about 178 inches long, which is about six inches shorter than the bZ4X.\n\nThe interior could be identical to the new bZ4X\u2019s, with a standard 14.0-inch touchscreen mounted on the dash and with an interface and infotainment system developed in North America. The small-diameter steering wheel bursts with control buttons, yet the steering column is not connected to the recessed instrument cluster that sits nearly at the base of the windshield. Larger iconography and brighter displays promise better visibility.\n\nOutward vision remained a priority, so both screens sit under the cowl, leaving the driver\u2019s line of sight unimpeded.\n\nThe C-HR+ goes on sale with either a 57.7-kwh or 77-kwh battery pack, and a choice of single-motor front-wheel drive rated at about 164 hp or dual-motor all-wheel drive rated at about 338 hp. Toyota says the motors in this second-gen BEV system are designed for more direct power delivery, prompting Yoshihiro Nakata, president and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe, to crow that it\u2019s the, \u201cMost emotional, dynamic crossover we have ever brought to the European market.\u201d\n\nExpect a 0-62 mph of 5.2 seconds, and a range of 373 miles on the generous European WLPT cycle. A 22-kw onboard charger will be optional, and battery pre-conditioning promises quicker DC fast-charge times.\n\nIt goes on sale in select European markets late in 2025, with a full rollout in 2026. Even though the gas model was discontinued in the U.S. in 2022, the C-HR+ is expected to launch in North America in 2026 as either a 2026 or 2027 model year.\n\n2026 Toyota bZ4X 2026 Toyota bZ4X 2025 Toyota C-HR+ 2025 Toyota C-HR+\n\nRefreshed Toyota bZ4X casts a wider net\n\nThe midsize crossover gets modest upgrades for the 2026 model year. A smaller 57.7-kwh battery pack will be offered alongside a 73.1-kwh (gross capacity) pack that has slightly more capacity than the 71.4-kwh pack currently sold in Europe and in single-motor versions in North America.\n\nThe new 57.7-kwh pack comes with front-wheel drive only and a single motor rated at 164 hp. Models with the 73.1-kwh pack come with either front-wheel or all-wheel drive, but the motors now use silicon-carbide semiconductors that boost power output to 221 hp from 201 hp in the single front motor or 338 hp from 214 hp for the dual-motor versions. Suspension tweaks promise to lower noise and vibration levels. Dual-motor models can now tow up to 3,300 pounds, which doubles that of current models.\n\nThe bZ4X has an available 22-kw onboard charger to cut Level 2 charge times significantly, and battery pre-conditioning comes standard and should quicken the pace of DC fast-charging in cold weather.\n\nSlight tweaks to the exterior improve aerodynamics, but a bigger change arrives inside in the form of a standard 14.0-inch touchscreen.\n\n2026 Lexus RZ F Sport 2026 Lexus RZ 2026 Lexus RZ 2026 Lexus RZ\n\nNew Lexus RZ F-Sport and its 8-speed \u201cmanual\u201d\n\nThe related Lexus RZ gets more significant upgrades than the bZ4X. Every RZ now comes with water cooling and a 77-kwh lithium-ion battery pack instead of the current 71.4-kwh pack. A larger 221-hp front motor (from 201-hp) with more efficiency in the inverter, as well as a larger available rear motor (up to 221 hp, from 107 hp) provide greater acceleration and more evenly balanced torque distribution.\n\nThe RZ 350e comes with a 221-hp single motor and front wheel drive; the RZ 500e has dual motors and all-wheel drive with an output of 375 hp; then there\u2019s the 402-hp dual-motor RZ 550e F Sport.\n\nAvailable on mid-grade models and higher, a new steer-by-wire system promises more direct responses and less vibration through the steering yoke. It lacks a mechanical connection to the front axle and turns up to 200 degrees before locking. Exclusive to the F Sport is an \u201cInteractive Manual Drive\u201d with paddle shifters to fake shifts. Engine sounds with a rev limiter and visual cues indicate when a driver should \u201cshift,\u201d and there\u2019s a meter in the recessed instrument cluster that to gauge the shifts of a fake 8-speed automatic.\n\nAll-wheel-drive versions can now tow twice as much as before at 3,300 pounds.\n\nCharging times quicken on the road or at home due to an available 22-kw AC onboard charger instead of the standard 6.6-kw charger. Battery pre-conditioning promises to boost DC fast-charging in cold weather.\n\nAll three models launch later this year in select European markets, with full European rollout early in 2026.\n\nToyota paid for airfare and lodging for Motor Authority to attend its product showcase.",

            "content": "If you\u2019re one of the few people who remember the C-HR that Toyota sold in the U.S. from 2018 to 2022, banish the thought of that too-slow and too-small crossover. The 2026 Toyota C-HR+ represents a radical departure from whatever brand identity still lingers after the demise of the gas-powered penalty box. The resurrected and electrified C-HR should be properly quick with room for a family of four and, unlike its predecessor, the all-important option of all-wheel-drive.\n\nThe C-HR+ also represents Toyota\u2019s much-needed second shot at a modern EV. By incorporating a few lessons learned with the unlovable bZ4X, it should extend the range and speed up charging times. More important, it has the potential to crack the affordability nut that\u2019s choking the entire American EV market right now. We figure the success or failure of the Toyota CH-R+ depends less on the technical specs and more to do with the big (or small) number on the window sticker. We haven\u2019t heard a peep about pricing, but if the C-HR+ lands in the low $30,000 range, it could vault Toyota from electric-vehicle back marker to a legitimate competitor.\n\nThis Is Not Your Kid\u2019s C-HR\n\nAside from the name, the sloping roofline, the rising beltline over the rear wheel, and the rear door handles hidden in the C-pillars, the C-HR+ shares almost nothing with the version that came before it. Thanks to its handsome styling and (what are sure to be optional) 20-inch wheels, the EV looks far more sophisticated and expensive than its predecessor. It also helps that it\u2019s larger. Built on Toyota\u2019s e-TNGA dedicated EV platform, the CH-R+ it measures 4.4 inches longer than the gas C-HR in both wheelbase and overall length. At 180.0 inches from nose to tail, it\u2019s within two inches of the Toyota RAV4.\n\nFaster, Better, Longer\n\nThe CH-R+ is making its debut in Europe, and Toyota hasn\u2019t yet confirmed details for the U.S. market, so some of the numbers and finer points may change before it arrives at American dealers in the first half of 2026. We do know that the CH-R+ shares most of its powertrain components with the updated 2026 Toyota bZ4x. In Europe, Toyota will offer two batteries with 57.7 or 77.0 kWh gross capacity. Front-wheel-drive models make 165 hp when paired with the small battery or 221 horsepower in combination with the larger pack. The hot ticket, of course, is the two-motor, all-wheel-drive version, which Toyota claims will be good for 338 horsepower and a 0-60 time of less than 5.2 seconds. That model will be offered exclusively with the big battery.\n\nToyota\u2019s not talking about range beyond saying the electric C-HR it will do up to 600 kilometers on the European WLTP cycle. Convert that to miles then lop off about 25 percent due to testing differences and we\u2019re estimating the big-battery, front-wheel-drive range king could earn around 270 miles in the U.S.\u2019s EPA test. We\u2019re told new motors are more efficient than what\u2019s currently used in the bZ4x, but interestingly all-wheel-drive models use two permanent-magnet motors and neither one has an axle disconnect. That strange decision suggests Toyota is still learning the basics of EV Design 101. Using one induction motor or an axle disconnect would boost efficiency and range, especially during long-distance highway drives.\n\nDC fast-charging peaks at 150 kilowatts, which is the bare minimum for an EV to be competitive today. The good news is that Toyota has finally implemented a battery preconditioning algorithm, which should shorten charging times, particularly in cold weather. It can be activated manually or automatically when you select a fast-charging station in the navigation system.\n\nSqueeze In and Stretch Out\n\nThe cabin looks like a subtly updated take on the current Toyota bZ4X cockpit. There's a familiar digital instrument cluster plus a larger, standard 14.0-inch touchscreen running Toyota\u2019s ubiquitous Audio Multimedia infotainment system. That screen doesn\u2019t appear that much larger, though, because it now integrates climate controls that, in prior Toyotas, existed as controls separate from the screen. The vehicle Toyota showed us also had dual wireless phone chargers in the tall, conventional center console that would look at home in a combustion-powered car if it weren\u2019t for the rotary gear selector knob. On first glance, the interior materials look and feel nice enough to make us question our price estimate.\n\nThe stretched wheelbase pays off with just enough rear-seat legroom to comfortably accommodate a 6-foot, 3-inch adult, although that\u2019s moot since headroom will be tight for any adult who could reasonably be described as \u201ctall.\u201d The sloping roofline makes for an attractive car at the expense of practicality. While the cargo area is also dimensionally compromised, a 1500-watt household outlet, a JBL subwoofer, and an adjustable-height load floor help elevate the C-HR+ above basic transportation.\n\nIt All Comes Down to One Number\n\nCompared to the 2022 C-HR and the current bZ4X, the 2026 Toyota C-HR+ looks like a solid upgrade. But those foils are some of Toyota\u2019s biggest recent misses. The real test for any new car is how it stacks up against its strongest competitors. We\u2019ll have to wait for more details and seat time before casting those judgments. As we said form the start, what matters most is the price tag. A price around $30,000 would motivate a lot of buyers to overlook range or charging speeds that come up a little short.",

It\u2019s a compact, two-seat, electric micromobility concept that weighs just 425kg and is therefore another light quadricycle. Look out, Citroen Ami. More important than its weight, of course, it its length, and like its adorable new French nemesis, the FT-Me measures less than two-and-a-half metres long. It occupies less than half the size of a standard space. Or less than a third if parked perpendicularly.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nTechnical details are still a little threadbare, but a Toyota spokesperson has confirmed the aim is \u201cat least 100km of range\u201d. That solar panel roof will play a big part in recharging, able to provide between 20-30km back each day. Unless you\u2019re a Londoner, obvs. Top speed? Around 28mph. Again, identical to the Ami. There\u2019s lots of natural light, 360-degree visibility and hand controls, so wheelchair users won\u2019t require heavy modifications to use it.\n\nAnd Toyota\u2019s thought heavily about usability. You can, for instance, remove the passenger seat and make room for your dog. Or a pile of laundry. At the rear is a 1.6m loading bay, and there is a bit of space between the passengers and the boot lid, so the FT-Me could actually serve as a courier vehicle. For pizzas, that is, not exotic tree transportation. There are a few niggles to figure out before this thing can go into production though. The wing mirrors are one; replacing them with cameras is expensive. And so is throwing in an air conditioning unit, and other such mainstream quality-of-life features found in cars. Should Toyota find a way around these problems, it says the FT-Me will target a competitive price point of less than \u20ac300 a month. That's \u00a3252 on this side of the Channel, though Toyota's yet to confirm if it'll be coming here.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nSo, Ami vs FT-Me. Who ya got over the most adorable 12 rounds?",

            "content": "The 2026 bZ4X can be optioned with a new 57.7 kWh battery or a 73.1 kWh unit.\n\nDriving the top-spec model are two electric motors with a combined 338 hp (252 kW).\n\nToyota has also doubled the electric SUV\u2019s towing capacity to 3,306 lbs (1,500 kg).\n\nThe Toyota bZ4X was supposed to be the brand\u2019s answer to the Tesla Model Y, and the slew of other similarly-sized electric SUVs on the market, but it\u2019s never really taken off the way Toyota would have hoped (although sales did double last year in the US). Not dissuaded by this, Toyota has updated it for the 2026 model year in Europe, and it promises to be better in all areas. This new model will also be available in the US.\n\nThe most significant changes come on the battery front. New to the bZ4X range is an entry-level 57.7 kWh battery pack. This lithium-ion pack is the same one available in the new C-HR+ and available exclusively in the base front-wheel drive model. This version has a 165 hp (123 kW) electric motor and promises a WLTP range of 276 miles (445 km).\n\nRead: Toyota And Subaru\u2019s Next Joint Electric SUV Coming In 2026\n\nTwo other versions of the bZ4X have been announced, both with a new 73.1 kWh battery pack. The lesser of these models packs 221 hp (165 kW) and can travel 356 miles (573 km) on a charge, while the flagship all-wheel drive model has 338 hp (252 kW) and a quoted range of 323 miles (520 km). Perhaps most impressive is that this version needs just 5.1 seconds to hit 62 mph (100 km/h) \u2013 not bad for an unassuming Toyota SUV.\n\nToyota says it\u2019s improved the energy density of both packs and also increased the number of cells used in each. Improvements have also been made to the electric motors and they now include silicon carbide semiconductors.\n\nCharging Improvements\n\nSeveral other improvements have been made. For example, the new bZ4X comes equipped with battery pre-conditioning that will allow for more efficient high-speed charging in cold conditions. The onboard AC charger on high-spec models now sports 22 kW, rather than 11 kW, but peak DC charging speed remains capped at 150 kW, which is less than some of the competition. Toyota is aiming for a 10-80% charge in approximately 30 minutes. Shoppers will also be pleased to hear the bZ4X\u2019s towing capacity has been doubled to 3,306 lbs (1,500 kg).\n\nFew changes have been made to the exterior of the EV, other than some minor tweaks to improve aerodynamics at the front end. Plenty of alterations have been made to the cabin. Key upgrades include a simplified digital instrument cluster and a new 14-inch screen that ditches the separate climate control switches of the old model.",

            "content": "Toyota says it's listening to its customers all over the world and finally getting serious about fully electric vehicles. At an event in Brussels last week, the world's largest automaker showed off a heavily updated bZ4X, the all-new C-HR+ and the recently released Urban Cruiser. While the cars they revealed are aimed at the European market, some of them seem very likely to make their way to other countries like the U.S. in the coming months.\n\nArguably Toyota's biggest news came in the form of a shadowy slide at the end of a presentation to journalists. That image featured the silhouettes of three more EVs due out by 2026. One is most likely the larger three-row SUV Toyota plans to make in the U.S.\n\nBut one of them is very clearly a pickup truck.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nGet excited, Tacoma and Hilux fans: The Toyota truck really does seem to be going electric.\n\nToyota's European or U.S. spokespeople had nothing to offer about the mysterious truck in that image. But if we look at the automaker's past announcements and concepts, we can make some educated guesses.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nFirst and foremost, this isn't really Toyota's first rodeo with a fully electric truck. Later this year, it's set to launch an EV Hilux model. But that's a more bare-bones work truck with around 124 miles of range, built in Thailand and aimed primarily at that market or maybe a few exports. More crucially, that truck is a single-cab model and the one in the image certainly seems to be a double-cab design.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nSome of the new Toyota EVs resemble ones shown off by then-CEO, now Chairman Akio Toyoda in late 2021. That leads us to believe it could be the truck revealed at that press briefing, which is very obviously an electric Tacoma. The only issue is that its proportions don't exactly match what's seen in the teaser image.\n\nToyota Pickup EV concept\n\nAs enticing as a purely electric Tacoma would be, perhaps another concept gives us a better idea of what to expect: the Toyota EPU Concept from 2023.\n\nGallery: Toyota EPU Concept 27\n\nI first saw this myself at that year's Tokyo Motor Show and I was immediately impressed. It's a Tacoma-ish-sized truck with four doors and a unibody design that really leans into the fact that it's an EV. It has a pass-through bed like the old Chevrolet Avalanche and the current Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, and with that open and the tailgate down, the bed goes from 4.5 feet (137.16 cm) to 8 feet (244 cm) in length.\n\nAt the time, Toyota officials said that the U.S.-crafted design study was more of a lifestyle vehicle with a strong degree of capability rather than a hardcore rock-crawler\u2014think Toyota's take on a Rivian R1T and you're close. But they also demurred when asked if that design was locked in for production or not.\n\nWhile Toyota officials stressed that the cars revealed in Belgium last week were for the European market specifically, we all know Europe doesn't love trucks the way Americans love trucks. And if Toyota is serious about getting into the EV truck game alongside Chevy, Ford, Ram, Rivian and even Tesla, it could be a game-changer.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nAs for the third and final vehicle in those teasers, that one feels like it's going to take less detective work to figure out. It's fairly obviously the Land Cruiser Se, which is exactly what it sounds like: a battery-powered version of Toyota's legendary SUV. Toyota showed that concept off at the same motor show in 2023 and it proved to be equally as popular.\n\nMore interestingly, Toyota had a Land Cruiser Se concept on display in Brussels for all to see. Coincidence? It certainly didn't feel that way to me.\n\nPhoto by: Patrick George Land Cruiser Se Concept\n\nFor now, we have no credible information about either vehicle, except that Toyota intends on launching them before next year is out.\n\n\"BEVs [Battery-electric vehicles] will become an ever-more accepted part of life,\" said Yoshihiro Nakata, the president and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe. \"Now, without giving too much away, these next three parts [of Toyota's EV strategy] will focus on enhancing the customer's lifestyle just as powerfully as they enhance our carbon neutrality goals.\"\n\nWhen automakers talk \"lifestyle,\" they usually mean luxury, trucks and bigger vehicles, or some combination of those things. If this is really where Toyota's EV game is headed next, it'll make a lot of longtime fans quite happy.\n\nWhat theories do you have about Toyota's upcoming electric truck?

            "content": "When you\u2019re able to offer an EV with 267 miles of driving range, an impressive driver assist suite, and decent styling for under $20,000, you better believe it\u2019s going to be popular. That\u2019s exactly what the 2026 Toyota bZ3X did in China, and the launch was so well received that it crashed Toyota-GACs order servers for some time. Let\u2019s look at what we\u2019re missing.\n\nThe bZ3X\u2014known as the Bozhi 3X, or Platinum 3X when translated\u2014is a small all-electric crossover SUV made for the Chinese market through the Toyota-GAC (Guangzhou Automobile Group Company) joint venture. It had a soft pre-launch in December where it was offered for around $14,000, but in March Toyota officially opened its order books for its cheapest EV in China. It was so cheap that it secured over 10,000 orders in just one hour and overwhelmed their servers. To put that into perspective, according to Electrek, the BYD Atto 3 is similarly sized but is nearly $1,000 more expensive to start.\n\nThere are two models with two battery pack sizes and five trim options available for the bZ3X. The base model without any full self-driving technology and other complicated ADAS features from Nvidia called the Nvidia Drive AGX Orin X, starts at 109,800 yuan or around $15,000. If you opt in for the Nvidia technology, add another 40,000 yuan for around $20,500. The standard battery pack is the 430 Air, a 50.03 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) pack good for up to 267 miles of range. The larger \u201c610 Max\u201d offers a battery with up to 370 miles of range with its 67.92 kWh LFP pack.\n\nInside is a bit of a home-away-from-home design that\u2019s very popular in China. All seats fold flat to offer up to 10 feet of nearly flat surface to lounge in. The 14.6-inch infotainment screen offers massive views for this price point, but the instrument panel consists of an 8.8-inch digital display. It\u2019s also a very simple dashboard layout with no other buttons save for the start and hazard light switches, but the HVAC vents are discrete.\n\nAs it\u2019s a joint venture build with GAC for China, it\u2019s unlikely that it will ever be brought over due to the Biden-era rules still in place effectively banning Chinese-built vehicles in the US. Even if they were to overcome those rules, the current\u2014and in constant flux\u2014tariff situation would make the bZ3X far more expensive to sell here after taking importation into account. It would not cost fifteen grand, in other words, a shame considering one of the barriers to entry to EVs their often richer pricing versus equivalent gas-powered offerings.\n\nThat said, in 2025, pricing in general represents a huge hurtle to new vehicle ownership, regardless of what power source you go with. Currently, the cheapest vehicle on sale here in the U.S. is the Nissan Versa S at $18,330, but who knows how long the Versa will continue to be produced with everything going on at Nissan, along with the industry's drift away from small, affordable vehicles (the subcompact segment that the Versa competes in, after all, is down to only two models\u2014soon to be one). Above those, no new vehicle starts at under $20,000, with the next cheapest being the 2025 Chevrolet Trax at $21,495. If Toyota could find a way to bring over the bZ3X or something like it, it could be a huge win, but pulling off such a cheap price outside of the Chinese market would be nearly impossible.",

The Sienna\u2019s sold as an LE, XLE, Woodland, XSE, Limited, or as a Platinum.\n\nThe decision between all five minivans has never been harder, and the outcome has never been better. But which one is better, and why?\n\nFor years, if you wanted an all-wheel-drive minivan, the Toyota Sienna was the only choice. Now the 2025 Chrysler Pacifica can put its power to all four wheels, too. At the same time, if you wanted a hybrid minivan, the plug-in hybrid version of the Chrysler Pacifica was the only choice. Now the 2025 Toyota Sienna comes standard as a hybrid and gets an EPA-rated 35 mpg combined with all-wheel drive.\n\nDespite the unabated rise in popularity of SUVs, the minivan is the ultimate suburban utility vehicle. With seating for up to eight, cargo volume like a box van, incomparably easy sliding doors, and versatile seating arrangements, the minivan lacks only the powertrain options of SUVs. No longer.\n\nI agree to receive emails from The Car Connection. I understand that I can unsubscribe at any time.

The base Sienna LE costs $40,500 and comes with a standard set of power sliding doors, a slew of safety technology, and an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe XLE adds synthetic leather upholstery and a sunroof, while the Limited gets real leather, navigation, JBL audio, and an intercom system for the driver to speak to people in the third row.\n\nHow much is a fully loaded Toyota Sienna?\n\nThe Sienna Platinum with all-wheel drive costs about $58,000.\n\nWhich Chrysler Pacifica should I buy?\n\nIt costs about $42,000 for a Pacifica Voyager, which comes with heated front seats, LED headlights, and a 10.1-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It\u2019s sold only with front-wheel drive. It\u2019s worth it to spend a little more for the Touring L, which adds synthetic leather upholstery and opens up access to packages that include better safety technology, tech, and available AWD.\n\nStep up to the Limited to get leather and a sunroof standard. All-wheel drive adds about $3,000.\n\nHow much is a fully loaded Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nThe Hybrid Pinnacle edition costs about $62,000.\n\nIs Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid worth it?\n\nThe Pacifica can be had as a plug-in hybrid but only with front-wheel drive and costing about $12,000 more than the base Sienna. If you have access to electric-car charging, the Hybrid Select costs about $53,000 and offers good electric-only driving range. We\u2019re impressed.\n\nAdvantage : Sienna in base trims, but the Pacifica\u2019s nicer at the top end.\n\nChrysler Pacifica vs. Toyota Sienna gas mileage\n\nSienna tops fuel-economy charts\n\nBase Pacifica scores much lower gas mileage\n\nPacifica Hybrid: 32 miles of electric range\n\nThe Toyota Sienna gets the advantage here for efficiency. Even with all-wheel drive, the Sienna\u2019s EPA-rated 35 mpg combined is remarkable for a vehicle this size. It\u2019s 36 mpg combined with front-wheel drive.\n\nThe Pacifica gets 20 mpg combined with all-wheel drive, and that difference would cost owners an extra $650 in fuel costs annually over the Sienna, according to the EPA. With front-wheel drive, it earns 22 mpg combined.\n\nThe 32-mile electric range of the Pacifica plug-in hybrid satisfies the distance of most everyday needs before plugging it into the garage overnight. Without electric juice, it gets a very good 30 mpg combined.\n\nAdvantage: In base spec, the Sienna; as a plug-in hybrid, the Pacifica.\n\n2022 Chrysler Pacifica interior\n\nChrysler Pacifica vs. Toyota Sienna interior and cargo space\n\nStow \u2018N Go excels at utility\n\nPacifica Hybrid doesn\u2019t get Stow \u2018N Go\n\nSienna has smaller third-row seat\n\nThe Pacifica has a bigger interior and a more high-end look than the Sienna, and its seating system ultimately is more useful.\n\nDrivers are treated well in either minivan. The standard power driver\u2019s seat in the Pacifica includes an armrest that is part of the seat; in the Sienna the armrest is part of the console and the other armrest is on the door. It can make for awkward driving positions, whereas the Pacifica has more road-trip ready comfort.\n\nThe Sienna has a convenient dashboard storage shelf that runs from the center stack to the passenger\u2019s outside vent. It\u2019s ideal for phones and the detritus of family life. A two-tiered center console adds more storage space, but the utilitarian Sienna can\u2019t match the premium fit and finish of the Pacifica.\n\nDoes the Chrysler Pacifica have stow-and-go seats?\n\nThe Pacifica\u2019s versatility shines with second-row \u201cStow \u2019N Go\u201d fold-away seats that collapse and stow into the floor, though it does take some finagling. It\u2019s offered on all-wheel-drive models, as well\u2014but not with the Hybrid, which stores its battery where the seats would be stored. Access in and out of the third row is made easy for little or big hands with pull straps down low and firm latches up top. The fixed position of the Pacifica\u2019s second row limits third-row space, though the third rows in both minivans recline for increased comfort.\n\nDoes the Sienna have removable second row seats?\n\nNo. The Sienna\u2019s second-row seats offer a different advantage: They can slide up to 25 inches (and can be equipped with footrests) that make accessing the third row much easier. The Sienna has more seating room, and much more leg room to comfortably fit two adults in the front two rows.\n\nThe problem for many Sienna fans is the second row can no longer be removed because of second-row airbags. However, the seat bottoms flip up, and the seats move up flush against the front seat backs.\n\nFolding down the Sienna\u2019s third row doesn\u2019t require much finagling. The handles on the 60/40 split seat can be pulled out with one hand and dropped into a cargo bay deeper by one cubic foot than in the Pacifica. Top trims of the Pacifica have power-reclining seats that take a little longer but can\u2019t be beat for convenience.\n\nIs a Toyota Sienna bigger than a Pacifica?\n\nFrom the rear, the Sienna beats the Pacifica with a lower load floor. The Pacifica maximizes the space, however, delivering 140 cubic feet with both rows folded flat compared to 101 cubes in the Sienna.\n\nAdvantage : Pacifica.\n\n2022 Chrysler Pacifica with all-wheel drive\n\nChrysler Pacifica vs. Toyota Sienna performance\n\nPunchy Pacifica V-6\n\nBetter handling with Sienna\n\nBetter ride with Pacifica\n\nThe Pacifica\u2019s 287-hp 3.6-liter V-6 springs off the line quicker than the Sienna. In Hybrids, a battery pack and electric motor team to a 260-hp version of the same engine. Both run power through a 9-speed automatic for generally responsive power output, though heavier Hybrids are noticeably slower.\n\nDoes the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid have all-wheel drive?\n\nAll other versions of the Chrysler minivan offer AWD except for the base Touring and the Hybrid, due to its tightly packaged gas-electric drivetrain.\n\nThe Sienna, in contrast, sports a 2.5-liter inline-4 and a 1.9-kwh battery powering an electric motor, for a total of 245 hp. Under light loads it can accelerate in EV mode up to about 15 mph, but under heavier throttle the gruff engine strains to meet demand. It\u2019s the slowest minivan, but still quick enough to satisfy most drivers.\n\nIs the Toyota Sienna AWD?\n\nSome versions of the Sienna come with all-wheel drive. On those models, a rear electric motor sends up to 80% of the torque to the rear axle.\n\nThe Sienna feels more assured and handles with more confidence than the Pacifica, which has good highway tracking and a more composed ride. The Sienna feels more buttoned down through corners, while the Pacifica tends to lean into corners more readily.\n\nAdvantage : Split decision between the Pacifica's power and the Sienna's composure.\n\n2022 Chrysler Pacifica in-car camera\n\nChrysler Pacifica vs. Toyota Sienna safety\n\nStandard automatic emergency braking\n\nSurround-view camera systems on either\n\nTop crash-test scores\n\nThe Sienna comes with 10 airbags to the Pacifica\u2019s eight, but both come standard with automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, active lane control, and automatic high beams. The Pacifica adds blind-spot monitors, while both offer optional surround-view camera systems and cabin cameras.\n\nBoth the Sienna and the Pacifica earn five-star NHTSA ratings and Top Safety Pick awards from the IIHS\u2014but the Pacifica score dates back to 2023, and the Sienna\u2019s score comes with a single Marginal test result in the latest front-impact test. It\u2019s possible neither will earn the award when ratings are next refreshed.\n\nAdvantage: It\u2019s slight, but the Pacifica has more standard safety equipment.\n\n2025 Toyota Sienna\n\nChrysler Pacifica vs. Toyota Sienna design\n\nPacifica\u2019s rounded and elegant\n\nSienna borrows Highlander style\n\nChrysler\u2019s more upscale feel\n\nEvery minivan appears in need of some Crossfit or a corset, but either of those things would ruin their jolly interior room.\n\nThe Sienna takes on more sculpted shapes from the Toyota Highlander, such as flared rear haunches. The stout front end and broad lower grille borrow elements of Toyota\u2019s trucks as much as its three-row SUVs but there\u2019s just no getting around that block of cheese rear end.\n\nThe Pacifica takes a sportier approach; from the rear wheel forward, the Pacifica looks as good as the better-looking SUVs out there, especially with available 20-inch wheels.\n\nAdvantage: The Pacifica is prettier, inside and out.\n\n2022 Chrysler Pacifica infotainment\n\nChrysler Pacifica vs. Toyota Sienna infotainment\n\nPacifica has bigger touchscreen\n\nChrysler also has better interface\n\nBoth have Amazon Alexa\n\nThe Pacifica comes with more features that look, act, and feel better. The centerpiece is a 10.1-inch touchscreen that\u2019s easy to use and has excellent natural voice commands. The standard setup in the Sienna is an 8.0-inch touchscreen, which gets upgraded to 12.3 inches in pricey models. Both vans come standard with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Amazon Alexa compatibility.\n\nAdvantage: Pacifica .\n\nChrysler Pacifica vs. Toyota Sienna warranty\n\nHybrids carry separate battery warranties\n\nBoth vans have mediocre standard warranty coverage\n\nToyota includes two years or 25,000 miles of free scheduled service\n\nBoth vans carry a 3-year/36,000-mile bumper to bumper warranty. Both minivans add on a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. The Pacifica Hybrid battery is covered for at least 10 years or 100,000 miles; the Sienna\u2019s battery is covered for 10 years or 150,000 miles. Toyota now also covers all vehicles for two years or 25,000 miles of scheduled service\n\nAdvantage: The Sienna has a longer battery warranty.\n\n2022 Chrysler Pacifica\n\nChrysler Pacifica vs. Toyota Sienna: Which one is the better minivan?\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica scores a TCC Rating of 6.7 out of 10 compared to a 6.7 for the Sienna.\n\nWith either, excellent safety and space hit the minivan mark. We tend to prefer the performance and flexibility of the Chrysler Pacifica. It\u2019s been the best family hauler on the market, though the competition is catching up\u2014not just the Sienna, but also the Kia Carnival, offer much of the same safety and space.\n\nThe Pacifica can overcome the deficit compared with the Sienna\u2019s fuel economy, but it costs much more to upgrade to the plug-in hybrid edition\u2014and doing so omits the fold-away second-row seat.\n\nThe Toyota Sienna is an impressive minivan worthy of a place on any family\u2019s shopping list. It\u2019s refined and has excellent gas mileage no matter which model, but the middle-row seats don\u2019t fold out of the way, and the third row is less spacious than that of the Pacifica, though it can be easier to access.

            "sentiment": null,
            "probability": null,
            "content": "When I first got to see the 2025 Toyota Crown Signia last year, I felt that it was a bold choice for the U.S. where flatter and squarer SUV designs are increasingly dominant. And while it isn\u2019t a direct replacement for the now-discontinued Toyota Venza, the Crown Signia\u2019s wagon-like body and well-designed interior conveyed that Toyota was offering something new to U.S. buyers.\n\nAlthough the Crown Signia and Highlander Hybrid belong in different segments and target different demographics, they are not priced very far apart. Here are five reasons I\u2019d choose the former.\n\n1. More Stylish Exterior\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid (below) is the bigger vehicle in this comparison, and the more practical choice. The Crown Signia (above) is as close as America will get to a new Toyota station wagon.\n\nHaving seen it in different colors and every angle, I can say that the Crown Signia combines the look of a wagon with a sedan\u2019s sleekness. Its lower roofline (4 inches shorter than the Highlander), larger 21-inch wheels and smooth silhouette contrast with the Highlander\u2019s traditional SUV style. If you are bored of flat shapes and aggressive designs but don\u2019t want to buy a sedan, the Crown Signia balances practicality with style.\n\n2. Better Fuel Economy\n\nWhere the Crown Signia is exclusively a hybrid vehicle, buyers can get the Highlander in the U.S. with a gas engine as well, which is far cheaper, but also far less fuel efficient.\n\nWhile both vehicles feature the same 2.5-liter hybrid system, the Crown Signia is at least 300 lbs lighter, and also thanks to a streamlined body, it is more fuel efficient. It gets 39 MPG city, 37 MPG highway, and 38 MPG combined, according to EPA estimates, generating a system output of 240 hp. The Highlander Hybrid reaches just 35 MPG city, 34 MPG highway, and 35 MPG combined (EPA), while developing 243 hp. For urban fuel savings, the Signia emerges as a better choice.\n\n3. High-Quality Interior\n\nIf you prefer a high-quality interior with a premium feel, the Signia fits better. If you are looking for ample headroom, a large cargo hold, and easier entry/exit, the Highlander is the winner.\n\nI can tell you that the Crown Signia is the closest you\u2019d get to a Lexus in a Toyota. When I got to sit in the car for the first time, I couldn\u2019t recall a Toyota feeling this premium. It comes with leather seats (standard on Limited trim), Black or Saddle Tan colors, and exclusive features including a Panoramic fixed-glass roof and Digital Key. The Highlander, on the other hand, prioritizes family practicality over luxury. If you prefer a refined feel similar to Lexus but don\u2019t need a third row, pick the Crown Signia.\n\n4. Lower Price\n\nThe Crown Signia is priced (MSRP before taxes and fees) between $43,590-$47,990; the Highlander Hybrid is priced between $46,050-$53,675.\n\nThe Crown Signia\u2019s compact size and lower stance make it easier to drive and park in crowded city conditions, even though it has a slightly bigger turning radius. If a third row isn\u2019t essential, the Crown Signia makes more sense, costing nearly USD 3,000 less.\n\n5. Future Of The Highlander\n\nToyota has said nothing about discontinuing the Highlander and may introduce a 2026 model year to silence any wild rumors. Yet, sales numbers tell a clear story. In 2024, Highlander sales fell sharply to just 89,658 units, down 47.5% from 2023. Even the Highlander Hybrid couldn\u2019t reverse the decline, dropping 50.4% year-over-year.\n\nWe expect the Grand Highlander (pictured) to outsell the Highlander in 2025. Its Hybrid variant already surpassed the regular Highlander\u2019s electrified model sales last year.\n\nRumors suggest Toyota may shift the Highlander nameplate exclusively to electric power when its new three-row EV SUV begins production at the Princeton plant late next year.",

It starts at an accessible $28,850, and for the price gives you a power driver's seat, a touchscreen multimedia display, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a Wi-Fi hotspot. There's also a 203-hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that routes power via an eight-speed automatic transmission. Plus, hybrid options are available.\n\nAll of these features have clearly worked in the RAV4's favor over the years.

            "content": "It might not have the Ford Raptor\u2019s firepower, but the next-gen Hilux GR Sport will have loyal fans coming back\n\nToyota\u2019s Hilux GR Sport redesign promises significant improvements over its predecessor.\n\nIt refines off-road capability with upgraded suspension, bolder styling, and improved tech.\n\nPower will likely come from a 221-hp turbodiesel, though Toyota may offer a stronger hybrid.\n\nToyota\u2019s current-generation Hilux has been a staple of transportation outside the United States for years now. Despite dating back to 2015\u2014a lifetime in the fast-moving world of vehicle updates\u2014it continues to sell exceptionally well, holding its own against far newer rivals. In Australia, for example, the Hilux was the third best-selling vehicle overall last year, trailing only the Ford Ranger and its RAV4 stablemate.\n\nFuture Cars: Everything We Know About The 2026 Toyota Hilux Pickup\n\nFortunately, a redesigned Hilux is just around the corner, promising vast improvements across the board. Yet, one question lingers more than most\u2014will Toyota finally have a competitive answer to Ford\u2019s Ranger Raptor?\n\nThe GR Sport: A Half-Step Toward a Raptor Rival\n\nThe current generation Toyota Hilux GR Sport\n\nFor context, Toyota currently sells a somewhat equivalent called the GR Sport. I say somewhat, as it was developed as a reactionary response to the Raptor rather than being a hardcore, off-road truck from the outset. To its credit, the GR Sport isn\u2019t just a sticker package as it features a raft of changes over the standard truck.\n\nMore specifically, it gets a wider track, beefier KYB monotube shocks, and a mild power bump for its 2.8-liter turbodiesel inline-four, bringing output to 221 horsepower and an extra 15 kW/50 Nm over the standard truck. Nice upgrades, sure, but nowhere near the punch of Ford\u2019s 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 (rated at 392 hp in Australia and 284 hp in Europe) or the capability of its high-end Fox suspension setup.\n\nAdding to the mixed bag, the next Hilux GR Sport will continue riding on Toyota\u2019s IMV ladder-frame platform, rather than upgrading to the newer TNGA-F architecture used in the Tacoma. That may sound like a letdown, but it\u2019s not all bad news.\n\nBrawny Looks\n\nIllustrations Josh Byrnes / Carscoops\n\nStarting with the styling, the truck\u2019s slim new LED headlights and angular honeycomb grille are complemented by rugged front bash plates, flared front and rear fenders, and chunky cladding. Redesigned rock sliders and increased ground clearance help those wanting to navigate into rougher territory.\n\nInside, expect a completely redesigned cabin with more supportive seats and contrasting interior materials. Toyota may also borrow the Tacoma TRD Pro\u2019s IsoDynamic shock-absorbing seats, which help cushion occupants on rough terrain.\n\nMore: The Toyota Hilux GR Sport II Brings Rally Vibes To Your Muddy Construction Site\n\nTech goodies will include a 12.3-inch infotainment system with off-road camera modes, a digital instrument cluster, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and wireless charging. Toyota\u2019s advanced Safety Sense suite of driver assists will also be included, ensuring the Hilux meets ANCAP\u2019s (the down-under equivalent of the IIHS) stricter standards for autonomous emergency braking.\n\nSport in Name, Mild in Performance\n\nIf Toyota seriously wants the GR Sport to challenge the Raptor, powertrain improvements are non-negotiable, because 221 horsepower from a four-cylinder diesel isn\u2019t going to cut it. Unfortunately, that\u2019s likely what it\u2019ll get.\n\nThe long-shot alternative? Whilst the standard truck will make do with a carry-over 48V mild hybrid 2.8-litre diesel four, the GR Sport could benefit from the Tacoma\u2019s 2.4-litre i-Force Max hybrid powertrain that generates 326-horsepower and a thumping 465 pound-feet of torque. It\u2019s not quite the near 400-odd ponies from Ford\u2019s stable, but it\u2019s a healthy upgrade, nonetheless.\n\nOn the suspension front, expect re-tuned springs and dampers designed more for technical off-roading than high-speed desert running.\n\nRivals and Reveal\n\nThe Isuzu D-MAX Blade\n\nIn concept, Toyota positions the Hilux GR Sport against competitors like the Ineos Grenadier, Kia Tasman, Isuzu D-Max Blade, Nissan Navara Warrior, and Jeep Gladiator Mojave.\n\nBut while it\u2019s shaping up to be a solid off-roader, it\u2019s still not the Raptor killer some fans were hoping for. That said, we\u2019ll have to wait for the official reveal in the coming months to see exactly what Toyota delivers.\n\nWould you like to see a more performance-focused Hilux GR Sport?

Others are focused around comfort and family duty, with a little bit of adventure thrown into the mix.\n\nWhile that distinction is nothing new, the lines between these different schools of EVs have been blurred a bit more each year. The look of those truck-based SUVs has become a little more modern and precious in the details, while the carlike ones have gone all boxy and cladding-endowed\u2014to the point where it may not always be apparent which is which on the dealership lot.\n\nFor example, a Santa Fe and a Land Cruiser wouldn\u2019t have been even remotely seen in the same lens in the past. But in one model year that all changed. For 2024, Toyota reintroduced the Land Cruiser as a cheaper, simpler, all-hybrid version of an SUV icon that had grown very expensive in its previous-generation form. Meanwhile for 2024, Hyundai gave the Santa Fe (including the hybrid) a complete overhaul, bringing a completely new look and feel to this model inside and out.\n\n2024 Toyota Land Cruiser 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid\n\nIn back-to-back weeks, I managed to check in with two boxy hybrid SUVs\u2014a 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid Calligraphy costing around $50,000, and a 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser at around $70,000\u2014that could easily be seen as having a lot in common, when they really don\u2019t. Both offer similar types of hybrid powertrains in relatively squared-off profiles, rounded for varying levels of modern finish.More ground clearance than carlike models, roof racks and tie-downs, plenty of lower body cladding, and octagonal wheel-well protection all sell the lure of the outdoors, but one is meant more for soccer practice.\n\nInside and in the driving experiences they provide\u2014and in their daily-use bottom line\u2014they couldn\u2019t be more different.\n\nHow does one of them achieve nearly double the real-world gas mileage of the other? How does one of them offer more than a 95-hp advantage without accelerating noticeably quicker? And how does one of them fit three usable rows of seating into less space than it takes for the other to fit a seemingly compromised two rows?\n\nIt all comes down to a set of traits that might not be so apparent to today\u2019s evolved SUV buyers, especially against the marketing backdrop of dusty trails.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid\n\nSanta Fe Hybrid vs. Land Cruiser hybrid systems: A lot in common\n\nAt a glance, these two hybrid systems have a lot in common. Both have turbocharged 4-cylinder engines with electric motors acting as go-betweens in the power flow with traditional hydraulic automatic transmissions, plus relatively small batteries to store energy from regenerative braking and release it to boost power and efficiency. Both of these SUVs also rely on familiar mechanically configured but electronically controlled all-wheel-drive systems (as a basis for a true 4WD system in the Land Cruiser, which we\u2019ll get to).\n\nThe Santa Fe Hybrid uses what Hyundai calls a transmission-mounted electric device (TMED) packaging a motor between the gasoline engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, with a 1.5-kwh lithium-ion battery pack. A clutch between the engine and motor allows the engine to be isolated from the driveline, for all-electric operation as conditions allow. The 1.6-liter turbo-4 makes 178 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque, while the electric motor makes 60 hp and 195 lb-ft; they combine for an output of 231 hp.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser hybrid 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser hybrid 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser hybrid\n\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser, on the other hand, gets what Toyota more flamboyantly names its i-Force Max hybrid system. It\u2019s powered by a 278-hp, 2.4-liter turbo-4. A 48-hp electric motor is packaged within a bell housing between the engine and an ordinary 8-speed automatic transmission\u2014also with a clutch between the engine and motor\u2014with a total system output of 326 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque. Its nickel-metal-hydride battery pack has a capacity of just 0.9 kwh.\n\nMore power doesn\u2019t make the Toyota any quicker or more efficient. Sheer weight is a big part of it. The Land Cruiser weighs a whopping 5,445 pounds, about 900 more than the Santa Fe Hybrid and a few hundred more than a similarly sized base Kia EV9 electric SUV, for a comparison with about the same footprint\u2014even though the EV9 is saddled with a heavy battery pack.\n\nToyota Land Cruiser hybrid vs. Santa Fe Hybrid mpg: Oh what a difference\n\nMy 53-mile loop tends to bring out the efficiency advantages of hybrids, as it includes a lot of minor ups and downs, with about 700 feet of overall gain and loss, and equal parts under-65-mph freeways, suburban boulevards, and rolling-hill backroads.\n\nRunning them in their respective Eco modes on that route (in 2WD in the Toyota\u2019s case), I averaged an indicated best-case-scenario 23 mpg in the Land Cruiser hybrid and 38 mpg in the Santa Fe Hybrid.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the Santa Fe Hybrid came with EPA ratings of 35 mpg city, 34 highway, and 34 combined, while the Land Cruiser was rated at 22/25/23 mpg. I\u2019ve never struggled to just meet EPA combined ratings in that gentle loop and the weather was mild, with temps in the 50s.\n\nI averaged less than 19 mpg the remaining 90 miles I covered in the Land Cruiser\u2014nearly equally urban driving and highway cruising by mileage. Meanwhile, in the Santa Fe Hybrid, the trip computer said I averaged nearly 34 mpg after another 70 miles of combined driving. Both examples included some quick bursts to see how much power was on tap and to understand dynamics and responsiveness, so you\u2019re bound to do a bit better. Clearly, the Hyundai is much more efficient than the Toyota.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid\n\nAnswers in very different layouts, 4WD systems?\n\nThe Santa Fe\u2019s all-wheel-drive system aims for occasional use, and maintaining traction after a snowstorm or on the way to a campsite. It employs a center clutch to vary the amount of torque going to the rear wheels, including a Smart mode, as well as Snow (80:20 to 50:50 front/rear), Sand/Mud (50:50), or a center \u201clock\u201d at 50:50.\n\nThe Land Cruiser does it a bit differently. Its system includes a center locking differential, a rear locker, and a Multi-Terrain Select system with off-road modes for specialized terrain and conditions. It can be used in both its 4Hi and 4Lo ranges\u2014something the Hyundai doesn\u2019t have\u2014and there\u2019s a smooth crawl control system for steep slippery slopes or just keeping it as slow as necessary for tricky terrain. The Land Cruiser most definitely has more impressive approach, departure, and breakover angles for serious and regular off-roading and we know it would dominate the trail versus the Hyundai\u2026but that\u2019s not really the point here.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nThese SUVs also have different suspensions. The Land Cruiser has a front independent suspension plus a rear live axle that helps enable its stronger towing rating of up to 6,000 pounds (versus just 1,650 pounds for the Santa Fe). The Land Cruiser also offers a disconnecting front stabilizer bar that allows the suspension to flex more, providing lots of wheel articulation to maintain traction over heaves or boulders. As for the Santa Fe Hybrid, it has struts and coil springs in front, with a rear multi-link independent setup, much as a large car might.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid\n\nRide quality and on-the-road suspension behavior was night-and-day different between these two SUVs. The Santa Fe felt relatively soft and absorbent around town, with enough firmness to prevent excess lean when pressed hard into corners. The Land Cruiser on the other hand rode with a busy, somewhat noisy harshness, with undue head-toss over normal urban patchwork. Yet out on a curvy road, the Land Cruiser\u2019s suspension gave way to a lot of lean and body roll.\n\nUltimately it comes down to a key difference, in addition to the Land Cruiser\u2019s live axle: The Land Cruiser is a body-on-frame truck, while the Santa Fe is a unibody crossover.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser hybrid 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser hybrid 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid\n\nLand Cruiser vs. Santa Fe Hybrid seating, cargo space: Biggest is smallest\n\nThe Land Cruiser is a little larger in all exterior dimensions. At 193.8 inches long, it\u2019s 3.5 inches longer, 3.1 inches wider, and 5.5 inches taller overall than the Santa Fe, with its 8.3 inches of ground clearance 1.3 inches more than the Santa Fe\u2019s.\n\nYet all that extra space on the outside disappears inside. The Santa Fe is loads more spacious inside, with three usable rows versus two in the Land Cruiser. While the Santa Fe\u2019s third row is really too small for adult use (especially getting back there), its second-row captain\u2019s chairs feels luxurious and good for a long weekend out on the highway. Meanwhile, the second row in the Land Cruiser feels oddly short on both knee room and cushioning.\n\nInside, the Santa Fe is modern and complex, and its materials, trims, and textures are a step above the Land Cruiser\u2019s, and really it\u2019s a matter of priorities. The Toyota interior includes loads of hard plastic that looks like it might scratch and look dingy over time. It\u2019s more utilitarian despite a higher price.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser hybrid 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid\n\nWith its taller, longer body and no third row, it\u2019s not surprising that it has more cargo space behind its second row compared to the Santa Fe\u201446.2 cubic feet versus 40.5 cubes. Behind the front seats, somehow that lead shrinks\u2014to 82.1 cubic feet versus 79.6 cubic feet. The most exasperating piece of packaging in the Land Cruiser is the cargo floor, which rises above the hatchback opening in a very awkward way, signaling some poorly coordinated engineering departments.\n\nNext to each other, it\u2019s clear the Santa Fe has a little more taper in its greenhouse; it not only narrows more on the way up to the roof but also resolves in a slight slope downward at the rear of the roofline before it cuts down. They\u2019re choices influenced by aerodynamics, for sure, but I found it noteworthy that they don\u2019t seem to noticeably affect interior space.\n\nThese two models would have about the same hood height if it weren\u2019t for the Land Cruiser\u2019s unnecessarily bulbous hood\u2014which quaked visibly and incessantly at 70 mph. Underhood turbulence, anyone?\n\nLand Cruiser vs. Santa Fe Hybrid: Drivability delights, quirks, footnotes\n\nIn real-world use, these powertrains and hybrid systems couldn\u2019t be more different, even though they\u2019re laid out so similarly. The engine is well-muted in the Hyundai, and it would be easy to lose track of where it is in the rev band, or even if it\u2019s on or not, if it weren\u2019t for the tachometer. That\u2019s a good thing. But in the Toyota, shifts are impossible to miss, as they\u2019re intermittently harsh (especially the 1-2 shift). The powertrain seems to be happier under load; step into the accelerator a little harder or climb a hill and things smooth out, but if you\u2019re trudging along in traffic there\u2019s no space to do that and in that environment it simply doesn\u2019t have any refinement.\n\nThe Land Cruiser\u2019s engine also runs far more often than in most other hybrids, and it\u2019s loud. Forget about a stealth mode here, as in other Toyota hybrids, allowing you to traverse a driveway or subdivision quietly.Selecting Eco also doesn\u2019t seem to make this hybrid more electric. Its turbo-4 always starts up with a little bit of a howl and settles in with a raspy quality. In my experience, the Santa Fe Hybrid\u2019s engine usually started when setting out, and it was easy to keep the engine off when creeping into a driveway or side street at the end of a trip.\n\nAcceleration is a mixed bag for both of these hybrid SUVs. Both get to 60 mph in a bit less than eight seconds, and despite that 95-hp deficit in combined output (yes, blame weight), the Santa Fe Hybrid feels just as quick to 60 mph, if not a bit quicker to 40 mph, if you simply keep the accelerator mashed. Both tend to sit and take a deep breath for a fraction of a second when you stomp on the accelerator. But in any kind of passing maneuver or sudden need for acceleration, the Land Cruiser felt a lot quicker.\n\nThe Hyundai provides paddles with multiple regenerative-braking steps and well-blended braking. The most aggressive level is almost enough to call it one-pedal driving, whereas the Land Cruiser\u2019s system provides no (or next to no) regenerative braking in the last few feet of a stop.\n\nLand Cruiser vs. Santa Fe Hybrid value and price\n\nThe prices of these vehicles don\u2019t match up with first impressions\u2014or even a reality check on value.\n\nIn the top-trim form I tested, the Santa Fe Hybrid Calligraphy came loaded with features that might typically be associated with luxury-brand models. Its standard feature set brought a head-up display, heated-and-cooled front seats, second-row power-folding heated captain\u2019s chairs, a heated steering wheel, heated side mirrors, Bose premium audio, and a digital key. The Calligraphy starts at $50,215, and premium paint and carpeted floor mats bumped the price of my tester to $50,895.\n\nMy Toyota Land Cruiser added up to a whopping $71,534 as tested. Its standard-feature set looked slimmer next to the Santa Fe Hybrid\u2019s, although heated and cooled front seats, a power driver seat, and a heated steering wheel. On top of the Land Cruiser trim\u2019s $63,345 base price, more than $8,000 in options included the $4,600 Premium Package, with 14-speaker premium audio, a sunroof, wireless device charging, a power leather-trimmed driver seat, a head-up display, and additional driver-assistance features. An upgrade to 20-inch alloy wheels, a roof rack, and a two-tone roof scheme were among the other options.\n\nStripping away all the options and some of the pizzazz, the 2025 Santa Fe Hybrid starts at $39,775 in SEL trim, while the 2025 Land Cruiser starts at $58,150 in its base 1958 version.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser hybrid 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid\n\nBoth SUVs offer wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Going in and out of CarPlay in both, the Hyundai\u2019s system simply felt better integrated, clearer, and more flexible, with its flowing, \u201copen concept\u201d layout that shifts some of the climate controls up into the screen space (and the shifter up to the steering column). Toyota\u2019s wide-format screen, for instance, still can\u2019t split its screen when you\u2019re using CarPlay\u2014something we were told was on the way when this system arrived a couple years ago.\n\nLand Cruiser gives up a lot, shakes you down for more\n\nThis circles around to a bottom line: The Toyota Land Cruiser does offer significantly more capability\u2014in off-roading and towing\u2014but at a big sacrifice the rest of the time to comfort, space, refinement, and efficiency versus a comparably sized model that doesn\u2019t push those boundaries. The Toyota even demands significantly more money for that experience.\n\nIn all fairness, Toyota does have a model that\u2019s a closer rival to the Santa Fe Hybrid. That would be the 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid, which does come rated at up to 34 mpg with AWD.\n\nToyota Land Cruiser hybrid and Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid\n\nThe comparison between the two here helps underscore how far SUVs have come, and how the old-style SUV formula has become a narrow, more expensive niche for good reason. If you want the SUV form factor but don\u2019t need all the old SUV baggage, the Santa Fe Hybrid explains in a language most shoppers will appreciate that you don\u2019t need that compromise.",

            "content": "Entering 2025, the EV industry anticipates a year of transition, marked by both challenges and opportunities. A risk lies in potential policy shifts, particularly in the US, where a change in administration could jeopardize existing EV incentives and regulations. The potential repeal of the federal tax credit, for instance, could impact EV affordability and demand. Furthermore, trade tensions, especially between China and Western nations, pose hurdles to market access. Increased tariffs and import restrictions could disrupt supply chains and limit consumer choice. However, there's optimism for improved macroeconomic conditions. As inflationary pressures subside and central banks begin to lower interest rates, EV affordability is expected to improve. Moreover, the long-term trajectory towards electrification, driven by emission regulations and industry investments, appears irreversible.\n\nThe EV sector navigated a turbulent 2024 due to macroeconomic pressures. Tradu recently reported that elevated inflation and surging interest rates globally constricted consumer spending, particularly on high-value items like EVs. This economic strain translated into a noticeable deceleration in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales across key markets, notably Europe and the US. In Europe, BEV registrations experienced a decline, while hybrid vehicle sales surged. This reflected a consumer shift towards more affordable and range-extended options. The US market, while still growing, witnessed a slowdown compared to the previous year's expansion. China, however, grew, with new energy vehicle (NEV) sales, which included BEVs, plug-in hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles, and surpassed 50% of total sales. This regional disparity underscored the varied pace of EV adoption worldwide.\n\nIn 2024, the worldwide EV (electric vehicle) market value was roughly $1.32 trillion, as reported by Grand View Research, and it is expected to expand at a CAGR 32.5% between 2025 and 2030. Worldwide governmental rules and rewards are boosting EV sales. Numerous nations enact strict pollution laws and give rebates, tax cuts, and other benefits to buyers and producers, which pushes a change from gas-powered cars to electric ones. Furthermore, battery tech gains are improving EV range, power, and cost. New ideas like solid-state cells and better lithium-ion cells cut costs and boost energy storage, thus making EVs more attractive.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Undervalued EV Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) stands against the other undervalued EV stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA pivotal factor influencing EV adoption in 2025 will be the introduction of more affordable models. Recognizing the need to expand their customer base, major automakers are developing sub-$30,000 EVs. Chinese manufacturers, using their cost advantages and established supply chains, will play a role in this segment and offer competitive pricing and a wider range of models. The availability of affordable EVs is expected to be a major catalyst for market growth. Additionally, the advancements in autonomous driving technology are anticipated to revive the EV sector. While regulatory hurdles and safety concerns remain, 2025 could witness accelerated deployment of autonomous driving features. This will enhance the overall user experience and expand the potential applications of EVs. The convergence of electrification and autonomy will reshape the automotive landscape and drive innovation.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through online rankings and stock screeners to compile a list of the top EV stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 20. We then selected the 8 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) the Most Oversold EV Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nWorkers assembling a car in a modern manufacturing plant, emphasizing the company's sense of progress.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of March 7: 9.22\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 13\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) is a global automotive manufacturer. It operates through automotive, financial services, and other segments and designs, produces, and sells a range of vehicles. These include passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and EVs, under the Toyota and Lexus brands.\n\nThe company is transitioning from a hybrid-heavy portfolio to increasing its EV presence. However, 2024 saw less than 200,000 EV sales in the first 9 months. Still, the company targets 3.5 million annual BEV sales by 2030, with at least 30 BEV models in its lineup. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) is also investing $13.5 billion in EV battery development by 2030 and aims for solid-state battery commercialization by the same year.\n\nOn March 7, Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) launched the Bozhi 3X in China, which is the company's cheapest smart EV, with prices starting at 104,800 yuan and the smart version at 139,800 yuan. The launch saw over 10,000 orders within an hour of its release. Earlier on February 6, Macquarie analyst upgraded the company from Neutral to Outperform. Analysts expect the company's near-term earnings to be weak due to slow volume recovery, but also predict that production stabilization will lead to steadier future earnings.\n\nOverall TM ranks 6th on our list of the most undervalued EV stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of TM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "It's only March, and we already we have a blue-ribbon winner for the most unexpected business news of 2025. According to CNBC, carmakers including Honda Motor Co. (NYSE: HMC), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM), and China's Geely Holding (owner of the Volvo Cars and Polestar brands) are all now investing in...rockets. Wild though it sounds, these three automotive companies have collectively sunk more than $300 million into the twin space businesses of rocket design and satellite manufacturing.\n\nAs the saying goes: \"I did not have that on my bingo card.\"\n\nCars in space?\n\nSince 2019, Honda has been developing what CNBC calls a \"proprietary reusable rocket.\" Toyota made a $44 million investment in Japanese rocket start-up Interstellar Technologies earlier this year. Geely, meanwhile, is investing $326 million in satellite manufacture.\n\nBut does any of this make sense?\n\nWell, the satellites part may. After all, Elon Musk famously juggles jobs running both the world's No. 1 (or No. 2?) electric-vehicle (EV) company, Tesla, and SpaceX, a space company with its own proprietary Starlink satellite constellation, which can be used to provide mobile internet service to Tesla EVs. If Geely aspires to do something similar, then yes, in fact, it might make some sense for Geely to be investing in satellite manufacture.\n\nYet I'm still not convinced that this isn't an example of \"diworsification\" -- what we call it when a company spreads itself too thin doing too many things, rather than focusing on what it's best at. And I'm even less sanguine about the prospect of Honda and Toyota apparently trying to turn themselves into rocket companies.\n\nGranted, as CNBC points out, \"connected vehicles\" -- cars that talk to each other via satellite and receive internet service, location data, and software updates back -- could grow to be a $742 billion annual business by 2030. That sounds like an optimistic, pie-in-the-sky estimate to me, but I suppose it could happen.\n\nStill, just because somebody might make money from linking up satellites to cars, that doesn't necessarily mean that the car companies are the best ones to do it. It seems to me that this is an idea more likely to burn up shareholder capital than to help propel Honda and Toyota into the 25th century, \u00e0 la Buck Rogers.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA better way to invest in space\n\nAll of this is to say: If you start seeing press releases from publicly traded car companies, boasting of how forward-thinking they are and how they're investing in rocket technology, don't get too excited.",

Its features hint that the Japanese automaker may finally be getting serious about EVs, at least on the other side of the planet.\n\nThe bZ3x, or Bozhi 3X as it\u2019s locally called, is Toyota\u2019s cheapest EV in China. It starts at 109,800 yuan or $15,150 as of current exchange rates. The version equipped with lidar and self-driving features increases the price but not by much, starting at 149,800 yuan ($20,707).\n\nToyota operates in China under a joint venture with local partner GAC Group. It is aiming to grab a larger piece of China\u2019s burgeoning yet cutthroat new energy vehicle (NEV) market, where over a hundred brands are competing to stay relevant in the long term. Brands that fail to keep up with the fast-advancing EV tech risk getting wiped out. Toyota doesn\u2019t want to be in that position.\n\nGallery: Toyota bZ3X 14\n\nThe bZ3x isn\u2019t groundbreaking on the range and charging fronts, but it makes up for that in features. Toyota has launched seven trims of the bZ3x, five without lidar and two with it included. They are all equipped with a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery, varying in size depending on the version, between 50 and 58 kilowatt-hours.\n\nWith the larger battery, the range on the overly optimistic CLTC cycle is 520 kilometers (323 miles). Output isn\u2019t all that great either, with 200 horsepower and 147 pound-feet of torque. It appears to be using a 400-volt architecture, taking 24 minutes to charge from 30-80%.\n\nThe cabin is more reminiscent of a California start-up than something from Toyota, with a minimalist look. There's a 14.7-inch screen in the center powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip. It gets its \u201csmart driving system\u201d from Chinese autonomous driving startup Momenta, which includes hardware such as the Nvidia Drive Orin X chip offering up to 254 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of computing power.\n\nThe sensor suite is impressive for an EV that costs just $20,000. It gets one lidar, three long-range radars, 11 short-range ultrasonic radars, and 11 cameras.\n\nChina\u2019s traffic landscape is far more complex than the U.S., with many more two-wheelers, narrow roads and tricky intersections, so this sensor suite makes sense as companies race to develop more sophisticated driver aids.\n\nLocal reports also suggest that the model may be an instant hit given its low price, with Toyota getting 10,000 orders in the first 60 minutes and then the web server crashing due to a flood of visitors.\n\nHave a tip?

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nWith the exception of Nissan, Japanese car companies have been famously reluctant to bring competitive electric cars to market. On the other hand, the Japanese have always been good at tailoring their offerings to local markets. The EV revolution is in full swing in China, so if Honda and Toyota want to be successful at selling cars there, which is the largest new car market in the world today, they have to put aside their skittishness about EVs and get off the schneid. And while they are at it, they should offer Chinese customers what they want most, which is SUVs. According to two news reports, that is exactly what both Honda and Toyota are doing in cooperation with their Chinese joint venture partners.\n\nHonda Introduces S7 Electric SUV\n\nUnveiled in concept form last year, the Honda S7, built in conjunction with Dongfeng, is aimed directly at the Tesla Model Y, with similar dimensions and prices. It\u2019s a little bigger in some dimensions, but overall it should appeal to many buyers considering the Tesla offering. According to CarScoops, the S7 is available with either a single rear motor rated at 268 horsepower (200 kW) or dual motors with a combined output of 469 hp (350 kW). Both versions are equipped with an 89.8 kWh NMC battery pack. The S7 is 4,750 mm (187.0 inches) long, 1,930 mm (75.98 inches) wide, and 1,625 mm (64.02 inches) tall. Those dimensions are very close to the Model Y, except the Tesla is about 50 mm longer overall.\n\nIt is built on a relatively large 2,930 mm (115.4 inches) wheelbase with a minimum ground clearance of 193 mm (7.6 inches). This puts the S7 in the range of your average compact SUV for exterior dimensions, but with a wheelbase that is longer than many midsize SUVs. For comparison, the Honda Pilot, which is not a small car by any means, has a wheelbase that is nearly 2 inches shorter. The extra wheelbase of the S7 allows for 860 mm of rear seat legroom, an attribute meant to appeal specifically to Chinese customers.\n\nThe single-motor Honda S7, at \u00a5259,900 ($35,800), is priced to compete with the Tesla Model Y, the Onvo L60, and the Zeekr 7X. The dual-motor version starts at \u00a5309, 900 ($42,840). The single-motor car has a range of 650 km (404 miles) in the wildly optimistic CLTC test cycle. The all-wheel-drive car checks in at a little less than that \u2014 620 km (385 miles).\n\nCarScoops says the S7 stands out in a way that no other Honda sold in markets outside of China does, which will help it cut through the noise of China\u2019s crowded car market. Inside, the S7 leans heavily into tech and luxury. In the center of the front passenger compartment are two touchscreens oriented vertically \u2014 a 12.8-inch screen above and 10.25 inch screen below. Just ahead of the driver there is a 9.9 inch digital instrument cluster. Gone are the traditional side view mirrors, replaced by cameras and screens mounted on the doors.\n\nThe cabin of the electric Honda also features twin electrochroamatic glass roof panels for that open, airy feel. Audiophiles can opt for a 16-speaker Bose sound system that includes speakers in the front headrests. ADAS features include active cruise control, pre-collision warning, lane keeping assist, and parking assist. CnEVPost says that many media reports indicated the S7 may offer Honda Sensing 360+ as well as a Huawei smart driving solution for customers to choose from, but this did not become a reality. Is all that goodness enough to attract Chinese customers to the Honda brand? That is the question on everyone\u2019s mind at the moment.\n\nToyota bZ3X Gets 10,000 Orders In 60 Minutes\n\nToyota, which has been criticized for its unwillingness to adopt electric vehicles, unveiled its own electric SUV for the Chinese market this week. Known as the bZ3X, it starts at \u00a5109,800, or roughly $15,000. It received 10,000 orders in the first hour after Toyota and its joint venture partner GAC started taking orders for the car. For context, the GAC Toyota Highlander, similar to the one sold in North America, starts at \u00a5284,800 ($39,300), while the Camry starts at \u00a5171,800 ($23,700).\n\nThe base version of the bZ3X, called the 430 Air, comes with a 50 kWh LFP battery pack, which Toyota says is good for 430 km (267 miles) in the CTLC cycle. Toyota will also offer the bZ3X in 520 Pro for \u00a5120,980 ($16,700) and 520 Pro+ for \u00a5139,800 ($19,300) versions, both of which are equipped with a larger 58 kWh battery and a range of 520 km (323 miles). All 430 and 520 models feature a single 204 hp electric motor. The version offering the most range is the 610 Max, which has a 68 kWh pack and a range of 610 km (379 miles). It also has a more powerful 224 hp motor and starts at \u00a5159,800 ($22,000).\n\nTwo versions of the 520 Pro offering advanced driver-assistance systems have also been announced, priced at \u00a5149,800 ($20,700) and \u00a5159,800 ($22,000), respectively. These models include 11 cameras, 12 ultrasonic radars, 3 mm wave radars, and one LiDAR, all powered by the Nvidia Drive AGX Orin X. Inside, the bZ3X features a 14.6-inch infotainment display, an 8.8-inch digital instrument cluster, and an 11-speaker Yamaha audio system as standard equipment. The car itself measures 4,600 mm (181.1 inches) in length, 1,875 mm (73.8 inches) in width, and 1,645 mm (64.7 inches) in height, with a wheelbase of 2,765 mm (108.8 inches), meaning it\u2019s roughly the same size as a RAV4. It weighs in at 1,835 kg (4,045 lbs), which is fairly typical for this type of electric vehicle.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nHonda is clearly targeting the mid-level market for electric SUVs, while Toyota is attempting a more difficult task \u2014 competing head to head with the likes of BYD, which just this week introduced the Yuan Plus with built-in refrigerator and God\u2019s Eye ADAS for the startlingly low price of $15,970. The competition in China is brutal, but both Honda and Toyota have to compete with the best local brands. There\u2019s no more coasting on the strength of their name recognition. It\u2019s put up or shut up time for both companies and both have responded with competitive offerings in their respective classes. Now the sales totals will tell the tale. It\u2019s go big or go home time for both companies.\n\nThe one thing not in their favor is that Chinese customers are now showing a clear preference for cars manufactured by Chinese companies \u2014 a headwind that has affected sales of all cars that carry the branding of foreign legacy manufacturers like Porsche, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Renault, and others. If the new offerings from Honda and Toyota are a swing and a miss in the marketplace, both companies may no longer be able to maintain a presence in China.",

I know the transmissions are on back order, and some people have been waiting 3 months or more.\"\n\nThat's what Alex Gutierrez says happened to his 2021 Toyota Highlander. He is an owner and went to the Toyota Highlander Owners Club Facebook page to ask others if they have the same problem.\n\nThe shared experience is a resounding yes. Alex received 59 comments from other Highlander owners who have experienced similar transmission problems. In this report, I'll delve into what's happening and what Highlander owners need to know.\n\nAlex says, \"For some reason, Toyota doesn't take Infinity Insurance on its on-site rental. I bought the Highlander with 32,000 miles one year ago.\"\n\nPicture yourself buying a used Toyota Highlander because you can't afford the cost of a new XLE trim level that starts at $42,420. So you find a good used 2021 XSE with 32,000 miles, thinking it will last for another ten years because of Toyota's good reliability history.\n\nYou put 8,000 miles on the Highlander and start having transmission issues. You take it to the Toyota dealer where you bought the SUV, and they tell you you need a new transmission.\n\nThe good news is that the 2021 Toyota Highlander comes with a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty, so Toyota will pay for the transmission.\n\nHowever, they don't have transmissions available, so you'll have to wait three months to get a new one. Your insurance doesn't cover a rental, and you'll have to pay out of your pocket to get a rental car for three months.\n\nIt will cost you $9,986 to rent a similar-sized Ford Edge SUV for the three-month rental.\n\nYou'll be out nearly $10,000 to get the new transmission and have a rental car to drive while you wait.\n\nIs The Highlander Worth Fixing?\n\nNow you have a dilemma. Should you fix the car, sell it to Toyota, and trade it in for another model? You paid $32,000 for the 2021 Highlander and still owe $20,000 for the loan.\n\nToyota will only give you $25,000 for your Highlander. The offer will pay off your loan and give you $5,000 for a down payment on another vehicle.\n\nWhat Should You Do?\n\nShould you sell the Highlander to Toyota and get another used Highlander? However, you aren't thrilled about getting another Highlander. The Toyota dealer wants to sell you a new 2025 Highlander, making the offer attractive. Or so it seems.\n\nShould Buyers Avoid the 2020-2021 Highlander?\n\nSome 2020-2021 Highlander owners report transmission failure with the 8-speed transmission.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of the issue:\n\nTransmission Issues: Some owners report transmission failures, whining noises, and difficulty getting repairs or assistance from Toyota, even with extended warranties.\n\nSome owners report transmission failures, whining noises, and difficulty getting repairs or assistance from Toyota, even with extended warranties. 8-Speed Transmission: The UA80E and UA80F transmission models are specifically mentioned as being problematic.\n\nThe UA80E and UA80F transmission models are specifically mentioned as being problematic.

Reliability Concerns: There are concerns that the 2020-2021 Highlanders may not have the same level of reliability as previous generations.\n\nOne Highlander on Reddit asks the question. Should I keep it or sell it?\n\nabellferd says, Add me to the list of transmissions needing replacement. I have a 2020 Highlander XLE with 70,000 miles. Whining between 15 and 60 mph.\n\nThe dealer says it's a $9,600 repair job, and parts are a few weeks out. They are asking for help from Toyota, so hopefully, some will be covered there. If that comes back a no - should I get it fixed or sell it?\n\nIt still runs and drives fine, but it's my wife's daily driver, and I don't want to run the risk of her and the kids being stranded somewhere. Do I do a trade-in at a dealer if they don't lower the price because they don't notice?\n\nAnother Reddit user shares,\n\nWe have a 2019 Highlander XLE AWD, and the estimate for repair from Toyota is $10K out of pocket. The car cannot be driven and transmission has failed. Even with our agreement to pay, Toyota Corporation is unresponsive to the delivery of replacements.\n\nThe transmission is on backorder for 120 days. There are metal shavings in the fluid. The casing is intact, so it's defective. They also have not agreed to pay for a loaner. We are past warranty but only by 10-15 K.\n\nFender_jazzmaster says,\n\nI just got the news that our 2021 Highlander LE AWD with 54,000 miles needs a new transmission. We have an extended warranty, but the factory warranty still isn't up, so they are saying they won't provide a rental and that, technically, we can still drive it while we are waiting for a new transmission.\n\nThey don't have any transmissions available, so they will need to build one and send it to our local dealership, but who knows how long that will take? How can they not offer a loaner? Has anyone dealt with this before? I called the Toyota hotline, and they said it's the dealership's responsibility to provide a loaner (or not). The dealership refuses.\n\nFinal Thoughts and Questions For Toyota Highlander Owners\n\nAdvice for Potential Buyers:\n\nBecause of the Toyota Highlander transmission failure in the 2020-2021 model year, it's recommended to steer clear of these model years or opt for a hybrid version, which is generally considered more reliable.\n\nFor those considering a Toyota Highlander, buying an extended warranty that covers the vehicle beyond the 60,000-mile factory powertrain warranty is not just a good idea, it's a crucial step. Alex's experience shows that even with warranty coverage, a new transmission can take months to arrive, leaving you to foot the bill for a rental car.\n\nIt's Your Turn\n\nDo you own a Toyota Highlander, and have you had transmission issues?

            "content": "Next Chapter >\n\nWe\u2019ve all got \u2018em \u2013 videos that sparked our love for cars or channelled our interests in a particular direction.\n\nI could name a few, but one that stands out is a 21-second clip of a bright yellow MkIV Toyota Supra built by JUN, power-sliding at Tsukuba Circuit. I\u2019m not sure where I first saw it online, but in 2001 \u2013 four years before YouTube was a thing \u2013 you can bet I risked the prospect of 25 to life by downloading the bootlegged clip.\n\nThankfully, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nSo imagine my joy, when a few years later, I caught a glimpse of what appeared to be that very same car parked in a gravel lot across the road from JUN\u2019s Iruma shop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t know at the time was that this was the same Supra that had graced the covers of Max Power and Super Street magazines in late 2001, with a somewhat different outward appearance. A Supra that had reached the mind-numbing top speed of 401.20km/h (249.292mph) on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA.\n\nHow did I end up here? Back in 1999, I met JUN Auto Mechanic head Susumu \u2018God Hand\u2019 Koyama in New Zealand when he travelled here to compete in the Option Speed Trial with the JUN Super Impreza GC8 \u2013 a 580ps (572hp) beast that hit 309.1 km/h on a long and straight but bumpy and wet backroad. I knew I had to visit JUN, and in 2004, I came to Japan and was able to make it happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 20 years later, I\u2019m still humbled to have received personal tours of JUN\u2019s Nerima shop in Tokyo and JUN Auto Works/Auto Mechanic in Saitama from the company\u2019s founder, Junichi Tanaka.\n\nI didn\u2019t get to spend much time with the Supra \u2013 it was the end of the day, and I had a train to catch back to Tokyo. But I was lucky enough to get the car moved into a little open space in the parking lot for a few photos.\n\n\n\n\n\nJUN was founded in 1980, but its parent company\u2019s history dates back to 1946. After World War II, Tanaka-san\u2019s father founded Tanaka Industrial Co., repurposing machinery used for Japanese warplanes for automotive applications. For his entry into Japan\u2019s performance car tuning industry, Tanaka-san hired Koyama-san, a talented young mechanic, to head up operations, and JUN as we know it was born.\n\nThe latest turbocharger technology was the heart of JUN\u2019s operations, and the company quickly built a name for itself by building some of Japan\u2019s fastest and most powerful cars. Tuning car top-speed trials held at the now defunct Yatabe Test Track by Option magazine in the \u201980s became an early focus for Koyama-san. Then, in 1990, he took JUN to the global stage with multiple appearances at Bonneville in different cars. In 2001, JUN returned to the salt flats with its \u2018Akira Supra\u2019 \u2013 a demo car build started three years earlier from a stock 1993 Toyota Supra RZ.\n\nUnlike most cars in Bonneville\u2019s 200mph Club, JUN\u2019s Supra wasn\u2019t a purpose-built, tube-framed race car. It was a modified street car with some extra go-fast bits added (and removed) to allow it to reach 400km/h \u2013 a number Koyama-san had seen on the salt with previous builds.\n\nAround the same time JUN was in the USA with the Akira Supra, the bootlegged clip of the car power-sliding at Tsukuba made its way online, now known to have been ripped from Video Option Vol. 76, which came out in 2000. Thinking back, this might have been the very first \u2018viral\u2019 video to emerge from Japan\u2019s tuning scene, which was still largely a mystery at the time.\n\nThankfully, Option officially uploaded the full three-minute segment to YouTube a few years ago, so you can watch that by pressing the play button above. As it turns out, the Akira Supra had been brought to Tsukuba to see how fast it could lap the circuit, and on a warm-down lap, Option test driver Eiji \u2018Tarzan\u2019 Yamada decided to have some fun\u2026\n\nNot long after I first saw the power-slide clip, a friend loaned me a Video Option VHS tape from, I\u2019m guessing, around 2000 too. In the grainy footage, the Akira Supra was filmed ripping through the gears along the Tokyo Aqualine at over 300km/h \u2013 the Wangan benchmark of the golden era. It just got better.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven before I knew of its Bonneville exploits, the Akira Supra embodied everything amazing about the Japanese tuning scene at the time. It was a street car that could hit 300 km/h with ease and drift. It had a 2JZ-GTE engine built up to 3.2L with JUN prototype parts \u2013 forged crankshaft, forged rods and pistons, performance cams \u2013 and a T88 turbo. Gear shifts were made through a sequential gearbox, practically unheard of in street cars, and it was unmistakably a JUN creation with functional exterior mods and that signature yellow paint.\n\nFor the Bonneville attempt, the 2JZ engine was completely overhauled. In addition to strengthening and modifying the engine base for more power, Koyama-san added twin Trust/GReddy SPL T78-29D-14cm turbos, a prototype JUN intake manifold, and a fuel system up to the task. That system included a 120L tank, five Bosch Motorsport fuel pumps, and a dozen JUN 890cc injectors. Tuned through an HKS F-CON V Pro engine management system, the setup made nearly 1,400ps (1,380hp).\n\nThe driveline retained the same 6-speed Holinger sequential gearbox it had previously been fitted with, but a 2.238:1 final drive ratio was used in the rear end to ensure the Supra could mechanically hit 400 km/h. Combined with its aerodynamic modifications and a full flat steel underbody tray, the Supra averaged 240.192mph (386.55 km/h) over two runs in the E/BGCC class. Hitting 401.20km/h on one of the runs is what it\u2019s remembered for though.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it returned from Bonneville, the Akira Supra was converted back to its street car setup, with a single Trust/GReddy T88-34D-22cm turbo, a milder cylinder head specification, a pared-back fuel system, and a more road-friendly diff ratio. In this form, the power output was up to 950ps (937hp), running around 1.7bar (25psi) of boost. That\u2019s the spec you see here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe street version of the Akira Supra \u2013 JUN\u2019s original look for the car \u2013 perfectly reflected the late-\u201990s/early-\u201900s Japanese tuner style. The front bumper, vented and bulged hood, aero mirrors, and GT wing were all JUN parts, while the rear diffuser was a RE Amemiya piece. Completing the vision were gold 18-inch Advan Model 6 wheels \u2013 the same ones used at Bonneville \u2013 wrapped in Yokohama Advan semi-slicks.\n\nSince the Supra hadn\u2019t been cut up in its transition from road car to salt flats racer, it was easy for JUN to return it to street-spec. Despite its race upgrades, like a welded Cusco 10-point roll cage and a Recaro SPG seat, it benefited from some comforts, such as a full dash, front carpet, and door cards. Also kept in place was the originally-fitted suite of GReddy gauges, plus its then-state-of-the-art Stack 8100 digital dash display.\n\nIn the years following my 2004 encounter with the Akira Supra, nothing much was heard about the car, so I assume it spent more time parked up in the lot. Then, in 2011, JUN gave the Supra a full overhaul \u2013 repainting it silver with new yellow and orange graphics and refreshing the powertrain for circuit use.\n\nTwo years later, in early 2013, JUN put the car for sale, but it took until late 2014 for a purchase to be made. That seems like a long time given the asking price, which you might want to sit down for: \u00a56,000,000 before tax \u2013 that\u2019s just US$40,000 in today\u2019s money.\n\nI\u2019d love to know where the Supra ended up. There\u2019s online chatter that mentions Australia, but I can\u2019t confirm it. Hopefully someone out there can shed some light on its location and current form.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: of all the tuner cars built in Japan over the years, JUN\u2019s Supra might just be the greatest. It was an all-rounder like no other.\n\nUnfortunately, Tanaka-san passed away in 2019, aged 76, after an illness, and Koyama-san, who had battled illness for years, passed away in 2022, having gone on to found Koyama Racing Labo in 2009/2010. While these icons of Japanese performance tuning are sadly gone, JUN\u2019s legacy will live on forever through cars like the legendary Akira Supra.\n\nBrad Lord\n\nInstagram: speedhunters_brad",

Toyota has torture tested the GR Corolla in the crucible of competition to make it an impressive thing to drive on track, but it really excels when you get an opportunity to kick it sideways at speed. Despite the ice course being slippery as hell, the Corolla never made me feel like I was unsure where it would go. Once I got accustomed to the car and the course, it just did almost everything I wanted it to do. Place a wheel right there, whip the back end around with a scandi-flick right here, scrabble some grip and accelerate away right here. This zany little car just wanted to dance with me, despite the dancefloor being built from frozen water. Picture in your head a raccoon on linoleum, and you kind of understand what driving this manic attack instrument is like.\n\nWhile inducing throttle-on oversteer isn't exactly the quickest way around a winter rally course, it sure is fun as hell. The winter driving school \"race\" course included a really slick slow corner leading into a big sweeping left-hand bend that led onto the main straight, rising then falling up and over a crest. Giving the throttle a boot full of foot and four-wheel drifting out to the edge of the track, with the nose of the car skipping past the apex cone, man, that's one of the most pure feelings of joy the 2025 Human Experience can deliver. I wish I could feel like that all the time, but maybe on a gravel course so it wouldn't have to be so damn cold!\n\nWhen I reviewed the GR Corolla back in October, I said that it wasn't the perfect car, but it's damn close. I'd like to officially amend that statement slightly. The GR Corolla makes a damn fine daily driver, a capable track car, and a brilliant autocrosser, but this is as close as you can get to perfection when the grip goes away. It's just so f*cking fun.",

            "content": "Toyota\u2019s recently-announced development of a new hydrogen fuel cell for passenger and commercial autos opens a fresh set of questions about how that sustainable vehicle technology will advance amid a new presidential administration that generally opposes subsidies for renewable energy.\n\nIn a Feb. 14 press release, Toyota claimed its new, third-generation fuel cell will improve durability by a factor of up to two times that of the second generation, providing endurance similar to diesel engines. The new cell also improves fuel efficiency by 20% compared with the second generation, allowing for 20% greater cruising range, according to Toyota.\n\nThe new fuel cell is designed to be installed in passenger and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, as well as other general purpose uses, such as trains, ships and stationary generators, Toyota spokesperson Jacob Brown wrote in an email to Autobody News. The system provides \u201cimproved performance, more compactness, and reduced costs compared to the current generation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe new fuel cell will launch in 2026 at the earliest, in markets \u201cmainly\u201d in Japan, China, Europe and North America, Brown wrote.\n\nHowever, the new technology will inevitably have to reckon with the policies of a Trump administration that has ordered the elimination of the \u201celectric vehicle (EV) mandate,\u201d including state emissions waivers and subsidies that have generally advanced battery-electric vehicles.\n\nConsiderations for Collision Repair\n\nThe degree of the hydrogen-fueled vehicles\u2019 future market expansion will influence the collision repair industry, especially shops that want to add hydrogen-powered vehicles to their repair portfolio.\n\nCalifornia Hydrogen Business Council (CHBC) President and CEO Katrina Fritz told Autobody News she recently visited a maintenance facility for the Oakland-based public transportation agency AC Transit.\n\nIn addition to a vertical ventilation system, the garage in Alameda County has a catwalk for technicians to reach the roof of buses undergoing maintenance, because hydrogen fuel cells and associated batteries sit on top of the buses, she said.\n\n\u201cThere's not the engine compartment like there traditionally is in the front or the back of the vehicle,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cThey require training \u2026 in a new fuel, and in a new layout of the system. How do you safely handle the hydrogen? You have to ground it before you use the refueling. So there's a different way of doing it. But the same [general repair] principles apply.\u201d\n\nGrounding refers to the process of providing a path for unwanted positive or negative charges to flow into the electrically neutral earth.\n\nAs for Toyota\u2019s third-generation fuel cell system, \u201cthe diagnostic and other tech-based tools that technicians will need to work on the [vehicles] will come in conjunction with the rollout of that product to the various markets,\u201d Brown wrote in his email. \u201cWe don't have anything further to share on that at this time.\u201d\n\nRepair shop layouts -- particularly venting systems -- will have to account for the unique characteristics of hydrogen fuel as opposed to petroleum-based fuel, Fritz noted. \u201cYou have to different ventilation in the ceiling,\u201d Fritz said.\n\nHydrogen flares upward, unlike internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, which burn horizontally, she noted. Because of this, facilities that repair hydrogen-powered vehicles \u201chave these higher roofs, and they have ventilation systems,\u201d Fritz said.\n\nToyota says its third-generation hydrogen fuel cell will be up to twice as durable as the second generation.\n\nFederal investments could ultimately spur the creation of certification programs for vehicle technicians who want to specialize in hydrogen vehicles, she said.\n\nFritz pointed out that more than a dozen states have received federal funding for low-emission, hydrogen-powered buses through a handful of grants provided to regional \u201chubs,\u201d spanning areas like the Pacific Northwest, Appalachia, the Midwest, the Heartland and the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nFritz said labor unions generally support jobs created by these grants, because the funding supports the transition of local workforces into the decarbonized fuel industry.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to form these hubs to really spur the economies of scale,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cUltimately, that's to build out and connect the regions across the U.S.\u201d\n\nStaking a Claim and Competition\n\nToyota said in its press release it will continue to collaborate with local governments and other companies, associations and organizations toward \u201cthe realization of a hydrogen society.\u201d\n\nToyota is just one player in the renewable industry staking its claim for how sustainable vehicle development should evolve in the years ahead amid an uncertain political environment.\n\nThe Electric Vehicle Association (EVA) challenged the development of Toyota\u2019s new fuel cell, arguing that it detracts from battery electric vehicle development.\n\n\u201cWe consider fuel cell a diversion from the electrification of transportation,\u201d EVA spokesperson John Higham wrote in an email to Autobody News. \u201cFurther, we think that Toyota should be embarrassed about dragging out the fuel cell's inevitable demise for so long.\u201d\n\nToyota did not respond to a request for comment on EVA\u2019s quote.\n\nBattery electric vehicle infrastructure is currently in place for passenger vehicles, making it more practical today for basic consumers than hydrogen-powered cars, according to Ashley Lynn Qua, policy lead for EVA\u2019s New Jersey affiliate.\n\n\u201cWe already have that infrastructure built into people's homes, multi-unit dwellings, workplaces and everything else,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou don't have to go out and build a hydrogen station for those folks because the fueling infrastructure is already in their houses.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Toyota\u2019s announced rollout of hydrogen-powered passenger cars is feasible by 2026, Lynn Qua pointed to the significant investments in hydrogen-fueling infrastructure that would be required.\n\n\u201cDoes Toyota actually want to spend the money to put in the depots?\u201d she said. \u201cAre they going to be the next Tesla of the hydrogen industry trying to build out their own infrastructure network? \u2026 If the hydrogen industry is going to learn anything from the [EV] industry, you can't carry an entire industry as a solo brand on your back. It doesn't work.\u201d\n\nLast spring, Tesla laid off hundreds of employees on its charging team and announced it would roll out new charging stations at a slower rate than previously anticipated. News reports did not identify a direct cause of the mass layoffs, though a Bloomberg analysis found that only about 1.5% of the company\u2019s total revenue came from charging stations.\n\nPrivate Industry Collaboration and Subsidy Support\n\nPartnerships across companies are required to support any long-term, wide-scale, clean-energy infrastructure investment, Lynn Qua noted.\n\nBMW and Toyota released a joint announcement in September stating they are collaborating on developing the powertrain for a batch of hydrogen-fueled vehicles, with BMW planning to launch its first hydrogen-powered production model in 2028.\n\nFritz also pointed to several technology and transportation companies that are investing in hydrogen infrastructure.\n\nFor instance, firms like Pilot and Trillium Energy, a subsidiary of Love\u2019s Family of Companies, are installing hydrogen fueling infrastructure at truck stops, supported by both free-market demand and energy subsidies.\n\nShe said that free-market demand alone is not yet strong enough to support the hydrogen sector.\n\n\u201cWe need the regulatory drivers and we need continued support,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cThe hydrogen and fuel cell industry has not enjoyed 40 years of constant scaled subsidies the way solar, for example, has, and even batteries. We've had stop-start cycles as new administrations come in, come out. You have to reeducate.\u201d\n\nCHBC is asking the Trump administration and California government to leave in place current tax credits for clean energy, including hydrogen, Fritz said.\n\nClean hydrogen hubs have bipartisan support and exist in both Democrat- and Republican-leaning states, she added.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) refers to these projects as \u201cRegional Clean Hydrogen Hubs.\u201d\n\nDOE announced the last two grants under this program on Jan. 17, days before the new administration took office.\n\nDOE\u2019s Office of Clean Energy Development (OCED) provided $20 million for the Heartland Hydrogen Hub to begin \u201cPhase 1 activities\u201d under the leadership of the University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center. The first phase entails initial planning, design, and community and labor engagement activities.\n\nOCED also granted $18.8 million to the Mid-Atlantic Hydrogen Hub to start first-phase activities under the leadership of the public-private Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub, Inc. The activities will include clean hydrogen to be used for heavy-duty transportation, with refueling stations planned to serve sanitation trash trucks, street sweepers and fuel cell electric buses.\n\nDOE claims the two grants will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by the equivalent of more than 340,000 ICE cars.\n\nShifting Political Realities\n\nOne of the subtexts of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d executive order, and other Trump policies, is an effort to boost workforces that the White House deems to have been \u201cleft out in the cold,\u201d Lynn Qua said.\n\nAn anticipated slowdown of battery electric infrastructure subsidies could coincide with a resultant dearth in battery production, she noted.\n\nThe administration may not officially choose hydrogen to be a winner in the clean energy market, but the market could foreseeably respond to lower battery electric subsidies by investing more in hydrogen fuel cell production, Lynn Qua said.\n\n\u201cThe industry may say, \u2018All right, if electric is not the answer to the industry, then what is?\u2019\u201d Lynn Qua added. \u201cNow it's the question of whether or not hydrogen can catch up so they can take their move and they can actually surge into the market space if it's actually granted to them as an opening.\u201d\n\nFueling Infrastructure and Preliminary Launch Plans\n\nOne potential mitigating factor of hydrogen infrastructure costs is that fuel cells can be refueled within minutes compared with battery EVs, which must be plugged in for hours, Fritz noted.\n\nOEM companies like Toyota, Hyundai and BMW are looking to extend hydrogen fuel cell technology into both the commercial and passenger vehicle space, due to the perceived refueling efficiency of the technology, she said.\n\n\u201cFuel cells perform more like [the ICE vehicles] they're replacing,\u201d Fritz added. \u201cThey can be refueled very quickly. They can carry heavier payloads if you are putting them on a locomotive or on a long-haul truck.\u201d\n\nHyundai boasts its 2023 NEXO fuel cell refuels in five minutes and produces zero emissions. The company also announced in October a new \u201cINITIUM\u201d hydrogen fuel cell concept vehicle with a targeted driving range of more than 650 kilometers, tabbed to enter production in the first half of this year.\n\nThat SUV is also being designed to act as a power source, with potential to charge various household appliances, according to Hyundai\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cNotably, the outdoor terminal is designed to connect directly to a 220V household outlet, Hyundai stated, \u201ctransforming INITIUM from a means of transportation into a potential energy supplier.\u201d",

Feature Comparison Method MR701 Black Rhino Barstow Element EL Series Best Use Case Heavy Off-Road All-Around Premium Builds Construction Cast w/reinforcement Cast Aluminum Flow Formed Load Rating 1,800 lbs 1,900 lbs 2,200 lbs Warranty Limited Lifetime 5 Years Lifetime\n\nProfessional Installation Guide\n\nInstalling new wheels on your 4Runner isn\u2019t just about swapping metal \u2013 it\u2019s about doing it right to ensure your safety and the longevity of your investment. Let me walk you through everything you\u2019ll need and the process I\u2019ve refined over hundreds of installations.\n\nBefore you begin, gather your primary tools. You\u2019ll need a torque wrench rated for at least 100 ft-lbs and a 21 mm-deep socket for the lug nuts. A quality floor jack (2-ton minimum) and jack stands rated for 4,000+ lbs are crucial for safety. Round this out with wheel chocks (rubber is preferred), a breaker bar (18\u2033 or longer), anti-seize compound, a wire brush, and some shop towels.\n\nTo make the job easier, consider having these additional tools on hand: an impact wrench to save time on the initial loosening, a torque angle gauge for precision, an LED work light for better visibility, a rubber mallet for stubborn wheels, and a digital tire pressure gauge for final checks.\n\nInstallation Process\n\n1. Preparation (15 minutes)\n\nThe key to a smooth installation starts with proper preparation. Find a level spot in your garage or driveway \u2013 this isn\u2019t negotiable. Engage your parking brake and place wheel chocks on the opposite end of where you\u2019ll start working. Clean all lug nuts and studs thoroughly, removing any old anti-seize compound. I like to lay out all my tools and new wheels in order of use \u2013 trust me, this saves time and headaches later.\n\n2. Initial Loosening (10 minutes)\n\nMany people skip this crucial step: loosen all lug nuts while the wheels are still on the ground. You\u2019ll only loosen them about a quarter turn\u2014just enough to break the initial torque. Your breaker bar is your best friend for stubborn lugs that won\u2019t budge (we\u2019ve all been there). The extra leverage makes all the difference.\n\n3. Lifting Process (15 minutes)\n\nSafety is paramount when lifting your 4Runner. Locate the proper jack points \u2013 they\u2019re marked under your vehicle for a reason. Place your jack stands under the designated points and lift one corner at a time. Never rush this process, and never work under a vehicle supported only by a jack. Once lifted, give your 4Runner a firm shake to verify stability. This might seem excessive, but it\u2019s better to catch a stability issue now than when you\u2019re underneath.\n\n4. Wheel Installation (30 minutes)\n\nThis is where attention to detail matters. After removing the old wheels, thoroughly clean the hub surface \u2013 any debris here can cause problems later. When mounting the new wheel, apply only a tiny anti-seize to the lug threads. Keep it away from the wheel seats and mating surfaces like it\u2019s your job \u2013 because it is.\n\nThe torque sequence is critical and requires three passes:\n\nThe first pass at 30 ft-lbs in a star pattern The second pass at 60 ft-lbs, maintaining the same pattern Final pass at 89 ft-lbs to complete the sequence\n\nPro tip: Mark each lug with a paint marker after the final torque. This will help you quickly spot any that have loosened during post-installation checks.\n\nCommon Installation Mistakes\n\nI\u2019ve seen plenty of wheel installations go wrong over the years. Never use an impact wrench for final tightening \u2013 I don\u2019t care how good you think your trigger control is. Over-torquing isn\u2019t better; it\u2019s dangerous. And please, don\u2019t skip the re-torque after a break-in. These aren\u2019t just guidelines \u2013 lessons learned the hard way by many before you.\n\nHere are Some Advanced Maintenance Schedule\n\nYour wheel maintenance journey doesn\u2019t end with installation. A proper maintenance schedule is crucial for longevity and safety. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found works best:\n\nWeekly Maintenance\n\nTake five minutes each week to check your wheels quickly but thoroughly. Run your hands over the lug nuts\u2014you\u2019d be surprised how often you can feel a loose one before it becomes a problem. While at it, verify your tire pressures when the wheels are cold and visually inspect everything for damage or corrosion.\n\nCritical Post-Installation Checks\n\nThe first 100 miles are crucial for new wheel installations. Check your torque at 50 miles and again at 100. Keep a log of these readings\u2014this documentation can be invaluable for troubleshooting any issues that might develop.\n\nMonthly Care\n\nSet aside 30 minutes each month for deeper maintenance. Use a pH-neutral soap for cleaning\u2014harsh chemicals can damage the finish. This is also the time to inspect for hairline cracks and check your valve stems for leaks. If equipped, don\u2019t forget to test your TPMS function.\n\nQuarterly Deep Dive\n\nPlan for a more thorough inspection once every three months. Remove each wheel to clean the backside and inspect your brake components. This is also the perfect time to verify the condition of your spare wheel, which is often overlooked until needed.\n\nAnnual Professional Service\n\nSome things are best left to the professionals. Schedule an annual service for:\n\nComplete wheel removal and inspection\n\nProfessional balance check\n\nRotation based on wear patterns\n\nFull alignment verification\n\nTPMS sensor battery check\n\nComprehensive torque verification.\n\nEmergency Inspections\n\nCertain situations demand immediate attention. After any hard impacts, if you notice new vibrations before and after long trips, following off-road adventures, or after exposure to extreme weather, take time for a thorough inspection. These unscheduled checks can prevent minor issues from becoming major problems.\n\nRemember, maintaining a detailed log of all service dates and torque readings is good practice, invaluable for troubleshooting, and can even help with resale value.\n\nYou can shop unbeatable deals on aftermarket wheels for your Camaro. Enjoy discounted Wheel Warehouse wheel and tire packages that give you premium rims without overspending.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAfter years of testing and thousands of miles on the trails, these three-wheel options represent the best choices for your 4Runner in 2024. The Method MR701 is my top pick for serious off-roading, the Black Rhino Barstow offers incredible value for daily drivers who hit the trails on weekends, and the Element EL Series is simply the best money can buy.\n\nAfter thousands of miles of testing, these wheels have repeatedly proven themselves. But if you\u2019re still exploring options, Discounted Wheel Warehouse offers an extensive range to match your 4Runner\u2019s needs, whether hitting trails or cruising city streets.\n\nRemember, the perfect wheel is the one that matches your driving style and maintenance commitment. Don\u2019t just chase the latest trends \u2013 think about how you\u2019ll use your 4Runner and choose accordingly.\n\nFAQ: Real Questions from Real 4Runner Owners",

            "content": "The electric SUV is a little larger than a BYD Atto 3 and offered with three different battery packs.\n\nEntry-level and mid-range models have a motor with 204 hp, while the flagship delivers 224 hp.\n\nToyota sells two models equipped with an advanced driver-assistance system powered by Nvidia.\n\nChina is quickly establishing itself as the global epicenter for affordable electric vehicles, and for good reason. However, most of the budget-friendly EVs have come from homegrown brands that have been able to work around the traditional constraints that have slowed down legacy automakers.\n\nBut now, even Toyota, a legacy company that\u2019s been criticized for its sluggishness in adopting electric vehicles, is jumping into the fray with a shockingly low starting price in the Chinese market, especially considering its size and features.\n\nSee: Everything We Know About The 2026 Toyota RAV4\n\nThe vehicle in question is the bZ3X and it\u2019s been brought to life thanks to Toyota\u2019s joint venture with GAC. It was first presented in December, but sales of it only just started. It\u2019s proven to be so popular that more than 10,000 orders were placed for it within an hour, causing the system to crash. Looking at what shoppers will be getting for their money, it\u2019s easy to understand why the bZ3X is so red hot.\n\nPricing Details\n\nPrices for the electric SUV start at 109,800 yuan, or roughly $15,000 at current exchange rates. Considering the compact SUV\u2019s size and features, that\u2019s an incredibly competitive price. For context, the GAC Toyota Highlander, similar to the one sold in North America, starts at 284,800 yuan ($39,300), while the Camry starts at 171,800 yuan ($23,700).\n\nAt that price, you\u2019re getting the base version of the bZ3X, called the 430 Air. It comes with a 50.03 kWh LFP battery pack. While that\u2019s on the smaller side for an SUV of this size, Toyota claims it\u2019s good for 267 miles (430 km) of range on the CTLC cycle. However, since China\u2019s testing cycle tends to be extremely generous, the real-world range will likely be closer to 250 miles (402 km). If you\u2019re looking for a bit more equipment, there\u2019s also a slightly upgraded 430 Air+ version available, starting at 119,800 yuan (~$16,500).\n\nToyota will also offer the bZ3X in 520 Pro (\u00a5120,980 / ~$16,700) and 520 Pro+ (\u00a5139,800 / ~$19,300) guises, both of which use a larger 58.37 kWh battery and have a quoted range of 323 miles (520 km). All 430 and 520 models feature a single 204 hp electric motor. The version offering the most range is the 610 Max, rocking a 67.92 kWh pack and good for 379 miles (610 km) on a charge. It also has a more powerful 224 hp motor. It starts at \u00a5159,800 (~$22,000)\n\nTwo versions of the 520 Pro offering advanced driver-assistance systems have also been announced, priced at \u00a5149,800 (~$20,700) and \u00a5159,800 (~$22,000), respectively. These models include 11 cameras, 12 ultrasonic radars, 3mm wave radars, and one LiDAR, all powered by the Nvidia Drive AGX Orin X.\n\nThe cabin of the bZ3X certainly isn\u2019t super-luxurious as far as Chinese-built EVs go, but it does look decent. It features a 14.6-inch infotainment display, an 8.8-inch digital instrument cluster, and an 11-speaker Yamaha audio system, all fitted as standard.\n\nThe SUV itself measures 4,600 mm (181.1 inches) in length, 1,875 mm (73.8 inches) in width, and 1,645 mm (64.7 inches) in height, with a wheelbase of 2,765 mm (108.8 inches), meaning it\u2019s roughly the same size as a RAV4 It weighs in at 1,835 kg (4,045 lbs), which is fairly typical for this type of electric vehicle.\n\nToyota\u2019s latest EV measures 4,600 mm (181.1 inches) in length, 1,875 mm (73.8 inches) in width, and 1,645 mm (64.7 inches) in height, with a wheelbase of 2,765 mm (108.8 inches). It tips the scales at 1,835 kg (4,045 lbs).",

The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. The company\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits.\n\n\n\nThe Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $29.50-$30 band in 2025. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividend payments.\n\n\n\nHowever, declining membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. We expect medical costs to jump over 14% YoY in 2025. A debt-laden balance sheet induces an increase in interest expenses.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of SAP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+48% vs. +2.6%). The company is gaining momentum from growing cloud demand, especially rising adoption of its Rise with SAP and Grow with SAP solutions. Continued strength in the Cloud ERP Suite sales is driving its cloud revenues.\n\n\n\nSteady growth in Cloud backlog at the end of 2024 is an encouraging development. By prioritizing Business AI and Joule development, the company targets to drive top-line expansion through 2027. Also, its healthy profit and cash flow statements position it for long-term growth.\n\n\n\nSAP\u2019s revised 2025 outlook succeeds the previous Ambition 2025 strategy. It now expects cloud and software sales in the \u20ac33.1-\u20ac33.6 billion band, up from the prior forecast of \u20ac29.83 billion at cc. However, continued softness in the Software license and support business weighs on its performance. Increasing restructuring costs dampens its margins.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on SAP here >>>)\n\n\n\nToyota Motor\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past six months (+9.3% vs. +9%). The surge in hybrid adoption is driving the company\u2019s sales, supported by strategic initiatives to accelerate growth and enhance profitability.\n\n\n\nToyota Motor is working to restore production to normal levels. While prioritizing hybrids, Toyota remains committed to the BEV market, with plans to introduce solid-state batteries that promise extended range and lower production costs. Investor-friendly moves further bolster optimism.\n\n\n\nHowever, significant investments in human capital and expansion initiatives are expected to weigh on operating profits this fiscal year. Elevated R&D expenditures on advanced technologies and alternative fuels support long-term innovation but may constrain near-term margins. Rising debt levels also pose financial challenges. The stock warrants a cautious stance now.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota Motor here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Better Choice have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-75% vs. -8.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $3.29 million is dependent on Asia-Pacific, which exposes the company to regulatory, economic, and competitive risks, while liquidity concerns persist despite recent capital raises. Elevated costs for marketing and supply chain improvements remain a challenge.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Better Choice delivered its first profitable quarter in Q3 2024 with adjusted EBITDA of over $0.2 million and gross margins reaching 40%, driven by operational efficiencies and inventory reductions. Strong supply chain performance (97% fill rates) positions the company for sustained growth.\n\n\n\nAsia-Pacific remains a key driver, fueled by China\u2019s doubling pet ownership trends and demand for premium brands like Halo. The SRx Health acquisition adds scale and enables entry into veterinary pharmaceuticals, enhancing diversification. Digital sales gained momentum, with double-digit subscription growth and a 20% rise in repeat purchases.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Better Choice here >>>)",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nAs someone who is following what goes on in Toyota's kitchen, I am curious to learn about the experience of other owners. Toyota Tacoma is, currently, the most popular midsize truck in the US, despite some owners reporting various issues. That said, it appears the third-generation isn't without its faults either as my latest find on ToyotaNation.com discovered.\n\nAn older thread regarding 2023 Tacoma transmission issues is being revisited by members, and since, it has become a thread for various other issues that plague the Toyota truck. The latest addition is from March 4, 2025, where a member speaks of various issues that have become so annoying that he is considering (for the first time ever) changing the brand. Here's what deross68 says:\n\n\u201cI love Toyota. I've owned the corolla, Camry Solara, Tacoma. Loved! 2019 Tacoma had a smaller screen than my phone was annoying. Bought my 2023 TRD Off-road and man do I regret it. Kinda stuck seeing the latest issues they're acknowledging with their newer models. Hope they get it together as I'm ready to get a better, less needy truck. #disappointed.\n\nFirst the bearing in my tailgate fails, little plastic bearing btw. Had to pay out of pocket although numerous postings of the same issue. Next, a message to bring to dealer asap for sensor issues, just cleared the code and again out of pocket. Transmission lags at random, of course not while being serviced therefore out of pocket again. Now I'm receiving messages that my battery is low. 2023 has 17,400 miles. Willing to bet this is out of my pocket too. I'm about to trade back down to a 2019. Ridiculous.\u201d\n\nIt seems the third-generation Toyota Tacoma continues to suffer from a variety of issues, even in its last model year.\n\nAccording to RepairPal, the 2023 Toyota Tacoma has a reliability rating of 3.5 out of 5, which is average for the midsize pickup truck segment, and far below the average for a Toyota. I recently reported on another Tacoma issue, this time a 2022 model, which isn't as serious at first glance but still enough to worry truck owners who depend on their Toyota to always perform. Traditionally, late model years are less prone to issues than their early counterparts, but it seems this may not be the case for the third-generation Tacoma.\n\nWhile some of these are known to be common issues for the 2023 Toyota Tacoma (like the sensor issues), it seems dealers are not willing to fix them under warranty, at least according to this owner. There are 25 common problems found on the 2023 Toyota Tacoma, but the plastic tailgate bearing is not among them.\n\nSome owners blame Tacoma's reliability on the manufacturing process\n\nTo be more specific, many owners blame the fact that since 2005, some Toyota Tacoma variants have been built in Mexico - Apaseo El Grande and Tijuana. The third-generation Tacoma is also built in San Antonio, Texas, but only until 2021, so if you have a 2023 Toyota Tacoma, it is built in Tijuana, Mexico. Whether that's the main culprit for the reliability issues is academic at this point, but let's see what other owners are saying.\n\nToto says: \u201cAt least some Tacomas have been made in Mexico since the beginning of Gen 2 or 2005. Some parts for all Tacomas (including the composite bed) were made in Mexico and shipped to the plant in the US where other Tacomas were made.\n\nCOVID affected the quality of everything. I think all cars have suffered since then.\"\n\nDeross68 adds: \u201cI agree. Mine was actually made in Mexico. I ordered it and watched its delivery progress online as it came via ship across the ocean. I was ready to upgrade as I'm not impressed with this truck. Unfortunately, they're now having transmission issues. I'm just waiting it out for now.\n\nI get it about the battery. I think it's odd to have battery issues already, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing is made to last long nowadays. Soon we'll plugging them in anyhow\u201d.\n\nSome of these problems are becoming more common and plaguing even newer generations, after less than a year of ownership. Even some 2024 Toyota Tacoma owners are experiencing battery issues, among others.\n\nThe owner and thread-started mentions that he also uses LoJack, which is an aftermarket add-on system that utilizes GPS to help locate the vehicle in case it is stolen.\n\nToto says: \u201cLojack is an aftermarket add-on that draws power, so maybe it's part of the reason why there's a battery issue.\n\n\n\nBatteries are made by maybe three companies in North America. No car maker makes their own batteries. And batteries are not exactly a precision piece of equipment. They're very much luck-of-the-draw these days.\u201d\n\nThe FAQ section on LoJack's website claims that the unit may draw a very small amount from your vehicle's battery power. Seeing that the product reviews are generally positive, it seems unlikely that this is the culprit.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Toyota's quality in the past few years? Between the new Toyota V-6 engine having issues, does this shake your trust in the Japanee brand? If you own a newer Toyota model, I would love to hear your thoughts.

            "content": "My car identifying skills have suffered a bit over the years, but I can still be pretty sure when I\u2019m looking at a late model product or something that was on its third owner.\n\nI was sort of shocked the other day when I saw a car that appeared to new but somehow had all of the trappings of something that went off of warranty years ago. You know the look- black primer over the rusted wheel arches, unpainted replacement front fenders from some altercation, strange Autozone tape stripes in back. The car I saw even had a strange combination of those chrome stick-on badges you also get at a car parts store in back; something like bZ4X. Is that an allusion to some meme?\n\nLook, I\u2019m not being serious, but in the few cases where I\u2019ve seen the rather rare Toyota entry into the full EV market I do get some of those feelings:\n\nIt\u2019s actually been a bit since the bZ4X was introduced for the 2023 model year; I have not warmed to its looks yet and I doubt that I ever will. Honestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone since sales have been surprisingly tepid; only 18,570 bZ4X found buyers last year (which is still a vast improvement over the 9,329 sold in 2023). You would think that the first real fully-electric car from one of the world\u2019s largest and most respected car makers would be a gangbusters hit. Toyota essentially invented the whole hybrid market two decades ago; this thing should have put the Tesla Model Y and 3 on notice.\n\nInstead, this thing is struggling to even be a niche player, and we\u2019ve pointed out a number of reasons why. The range is about 50 miles short of what it really should be, it might not qualify for certain tax credits, and the cabin is not especially large. Virtually everyone has laughed at the \u201cBees Forks\u201d name of Toyota\u2019s latest EV, and more than a few commenters have torn into the appearance of Toyota\u2019s EV, including on this site:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhoa, they let loose on this thing! They weren\u2019t even done, and I didn\u2019t even pull all of them from the various bZ4X posts:\n\nHarsh words there, and I don\u2019t necessarily disagree. Notice that there are some Toyota People in there as well so that\u2019s doubly damning. Indeed, the Toyota name alone should be worth enough to outweigh those issues for many, but that\u2019s not enough.\n\nThe sad thing is that the basic shape of the bZ4X is hardly ugly; maybe not ultra-distinctive but not even remotely offensive. I do think that the car is salvageable with some quick cosmetic modifications, or at least worth a try.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n4X In The Road\n\nThe real question many have is why the Bees Forks looks the way it does in the first place? Going back a ways to when Jason first reviewed the bZ4X, the reasoning he got from the staff on hand was that they wanted an appearance that set it apart from the Prius and their other hybrids. They apparently were searching for a different approach to the looks as opposed to assimilating the styling into their ICE lineup. Sure, that\u2019s fine, but the looks of their primary hybrid, the Prius, have finally reached a point where they\u2019re quite pleasing.\n\nThe bZ4X, on the other hand, looks like it could be any one of the myriad Chinese EVs you see pictures of on this site, though many of those pull of the look much better. What\u2019s even more damning is that Toyota has been showing concepts for another upcoming bZ-family EV that features little of the strange aesthetic of the current car. Honestly, despite the spokesperson\u2019s pitch to Jason, it looks far more like a Prius (and much better):\n\nThe BZ4x is trying to be different, but it\u2019s also attempting to do some other things with the styling to fool your eyes; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really succeeding at either.\n\nWhy the black trim? I am just making a wild-ass guess here, but my feeling is that at some point a designer at Toyota did a concept sketch for the bZ4X that looked much like this vaporware that the \u201cnew\u201d Delorean company has shown:\n\nThis basic shape has appeared on screens of students and car designers around the world for the last decade; type \u201cfuture off roader\u201d into Google, hit \u201cimages\u201d and you\u2019ll see a bunch of them. There\u2019s a reason that it\u2019s never seen the light of day; regulations in most countries won\u2019t allow for such open wheel layouts to hit the street.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI could be totally off, but my feeling is that Toyota thought that they could replicate this appearance by just throwing black \u201cfillers\u201d into what would have been the open areas of their initial concept to replicate the look. They even imagined that such an eye trick would make the wheel wells appear bigger and, in turn, the tires seem much more Baja 1000-worthy.\n\nAs many have pointed out, it just doesn\u2019t work. Instead of making the viewer see tough off-roader the end result unfortunately looks a lot like the Chicago Twingo that Mercedes Streeter reported on recently where the brave owner found a new black primer-covered replacement front fender but didn\u2019t have the time or scratch available to paint it body color:\n\nIn back it\u2019s much of the same. The dog-bone taillight gives the appearance of a RAV4 that\u2019s been crying after horrible dinner party and now black mascara is running down her cheeks. Again, it looks like vestiges of something on an earlier concept that didn\u2019t make the production cut and now we just have this awkward appendage left over. Overall, it\u2019s a rather unfortunate looking piece and the styling can\u2019t be helping sales.\n\nHere\u2019s my biggest fear, though; in a few years we\u2019ll need a third car for the kids to get to school and activities in. My wife will likely want to buy used electric, and with Cars I Buy, Maintain And Fix But Never Drive my rule is usually anything as long as it\u2019s a Toyota. I was in denial that some time I\u2019d be writing a check for an RX300 or an LX570, and sure enough the day came for each of them. But this? How could I live with the Bees Forks in my driveway? Well, I have Photoshop, and at the office a nice vinyl cutter and $35,000 3D printer at my disposal (with spools of ABS) after hours. Time to put them to work.\n\nLet\u2019s Stick A 4X In It\n\nBefore we do anything else, I simply can\u2019t type that stupid name one more time. Yes, I know that \u201cbZ4X\u201d is supposed to be the first of a combination of letters and numbers to signify a family of electric vehicles that Toyota is introducing. I really don\u2019t care; I know that Declan McManus and Marshall Mathers had reasons for their names but they would never have become pop stars with such titles. We\u2019ve got to change the name. Sorry Bees Forks, you\u2019re now the Toyota Cresta.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFirst, the wheel arches get covered in vinyl to match the body color (or we wrap the whole thing), leaving just the black lip around the openings visible. I\u2019ve left the fake brake air intakes since they actually look decent. In front, I\u2019ve added more body-colored vinyl on the strip between the headlights for a slimmer look. The nose is just too much of an expanse so there I\u2019ve added a black vinyl pattern based on other current Toyota cars like the Camry and Crown to break up the space. If we want, I can 3D print a grille pattern to match the pattern above. I\u2019ve even added some body color above the headlights since those black gaps just look like pop up lights that don\u2019t fit properly.\n\nHere\u2019s the original car:\n\nThe modified one:\n\n..and the animation of the two:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the rear, the lower part of the dog bone ends are covered up to create a simple band taillight; here I\u2019ll do the opposite of the grille and put some black vinyl across for a uniform height left to right. Here\u2019s the original car:\n\nYou\u2019ll also see that some models of bZ4X (like the one shown) have these odd \u201cwinglets\u201d coming off of the sides of the hatch just above the rear window. BMW does a bit of this as well so it\u2019s a common current styling feature, and personally I think it\u2019s sill 2025 versions of 1950s tailfins. I doubt that they improve aerodynamics, and it looks like the ears on Pikachu\u2019s head. I\u2019d 3D print a piece to fill the gap between the two pieces as seen above, maybe even adding an auxiliary fog light so that Jason won\u2019t complain about me running the hazard flashers in bad weather.\n\nThe modified car:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe animation of the original and new:\n\nOh, and one last thing based on Jason\u2019s ask from his initial review; as expected he hated the lack of frunk on the bZ4X-now-Cresta:\n\nHe asked if we could at least have a very shallow frunk for charging cables or small items so you won\u2019t have to unload the cargo area to get to them (yes, I forgot to add a cutout for the washer filler):\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHave we made the Busy Forks blander? You might say that, but if so, I\u2019ve done my job. Seriously, let\u2019s keep some things in mind. First of all, the main competitor for this thing is likely a Tesla, and Model 3 and Model Ys are hardly had the most standout styling when they were introduced years ago; they look even less distinctive now. Say what you want about them, but the entry-level Teslas are hardly hurting in the sales department; their 2024 numbers of 189,903 Model 3s and a whopping 372,113 Model Ys impressive. That\u2019s thirty-one times what the world\u2019s largest auto maker could muster with their bZ4X. Rising EV sellers like the Prologue are hardly rocking the boat with their styling; the clean-looking minimal-bullshit Ioniq 5 and Mustang Mach E are also finding plenty of buyers.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, Toyotas have always been known for conservative reliability; the shopper that goes into the showroom to meet Jan is typically not pining for an outrageous looking car. Toyota buyers historically want a \u201cnice looking\u201d machine that won\u2019t express non-existent individuality. The reputation is what sells these things, not the styling. Laugh all you want, but it\u2019s made them one of the world\u2019s biggest auto makers. Seriously, I don\u2019t really even like most Toyotas but I\u2019ve spent tens of thousands on them over the last twenty years, and will do so again.\n\nMaybe a makeover still wouldn\u2019t give Tesla something to worry about, but it might at least ruin part of their day.\n\nWhat the Fork, Toyota?\n\nIs there anyone out there that likes the looks of the bZ4X? If I were Toyota, I\u2019d seriously consider these easy-to-make changes. It\u2019s just not a bad looking car under all of that weird makeup.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI really hope that a Bees Forks isn\u2019t in my future, but all signs on the Magic 8 Ball point to VERY LIKELY. Let\u2019s face it- I\u2019m not buying a used Tesla and somehow my guess is that the competitive non-Toyota EVs will have lost much of their 50-mile range advantage and maybe even be falling apart by the time I\u2019m ready to buy one as a Kid Kar in four or five years. It\u2019s a good bet that the bZ4X will still be running and looking like new, even you don\u2019t want it to.\n\nYou can\u2019t kill a Toyota, but we can kill ugly.\n\nHow I Would Tweak The New Jaguar 00 Into Something I Might Actually Buy \u2013 The Autopian\n\nLet\u2019s Raid The BMW Parts Bin To Make A Real Toyota Supra GT \u2013 The Autopian\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe \u2018Personal Luxury Coupe\u2019 Car-Segment Used To Be Huge.

Engine torque has been increased from 273 lb.-ft. to 295 lb.-ft., and suspension upgrades give the GR Corolla\u2019s handling characteristics a nudge. The front bumper is redesigned to accommodate newly available cooling components.\n\nThere are three 2025 GR Corolla trims: Core, Premium, and Premium Plus. All three are powered by the same 1.6-liter three-cylinder turbo engine capable of generating that whopping 300 horsepower.\n\nEPA ratings are 19 mpg city, 27 mpg highway, and 22 mpg combined. Premium unleaded gasoline is required.\n\nThe Premium Plus model is new for 2025 and has a forged carbon fiber roof, vented bulge hood, and 18-inch matte black wheels. A head-up display also comes standard on the Premium Plus.\n\nGR Corolla is a five-passenger four-door hatchback with a front engine and all-wheel drive. Pricing starts at $38,860 for the Core model with a manual transmission.\n\nI drove the new Premium Plus with an automatic transmission. It\u2019s not just a certainly fine transmission. It\u2019s a super Gazoo Racing Direct Automatic Transmission (DAT), crafted by engineers focused on achieving the fastest possible downshift speed.\n\nOptimized for sporty driving, the DAT control software delicately senses the way the driver steps on the brakes and operates the accelerator. With these inputs, it anticipates when gear shifting is optimal even before changes in vehicle behavior occur, achieving a gear selection that reflects the driver\u2019s intentions, which leads to shifting that is similar to that of professional drivers.\n\nYou can imagine how underchallenged the DAT was with me as the driver.\n\nI once road shotgun with Hurley Haywood while he drove hot laps at Laguna Seca, and that will always be the impossible benchmark by which I assess my driving skills.\n\nTo experience the GR Corolla\u2019s ability to the utmost requires a racetrack setting. But even within the confines of Snohomish County public roads, I was fully awed by this little car\u2019s acceleration and cornering talents, and knew it was a masterpiece.\n\nFor anyone wondering if the 2025 Toyota GR Corolla offers anything other than thrills: It is comfortable, civilized, and practical enough for pleasant daily driving.\n\n2025 TOYOTA GR COROLLA PREMIUM PLUS\n\nBase price: $47,515\n\nPrice as driven: $50,024\n\nMary Lowry is a member of the Motor Press Guild and a member and past president of the Northwest Automotive Press Association.

Ford Australia\u2019s Director of Marketing, Ambrose Henderson, recently did just that, taking aim at the new Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, all while defending the Ford Everest as the true champion of rugged SUVs.\n\nMore: New Ford Everest Tremor Brings Raptor Vibes To Ranger SUV\n\nThe Ford Everest directly competes with truck-based SUVs like the Toyota Fortuner, Mitsubishi Pajero Sport, and Isuzu MU-X. It also goes head-to-head with the newer Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, which is currently available as a 7-seater, unlike the 5-seater North American Land Cruiser.\n\nFord vs. Toyota\n\nIn a media chat with Australian outlets, Henderson was asked about the Toyota Land Cruiser, and according to CarExpert, his response was anything but subtle. He acknowledged the Prado\u2019s legacy but took the opportunity to highlight Ford\u2019s \u201cno-compromise\u201d approach:\n\n\u201cThe model you speak of is a formidable competitor, and it\u2019s had a very long run of having wonderful products in these spaces. But I think when you compare our products back to back, you can see where we\u2019ve made strategic decisions not to compromise, and others may have compromised items that are very important to customers in these segments \u2013 as an example, being able to fit your luggage in the boot,\u201d he said.\n\nThe boot space behind the third row of seats in the Ford Everest and the Toyota Land Cruiser.\n\nHenderson went on to emphasize Ford\u2019s customer-first philosophy: \u201cTop of mind for us in everything we do is delivering customers what they want and what they\u2019re telling us, and making no compromise on that. We have to run our own race, and we\u2019re really confident in the range that we\u2019ve put forward and the value proposition that presents to customers as well\u201d.\n\nWhile Henderson\u2019s criticism was broader, he used the boot space of the seven-seater Land Cruiser Prado as a key example. In his view, the Prado\u2019s 182 liters (6.4 cubic feet) behind the third row just didn\u2019t measure up. Meanwhile, the Everest boasts 259 liters (9.1 cubic feet) of luggage space in its seven-seater configuration, seemingly a better fit for those hauling gear and kids.\n\nFord also claims that the Everest can hold 259 liters (9.1 cubic feet) of luggage in the seven-seater setup, while the five-seater version offers a much larger 898 liters (31.7 cubic feet).\n\nWhat About the Compromises?\n\nHenderson\u2019s mention of \u201ccompromises\u201d might have left some wondering exactly what else he\u2019s referring to in the Land Cruiser Prado. While the comment about boot space is easy enough to track, it\u2019s less clear what other sacrifices Ford is pointing to. But hey, automakers are notorious for benchmarking their rivals\u2019 products, so Henderson likely knows exactly where the Prado might be lacking.\n\nMore: Aussie 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser Prado Gets A Weird Grille Option\n\nHe also had some thoughts about Ford\u2019s own Ranger pickup, calling it \u201cthe only product in that segment that offers an electrification solution that doesn\u2019t lose any capabilities.\u201d With a hefty towing capacity of 3.5 tonnes and solid off-road chops, Henderson seemed to have Chinese competitors like the plug-in hybrid BYD Shark 6 and GWM Cannon Alpha PHEV.\n\nFord Ranger and Everest Are Big Sellers, But Can It Catch Toyota?\n\nOn the numbers side, Ford\u2019s Everest had a stellar year in Australia, reaching 26,494 sales in 2024. That beat the previous record held by\u2014you guessed it\u2014the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, which sold 21,000 units back in 2021. But Ford wasn\u2019t done there. The Ford Ranger, which shares a platform with the Everest, took the crown as Australia\u2019s best-selling vehicle of 2024 with 62,593 deliveries.\n\nFord Everest\n\nTogether, the Ranger and the Everest accounted for a staggering 89% of Ford sales Down Under last year. The ladder-frame SUV and pickup brought Ford in the second place of the best-selling brands in Australia, behind Toyota.\n\nAlthough the Hilux and Land Cruiser Prado were outsold by Ford\u2019s Ranger and Everest, Toyota remains the king of the Australian automotive jungle. In 2024, Toyota sold a whopping 241,296 vehicles, more than double Ford\u2019s tally of 100,170 sales. Toyota\u2019s dominance isn\u2019t likely to be shaken anytime soon, with the company holding the top spot for the 22nd consecutive year.\n\nToyota Land Cruiser Prado",

I'm sharing my experiences with new vehicles after living with them for a few days or revisiting them after a few months.\n\nCar of the week: The 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser SUV, the brand's oldest truck nameplate. I wrote about it last April.\n\nWhat it is: The 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser is a full-size four-door, five-passenger SUV with a standard hybrid engine and four-wheel drive. Toyota\u2019s Land Cruiser dates to 1958. The new model that debuted as a 2024 model got a hybrid engine and shares its basic engineering with the Tundra and Tacoma pickups and 4Runner SUV.\n\nHow much you'll pay for the Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nPrices start at $56,700. The Land Cruiser FE model I tested stickered at $75,430. Prices exclude $1,395 destination charge.\n\nHow's it selling?\n\nToyota sold 29,113 Land Cruisers in 2024.\n\nWhat I liked most the first time I drove a Land Cruiser\n\nIn a brief off-road test last year, the Land Cruiser's hybrid drivetrain proved very capable on steep, unpaved trails. Available off-road features include locking rear and center differentials and disconnecting front stabilizer bar. The Land Cruiser\u2019s tidy proportions make it manageable on trails and easier to park than larger SUVs like the Chevy Tahoe and Ford Expedition.\n\nLand Cruiser competitors\n\nChevrolet Tahoe\n\nJeep Grand Cherokee\n\nFord Expedition\n\nNissan Armada\n\nWhat I love about this Toyota now\n\nThe Land Cruiser looks ready for any adventure. It\u2019s loaded with advanced features for off-roading, but is still a comfortable daily driver \u2015 even over uneven pavement. The passenger compartment is roomy and well-appointed, with controls that combine physical buttons and dials with a 12.3-inch touch screen and virtual assistant. Other goodies include an available JBL audio system. It's a delightful full-size SUV, though prices rise fast as you add features.\n\nWhat could be better about this Toyota SUV?\n\nDespite its fuel efficiency, the 2.5L turbocharged hybrid power plant needs premium gasoline to achieve its rated power and fuel economy. That will make it more expensive to run than the V6 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which runs fine on regular, per EPA estimates.\n\nApple CarPlay refused to work a few times during my test, despite initially connecting easily.\n\nMore: 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT EV makes a leap with new battery, features customers asked for\n\nThings I\u2019m not sure about the Land Cruiser\n\nThe Land Cruiser's size and price get very close to Toyota\u2019s 4Runner SUV, which is new this year, and slightly longer than the Land Cruiser, Toyota\u2019s flagship SUV. Does Toyota need two SUVs so similar?\n\nKey features of the Toyota Land Cruiser SUV\n\nSeats five\n\nRear- or four-wheel drive\n\nStandard hybrid power: 326 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque\n\n6,000 pounds towing\n\n2.4L turbocharged engine, Eight-speed automatic transmission\n\nEstimated fuel economy: 22 mpg city/25 highway/23 combined.\n\nContact Mark Phelan: 313-222-6731 or mmphelan@freepress.com.

We then rejoiced upon its return in 2024.\n\nDisappointment has ensued for many, though not all, that have ridden this rollercoaster of emotions.\n\nDuring our all-too-brief first encounter with the new Toyota Land Cruiser in 2024 it was clear the icon attempted to pivot to retro charm. Living with the Land Cruiser has proven that the retro charm only goes so far, and it\u2019s disappointed the entire editorial team.\n\nHere are the pros and cons of the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser after spending time living with both the base 1958 trim and more expensive, and slightly nicer, Land Cruiser trims.\n\nSpoiler: This simply doesn\u2019t feel like the Land Cruiser we all knew, loved, and missed. Is its different formula something better, at least in some respects? We reasoned through what you get in the Land Cruiser, now, and came up with the following pros and cons.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958\n\nPro: The Land Cruiser looks like a Land Cruiser\n\nJust not the one you are thinking of. The Land Cruiser looks like its namesake. The square upright profile, short overhangs, and flared metal all speak the Land Cruiser language. But the 200-Series has some throwback cues to its design with a nod to the J80 of the \u201890s with its front and rear ends.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser 1958 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser 1958 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser 1958\n\nThe new 300 Series, which is the real Land Cruiser the rest of the world gets, is a true evolution of the outgoing 200 Series. The new Land Cruiser America received is known as a Land Cruiser Prado to the rest of the world. The 1958\u2019s round headlights and Land Cruiser model\u2019s horizontal chiclet LED headlights are throwbacks to the 1960\u2019s 40 Series and 1980\u2019s 60 Series, respectively. Respectfully, no one currently buying these things is going to realize that because they weren\u2019t born yet. Same goes for the vertical taillights harkening back to the FJ60s. Is it all Land Cruiser design parts bin from all the eras mashed into one? You betcha. It looks retro. It looks like a Land Cruiser. No one under 40 is going to know that. But it does look like a Land Cruiser, just not the one we wanted and the rest of the world gets.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958\n\nCon: Land Cruiser feels like cheap tin can\n\nThe Land Cruiser was a flagship for Toyota. Since the 1990s-eras J80 the Land Cruiser\u2019s had wide, overstuffed seats, plush door coverings, and nice soft-touch dashboards. It may not have felt like a bank vault shutting like a Mercedes-Benz G-Class, but it sure as heck didn\u2019t feel cheap (and it wasn\u2019t). The latest Land Cruiser fails on all these fronts. Open the door, shut the door, and it feels like this thing is a tin can with thin metal. It\u2019s further proven with the thin sheetmetal on the hood flexing and bending in the wind on the highway, which would induce an LOL moment if it weren\u2019t so sad.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser 1958 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser 1958 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser 1958 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser 1958\n\nWhile we love the base 1958\u2019s throwback tweed-like seat upholstery, it feels completely out of place in a $56,700 SUV. This isn\u2019t a $35k Wrangler. The 1958\u2019s interior has shiny, cheap, hard plastics everywhere from the door panels to the dashboard covering. If you touch it, it\u2019s cheap plastic. The upper Land Cruiser trim\u2014yes, that\u2019s actually the upper trim level\u2019s name, making it the Land Cruiser Land Cruiser\u2014has a nicer interior for $61,470 with a soft-touch dashboard, some center console and door panel soft-touch materials, and leather upholstery. But it all feels thin with hard plastic felt beneath on the panels, and the soft leather seat upholstery doesn\u2019t feel durable or up for adventure. The Land Cruiser Land Cruiser I tested was $73,344 of yikes thanks in large part to the $4,600 Premium Package that added a JBL sound system, memory for the leather-trimmed driver\u2019s seat, a heads-up display, and power front seats. There was also a $1,440 roof rack that created a ton of wind noise on top of the wind noise that comes screaming off the side mirrors at anything more than 40 mph. At least the expensive Land Cruiser Land Cruiser gets a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and 12.3-inch touchscreen for the money rather than the 1958 model\u2019s 7.0-inch cluster and 8.0-inch touchscreen.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nPro: Land Cruiser has enough off-road worthy hardware\n\nEvery Land Cruiser comes standard with full-time four-wheel drive with a 2-speed transfer case, center and rear locking differentials, and Toyota\u2019s Multi-Terrain Select system, with off-road modes available in both 4Hi and 4Lo. There\u2019s also a crawl control system, which is like off-road cruise control. It is more refined than Toyota\u2019s previous system that clunked and thunked. The nearly $60,000 base 1958 model can\u2019t be optioned with the electronically controlled disconnecting sway bar, but it\u2019s available on the Land Cruiser model for $1,250. Sadly, the outgoing Land Cruiser\u2019s trick KDSS (hydraulically controlled disconnecting sway bar system) isn\u2019t even an option. It\u2019s just gone.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958\n\nAltogether, the hardware is, as the kids say, legit, and competitive with other off-roaders. It\u2019ll get where the Land Cruiser is trying to go, aside from the fact that no Land Cruiser is available from the factory with all-terrain tires\u2014a hilarious and weird oversight that says a lot. The fact that front, rear differential, and transmission steel skid plates are all optional is both concerning and speaks volumes. There\u2019s also no front locker to be seen anywhere on an options sheet.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nCon: Land Cruiser doesn\u2019t feel effortless, cosplays efficiency\n\nGoodbye, V-8. Every Land Cruiser is a hybrid with a 2.4-liter turbo-4 paired with an electric 48-hp electric motor sandwiched in the 8-speed automatic transmission. Power output is rated at 326 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque for the combined system. Land Cruisers are supposed, and historically, conquer the land effortlessly. This one doesn\u2019t and won\u2019t. It\u2019ll get where you\u2019re going, probably, but it feels strained, sounds and feels coarse, and is unrefined. One might even describe the powertrain as a bunch of hamsters spinning a wheel beneath the engine. Though, you can hear the turbo go whoosh, which is kind of fun. The transmission\u2019s a gem with quick, clean shifts. But the engine sounds like it would be at home in a third-world country, not a flagship. The buttery smooth V-8? It\u2019s missed. From 0-30 mph the Land Cruiser feels quicker than it should thanks to the electric assist, but then things fall off sharply from there and aerodynamics start kicking in with the brick-like profile. EPA fuel economy ratings of 22 mpg city, 25 highway, and 23 combined are markedly better than the outgoing model\u2019s 13/17/14. But it\u2019s unrealistic to see these ratings of the newer model translating to the real world. In multiple weeks of testing multiple Land Cruisers over the course of hundreds of miles I saw an average of 18-19 mpg in mixed suburban driving. Notably better than the 12 mpg the outgoing Land Cruiser averaged? Yup. Efficient? Not really.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nPro: Land Cruiser sticks to the script with buttons, knobs, toggles\n\nWhile the Land Cruiser feels like a massive step backwards in many ways there\u2019s one thing Toyota didn\u2019t forget: Easy-to-use controls are king while both driving and going off-road. To that point the Land Cruiser wins with large knobs, buttons for all essential off-road controls, toggles and buttons for climate controls, and a real volume knob. If the touchscreen failed you would lose your tunes, but making it home wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nCon: Land Cruiser packaging should make engineers weep\n\nThe packaging of the Land Cruiser is borderline embarrassing. Somewhere, someplace, an engineer must cry softly over the specifications and design they were handed to work around. The hybrid\u2019s battery pack sits in the cargo area. This forces a triple liftover point forcing cargo to be lifted over the bumper, cargo area lip, and then the battery pack shelf. Fold the second row and it\u2019s not a flat load floor. My 11-year old sitting behind my 5-foot-10 frame noted the second row came up short on legroom. The receiver, which is only rated to tow 6,000 pounds, has a plastic cover that requires either a screwdriver or key to remove push pins, then a second plastic surround, and that\u2019s all to reveal the industry\u2019s only receiver (i.e. only Toyota and Lexus products) that features a double-wall and air-gapped design. That requires a hitch pin that\u2019s 4.0-inch long, which isn\u2019t common. Toyota\u2019s engineering team has said that the design is for strength, but no one else in the industry does this.\n\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958\n\nTime has marched on, and seemingly the Land Cruiser\u2019s trying to go back to a land before it became a stealth wealth symbol. The price has been rolled back two decades, but the 2005 Land Cruiser, known as J100, was a much nicer vehicle than today\u2019s Land Cruiser. This latest model will cruise the land, but it doesn\u2019t feel like the Land Cruiser we all knew and loved. I want to love it; I kind of like it; but I know what it could be. The rest of the world gets the real Land Cruiser (300 Series), and there\u2019s seemingly little to no reason it can\u2019t exist in America for $65,000 to $70,000. The Land Cruiser we got almost feels like a cash grab. Toyota said it would bring back the Land Cruiser, and it did. But just because it wears the badge doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll meet your expectations. Disappointment might ensue.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n2025 Land Cruiser Land Cruiser\n\nBase price: $56,700 including $1,450 destination charge\n\nPrice as tested: $73,344\n\nPowertrain: 326-hp 2.4-liter turbo-4 hybrid, 8-speed automatic, 4WD\n\nEPA fuel economy: 22/25/23 mpg\n\nThe hits: Looks like a Land Cruiser; off-road hardware, buttons, knobs, and toggle switches\n\nThe misses: Feels cheap; coarse powertrain; not cruising anything effortlessly; compromised packaging; not the Land Cruiser you remember",

            "content": "The full-size SUV accomplishes a singular feat unmatched by any other automotive segment. It can transport a hockey team\u2019s starting line and their gear in relative comfort, as long as you\u2019re wearing nose plugs.\n\nThe large truck-based SUVs that seat up to nine passengers are known for their roomy utility as much as their poor fuel economy. The 2025 Toyota Sequoia counters that last point with a standard hybrid powertrain nearly 50% more efficient than the V-8 it replaces. Is it enough to overcome the segment\u2019s bestseller, the larger, roomier, and more versatile 2025 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nHere\u2019s how the two squads face off.\n\n2023 Toyota Sequoia 2023 Toyota Sequoia 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71\n\nTahoe vs. Sequoia prices and trims\n\nBase Tahoe LS costs about $61,000\n\nBase Sequoia SR5 costs about $64,000\n\n4WD adds $3,000 on both models\n\nBest picks: Sequoia SR5, Tahoe LT\n\nHow much does a Toyota Sequoia cost?\n\nThe Sequoia SR5 costs about $64,000. It\u2019s more expensive than the base Tahoe LS, but it comes much better equipped with a sunroof, power and heated front seats, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and wireless smartphone compatibility. On Limited, Platinum, TRD Pro, and top Capstone models, a 14.0-inch touchscreen with a new infotainment system that\u2019s almost as good as GM\u2019s comes standard. The base SR5 with 4WD and an 8.0-inch touchscreen does the job just fine; we\u2019d add a TRD Sport package with 20-inch alloy wheels and Bilstein shocks for a total of about $67,000, though we might add a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe top Capstone trim doesn\u2019t match rival\u2019s luxurious trims, including the Tahoe High Country. For $85,610, the Toyota Sequoia Capstone adds 22-inch chrome wheels, power running boards, black-and-white leather upholstery, American Walnut wood dash trim, and LED mood lighting.\n\nEvery Sequoia has a 3-year/36,000-mile basic warranty with 2 years or 25,000 miles of scheduled maintenance. Hybrid components are covered for 8 years or 100,000 miles.\n\nHow much does a Chevrolet Tahoe cost?\n\nIt varies based on the three powertrain options, but the base $60,495 Tahoe LS comes with rear-wheel drive and the 5.3-liter V-8. Standard gear includes power-adjustable front seats, a 17.7-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, keyless and remote start. GM can\u2019t match Toyota\u2019s warranty with just 3 years or 36,000 miles of coverage. The turbodiesel costs $1,000 more, on average, while the 6.2-liter V-8 available on RST, Z71, Premier, and High Country trims costs between $2,000 to $8,000 more.\n\nThe $63,695 Tahoe LT model aligns with the Sequoia SR5 and offers wireless smartphone charging, an 11.0-inch digital instrument cluster, a hands-free power tailgate, Bose audio, and leather upholstery. In addition to the available turbodiesel, the Tahoe comes with many more options as well, which ultimately gives it the edge here.\n\nThe top High Country model nudges into GMC Denali terrain with its adaptive damping, heated second-row seats, and power-folding third row, but at more than $81,000 it\u2019s a bit much.\n\nAdvantage: Chevy Tahoe.\n\n2023 Toyota Sequoia SR5 2023 Toyota Sequoia 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe\n\nTahoe vs. Sequoia performance and efficiency\n\nThe Toyota Sequoia comes with one hybrid powertrain\n\nThe Chevy Tahoe offers up to three engine choices\n\nBoth models use a 10-speed automatic transmission\n\n2023 Toyota Sequoia SR5\n\nWhat are the Toyota Sequoia specs? How does it drive?\n\nA 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 hybrid powertrain makes 437 hp and 583 lb-ft of torque\n\nEPA rates it at 21 mpg city, 24 highway, 22 combined with rear-wheel drive\n\nFour-wheel drive costs it 2 mpg across the board, to 19/22/20 mpg\n\nSharing a hybrid engine with the Toyota Tundra full-size pickup truck, the Sequoia\u2019s hybrid powertrain sandwiches a motor generator between the engine and 10-speed automatic transmission for low-speed EV driving below 18 mph. More spirited off the line and while passing than its predecessor, the Sequoia scoots to 60 mph in the low six seconds. The hybrid V-6 delivers its power more quietly than the old 5.7-liter V-8, giving the Sequoia a sense of refinement it lacked before. That\u2019s enhanced by an independent front suspension and a solid rear axle with coil-over rear springs and an available air suspension that keeps it from handling as rough and tumble as a truck. The Sequoia can tow up to 9,520 pounds, but it\u2019s not as smooth or confident as the Tahoe and its 8,400-pound tow rating.\n\n2025 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71\n\nWhat are the Chevy Tahoe specs? How does it drive?\n\nThe standard 5.3-liter V-8 makes 355 hp and 383 lb-ft; it gets 15/20/17 mpg\n\nA 3.0-liter inline-6 turbodiesel churns out 305 hp and 495 lb-ft; it\u2019s the highway champ at 21/28/24 mpg\n\nThe 6.2-liter V-8 makes 420 hp and 460 lb-ft; it gets 16 mpg combined with RWD or 4WD\n\nThe Tahoe\u2019s best version slaps with a 6.2-liter V-8 that hustles the land barge to 60 mph in the mid seven-second range. It\u2019s available on all but the LS and LT trims. Any of the three Tahoe engines pair with a seamless 10-speed automatic that\u2019s almost telepathic, but a heavy foot keeps it in low gears until it howls approaching the redline. The turbodiesel is a rare but compelling option, especially for owners who tow and log a lot of highway miles. Quieter and cleaner than older diesels, it\u2019s only a $1,000 upcharge and it\u2019s more efficient than the hybrid Sequoia. Rear-wheel drive comes standard, but four-wheel drive is available across the lineup.\n\nChevy fits the Tahoe with a fully independent suspension that counteracts the SUV\u2019s prodigious weight to make it feel lighter and more agile. The available magnetic ride control dampers smother road imperfections even better, and an available air suspension can raise or lower the big rig by nearly four inches.\n\nAdvantage: Sequoia for everyday efficiency, Chevy\u2019s turbodiesel for towing, Chevy\u2019s 6.2-liter V-8 for everything else.\n\n2025 Chevrolet Tahoe RST 2025 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 2025 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 2025 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71\n\nTahoe vs. Sequoia specs and dimensions\n\nBoth full-size SUVs seat up eight passengers standard, but the Tahoe can be equipped with a front-row bench to seat nine\n\nAvailable captain\u2019s chairs bring the seating capacity to seven\n\nThe Tahoe is longer, roomier, and has more cargo room\n\nWhile fuel efficiency might be the Sequoia\u2019s best move, it can\u2019t measure up to the economy of space in the Tahoe. And the two are related.\n\nIs the Toyota Sequoia bigger than the Chevy Tahoe?\n\nIt\u2019s 2.0 inches shorter than the Tahoe but has a 2.0-inch longer wheelbase\n\nThere\u2019s only 11.5 cubic feet of space behind the rearmost seats\n\nRearmost legroom measures out to 33.7 inches, but it\u2019s misleading\n\nThe Sequoia\u2019s hybrid battery pack sits below the third row seat, designed so that more high traffic areas around the second row would be easier to navigate. Because of this packaging, the second row doesn\u2019t slide, but the third row slides fore and aft 5.5 inches. Sliding the seats to the rearmost position is the only way to accommodate passengers in the third row, and they should be on the smaller side. This squeezes headroom and legroom enough to prohibit adults or even teens from fitting heads, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes. In Toyota\u2019s family, the Grand Highlander feels roomier by comparison. With the seats back, the third row measures out to only 11.5 cubic feet. Not even goalie gear would fit back there.\n\nHow big is the Chevy Tahoe?\n\nThe Tahoe stretches to 210.7 inches long with a 120.9-inch wheelbase\n\nCargo volume behind the third row is 25.5 cubic feet, or 72.6 cubes with the third row down\n\nRearmost legroom measures out to 34.9 inches, and its functional enough to fit adults\n\nThe Tahoe has 25.5 cubic feet of space behind its third row, and adults can functionally sit in the wayback with 34.9 inches of rear legroom, which is as much space as the second row of many compact crossovers. The second-row seats slide and collapse for easier entry and exit, and unlike the Sequoia they can be folded down for a full flat floor to optimize cargo, which measures out to 122.9 cubic feet with both rear rows folded.\n\nAdvantage: Chevy Tahoe, by a good margin.\n\n2023 Toyota Sequoia 2023 Toyota Sequoia 2025 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe with Super Cruise\n\nTahoe vs. Sequoia exterior and interior\n\nBoth SUVs share a platform with pickup trucks\n\nThe Sequoia\u2019s design channels the Toyota Tundra pickup truck\n\nThe Tahoe mimics the blocky elements of the Chevy Silverado\n\nIs the Toyota Sequoia a good-looking SUV?\n\nThe Sequoia looks newer but the Tahoe appears more timeless in its big box shape. Both models embrace the design cues of the full-size pickup trucks with which they share a platform, with broad vertical grilles and jar-head sides.\n\nBulging fenders and flexed rocker panels define the profile of the Sequoia, and the door cutouts don\u2019t gel with the rear part of the greenhouse, though the same could be said of the Tahoe. Up front, a prominent air dam on non-TRD models underscores broad grilles that differ by trim. The Sequoia wears the same corner brace LED headlights as the Tundra, and it also has the same narrow windshield that squeezes outward vision once inside. In the cabin, the horizontal blockiness carries over across the dash, with vents like ears flanking a 14.0-inch touchscreen on most grades. Gratefully, and maybe even gracefully, both models have climate control dials and multimedia buttons so you don\u2019t have to rely on the touchscreen for everyday functions.\n\nIs the Chevy Tahoe a good-looking SUV?\n\nAll Tahoes now sport a 17.7-inch touchscreen and a digital display that wrap around the driver, framed by rich-looking interior trim once you\u2019re beyond the LS trim. At the top High Country level, the Tahoe summits Denali and crests Cadillac territory.\n\nOutside, the Tahoe can ride on 22-inch wheels that make the sharp horizontal bands on its steep face even more imposing in rear-view mirrors. The rear end is more unified than the Sequoia\u2019s, even with its shark fin cover behind the rear door pillars. The proportions of both models preclude them from being attractive, but the Tahoe is more whole.\n\nAdvantage: Chevy Tahoe.\n\n2023 Chevrolet Tahoe with Super Cruise\n\nTahoe vs. Sequoia safety\n\nTahoe has received four stars from the NHTSA in the recent past, including a three-star rollover rating\n\n\n\nSequoia has not been tested by the NHTSA\n\nNeither model has been tested by the IIHS\n\nAutomatic emergency braking is standard on both\n\nHow do the Toyota Sequoia safety features compare to the Chevy Tahoe?\n\nEven though they lack full crash-test ratings, both models come well equipped with driver-assist features meant to avoid or mitigate the impacts of a crash. Automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, active lane control, and blind-spot monitors are standard on both, but Toyota adds adaptive cruise control, front and rear park assist, and a standard surround-view camera system that is crucial for a vehicle with such thick rear pillars. Headrests\u2014and heads\u2014in the rearview mirror can stick out like a game of whack-a-mole. The Tahoe can be fitted with Super Cruise limited hands-free driving system that gives a welcome assist on road trips.",

Toyota's ROE reached 15.6% for April-December 2024, in line with the 15.8% for the 2023 fiscal year. The metric has increased from 9.0% in fiscal 2022 and 11.5% in the financial year before that.\n\nToyota has long been working to improve its profit margin by reducing the cost it takes to produce its vehicles, thereby lowering the break-even point for its consolidated sales volume.\n\nThe next time the automaker is likely to publish an ROE figure is in the second week of May when it usually reports full-year financial results.\n\nSpeaking before the U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada on Tuesday, Yamamoto said Toyota - which has assembly plants in both targeted countries - would provide information about the impact of tariffs once it was able to.\n\nLast month, Toyota said a nearly $14 billion factory in North Carolina - its 11th U.S. manufacturing plant - was ready to begin production, with battery shipments for electrified vehicles including hybrids starting in April.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Leussink and Maki Shiraki; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

The modifications are so extensive, they make the off-roading icon look like Japan\u2019s answer to the Brabus G-Class\u2014if the G-Class had a serious identity crisis.\n\nAfter teasing the world with renderings last year, Wald unveiled the real deal at the 2025 Osaka Auto Messe. While the original designs included both a lifted and a slammed version, we\u2019ve only seen the lifted version come to life so far.\n\nMore: Toyota Land Cruiser 250 Gains Rugged Looks And Even A Camper Kit By Japanese Tuners\n\nThe Black Bison Edition is, unsurprisingly, all about aggressive visuals. It features a custom bumper with intricate intakes, extra DRLs, and an aluminum skid plate. Adding to the look is a large hood scoop and an aerodynamic roof-mounted add-on, complete with integrated fins and LEDs.\n\nThe side profile gets some serious flair, thanks to wide fender extensions that house the beefy new wheels wrapped in mud-terrain tires. This particular build also benefits from a lift kit and wider tracks to further enhance its road presence and off-road capability.\n\nWald International / Instagram\n\nThe slammed version of Wald\u2019s Land Cruiser Prado has been shown in a rendering.\n\nMoving to the back, Wald has added a sporty bumper with a diffuser, decorative vents on the fenders, and a wing mounted on the rear spoiler that, frankly, feels a bit out of place.\n\nThe street-focused version that exists only in the digital realm takes things even further with larger wheels wrapped in performance tires and a lowering kit. Sure, this would significantly hamper the Prado\u2019s off-road chops, but let\u2019s be honest: there\u2019s definitely a crowd out there who loves the idea of a \u201ctough\u201d SUV that can barely clear a speed bump.\n\nMore: Wald\u2019s Toyota Hilux Black Bison Edition Looks Like It Could Eat A Ford Ranger For Breakfast\n\nThere\u2019s no word on performance upgrades yet, though those looking for more grunt can always find ways to juice up the hybrid, gasoline, or diesel engine (depending on your market).\n\nWald hasn\u2019t released any pricing details for the Desert Edition Black Bison kit for the Land Cruiser Prado, nor has it mentioned availability outside of Japan. But if you\u2019re itching for a similar kit, Wald has already rolled out one for the Land Cruiser 300 Series.

            "content": "In January, Toyota said its mobility software subsidiary \"Woven by Toyota\" was investing $44 million into Japanese rocket maker Interstellar Technologies. Rival Honda has been developing a proprietary reusable rocket since 2019 to launch low-earth orbit satellites to space. Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group, a Tesla competitor, has invested $326 million to manufacture its own satellites.\n\n\"What are those satellites going to be used for and what are they already being used for?\" said Micah Walter-Range, president of consulting firm Caelus Partners. \"Some of it is for improving navigation services for cars. Some of it's for mapping. If you think about what's going to be needed a little further down the road for autonomous vehicles, having full awareness of what's going on on the road is incredibly valuable.\"\n\nCars today use satellite connectivity for tracking and location, software updates and entertainment like satellite radio. But as cars become more and more connected, automakers need the infrastructure to make that possible. That's where satellites, and the rockets needed to launch them, come into play. One recent report estimates that by 2030, connected vehicles could be a $742 billion annual revenue opportunity for automakers and suppliers.\n\n\"In the smartphone world, Apple is shifting from a single device sale to additional services that can be provided throughout the life of that device,\" Walter-Range said. \"So for a car, it's the same deal. You know, once you sell that car, are there additional revenue streams that you can get by providing services? Some of those services can be delivered from space.\"\n\nOne model is charging subscriptions for advanced driver assistance systems. General Motors ' Super Cruise uses cameras, sensors and real-time location and map data from GPS satellites to allow the vehicle to do things like automatically steer and keep the car centered in a lane. In the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, GM CEO Mary Barra said the company expected that within the next five years, Super Cruise would bring in about $2 billion in annual revenue for the company.\n\nWatch the video to find out how else automakers and car companies can benefit from each other.",

            "content": "And it\u2019s not just Norway as Tesla\u2019s sales have also plummeted in France, Denmark, and Sweden this year\n\nTesla sales marked a significant decline in Norway since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe company sold 1,606 cars in January and February, down from 2,887 in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Norway\u2019s passenger car sales grew by 46.3%, and EV sales by 53.4%.\n\nFor years, Tesla has dominated Norway\u2019s EV market, but early 2025 sales figures suggest that grip is weaking. In the first two months of the year, Tesla\u2019s sales in Norway plummeted by 44.4% compared to the same period in 2024. Meanwhile, the overall EV market surged by 53.4%, now accounting for a staggering 96% of all new passenger cars sold in the country.\n\nMore: Tesla Sales Crumble 45% In Europe, While EV Market Explodes 37%\n\nWith 1,606 units sold in January and February, down from 2,887 last year, Tesla has dropped to third place among Norway\u2019s best-selling brands, trailing behind Volkswagen and even Toyota which only sells one EV, the bZ4X. That\u2019s a sharp contrast from its full-year 2024 performance, when Tesla moved 24,259 cars and claimed an 18.9% market share.\n\nNorway\u2019s EV Market Grows, But Tesla Shrinks\n\nAccording to data from the Norwegian Road Traffic Information Council, overall passenger car sales including EVs and ICE models jumped 46.3% (18,292 units) in the first two months of 2025. Zero-emission vehicles saw an even bigger boost, climbing 53.4% (17,443 units). This reinforces Norway\u2019s status as a global leader in EV adoption, yet Tesla isn\u2019t reaping the benefits.\n\nThe Top-Selling Brands and Models\n\nVolkswagen currently holds the top spot in Norway\u2019s EV market, delivering 3,222 vehicles in January and February, an astonishing 224.1% increase over the same period in 2024. Toyota follows with 2,102 units sold (+97.6%), while Tesla, now in third place, saw its sales drop to 1,606 (-44.4%). Rounding out the top five are Nissan with 1,186 units (+31.3%) and BMW with 1,134 units (+113.6%).\n\nWhen it comes to individual models, Toyota\u2019s bZ4X is the best-seller so far this year, with 1,762 units sold (+236.3%). The VW ID.4 follows with 1,342 units (+207.8%), just ahead of the Nissan Ariya at 1,171 units (+201%). Tesla\u2019s Model Y, once the country\u2019s favorite EV, has fallen to fourth place with just 965 units sold, a staggering 64.4% decline. The VW ID.7 rounds out the top five, surging 729.2% to 879 units sold.\n\nMore Than Just Musk Fatigue?\n\nAs reported by local media TV 2, while it is still too early to draw conclusions about Tesla\u2019s market appeal in 2025, Norwegian attitudes toward the brand appear to have shifted. A recent survey by Opinion found that two out of three Norwegians have developed a more negative view of Tesla, while only 2% reported an improved perception of the EV maker. Much of this backlash appears tied to the controversial politics of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, particularly his association with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nSome experts argue that Tesla\u2019s struggles in Norway go beyond its CEO\u2019s public persona. Robert N\u00e6ss, Chief Investment Officer at Nordea Asset Management, suggests that Tesla\u2019s once-unmatched appeal has faded in Norway: \u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of some people having a negative impression of Musk and the fact that a Tesla is no longer a much better buy than all other electric cars.\u201d\n\nMore: VW ID.4 Soars 194% Leading Europe\u2019s EV Sales, But Doesn\u2019t Even Crack Top 25 Overall\n\nMeanwhile, Thor \u00d8ivind Jenssen, Associate Professor at the University of Bergen believes that negative experiences among Tesla owners have significantly contributed to the decline in sales: \u201cTesla is at the top of the hate list of NAF and the Consumer Council. There have been several faults with the cars, and when customers complain, they are arrogant and slow in the service process\u201d.\n\nCan the Updated Model Y Turn Things Around?\n\nPhoto Thanos Pappas / Carscoops\n\nTesla\u2019s biggest test in Norway will come in March 2025. Historically, March has been a strong month for the brand, and it also marks the arrival of the updated Model Y Juniper.\n\nA sales rebound would be much needed. The Model Y, once Tesla\u2019s best-seller in Norway, has seen its numbers collapse with just 965 units were delivered in January and February, a 64.4% drop from the 2,711 sales recorded in the same period last year.\n\nWhether the updated Model Y can reverse Tesla\u2019s downward trend remains to be seen, but for now, the automaker\u2019s standing in Norway is looking shakier than ever.\n\nSales Plunge in Other European Markets\n\nUnfortunately for Tesla, Norway isn\u2019t the only place where the EV brand is struggling. While full European sales figures for February are still coming in, early data paints a grim picture. Tesla\u2019s sales dropped 48% in Denmark last month, while over the first two months of 2025, they fell 45% in France and 42% in Sweden compared to the same period last year.\n\nIf this trend continues, Tesla may have more to worry about than just Norway\u2019s cooling enthusiasm.",

After years of persistent rumors, Toyota has officially confirmed that a new Celica is under development, and even trademarked the GR Celica name. The model will continue the legacy of its predecessors that remained on sale between 1970 and 2006 spanning seven generations.\n\nThe reborn Celica is expected to pack Toyota\u2019s newly developed turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, delivering up to 400 hp (298 kW / 406 PS) in street-legal form and over 600 hp in track-focused applications. Power will reportedly be sent to all four wheels through an AWD system, much like the legendary rally-bred Celica GT-Four models of the past.\n\nToyota remains tight-lipped about the Celica\u2019s debut date. However, the two-door coupe will likely arrive before the next generations of the GR86 and GR Supra, potentially in 2025 or 2026. Given its heritage, it\u2019s also possible that the new Celica could serve as the foundation for a future WRC race car, taking the torch from the GR Yaris.\n\nToyota MR2: A Mid-Engine Revival\n\nToyota MR2, Illustration: CarScoops\n\nAnother long-rumored comeback is that of the MR2. Toyota gave us a taste of its mid-engine ambitions with the GR Yaris M Prototype at the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, and while some speculate this layout could make its way into the Celica, an earlier teaser\u2014hidden in a Toyota anime, of all places\u2014hints at the return of the MR2 instead.\n\nMore: Toyota Hints At \u2018MR-Something\u2019 Mid-Engine Sports Car With 2.0 Turbo And AWD\n\nThe new MR2 is expected to take the form of a an ICE-powered, mid-engined, AWD sports car, sticking to its original formula but with modern updates. While its exterior may take inspiration from the all-electric Toyota FT-Se concept, it will reportedly be powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, available in two output levels: 296 hp (221 kW) and 395 hp (294 kW).\n\nToyota has revealed that development of mid-engined prototypes will continue throughout 2025, including their participation in motorsport activities in Japan starting this summer. This will eventually lead to the debut of the production-spec MR2, which could happen sometime in 2026.\n\nToyota GR86: Sticking Around\n\nToyota GR86, Illustration: CarScoops\n\nWhile the arrival of the new Celica and MR2 might lead some to believe the GR86 is on the chopping block, Toyota isn\u2019t letting go of its affordable sports car just yet, as a new generation is already in development. Unlike its predecessors, the next GR86 doesn\u2019t appear to be twinned with the Subaru BRZ. Instead, Toyota is reportedly developing it in-house, with reports suggesting input from Mazda.\n\nMore: Toyota Keeps Top Spot In Global Sales\n\nThe compact coupe will almost certainly retain its rear-wheel-drive layout, distinguishing it from the AWD GR Celica, even though both have front-mounted engines. It\u2019s expected to ride on a newly developed platform, possibly related to the Lexus IS. As for power, the new GR86 could inherit the GR Yaris\u2019 turbocharged 1.6-liter three-cylinder unit, potentially with hybrid assistance, though a lower-output version of the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder remains a possibility.\n\nWhile Toyota hasn\u2019t provided a launch timeline yet, the next GR86 is expected to arrive sometime around 2027 or 2028.\n\nToyota GR Supra: A New Chapter\n\nToyota GR Supra, Illustration: CarScoops\n\nThe A90-generation GR Supra, developed in partnership with BMW, is wrapping up production later this year with a Final Edition. But the Supra name isn\u2019t going anywhere. A next-generation GR Supra is already in the works, and this time, it may not rely on BMW\u2019s engineering.\n\nInstead, the new Supra could feature a hybrid-assisted 2.0-liter four-cylinder, though there are whispers of a collaboration with Mazda that might bring an inline-six into the mix. Regardless of its powertrain, the Supra will remain rear-wheel drive, ensuring it doesn\u2019t step on the toes of the AWD Celica or undercut the smaller GR86.\n\nAs for transmission options, reports from Japan suggest Toyota is considering an eight-speed or 10-speed automatic. Meanwhile, the company has been experimenting with simulated manual gearboxes for hybrids and EVs, potentially offering an alternative for purists who lament the loss of a traditional stick shift.\n\nThe next-gen Supra is expected to launch in 2027, leaving a brief gap in the range following the current model\u2019s discontinuation.\n\nToyota GR GT3: A Supercar Is Coming\n\nSpy Shots: SH Proshots and Baldauf for CarScoops\n\nSports cars are exciting, but Toyota Gazoo Racing has its sights set even higher. The company is preparing to enter the supercar arena with a spiritual successor to the Lexus LFA, set to be offered in both race-spec and street-legal forms. Rumored to carry the Lexus LFR badge, this halo car could also debut under the Gazoo Racing brand as a standalone model.\n\nMore: Tokyo\u2019s Wildest Lexus Concept Is Actually A 2012 Toyota 86 In Disguise\n\nCamouflaged prototypes have been spotted testing on several occasions, showcasing dramatic proportions reminiscent of the 2022 GR GT3 Concept. A long hood, low roofline, and sharp aerodynamic elements give it an unmistakably aggressive stance. The carbon fiber bodywork is expected to sit atop an aluminum chassis, while the roadgoing version will reportedly pack a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 paired with a self-charging hybrid system, delivering a combined output of at least 900 hp (671 kW / 912 PS).\n\nSome sources suggest the supercar\u2014whether badged as a Lexus, a Toyota GR, or both\u2014could be unveiled as early as this year, though first deliveries likely won\u2019t arrive until 2026. Japanese media have speculated a starting price of around 30 million yen (roughly $197,000 at current exchange rates), but we\u2019d take that with a pinch of salt.\n\nFor context, the Lexus LFA launched at 37 million yen in Japan 15 years ago, and given inflation, advancements in technology, and the increasing costs of high-performance engineering, it\u2019s hard to imagine Toyota pricing its modern successor significantly lower.\n\nToyota GR Corolla: Hot Hatch Evolution\n\nToyota GR Corolla, Illustration: Theophilus Chin\n\nThe GR Corolla is keeping the hot hatch flame alive together with the VW Golf R and Honda Civic Type R. Launched in 2022, it has already seen a few updates, including the addition of an automatic transmission alongside the manual gearbox. But while the GR Corolla still feels fresh, its underlying platform dates back to 2018, raising questions about when Toyota will roll out its replacement.\n\nMore: 2027 Toyota Corolla Could Launch Next Year With A Plug-In Hybrid Option\n\nWith a new generation of the Corolla on the horizon for a 2026 debut, there is a good chance that Toyota will update the GR Corolla to keep them in sync. Rather than a full redesign, the next iteration of the performance compact model could be a comprehensive refresh, refining key aspects while building on its existing strengths.\n\nToyota has two likely options for the next GR Corolla\u2019s powertrain: sticking with the turbocharged 1.6-liter three-cylinder in an improved form or upgrading to the new 2.0-liter turbo-four. Either way, it\u2019s expected to keep the GR-Four AWD system and a manual transmission. As for timing, Toyota hasn\u2019t confirmed anything yet, but given the standard Corolla\u2019s upcoming redesign, we wouldn\u2019t expect an updated GR Corolla before 2027.\n\nToyota GR Yaris: Staying Sharp Amid an Uncertain Future\n\nToyota GR Yaris Aero Package\n\nThe GR Yaris is currently the oldest member of Toyota\u2019s GR lineup, having debuted in 2020. However, this rally-bred hot hatch received a major refresh in 2024, gaining more power, updated styling, a revamped interior, and an eight-speed automatic option alongside the six-speed manual. Looking ahead, a new version of the sharper GRMN Yaris is expected to launch in spring 2025, featuring a more focused chassis setup and aggressive aero.\n\nMore: The Toyota GR Yaris Has Never Looked This Wild\n\nThese updates, combined with the lack of direct rivals, should keep the GR Yaris relevant for several more years. That said, Toyota has yet to confirm whether it will develop a true successor when the current model reaches the end of its lifecycle later this decade.\n\nThe biggest challenge for the future of the model could be its high R&D costs, given the extensive modifications required compared to the standard Yaris lineup\u2014including a bespoke platform, drivetrain, and bodywork. Still, Gazoo Racing may be keen to keep the GR Yaris in the mix as a baby brother to the next-gen GR Corolla, even if the Celica takes over as Toyota\u2019s next-generation WRC rally car.\n\nToyota Century GRMN: Ultra-Luxury Performance SUV\n\nToyota Century GRMN\n\nThe Century GRMN is officially happening, and unlike the GR Sport treatment given to the Land Cruiser 300, this is a full-fledged GRMN model promising real performance upgrades.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the Century SUV is essentially Toyota\u2019s answer to the Rolls-Royce Cullinan, blending ultra-luxury with a 3.5-liter plug-in hybrid V6. The GRMN version is expected to take things further, with a sportier chassis setup, upgraded bodywork, and a more potent powertrain, though Toyota hasn\u2019t revealed specific performance figures yet.\n\nA prototype debuted in 2023, and the production model is expected to reach Japan and China soon. Whether Toyota will sell it in other markets remains to be seen, but a high-performance luxury SUV from Gazoo Racing is definitely an interesting experiment.\n\nToyota\u2019s Mysterious GR SUV\n\nToyota GR C-HR, Illustration: CarScoops\n\nBeyond its sports cars and flagship supercar, Toyota has confirmed it\u2019s developing a full-fledged GR variant of one of its SUVs. This model could become the most practical member of the GR lineup, offering a performance-focused option with everyday usability, perfect for enthusiasts who need room for more than just a helmet and a weekend bag.\n\nMore: Everything We Know About The 2026 Toyota RAV4\n\nCompany officials didn\u2019t share specifics, but one possible candidate is the Yaris Cross, given its close ties to the GR Yaris and Lexus LBX Morizo RR. However, its subcompact size is unlikely to appeal to North American buyers, prompting consideration of larger options. If Toyota is indeed aiming for a model with broader global appeal, strong contenders include the Corolla Cross and the upcoming RAV4, both prime candidates for the GR treatment.\n\nMore GR Rumors: Starlet, Prius, and Crown\n\nToyota GR Starlet, Illustration: CarScoops\n\nToyota\u2019s GR expansion doesn\u2019t stop with the vehicles we mentioned above, as there are whispers of high-performance variants of some unexpected models.\n\nGR Starlet: A Budget-Friendly Rally Hatch?\n\nOne intriguing rumor suggests Toyota is developing a GR Starlet, potentially launching in 2026 as its most affordable model\u2014a rally-inspired hot hatch positioned below the GR Yaris. Reports from Japan indicate it may feature a turbocharged 1.3-liter engine producing around 150 hp in roadgoing form, with a more powerful Rally 4-spec version also in the works. However, as exciting as this sounds, Toyota has yet to confirm whether the project is real.\n\nGRMN Prius: A Hybrid Performance Experiment?\n\nToyota GRMN Prius, Illustration: Carscoops\n\nBack in 2023, reports surfaced that Toyota might be working on a GRMN Prius, featuring a boosted plug-in hybrid powertrain, chassis upgrades, and enhanced aerodynamics. The speculation stemmed from the GR Prius Concept shown that year, but since then, Toyota has remained silent. So far, there\u2019s no indication that a hotter Prius will ever make it to production, which is a shame given how good the current generation of the model is.\n\nGR Crown: A Sportier Take on the Crossover?\n\nFinally, there were rumors last year about a GR version of the Crown Crossover, reportedly featuring a more powerful hybrid powertrain and all-wheel drive. However, if we had a say in Toyota\u2019s corporate decisions, we\u2019d argue that the Ferrari Purosangue-style Crown Sport is a far better candidate for the GR treatment, as demonstrated by several speculative renders over the past year.",

Rounding out the top 10 you\u2019ll also find Japanese car models such as the Honda CR-V, Toyota Camry, Nissan Rogue and Honda Civic. However, not every Japanese car will get you as far down the road as you think.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn fact, Japanese manufacturers, including Honda and Toyota, have had some duds over the decades. You might want to avoid these models if you\u2019re shopping for a classic Japanese car that will hold its value while delivering performance, comfort and style.\n\nMazda RX-8\n\nThe first-generation Mazda RX-8 was sold from 2004 to 2008. It had a 4-cylinder engine that wasn\u2019t winning any races with 212 HP. But worse than that, it ranks just 11th in reliability out of 19 Mazda models evaluated by MazdaProblems.com.\n\nThe site reveals complaints about engine failure, power steering jerks, excessive oil consumption and numerous recalls over the years.\n\nFind Out: 2 Reasons New Car Prices Will Crash in 2025\n\nMitsubishi Eclipse\n\nThe Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sporty little car with great gas mileage and decent handling. If you\u2019re buying one of the older models today, you can snag it for just around $3,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. But models made between 1999 and 2003, and again in 2007, seem to be plagued with problems, according to MitsubishiEclipseMA.com.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe rims and wheels tend to become damaged easily or suffer wear and tear over the years, which can make this car look worn out before its time. The tires also wear out more quickly than some models of vehicles. The interior tends to be cheaply made, which means parts can break. Finally, drivers reported trouble with the automatic transmission, power train, and steering on the 1999 model, in particular.\n\nHonda CRX Del Sol\n\nHonda remains a trusted Japanese brand today, with the Honda Civic and Honda CR-V models making Car and Driver\u2019s list of bestselling cars for 2024. However, the Honda CRX Del Sol, designed to replace the beloved Honda CR-X in 1992, was nothing better than \u201cterribly disappointing,\u201d according to HotCars.com.\n\nThe roof leaked. The cabin was noisy. And front brake rotors tended to warp. Far from the sporty coupe of its namesake, the Honda CRX, it seemed to be nothing short of a lemon. Honda no longer makes a car equivalent to the Del Sol.\n\nThe sportiest model you\u2019ll find in the Honda line today is the two-door version of the Civic Si, with late-model used versions going for around $20,000 and worth every penny, considering that Hondas tend to hold their value.\n\nToyota Paseo\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t blame you if you read \u201cToyota Paseo\u201d and said, \u201cToyota Pa-what?\u201d While other Toyotas, like the Camry, Tacoma, RAV4, and even the Prius \u2014 one of the first hybrid cars to gain mainstream popularity \u2014 are household names, the Paseo was barely a blip in the 1990s.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nManufactured from 1991 to 1997, the sub-compact car could have captured more market attention or love from Toyota fans despite being built on the Corolla frame. The car came in a controvertible and regular model. Today, these vehicles go for thousands in excellent condition.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that the Paseo is a bad car. It\u2019s not plagued with mechanical problems like others on this list; it just failed to capture the hearts of \u201990s drivers, so Toyota discontinued it quickly. As such, if you pick one up to restore, with so few available in the U.S., it could be hard to find parts.\n\nSuzuki Samurai and Suzuki X-90\n\nThe \u201990s was a rough decade for Japanese auto manufacturers. Suzuki launched the Suzuki Samurai SUV with boxy lines reminiscent of the Jeep Wrangler. But the car was given a safety rating of \u201cnot acceptable\u201d by Consumer Reports, according to SlashGear.com. It was prone to flipping during sharp maneuvers.\n\nLikewise, the Suzuki X-90 successor had a similar problem of tipping over. However, unlike the Samurai, which had an appealing style, the two-seater X-90 had a weird design. Suzuki was curious to know if it was a coupe, a sports car, or the front half of a pickup truck. It boasted only 90 horsepower and, ultimately, crawled into oblivion, along with the Samurai, as one of the worst Japanese cars ever made.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCaitlyn Moorhead contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Japanese Cars To Stay Away From Buying",

Yuri Kageyama, Associated Press \u25b2\n\nThe first phase spans 506,000 square feet, roughly the size of about five baseball fields. When completed, it will be 3.1 million square feet.\n\nBuilt on the grounds of a shuttered Toyota Motor Corp. auto plant, it's meant to be a place where researchers and startups come together to share ideas, according to Toyoda.\n\nThe square at the center of the apartment complexes of Woven City in Susono city, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Woven by Toyota \u25b2\n\nAmbitious plans for futuristic cities sputtered or are unfinished, including one proposed by Google's parent company, Alphabet, in Toronto; \"Neom\" in Saudi Arabia; a project near San Francisco, spearheaded by a former Goldman Sachs trader, and Masdar City next to Abu Dhabi's airport.\n\nWoven City's construction began in 2021. All the buildings are connected by underground passageways, where autonomous vehicles will scuttle around collecting garbage and making deliveries.\n\nThe square at the center of the apartment complexes of Woven City is seen in February in Susono city, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Woven by Toyota \u25b2\n\nNo one lives there yet. The first residents will number only 100 people.\n\nCalled \"weavers,\" they're workers at Toyota and partner companies, including instant noodle maker Nissin and Daikin, which manufactures air-conditioners. Coffee maker UCC served hot drinks from an autonomous-drive bus parked in a square surrounded by still-empty apartment complexes.\n\nA sign is displayed at Toyota Woven City in Susono city, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Woven by Toyota \u25b2\n\nName a link to company's history\n\nThe city's name honors Toyota's beginnings as a maker of automatic textile looms. Sakichi Toyoda, Daisuke Toyoda's great-great-grandfather, just wanted to make life easier for his mother, who toiled on a manual loom.\n\nThere was little talk of using electric vehicles, an area where Toyota lagged. While Tesla and Byd emerged as big EV players, Toyota pushed hydrogen, the energy of choice in Woven City.\n\nToyota officials acknowledged it doesn't expect to make money from Woven City, at least not for years.\n\nA main street and the complexes at Woven City are seen in February in Susono city, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Woven by Toyota \u25b2\n\nKeisuke Konishi, auto analyst at Quick Corporate Valuation Research Center, believes Toyota wants to work on robotic rides to rival Google's Waymo \u2014 even if it means building an entire complex.\n\n\"Toyota has the money to do all that,\" he said.",

Nobody wants to get stranded halfway or wait forever for their car to charge, no matter how addicted to TikTok they are. This is where Toyota comes in, which wants to make a difference with its latest big bet: solid-state batteries. Just as you read.\n\nThis advance, which seems straight out of a science fiction script, has just received the green light from the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Japan (METI), which means that Toyota will be able to advance its development and production without restrictions. The goal? Batteries that charge in minutes and offer more than 1,000 km of autonomy!!\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about these batteries?\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of solid-state batteries before, but why all the fuss now? The key is that they replace the liquid electrolyte in today\u2019s lithium-ion batteries with a solid material, which brings with it three crucial advantages:\n\nFirst, more range: Toyota promises up to 1,000 km on a single charge.\n\nSecond, fast charges of less than 10 minutes for a full charge (it sounds like a dream, even).\n\nAnd last, they are less prone to overheating and would reduce the risk of fires.\n\nToyota has divided its strategy into different types of batteries, each with a specific purpose:\n\n\u201cPerformance\u201d batteries (2026): Range of 800 km with a more efficient charge.\n\n\u201cPopularization\u201d batteries (2027): More accessible model with 600 km of range and lower cost.\n\nHigh Performance Batteries (2028): The jewel in the crown: 1,000 km of autonomy and charging in 10 minutes.\n\nSounds incredible, right? But the big question is\u2026\n\nWill they arrive on time or is it just another promise?\n\nThis is not the first time that Toyota has announced progress in solid-state batteries. Years ago they assured that they would be ready in 2021, then in 2022, and now it seems that 2030 is the new magic date. Will they arrive this time?\n\nThis time there is a key factor that could speed things up: the Japanese government is betting harder than ever. How? Japan has invested 7 billion dollars so that its battery industry can reduce its dependence on China. The idea is that companies like Toyota, Nissan and Panasonic develop and produce batteries without depending on other companies, thus ensuring a stable and competitive supply. In a market crowned by Tesla, Japan wants to take advantage of its competitors in the race to dominate the electric sector.\n\nKey information\n\nCategory Key Information Toyota\u2019s breakthrough Approved by Japan\u2019s government to advance solid-state battery development for EVs. Key benefits 1,000 km range on a single charge.\n\nUltra-fast charging in under 10 minutes.\n\nEnhanced safety, reducing overheating risks.

Global impact If Toyota meets its targets, solid-state batteries could reshape the EV industry by 2030.\n\nIf Toyota really does manage to bring these batteries to market in the next few years, we could be looking at the end of the main problems affecting electric cars today: range issues.\n\nSolid-state batteries are the automotive industry\u2019s great hope for making electric cars more practical, safe and accessible. If Toyota meets its deadlines, it could mark a turning point in electric mobility and become the undisputed leader in the sector. Are you ready for this future?",

Read our privacy policy\n\nGetting on in years, a friend looking for a bit of reliable transport with easy access asked me what I\u2019d recommend. Almost instinctively I replied: \u201cA Toyota\u201d. Yes, I\u2019m mentally lazy but, not wanting any \u201ccomeback\u201d, telling anyone a Toyota is a good idea least likely to cause a rupturing in personal relationships.\n\nSpecifically, and not just because it was the last car I\u2019d tried, I prescribed a Toyota C-HR to assist with his incipient arthritis. (Indeed, the SUV/crossover boom of recent years can be at least partly attributed to demographics.) For purposes of clarity and brevity, because I was keen to get on with slagging off Donald Trump, I described the C-HR as a sexier-looking version of the Toyota Prius, so familiar to the world \u2013 but taller and easier to get in and out of.\n\nWhich it is \u2013 but it\u2019s much more than that. The C-HR press car I was lent is the later of the two versions to be released, the \u201cplug-in\u201d petrol-electric hybrid, the standard hybrid having already been in the showrooms for some months, and there as yet being no petrol or full-electric battery-powered versions (though there is a proper battery-electric only Lexus sibling).\n\nopen image in gallery Where\u2019s the rear wiper? ( Sean O\u2019Grady )\n\nIf used as intended, using battery power for the great majority of your driving with charging at cheap domestic tariffs overnight, your C-HR will justify the admittedly high list prices that Toyota demands \u2013 about \u00a340,000 and upwards. \u201cAs intended\u201d means a narrow clientele \u2013 the plug-in works best if most of your driving consists of a 20-mile commute to work each way; or around 40 miles if you can charge while you are at work (at non-premium rates). Otherwise, settle for the conventional hybrid (\u201cself-charging\u201d in Toyotaspeak), and save \u00a310,000 instead (enough for plenty of pilates sessions).\n\nTHE SPEC Toyota C-HR Excel PHEV Price: \u00a342,610 (as tested, range starts at \u00a331,300) Engine capacity: 2l-petrol, 4-cyl + 13.6kWh battery, auto Power output (hp): 220 Top speed (mph): 112 0 to 60 (seconds): 8.3 Fuel economy (mpg): 353.1 CO2 emissions (WLTP, g/km): 19\n\nThere\u2019s a wide choice of trim levels and the conventional hybrids come with a choice of petrol engines; all the plug-in ones have a two-litre petrol unit. A clever touch is the way the model name is fully integrated into the rear light \u201cbar\u201d; it\u2019s another way of reassuring its owners that they\u2019ve bought themselves a hi-tech package; and for others, a reminder that \u201cthe car in front is a Toyota\u201d, as the ads used to say.\n\nIt\u2019s a fairly enjoyable car to drive around town and on suburban routes, but it\u2019s a bit noisy when you put your foot down on a fast A-road or motorway. The Toyota\u2019s habitual serenity is rudely intruded upon by the traditional flaw of the hybrid system \u2013 a kind of moaning from the single-gear transmission as the electric motor and petrol engine struggle to build up momentum. As I say, it\u2019s a shame because I thought Toyota had sorted this out; it may be because the plug-in version does carry some extra weight, and battery packs tend to be heavy anyway.\n\nopen image in gallery The controls are delightful to use ( Sean O\u2019Grady )\n\nThere are few other such disappointments. The cabin exudes high quality and the controls are delightful to use, though the steering is, if anything, overly light. It has a comprehensive suite of driver assistance \u2013 these days, extending to a reminder to take a break \u2013 and, as the law rightly dictates, bleeps when you try to exceed the speed limit and corrects your steering if you stray out of lane. Most people hate this, but I find it reassuring.\n\nThis the second generation C-HR, and it\u2019s an even more dramatic-looking thing than its predecessor, though now the designers haven\u2019t bothered trying to make it look like a coupe by \u201chiding\u201d the rear door handles under black appliqu\u00e9 at the tops of the back doors \u2013 which also made them trickier to open. Now we have handles that pop out to greet you \u2013 plainly an improvement.\n\nopen image in gallery The cabin exudes high quality ( Sean O\u2019Grady )\n\nThe C-HR puts looks first and it\u2019s not the most space-efficient, and would indeed suit retired folk more than young families who\u2019d be better off with, say, a Skoda Karoq or MG HS (both outstanding value). But I found this C-HR comfortable company. Its biggest flaw has to be the fact that the steeply raked rear screen has no wiper. It\u2019s supposed to be self-clearing because of aerodynamics, but of course that doesn\u2019t work if you\u2019re pottering around the city.\n\nSuch a flaw in no way fully compensates for the nonetheless delightful fact that the rear parking sensors sound like the first distinctive notes of Jackie Wilson\u2019s 1968 hit \u201cI Get the Sweetest Feeling\u201d. Which is appropriate, given the C-HR\u2019s target audience is well-heeled pensioners who will remember that song from the first time round. Sweet.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nThe fourth-generation Toyota Tacoma, once revered as the gold standard of midsize truck reliability, has found itself in an unfamiliar position, under scrutiny. For decades, the Tacoma was the automotive equivalent of a Swiss Army knife, simple, dependable, and seemingly unbreakable. However, as modern trucks become more complex, even Toyota\u2019s venerable workhorse has developed a troubling knack for electronic gremlins and recall notices.\n\nToyotas Reliability\n\nToyota\u2019s renowned Production System emphasizes precision, lean manufacturing, and quality control, which contributes to vehicles that last for hundreds of thousands of miles.\n\nIndependent surveys by organizations like Consumer Reports and J.D. Power frequently rank Toyota models among the most reliable, reflecting fewer repairs and lower maintenance costs over time.\n\nToyota\u2019s reputation for durability not only keeps repair expenses low but also supports high resale values, making them a smart long\u2011term investment for many drivers.\n\nThe latest headache? A grille shutter malfunction warning that, for one unlucky owner, decided to make its grand entrance three hours deep into the mountains.\n\n\"I'm up in the mountain and this just happened. Will I be able to drive it back? I'm 3 hours away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeap, I made it back with no issues and now this morning all dash messages are gone \ud83d\ude33 Wtf. I already have an appointment on Monday at the dealer \ud83e\udd14 should I still take it?\"\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever owned an older Tacoma, or any truck from the pre-electronic nanny era, you might read this and shake your head. A warning about grille shutters? The idea that an off-road-ready pickup could potentially be sidelined by an aerodynamic efficiency feature seems, at best, counterintuitive. But that\u2019s the reality of modern vehicle engineering. Trucks are no longer just mechanical workhorses; they are rolling computers, governed by sensors, actuators, and lines of code.\n\nWhen one of those systems throws a tantrum, it can leave even the most seasoned drivers wondering if they\u2019re about to be stranded.\n\nGrille Shutter System\n\nTo be fair, the grille shutter system exists for a reason. It helps improve fuel economy by managing airflow through the radiator, opening when cooling is needed and closing at higher speeds for better aerodynamics. In theory, it\u2019s a smart system. But as with so many modern automotive innovations, it also introduces a new point of failure.\n\nWhen it works, no one notices. When it doesn\u2019t, it triggers a dashboard light that, for our unlucky Tacoma owner, appeared at the worst possible moment. And then, just as mysteriously, it disappeared the next morning, leaving behind nothing but confusion and an appointment at the dealership.\n\nThe New TNGA-F Platform\n\nBuilt on Toyota\u2019s new TNGA\u2011F platform, the 4th\u2011gen Tacoma features a lighter, stiffer chassis that enhances both on\u2011road stability and off\u2011road ruggedness.\n\nIt offers a turbocharged 2.4\u2011liter inline\u2011four engine, with an optional i\u2011Force Max hybrid variant, that delivers improved fuel efficiency and robust torque tailored for adventurous driving.\n\nThe refreshed cabin boasts a digital instrument cluster and a large touchscreen interface, paired with enhanced driver aids like Multi\u2011Terrain Select and Crawl Control for a more intuitive and confident ride.\n\nOf course, Toyota\u2019s latest Tacoma has already endured its fair share of teething issues. Earlier this year, a recall was issued for improperly secured axle shafts, a problem severe enough that it could lead to wheels detaching from the truck. Combine that with lingering complaints about the new automatic transmission\u2019s behavior, electrical quirks, and quality control hiccups, and a pattern starts to emerge. The Tacoma is still a capable truck, but it\u2019s facing an identity crisis. Is it the rugged, go-anywhere machine its predecessors were? Or is it a high-tech midsize truck with just enough modern complications to make longtime fans nervous?\n\nShould He Take It To The Dealership?\n\nThe real question here is whether the owner should still take the truck to the dealer now that the warning has vanished. The logical answer is yes, intermittent electronic failures rarely fix themselves permanently. But many Tacoma owners have been down this road before, where a dealer visit results in little more than a software update and a polite suggestion to \u201ckeep an eye on it.\u201d And that\u2019s the frustrating part. In the past, a mechanical failure was obvious. A busted U-joint or a leaking water pump didn\u2019t come and go like a ghost in the machine. You heard it, you saw it, and you fixed it. Today, many issues are invisible, existing only in the truck\u2019s digital brain.\n\nThis is the reality of modern vehicle ownership. While today\u2019s trucks are more powerful, efficient, and feature-packed than ever, they are also more reliant on electronics that can sometimes fail without rhyme or reason. It\u2019s a trade-off that manufacturers have deemed necessary, but it leaves owners dealing with problems that can\u2019t always be solved with a wrench and a little elbow grease.\n\nThe Tacoma Is Still A Workhorse\n\nThe Tacoma did what it was supposed to do, it got its owner home safely. But the lingering doubt, the moment of hesitation when that warning light appeared, is telling. Toyota built its reputation on trust, on the knowledge that a Tacoma would never let you down, no matter where you took it. That trust isn\u2019t gone, but with each new warning light and recall, it\u2019s being tested. And for a truck that\u2019s supposed to be unstoppable, that\u2019s a problem Toyota can\u2019t afford to ignore.\n\nNoah Washington is an automotive journalist based in Atlanta, Georgia.

            "content": "With the opening of a new year, Toyota has introduced a series of new features for its enduringly popular Corolla range \u2013 Hatchback, Touring Sports wagon and Sedan. The new details strengthen Corolla\u2019s market appeal, bringing a fresh look and new sustainable choices when it comes to interior finishes.\n\nThese latest additions enhance the all-round quality and breadth of choice that make the Corolla a powerful proposition at the heart of the European C-segment for family-size cars. These virtues are supported by well-proven quality, reliability and durability and the advanced protection and peace of mind provided by Toyota T-Mate safety and driver assistance features, including the latest generation Toyota Safety Sense. Practicality is achieved with three body styles, and two efficient hybrid powertrains show Toyota's multi-pathway strategy to provide low-emission mobility for everyone.\n\nToyota is moving to adopt sustainable materials where possible in its model range. Following the principle first introduced on the all-new Toyota C-HR, a high-quality synthetic leather material is used to wrap the steering wheel and gear shift knob across all Corolla grades. There is also a new upholstery option for the Mid+ grade Hatchback and Touring Sports. Made from recycled fabrics of different colours, it has a distinctive and appealing look, feels good to the touch and is suitably hard-wearing.\n\nThe colour palette for the Hatchback, Touring Sports and Sedan has been extended to 10 options with the addition of new Metal Oxide, a rich red exterior finish that is offered exclusively as a bi-tone combination with gloss black roof on the Hatchback and Touring Sports models and as a monotone or bi-tone option on the Sedan (all according to grade).\n\nGloss black mirror caps introduce a striking contrast, now available across all model grades, replacing the previous body-coloured caps.\n\nTo complete the 2025 introductions, there is a new 17-inch alloy wheel design for the Mid+ grade in all three body styles. This projects a refined looked with a silver/machined black finish and eye-catching star-shaped wheel cap ornamentation.\n\nProduction of the 2025 Hatchback and Touring Sports models will commence at Toyota Manufacturing UK in February, followed by the launch of Sedan production at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Turkey in March. Sales will commence in March.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nToyota still seems to be the reigning champ when it comes to capable and dependable SUVs. For the most part, the Japanese company has done a great job at damage control, following some recent inconsistencies in build quality. Toyota is downsizing its engine lineup, meaning many models that previously featured V-6 engines, now get an inline-four. As expected, there is noticeable feedback from prospective buyers.\n\nMy research led me to an intriguing post from the Facebook group, 6th Gen 4Runner club. The topic is very relevant to buyers who are cross-shopping between two or more SUV models. In this case, the member who posted was looking at a Toyota 4Runner, but ended up liking another comparable model from a rival Japanese manufacturer. Here's what he says:\n\n\u201cMy thoughts on 4Runner vs Passport.\n\nContemplating a 2025 4Runner vs Passport.\n\nToday I tested this base 2026 PASSPORT RTL.\n\nThe very base model has all-wheel drive standard, 2 clutch pack in the rear axle for dynamic torque distribution of up to 70% of the incoming torque.\n\nHas as standard 3.5L V6 producing 285 hp and 262 lb ft. J35Y8 with no VTEC, basically same as in the Pilot. 8.3in of ground clearance. 21 mpg combined.\n\nCurb weight 4,478 lbs.\n\n3 zone climate control, heated front seats, however no perforation or ventilation, though they are leather appointed, not faux leather, interesting.\n\nDriving: compared to coarse and jerky 2.4T in the 4Runner, the NA V6 is a blessing together with a quick 10 speed auto. Suspension is softly sprung, eats up most road imperfections.\n\nHuge cabin, 2 rows, huge cargo space of 44 cu ft.\n\nMeaty 265/60 18\u201d tires.\n\nSure enough, it\u2019s not apples to apples since it\u2019s a unibody vs body on frame. And 4Runner had a true mechanical 4WD + optional locker + adaptive sway bars in TRD PRO/Trailhunter. + more ground clearance.\n\nPrice of the tested RTL version is $46900 before taxes.\n\nI think the Passport is a more versatile, fun, all all-terrain unibody SUV since 99% of 4Runner owners likely won\u2019t go true offroad\n\nWhat do you think, guys? Are you cross-shopping these 2?\n\nTotally get your different opinions, but just wanted to share my thoughts.\u201d\n\nIt seems the opinions between Toyota 4Runner and Honda Passport are quite divided, as the two SUVs can trade punches all day long.\n\nWhen it comes to off-roading, the Toyota 4Runner's body-on-frame platform gives it an advantage. The Toyota can also tow up to 6,000 pounds, versus the Passport's 5,000. The 4Runner has better approach, departure, and breakover angles \u2013 33/24/24 compared to the Honda Passport's 21.1/24.6/N/A. In terms of ground clearance, the 4Runner, once again, wins with 9.2 inches versus 8.1 for the Honda Passport.\n\nMany people have gripe with the new 2025 Toyota 4Runner not offering a V-6. Some owners claim the 2.4-liter turbo-four, although torquey, is rough. Others are also concerned about the long-term reliability and resale value of all the Toyota SUVs and pickup trucks that feature the four-cylinder turbo, with or without the hybrid tech. To add to the 4Runner's struggle, the Honda Passport Trailsport brings more focus on off-roading, which, while, arguably not as capable as the 4Runner, could be enough for most SUV buyers.\n\nIt is also one of the reasons why some owners are not hesitant about trading in their J250 Land Cruiser for something with a V-6. The fact that dealerships are selling some of these Toyota SUVs for under MSRP is also indicative of the demand. Actually, despite the downsizing trend persisting, there are still a good number of great V-6-powered SUVs you can buy if you are not a fan of hybrids.\n\nJarrod Berns says: \u201cAll of these 4-cylinder turbos pushing these heavy, full-sized trucks/SUVs are going to be no Bueno in about 50,000/60,000 miles folks! You've been warned!\u201d\n\nTony Hernandez: \u201cI was actually thinking the same when I saw the new Passport come out. In my opinion one of the things that\u2019s killing the 4Runner for most of us is the 4-cylinder engine, and what we\u2019ve been seeing happening to the Tundra and the Tacoma. I wouldn\u2019t mine this Passport, especially when I only use the 4wd when it snows, don\u2019t do much off roading.\u201d\n\nAlvin Santoni says: \u201c4Runner is overpriced, 4-cylinder, and hard plastic. Passport is a much better buy.\u201d\n\nOne particular comment explains the benefits and disadvantages of the different types of 4WD systems and why the Honda is better, primarily for on-road driving.\n\nSean Ginnetty says: \u201cOne good thing about the Passport/Ridgeline/Pilot AWD system is that it\u2019s pretty much always sending power to the rear wheels, unless you\u2019re cruising along steady speed. It, actually, biases more to the rear whenever you take off from a stop. So because of that, they never really feel like they are front wheel drive.\n\nJust my thoughts after we had a 22 Pilot for a while. I HATE the feel of front wheel drive and front wheel-based AWD where the rear only gets power if the fronts slip, but I, actually, never minded driving the Pilot. It\u2019s also cool how it sends more power to the outside rear wheel when you hit the gas in turns, which is yet another way it makes it not feel FWD.\n\nOf course those are only ON-road benefits. Anything more than light off-roading, when that rear drive unit starts doing a lot of work, the clutches & fluid heat up quick and can even totally de-clutch from the driveshaft to protect itself. Beyond a moderately rough unpaved road, there\u2019s no comparing the abilities though. Many people don\u2019t need the off road capability of the 4Runner, they just want it, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\nIt\u2019s also a bit of a maintenance headache. Due to how active the clutch packs are in the rear, Honda wants you changing that rear differential fluid at 15,000, and then every 30,000 miles. The proprietary Honda fluid is expensive. We drove the Pilot a lot so those intervals came quickly, but on the other hand it\u2019s very easy to do yourself.\u201d\n\nCan the fourth-generation Toyota 4Runner still make a strong case for itself?\n\nWith the fifth-generation 4Runner being an all-new model and in its early model years, some buyers opt for the \u201csafe\u201d option that is the previous generation. It could be your last chance to get a new (or slightly used) 2024 Toyota 4Runner instead of the new generation, and according to some, this is all the SUV you will ever need.\n\nFourth-generation 4Runner prices are still relatively high, but still nowhere near what the 2025 and newer models cost. Old, but proven tech seems to be more valued than ever with newer Toyotas seemingly proving to be less reliable than their old counterparts.\n\nTony Gulotta says: \u201cHave you considered a used 4R? This is my \u201821 Limited Nightshade with 48k miles and just breaking in.\n\nIt\u2019s 4 years old still looks and smells new.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing this SUV cannot do. It replaced my \u201806 Limited.\n\nThe problem with the new 4R is that it\u2019s a complete revamp and in its first year just like the LC.\n\nThere are lots of kinks to work out and I wouldn\u2019t spend all that $ to spend my time on recalls.\n\nI\u2019m keeping it \u2018till it turns to dust\u202615 more years, maybe more. \u201c\n\nAlthough Toyota 4Runner is a clear winner when it comes to off-road capabilities, many sway in favor of the Honda Passport, as the better daily driver, and has a V-6.\n\nAshley Clark says: \u201cI don't mean to put down the new 4runner. We have 2 4runners but Toyota folded to the pressure of the old era mandates. They are gone now and others are keeping V-6 and V-8s. Toyota should have kept the V-6 option and everyone would be happy. The other issue is that the models built in Japan were slightly better. Sad to say it but the Land Cruisers and 4runners were the best of the best.\u201d\n\nAshley Clark (again) says: \u201cThe new 4Runner with the four-cylinder engine there's no comparison to the older with the V-6. The new Honda Passport has a commercial comparing the new one to the Honda Passport and a claim that their V-6 as far superior and more capable so yes one is a truck and the other is a modular frame but with the new 4 cylinder it's pretty sad that Honda has a better Powertrain.\u201d\n\nJakub Rembisz says: \u201cDead honest... if you're not off-roading, get the Passport. It's cheaper, handles better, and actually has a V6. No reason for people to buy 4Runners anymore.\u201d\n\nKevin Brantley in reply: \u201cJakub Rembisz, as a Yota guy, I wholeheartedly agree. No need to spend the $$$ on a 4Runner unless you\u2019re going full in with a TRD Pro, Trailhunter, or at least TRD OffRoad.\u201d\n\nWesleys Way says: \u201cWe'll more than likely be buying the Trail sport edition Passport. The styling is better and I personally dislike everything going to small turbos.\u201d\n\nHonda's reliability isn't entirely untarnished, and some prospective buyers are worried how the Passport will hold up, long-term. Are the complaints well-founded?\n\nPaul Lee says: \u201cHope the transmission on these are better than that crap 6/9 speed they\u2019ve been using for their V6\u2019s. Never owned a car that needed tranny fluid every 30k.\u201d\n\nThis relates to some issues with Honda transmissions, paired to the early J-series V-6 engines. The five-speed automatic, in particular, was known for premature slippage and failure. So far, the 10-speed automatic seems to be holding up, and most owners are happy with how it works. We may have to revisit this topic once a few years go by.\n\nBrock Spillman says: \u201cThen you would have to deal with the notorious 3.5 oil burning issues, a transverse mounted V-6, and a timing belt. No thanks!\u201d\n\nMaintenance on a transversely-mounted V-6 is typically, more labor-intensive and more expensive compared to the longitudinal layout. Excessive oil consumption is not as wide-spread as some owners make it out to be, and so far, it seems to be an issue on some of the earlier J-series engines (but definitely not all). However, the Variable Cylinder Deactivation (VCM) is known to fail.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Toyota 4Runner and Honda Passport are two very different vehicles, despite both of them being midsize SUVs. Like Juan Phillips says:\n\n\u201cApples Vs oranges.\n\nOne is a car; the other is a truck.\n\nMaybe comparable in shape and layout.\n\nThe 4runner being body on frame will ride and drive like a Conestoga wagon compared to what is essentially an SUV-shaped minivan. I think people will know what they like or need best after the first test drive.\"\n\nBut let us know what you think? Can the Honda Passport be good enough for you if you still plan on doing some off-roading? Or are you willing to trade some on-road ride quality and handling for off-road capabilities?

But then an Aston customer came up with an even wackier plan and commissioned the factory to stuff a V8 in one.\n\nRelated: Aston Martin Cygnet Gets The V8 Engine An Aston Deserves\n\nYou might remember the Super Cygnet from the 2018 Goodwood Festival of Speed, when it caused a stir thundering up Lord March\u2019s driveway. Now that same one-off car is for sale through marque specialists Nicholas Mee.\n\nA Radical Transformation\n\nStarting with a stock, right-hand drive Cygnet, Aston\u2019s engineers totally transformed it over a 10 month period, hauling out the puny 1.33-liter, 97 hp (98 PS) Toyota engine and dropping in a 430 hp (436 PS), 4.7-liter V8 from a Vantage S that sends power to the rear wheels through Aston\u2019s clunky seven-speed Sport Shift paddle-shift transmission.\n\nThat drivetrain mod wasn\u2019t a simple swap because the Cygnet is front-wheel drive. Aston crammed the Vantage front and rear subframe assemblies and suspension into the shell, resulting in a massively wider track and giant transmission tunnel inside the cockpit. The cabin is also home to a roll cage, Recaro bucket seats and a carbon fiber dashboard containing a full set of Vantage gauges.\n\nPerformance: A Tiny Monster\n\nAston reckoned the Super Cygnet could hit 62 mph (100 kmh) in 4.2 seconds and probably reach 170 mph (274 kmh) if you were feeling brave enough. Check out the clip of the car running at the FoS in 2018 and it certainly looks rapid. It also looks more than a little twitchy as it gets near the top of the Goodwood hill, which is probably down to the tiny 2,020 mm (79.5 inches) wheelbase.\n\nThe Super Cygnet\u2019s original owner has covered just 2,900 miles (4,700 km) in the green mutant, but has now decided to pass it on. Even ordinary Cygnets are changing hands for more than \u00a328,000 in the UK ($35,000), versus \u00a34,000 ($5,000) for an IQ, but this is definitely no ordinary Cygnet, so it was always going to be expensive.\n\nThe Price of Madness\n\nAccording to Nicholas Mee\u2019s ad (check it out here), the price is listed as POA (Price on Application), but the company told us they\u2019re hoping to get \u00a3450,000 ($566,000). Yes, that\u2019s an awful lot of money. For that price, you could buy yourself a proper Aston Martin\u2014just maybe not one that\u2019ll make you the center of attention the way this absurd little thing will.",

            "content": "The 2025 Hyundai Palisade and the 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander represent two of the newer three-row SUVs for families to choose from, but which one is best?\n\nWe'd recommend either one over the base Toyota Highlander, which is smaller\u2014and a better value\u2014than the larger, more refined Grand Highlander. For a detailed difference between the two Toyotas, check out our Highlander vs. Grand Highlander compare. For 2025, the Toyota Highlander Hybrid now comes only with AWD, and a higher pricer, while Toyota expands the trim levels and offerings of the Grand Highlander. This may be in anticipation of the Highlander becoming an all-electric model for 2026.\n\nUpdates to the 2025 Palisade are more straightforward following its mid-cycle refresh last year.\n\nWhen the Hyundai Palisade launched for 2020, finally giving the brand a proper three-row crossover SUV, it was nearly 20 years after Toyota launched the Highlander. It learned some things from Toyota\u2019s family hauler benchmark, with a roomier third row and luxury-leaning features and design.\n\nNow Toyota is learning from Hyundai. It launched a larger, more luxurious version dubbed the Grand Highlander for 2024\u2014and maintains two hybrid powertrain options.\n\nIs it enough to subdue the Palisade, and keep shoppers coming to Toyota? Or has Hyundai gotten too good? Here\u2019s how the two measure up.\n\n2025 Toyota Grand Highlander\n\nHyundai Palisade vs. Toyota Highlander price and trims\n\nHighlander costs between $41,000 and $54,000; Grand Highlander ranges from $42,500 to $60,000\n\nHighlander and Grand Highlander Hybrids cost about $47,000, but that includes standard AWD\n\nPalisade offered in SE, SEL, XRT, Limited, and Calligraphy grades, ranging from $38,000 to $53,000\n\nBest picks: Hyundai Palisade SEL for $42,000; Toyota Grand Highlander LE Hybrid for $47,000\n\nWhich Toyota Highlander should I buy?\n\nThe $41,000 Highlander LE (including a $1,450 destination fee) comes with an 8.0-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a power driver seat, cloth upholstery, and 18-inch wheels. All Highlanders get an average 3-year/36,000-mile warranty, though Toyota throws in two years or 25,000 miles of scheduled service.\n\nAll-wheel drive costs between $1,600-$2,000, with the higher price tacked on to higher trims. The hybrid upcharge of about $5,000 includes all-wheel drive, and it's no longer offered on the base Highlander LE. That means the 2025 Highlander XLE Hybrid AWD starts the bidding at $47,450, so the $46,000 Grand Highlander LE Hybrid AWD marks the better hybrid deal.\n\nThe Grand Highlander LE costs about $42,500 and is the best deal here. It has power front seats that are heated and covered in synthetic leather, a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless smartphone connectivity and a wireless smartphone charger, a power tailgate, and blind-spot monitors.\n\nWhich Hyundai Palisade should I buy?\n\nHyundai offers the Palisade in SE, SEL, XRT, SEL Premium, Limited, Calligraphy, and a Calligraphy Midnight trim that crests $55,000, including the $1,415 destination fee. For $38,500, the Palisade SE has a 12.3-inch touchscreen with navigation but it still requires wired smartphone connectivity. USB ports in the first two rows and three-zone climate control keep it family friendly, as do power second-row seats. The whole family might not appreciate it except for the ones controlling the pursestrings, but Hyundai\u2019s industry-leading 5-year/60,000-mile warranty includes three years or 36,000 miles\u2019 worth of scheduled maintenance. That itself could be a dealmaker.\n\nAll-wheel drive adds $2,000 on models where it\u2019s available and not already standard.\n\nFor $2,750 more, consider our recommended pick in the SEL. It adds synthetic leather seats, power front seats that are heated, second-row captain\u2019s chairs, a wireless smartphone charger, and a power tailgate. That's the best deal for the Palisade, and really the best value between these three models if you don't want a hybrid.\n\nThe $4,600 Premium Package tempts with 20-inch wheels, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, front parking sensors, a surround-view camera system, a sunroof, memory for the driver\u2019s seat, a heated steering wheel, heated second-row seats, cooled front/middle row seats, a blind-spot camera, plus the automaker\u2019s more advanced adaptive cruise control system. That brings the total to just over $45,000, and it\u2019s better equipped than the Highlander XLE models.\n\nAdvantage: Hyundai Palisade unless you want a hybrid, then look to the Grand Highlander LE Hybrid.\n\n2023 Hyundai Palisade 2023 Hyundai Palisade 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander\n\nHighlander vs. Palisade interior and exterior design\n\nThe handsome Hyundai Palisade outshines the smaller Highlander\n\nThe Highlander carries over, the Grand Highlander stands out\n\nThe Palisade cabin outshines the Grand Highlander\u2019s\n\nIs the Toyota Highlander a good-looking SUV?\n\nIt depends. The Grand Highlander dwarfs the carryover Highlander that appears dated in comparison. The ends of the standard Highlander have gotten sharper, giving it an edge, but it still wears the same body bulge that rises over the rear fender as in the Sienna minivan.\n\nNot only is the Grand Highlander 6.5 inches longer, 2.3 inches wider, and 2.0 inches taller than the Highlander, it\u2019s smoother and more sophisticated than the Highlander. The vertical face and scalloped rocker panels look more like the Palisade than the Highlander, but Toyota wraps the back end in a more cohesive package than the Hyundai.\n\nThe Grand Highlander benefits from newness inside with an available 12.3-inch touchscreen that fits better in the dash, even if it sticks up like a digital thumb. Storage spaces abound in either model, with a smart shelf above the glove box highlighting the space optimization. An electronic gear shifter that takes up a lot less space than the mechanical shifter in the Highlander.\n\nIs the Hyundai Palisade a good-looking car?\n\nRefreshed for 2023, the Hyundai Palisade gets busy on the outside with a wide cascading grille plated like a printing press, and tipped with indicator lights. The DRLs stand upright, flanking stacked headlight housings. It projects either assertiveness or confusion. It would be harder to argue the merits of the chrome band that splits the C-pillar and separates the rear quarter window from the rest of the greenhouse. The XRT model has dark trim elements, fake skid plates, black roof rails, black 20-inch alloy wheels, power sunroof, and black synthetic leather inside.\n\nHyundai smoothed out the Palisade\u2019s interior, starting with a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen housed under the same curving piece of glass as the instrument cluster. A slim band of vents underlines the screen, which itself is underscored by a thin panel of climate and menu controls. It combines to give the dash a low, horizontal profile that evokes roominess. The console holds an electronic gear dial and has a welcome blend of hidden storage compartments and soft-touch surfaces lined with metal trim.\n\nAdvantage: Grand Highlander exterior, Palisade interior.\n\n2025 Hyundai Palisade\n\n2025 Toyota Grand Highlander\n\nPalisade vs. Highlander size, seating comfort, and cargo capacity\n\nAll three have three rows of seats for eight passengers\n\nGrand Highlander is 201.4 inches long, with a 116.1-inch wheelbase\n\nHighlander is 194.9 inches long, with a 112.2-inch wheelbase\n\nPalisade is 196.7 inches long, with a 114.2-inch wheelbase\n\nPalisade splits the difference in size between the Highlanders\n\nThe Grand Highlander outsizes both the Palisade and the standard Highlander first as it is the roomiest and most spacious for passengers. But the Hyundai Palisade simplifies seat folding. All three models have three seats in the third row and available captain\u2019s chairs in the second row.\n\n2024 Toyota Grand Highlander 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander\n\nHow big is the Toyota Highlander?\n\nGrand Highlander cargo room measures 20.6 cubic feet behind the third row, 57.9 cubic feet behind the second row, 97.5 cubic feet with both rear rows flat\n\nHighlander cargo space is 16.0/48.4/84.3 cubic feet\n\nGrand Highlander third-row legroom is 33.5 inches, compared to 27.7 inches in the standard Highlander\n\nConsistent with their sizes, the Hyundai Palisade splits the difference in roominess and cargo space between the Grand Highlander and the standard Highlander. All three can seat eight passengers, but the Grand Highlander does it best.\n\nIt comes standard with captain\u2019s chairs and seating for seven, though Toyota offers a mid-row bench at no cost. The Grand Highlander has 1.5 inches less second-row legroom than the standard Highlander at 41.0 inches, and the seats sit on a shelf that\u2019s about four inches high to make room for the hybrid battery pack. The shelf is there on gas or hybrid Grands, and the floor stays elevated in the third row, so your knees ride a bit higher.\n\nWith 33.5 inches of rear legroom, and built-in dual cupholders above the wheel wells, it\u2019s roomy enough back there even with the panoramic sunroof to fit two adults as long as the mid-row passengers slide their seats up halfway to allow for more toeroom.\n\nFrom the cargo area, pull straps collapse the wayback seats and their headrests, simplifying folding of the 60/40-split third row. Levers on the side of the seats and latches on the top of the second-row seats could be a challenge for smaller hands, especially compared to the push-button second-row seats standard on the Palisade.\n\n2023 Hyundai Palisade 2023 Hyundai Palisade 2023 Hyundai Palisade\n\nHow big is the Hyundai Palisade?\n\nCargo space measures out to 18.0/45.8/86.4 cubic feet\n\nSecond-row legroom is 42.4 inches\n\nThird-row legroom is 31.4 inches\n\nThe Palisade\u2019s rear seats are easier to operate for the whole spectrum of potential passengers than those in either Highlander. One finger press slides the second row forward for easy egress to the third row, and getting out is just as easy. The third row reclines, and also has cupholders and USB ports in most grades, while top trims have heated and cooled seats, as well as power folding functions. The 31.4 inches of rear legroom is above average for the third-row class.\n\nFront-seat occupants get the comfiest thrones, with power adjustments and heating on all but the base model. Plenty of bolstering and lumbar support, as well as pillowy cushions, provide enough comfort to ignore most of the bickering from the rear rows on road trips.\n\nThere\u2019s enough room in back behind the third row for everyone to stow a rollaboard for each passenger.\n\nAdvantage: Grand Highlander space, Palisade seats.\n\n2023 Hyundai Palisade 2023 Hyundai Palisade 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander\n\nToyota Highlander vs. Hyundai Palisade towing, off-road, and performance\n\nHighlander has three engine options, including two hybrid choices\n\nPalisade presents only a 291-hp V-6 that makes 262 lb-ft of torque\n\nTowing maxes out at 5,000 pounds in both models\n\nIs the Hyundai Palisade 4WD?\n\nIt can be, for an extra $1,900. Front-wheel drive comes standard, but AWD models add a locking center differential with additional Snow and Tow modes. The locking center diff splits the torque evenly between the axles under 40 mph for better traction on slick or muddy surfaces.\n\nThe Palisade is built for comfort, not speed or climbing ability. It rides soft, and handles like it\u2019d rather not be pushed, and that\u2019s fine, as it does a good job insulating the road from the driver. It has a self-leveling rear suspension that keeps it balanced instead of sagging while towing up to 5,000 pounds.\n\nHow fast is the Hyundai Palisade?\n\nThe 291-hp 3.8-liter V-6 pairs with an 8-speed automatic that has good power off the line, and it downshifts quick enough or can be overridden with paddle shifters to hustle the bulky SUV on passing moves. Four drive modes (Smart, Sport, Eco, and Comfort) change the throttle mapping, so the pedal is mushier in Eco mode and springier in Sport mode, but it\u2019s best left alone in Smart mode. It lacks the grunt of the Grand Highlander Hybrid Max, but packs a much bigger punch than the Highlander hybrid.\n\nIs the Toyota Highlander 4WD?\n\nBoth Highlanders come with front-wheel drive, while AWD could be a $1,600-$1,950 option. It's standard on hybrid models. The basic setup splits off half the power to the rear wheels when slip happens for all-wheel drive on demand. Limited and Platinum gas Highlanders have torque vectoring across the rear axle for more precise power delivery and better handling. The AWD hybrid adds a third motor powering the rear axle when called upon.\n\nThe hybrid powertrain exclusive to the Grand Highlander uses a full-time all-wheel-drive system that routes torque based on driver inputs and modes: Sport mode has more rear axle torque for better takeoff, and Snow or Rock & Dirt modes have low-speed torque more evenly apportioned for more traction.\n\nHow fast is the Toyota Highlander?\n\nIt ranges from pokey, to punchy, to palpable.\n\nThe 2.5-liter inline-4 hybrid with two front motor generators available on both Highlander models makes 243 hp and 175 lb-ft and gets to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. With a light foot and the right circumstances, it runs in silent EV mode up to about 15 mph; a heavy foot or an uphill climb might make it protest. Its charm is in efficiency, not assertiveness. Towing is limited to 3,500 pounds.\n\nBase versions of both Highlanders share a 2.4-liter turbo-4 that makes 265 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque. It has a bit more gusto than the Palisade. Paired with an 8-speed automatic in front- or available all-wheel drive, it\u2019s louder than the hybrids but all that torque comes on early to give it plenty of grunt for passing moves. It goes from 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds in the larger Grand Highlander.\n\nThe Grand Highlander\u2019s Hybrid Max powertrain pairs the 2.4-liter turbo-4 with a motor at either axle bound together by a 6-speed automatic transmission. Total output reaches 362 hp and 400 lb-ft, good for a 0-60 mph of 6.3 seconds that seems quicker behind the wheel of a large vehicle. It\u2019s the most powerful powertrain here, and it\u2019s more efficient than the Palisade\u2019s V-6.\n\nAdvantage: Grand Highlander.\n\n2023 Hyundai Palisade 2023 Hyundai Palisade 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander\n\nHyundai Palisade vs. Highlander fuel economy\n\nThe Hyundai Palisade has an EPA rating of 19 mpg city, 27 highway, 22 combined; AWD rates at 19/25/21 mpg\n\nHighlander turbo-4 rates at 22/29/25 mpg or 21/28/24 mpg with AWD; the Grand Highlander loses 1 mpg combined\n\nHighlander hybrid rates at 35/35/35 mpg with AWD\n\nGrand Highlander hybrid is 36/32/34 mpg with AWD\n\nGrand Highlander Hybrid Max maxes out at 26/27/27 mpg\n\nAdvantage: The Highlander, across the board.\n\n2024 Toyota Grand Highlander 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander 2023 Hyundai Palisade 2023 Hyundai Palisade\n\nHighlander vs. Palisade safety\n\nThe Palisade earned a Top Safety Pick and a five-star NHTSA rating\n\nThe Highlander earned a Top Safety Pick, but the Grand Highlander missed it\n\nAll three models come standard with automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, active lane control, and adaptive cruise control\n\nHow safe is the Toyota Highlander?\n\nThe Grand Highlander hasn\u2019t been crashed yet by the NHTSA, and the IIHS gave it an \"Acceptable\" rating for its front crash protection, precluding it from a Top Safety Pick award. The IIHS rates the standard Highlander as a Top Safety Pick, and the NHTSA gives it five stars.\n\nHighlander XLE and above models add blind-spot monitors to the standard driver-assist tech mentioned above, and most versions can be upgraded with parking sensors, a head-up display, and a surround-view camera system. A limited hands-free driving system for stop-and-go traffic at speeds under 25 mph will be offered via subscription on the Grand Highlander.\n\nHow safe is the Hyundai Palisade?\n\nThe Palisade aces crash tests. It earns a five-star rating from the NHTSA and a Top Safety Pick from the IIHS. A new front crash test launched this year to measure rear-seat protection challenged the Palisade, however, same as in the Grand Highlander.\n\nHyundai equips the Palisade with more standard driver assistance tech than the Highlander, due to its standard blind-spot monitors. High-end versions have front parking sensors plus a more advanced automatic emergency braking system that can react to potential collisions at intersections. A surround-view camera system and blind-spot cameras that project images in the instrument cluster are noteworthy options.\n\nAdvantage: Palisade.\n\n2025 Toyota Grand Highlander\n\nWhich is better: Hyundai Palisade or Toyota Highlander?\n\nElevated by the new Grand Highlander, the Toyota Highlander matches the Hyundai Palisade\u2019s high TCC Rating of 7.0 out of 10. (Read more about how we rate cars.) Its more sophisticated design, as well as the larger size and roomier cabin stands above the standard Highlander. If measured alone against the Palisade, the Grand Highlander slightly outranks the Hyundai due to its more cohesive exterior design and hybrid powertrain options. Yet the Palisade has more value baked into it than the Grand Highlander, which narrows the already small gap between the two\u2014and while Hyundai's reputation is good but not great for reliability, Toyota's no longer the most reliable car brand, either.",

With models like the GR86, GR Corolla, and the GR Supra, Toyota has carved out a solid niche. And now, even as the brand continues to shift toward electrification, there\u2019s good news for enthusiasts: the GR family won\u2019t be ditching gas engines\u2014or manual transmissions\u2014anytime soon.\n\nMore: Mazda Inline-Six Rumor For New GR Supra And RX-7 Sounds Too Wild To Be True\n\n\u201cCombustion engines and manual transmissions will be around for a long, long time,\u201d says Sean Hanley, an executive with Toyota in Australia while speaking to CarSales. If this were an infomercial, we\u2019d cue the slow clap. In a world filled with bad or worse news, he\u2019s brought us some things to get excited about.\n\nOver the past few years, cars like the GR Supra, GR Corolla, and GR 86 have continued to make their mark in the enthusiast community. It seems that trend will continue, at least for the foreseeable future, with gas-powered engines and manual gearboxes remaining a key part of Toyota\u2019s performance strategy.\n\nA Firm Commitment to Driving Pleasure\n\nHanley made it clear that GR was on its own path so to speak. \u201cEven as we transition to electrification, there is still room to satisfy dyed-in-the-wool performance car lovers, and these enthusiasts are not a dying breed,\u201d he said. So, no need to panic and assume Toyota\u2019s about to slather some synthetic exhaust sounds onto an EV prototype to mimic the feeling of a real sports car.\n\nHe clarified what he meant stating, \u201cWhile we\u2019re focused on future electrification for the rest of our model line-up, we plan to keep GR about the sounds, about the smells and the feel of a combustion engine \u2013 that snap, crackle and pop we all love so much.\u201d Unless the automaker plans on baking in some petrol-scented diffusers in its EVs, he\u2019s got to be talking about genuine combustion engines.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting in all of this that Hanley wasn\u2019t dogmatic about Toyota\u2018s approach to performance-oriented cars. He made it clear that the automaker could, in theory, propel a sports-focused car with hydrogen in the future.\n\nEven when the company eventually does venture into electric sports cars, they plan to maintain the core values that make GR cars appealing: raw performance and real driving engagement. Hanley emphasized that the GR brand will still cater to \u201cevery car enthusiast and performance fan\u201d with future offerings.\n\nSounds like a future we can all get behind.\n\nCredit: Stephen Rivers",

It sits near the southern Japanese city of Susono. Company officials recently showed off the latest progress to reporters from the Associated Press.\n\nDaisuke Toyoda is an executive for Toyota who is helping lead the project. He told the AP that the center was not designed to be a \u201csmart city.\u201d However, it aims to carry out technology research and development and be \u201ca test course for mobility.\u201d\n\nThe company said Woven City would serve as a \u201cLiving Laboratory.\u201d It aims to test technology systems to support future changes in \u201cthe movement of people, goods, information and energy.\u201d\n\nToyoda said the center is meant to be a place where researchers and technology company officials can come together and share ideas. It will also seek to establish a community with a shared desire \u201cto co-create, develop and refine\u201d new technology products and services.\n\nWoven City was built on the grounds of a closed Toyota automobile factory. The automaker said the project\u2019s first phase covers about 47,000 square meters. When completed, it will spread out over 294,000 square meters.\n\nBuilding operations on Woven City began in 2021. All the buildings are connected by underground passageways. Among planned testing activities will include self-driving vehicles making waste pickups and completing deliveries around the area. Testing operations will center on how people living in cities can best interact with changing technologies.\n\nCurrently, no one lives in Woven City. When it opens, officials plan on having about 100 people living there. They will be called \u201cweavers.\u201d These are workers employed by Toyota and its partner companies making other products.\n\nWhen AP reporters visited the area, Japanese coffee maker UCC was serving hot drinks from a self-driving bus. The bus was parked in an area surrounded by still-empty housing.\n\nToyota has supported electric vehicle (EV) technology in the past. However, the company is currently involved in a push for hydrogen, the energy of choice in Woven City.\n\nKeisuke Konishi is an automobile expert at Japan\u2019s Quick Corporate Valuation Research Center. He told the AP Toyota has plans to expand into self-driving vehicle services to compete with Google\u2019s Waymo and other large companies.\n\nKonishi noted the company has the money for such development even if it means building up a completely new business. \u201cToyota has the money to do all that,\u201d he said.\n\nToyota officials have said they do not expect Woven City to make money, at least not for the first few years.\n\nSeveral other futuristic developments have been planned in other areas of the world over the years. They have included efforts in Toronto, Canada; Saudi Arabia; Abu Dhabi; and San Francisco, California. But those projects are either still being developed or have been canceled.\n\nI\u2019m Bryan Lynn.\n\nThe Associated Press reported this story.

Problem Solved\n\nWhen its wheels are not at risk of falling off, the Toyota bZ4X electric SUV isn't so bad, though it does have disappointing range for the price compared to its competitors. Now, the Toyota EV lineup is finally growing with a more compact (and hopefully easier to pronounce) SUV model that will be revealed next month. Here's what we know so far.\n\nThe teaser images do not reveal too much, but we do already know based on a concept vehicle that looks just like this from a few years ago that it should be a more compact model than the existing bZ4X EV. The concept was said to be around six inches shorter in length and 3.5 inches lower in overall height than its bigger sibling.\n\n2025 Toyota SUVs: What\u2019s new with RAV4, Highlander, 4Runner and Crown Signia\n\nIt looks like Toyota is continuing to ape its upscale Lexus design department for its more mainstream products, as it did with the bZ4X previously. We can make out an angular look, a notched shoulder line and edged creases around the entire body. The images reveal C-shaped headlights modeled after the brand's Crown lineup and recent Prius and Camry design updates, and a full-bar rear taillight under the rear window, with a little winglet above the light unit for likely improved aero efficiency.\n\nMore Toyota news: Toyota Tacoma truck recalled for excessive dirt build-up\n\nIt's unclear how big of a battery or how many motors the new compact EV SUV might get for now, but it should ride on the same e-TNGA platform as the bZ4X. A new \"Urban Cruiser\" electric SUV from Toyota in Europe sports 49- and 61-kWh battery pack options, so those could port over here. The bZ4X gets around with a near-72-kWh battery pack, depending on configuration. Toyota claims the new compact EV will have \"elevated driving dynamics,\" which should be a plus because the bZ4X really hates to be pushed hard, as we found in our SUVOTY testing back in 2023.\n\nToyota revealed very little about the concept version of this model back in 2022, and has now revealed even less about the coming production version. Still, it should come priced lower than the bigger bZ4X, which starts at $38,465 before incentives. We'll learn more about this new vehicle at its full reveal on March 11. The teaser was only posted to the European Toyota newsroom website, so hopefully it still comes stateside one day, too.\n\nPhotos by manufacturer",

At the end of three hours of practice, the #8 of S\u00e9bastien Buemi, Brendon Hartley and Ryo Hirakawa was the lead GR010 HYBRID in sixth, with the #7 crew of Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi and Nyck de Vries in 13th after a constructive day in challenging conditions.\n\n\n\nFollowing the two-day Prologue last week, the team\u2019s engineers and drivers had prepared for today\u2019s action by analysing data from the GR010 HYBRIDs and the Michelin tyres, working to optimise performance for the race. Meanwhile, all six drivers also joined local Toyota colleagues on Sunday for a lap time competition with GR Yaris Cup Qatar race cars, sharing the excitement of motorsports. Visitors to Lusail International Circuit can also get their own taste of the GR Yaris Cup Qatar via a TOYOTA GAZOO Racing display in the fan zone.\n\n\n\nWhen free practice began late on windy Wednesday morning, both GR010 HYBRIDs remained in the garage for almost 10 minutes to assess conditions, which had changed since the Prologue due to a change in wind direction causing sand to be blown on to the racing line. Eventually, both cars began on-track preparations for Friday\u2019s race, working on tyres and car set-ups.\n\n\n\nNyck and Brendon set the fastest laps for their respective cars. The #7 was 13th and the #8 fourth on the timing sheets in a close session which was interrupted by a 10-minute red flag and ended with less than a second separating the quickest 11 cars.\n\n\n\nSecond practice started in daylight and ran into darkness, with floodlights illuminating Lusail International Circuit as the team carried out more tyre and race preparations. Brendon made the most of an early lap with lower fuel load to record the best time for the #8, sixth overall. Nyck waited until later in the session to test a qualifying set-up and register the best lap in the #7, putting that car 13th on the timing sheets.\n\n\n\nThe team will now work on improvements prior to third practice on Thursday lunchtime, which is the final opportunity to try new settings before qualifying and Hyperpole later in the day (5.40pm local, 3.40pm CET). The race starts at 2pm (midday CET) on Friday 28 February.",

Why Trust Us?\n\nAs a racing driver himself, Akio Toyoda, Toyota Motor Company\u2019s chairman, is one of only a few automotive top brass who knows proper car control. He even has a nickname, \u201cMorizo,\u201d which he used to secretly race the 24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring in 2007. Along with possessing a deep understanding of how to make Toyotas go fast, he\u2019s taking big steps to steer the future of for Toyota.\n\nThat starts with investing in solid-state batteries, which Toyota hopes to implement in its customer vehicles as soon as 2027, with mass production set for 2030 and beyond.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t be the first to tell you that EV interest has waned considerably since its prominence in the early 2010s. When the technology was in its infancy, there was a linear trajectory of improvement; that linearity has since plateaued, and we see EVs now with an average of around 300 miles of range, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. We\u2019ve reached the apex of current battery tech, and many automakers are now looking at solid-state batteries as the answer.\n\nWhat Is a Solid State Battery?\n\nCourtesy Toyota\n\nInherent in their name, solid-state batteries use, well, solid electrolytes instead of liquid. Toyota says the new battery tech allows for faster movement of ions and a greater tolerance for high voltages and temperatures. These qualities bring many advantages, especially longer range and faster charging times.\n\nToyota says its batteries of the future would be able to supply 620 miles of range and be fast-charged from 10 percent to 80 percent in under 10 minutes, which is about the time it takes to refuel your typical gasoline vehicle.\n\nSolid electrolytes also lower the risk of fires while increasing energy density\u2014the amount of energy a battery can deliver compared to its weight. This will theoretically allow Toyota to produce a higher-capacity battery pack that\u2019s lighter and more powerful than ever. For context, the Japanese automaker says its prototype batteries are about the size and thickness of a thin spiral notebook.\n\nWhat\u2019s Holding Back Current Battery Tech?\n\nHeat is the biggest enemy of the current battery technology: Charging a battery quickly produces a tremendous amount of heat. The same can be said for rapidly discharging a battery; it\u2019s one of the reasons why high-performance EVs struggled for such a long time to do a full lap of the 12.9-mile Nurburgring Nordschleife course.\n\nMini was the first to attempt a lap record in 2010 with a prototype EV-converted Mini Cooper\u2014setting a somewhat lukewarm lap time of nine minutes and 52 seconds.\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s motorsport division already developed a bespoke fast-charging solution for its I.D. R Pikes Peak car as early as 2018. Considered to be cutting-edge technology at the time, it was able to juice up the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes. However, the lithium-ion (liquid electrolyte) battery still struggled to keep cool with the amount of energy being pumped into it in such a short amount of time. Seven years later, we\u2019re still facing the same issues with the same technology in road vehicles.\n\nWhat Are the Practical Benefits of Solid-State Batteries?\n\nAlong with greater range and fast charging times, Toyota is also looking at the aerodynamic benefits of solid-state batteries. Most EVs have their battery packs mounted underneath the vehicle\u2019s floor to keep the center of gravity low. However, Toyota says the current batteries are too tall, forcing vehicles to run a higher ride height to stop them from scraping the ground.\n\nThis is detrimental not only to handling, but also aerodynamics. If we reduce the height of the battery pack, the vehicle\u2019s height can also be reduced, lowering its CdA (coefficient of drag multiplied by frontal area) and increasing its effective range.\n\nFor context, Toyota says the battery pack in its all-electric bZ4X is 150mm tall (5.9 inches), while its batteries of tomorrow could be made as thin as 120mm\u20144.7 inches. Sure, that\u2019s just a sneeze over an inch of ride height, but that\u2019s not an insignificant amount. The Japanese automaker also mentioned that it would be able to shave another 20mm off to make low-profile batteries for performance EVs where weight distribution is even more important.\n\nIs There Any Competition?\n\nMatt Crisara\n\nUnsurprisingly, Toyota isn\u2019t the only automaker looking to implement solid-state batteries. Nissan, Honda, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Ford, and let\u2019s not forget Tesla\u2014among others\u2014are all working on implementing solid-state batteries before 2030. We\u2019ll have to see how this evolves in the United States, pending the effects of tariffs on the automotive industry.\n\nMany manufacturers are considering \u2014combining solid and liquid electrolytes\u2014to be a more approachable alternative in the interim. Solid-state batteries have many \u201choly grail\u201d benefits, but they aren\u2019t without compromise. For instance, solid-state batteries are much more complicated to produce, still have longevity concerns, and swell considerably while charging.",

Now, the Toyota EV lineup is finally growing with a more compact (and hopefully easier to pronounce) SUV model that will be revealed next month. Here's what we know so far.\n\nThe teaser images do not reveal too much, but we do already know based on a concept vehicle that looks just like this from a few years ago that it should be a more compact model than the existing bZ4X EV. The concept was said to be around 6 inches shorter in length and 3.5 inches lower in overall height than its bigger sibling.\n\nIt looks like Toyota is continuing to ape its upscale Lexus design department for its more mainstream products, as it did with the bZ4X previously. We can make out an angular look, a notched shoulder line, and edged creases around the entire body. The images reveal C-shaped headlights modeled after the brand's Crown lineup and recent Prius and Camry design updates, and a full-bar rear taillight under the rear window, with a little winglet above the light unit for likely improved aero efficiency.\n\nIt's unclear how big of a battery or how many motors the new compact EV SUV might get for now, but it should ride on the same e-TNGA platform as the bZ4X. A new \"Urban Cruiser\" electric SUV from Toyota in Europe sports 49- and 61-kWh battery pack options, so those could port over here. The bZ4X gets around with a near-72-kWh battery pack, depending on configuration. Toyota claims the new compact EV will have \"elevated driving dynamics,\" which should be a plus because the bZ4X really hates to be pushed hard, as we found in our SUVOTY testing back in 2023.\n\nToyota revealed very little about the concept version of this model back in 2022, and has now revealed even less about the coming production version. Still, it should come priced lower than the bigger bZ4X, which starts at $38,465 before incentives. We'll learn more about this new vehicle at its full reveal on March 11. The teaser was only posted to the European Toyota newsroom website, so hopefully it still comes stateside one day, too.",

Sales have fallen just short of 100,000 the past two years largely due to competition from the Ford Bronco, which managed to beat the Wrangler sales-wise in 2023 and 2024. If we don\u2019t have the most popular off-roaders in America for this comparison test, it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re as close as we could get. (We asked for a Bronco, but Ford declined our request.) Let's see how the 2025 Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium fares against the 2025 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited 4xe Willys \u201941, shall we?\n\nWhen you think about the Jeep Wrangler, it\u2019s hard to escape its impressive heritage. What other vehicle still in production today can trace its lineage directly back to World War II? Well, the Chevrolet Suburban has been in production longer (since the 1935 model year), served the Allies well during the big one, and can still be purchased new in 2025. But never mind GM\u2019s failure to advertise this fact; the Wrangler has roots that trace back to General Patton and the Seventh Army recapturing Palermo. These roots tend to make all other off-roaders look like relative children. Although, and maybe we\u2019re just starting to feel old, the Toyota 4Runner itself has been around a long time, too; introduced in 1983 as the Hilux Surf in Japan and other markets, the 4Runner came to the States as a 1984.5 model. Yes, the basic Jeep archetype has been around for more than twice as long (the Wrangler nameplate arrived in 1986), but 40 years in the SUV game means this Toyota\u2019s no noob.\n\nOn the Road\n\nIt won\u2019t be news to anyone who\u2019s been paying attention, but this is an easy win for Toyota. Say whatever you want about the Wrangler\u2019s rock-crawling ability, around town and on the highway it feels like an anachronism compared to the new 4Runner. We might be willing to overlook the two solid axles if the wind noise wasn\u2019t worse than in every other SUV, save for the Ford Bronco. Yes, the doors and roof still come off, and the windshield folds down, something you\u2019ll need to repeat to yourself mantra-style as you attempt to have a phone conversation at 75 mph. Even our own Jeep-loving technical writer Jared Korfhage agreed: \u201cThe 4Runner is the clear winner on the pavement,\u201d he succinctly stated.\n\nMost people, most of the time, will find the 4Runner to ride better, handle much better, be roomier, have a much larger screen, have more storage, return better fuel economy, and just be more carlike all around. We\u2019re not faulting the Jeep for being a Jeep, but just know how much better you\u2019d feel with the Toyota after taking each for a 30-minute drive. There is one on-road bright spot for this Wrangler 4xe (4xe is Jeep-ese for \u201cplug-in hybrid\u201d)\u2014its surprisingly strong acceleration. Korfhage again: \u201cThe Willys \u201941 has no business being this peppy. The hybrid system\u2019s boost almost makes up for the archaic on-road characteristics. You can actually swing the back end out with traction control turned off. It\u2019s legitimately fun.\u201d With a combined 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque, the Willys ought to be quick, and it is.\n\nThe new 4Runner is available with a hybrid powertrain that Toyota calls i-Force Max, which would have given us 326 hp and 465 lb-ft of twist to play with. Instead, Toyota delivered a TRD Off-Road Premium with the regular, nonhybridized 2.4-liter turbo I-4 (called just i-Force) that produces 278 hp and 317 lb-ft of torque. For the most part, the powertrain felt quick enough, partly because of the crisp-shifting eight-speed automatic, a massive improvement over the old five-speed slushbox used in the previous-gen model. That said, the Jeep is quicker, so speed brokers will obviously prefer the hybrid version of the 4Runner.\n\nAnd Here Are the Test Numbers\n\nAt the test track, The Wrangler achieved 60 mph in 5.4 seconds; this 4Runner needed 7.8 seconds. The story is about the same in the quarter mile, where the 4xe got it done in 13.9 seconds at 98.6 mph compared to 15.9 at 89.3. But don\u2019t go breaking the Jeep\u2019s roll cage patting it on the back just yet.\n\nThe Wrangler required an alarming 149 feet to stop from 60 mph, compared to a much tidier 127 feet for the Toyota\u2014more than a car length in difference. True, the Wrangler arrived on gnarly, off-road-focused BFGoodrich KO2 tires, but the 4Runner wasn\u2019t exactly on summer rubber, as it wore Falken Wildpeak A/Ts. The Wrangler is a heavier vehicle, but the difference is just a linebacker and a large suitcase: 5,251 pounds compared to the Toyota\u2019s 4,950. It\u2019s a fact of Jeep life that Wranglers just don\u2019t stop very well.\n\nNeither SUV performed well on our figure-eight test, which measures acceleration, braking, and handling in one exercise, with the 4Runner \u201cwinning\u201d with a time of 28.0 seconds compared to 28.1 for the Wrangler. Both vehicles achieved a maximum lateral acceleration of 0.72 g. Hope we don\u2019t break any hearts by saying limit track handling isn\u2019t a forte for these SUVs. Here again, while the Wrangler 4xe felt quicker, the 4Runner felt much better to drive (and was actually slightly quicker).\n\nOff-Road\n\nIt\u2019s never fair to perform a comparison test involving a Jeep Wrangler and not head for the rocks. After all, every single compromise, every archaic demerit, stems from the fact that it\u2019s built that way on purpose. A live front-axle is lousy for passenger comfort but allows for greater front-end articulation, critical when you\u2019re trying to climb over an obstacle. The recirculating ball steering, while slow and goofy on-road, comes into its own off the pavement. On the other hand, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the 4Runner to just rock up to Chocolate Thunder (a well-known King of the Hammers obstacle) and declare the Jeep to be the winner. What to do?\n\nWe took both SUVs to a nice muddy and rutted trail in the mountains near Wrightwood, California, to mimic what we think people will do most often with their off-roaders. Running at speeds higher than 20 mph (not recommended!), the 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium ate up the ruts, rocks, bumps, and lumps. The Toyota felt completely and totally at home. The Jeep, on the other hand, did not. It crashed and bashed its way over everything, beating up the occupants. Once we decided to calm things down, the Toyota still felt more confident and in control running along the trail.\n\nIn terms of more extreme obstacles, both SUVs come with a locking rear diff. Neither had a front locker, although if you were you to opt for a Wrangler Rubicon, you\u2019d get one. Neither had a disconnecting front anti-roll bar. Again, the Rubicon gets one, as do the more hardcore versions of the 4Runner, the TRD Pro, and the Trailhunter. The off-road tire war is easily won by the Willys \u201941, as is the approach angle battle. Unlike the TRD Pro and Trailhunter, the TRD Off-Road Premium has a massive chin spoiler. We happened to post a picture to Instagram during the comparison, and a Toyota designer commented on the post: \u201cI helped design the aero on this, including the grille and lower air dam. Seriously, take the thing off if you\u2019re going off-road (it\u2019s removable). It does add a fair amount in mpg on the highway, but it\u2019s just so big and cumbersome.\u201d\n\nThat said, while the spoiler looked like it would have slowed the 4Runner down, careful maneuvering (and some expert spotting) meant it never actually did. Plus, it\u2019s made from a very soft plastic, so if it does get caught on a rock or whatever, the spoiler just bends. Like all Toyota off-road machines, this 4Runner has Multi-Terrain Select, and it\u2019s programmed quite well. Korfhage said, \u201cThe modes are well sorted, and they\u2019ll pull the 4Runner through a hole with two opposite tires in the air.\u201d Over some pretty tricky obstacles, the 4Runner impressed us with capabilities we didn\u2019t think it had.\n\nAnd the Jeep did not. Hear us out: The Jeep Wrangler 4xe Willys \u201941 could do everything the 4Runner did. However, we tried to take it on two more difficult obstacles that a Wrangler Rubicon could have easily conquered and got hung up both times. On one, there was simply no forward progress. On the other, we wound up bashing the rock sliders to climb a rock in a needlessly ugly fashion.\n\nAnd So \u2026\n\nThis transitions us nicely to price. As tested, the 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium clocks in at $57,670. The Jeep Wrangler 4xe Willys \u201941 showed up with a $69,100 total price. To add some perspective, had we been able to test a hybrid version of the Toyota, you could add $2,100 to its price. That would put it closer to the $60K threshold and the $61,825 opening price of a 4xe Willys \u201941, but the Jeep we had on hand had nearly every option box checked.\n\nAnd yet if the prices had been closer, we\u2019d still choose the Toyota 4Runner as the winner of this comparison test. The 4Runner was better on-road and better to drive off-road on more run-of-the-mill terrain, and, when it came to extreme obstacles, the Willys presumed advantage couldn\u2019t come to fruition given its lack of a disconnecting front bar. We simply couldn\u2019t access the increased articulation its solid front axle is capable of.\n\nWould the results be different if we\u2019d pitted a full-fat Rubicon against a 4Runner TRD Pro or Trailhunter? Perhaps, and we\u2019re eager to throw those vehicles into the ring at a later date. But for now, we congratulate Toyota on this well-earned victory. It took a while for this sixth-generation model to show up, but it seems 40 years of making 4Runners (and even longer making Land Cruisers) has taught the Japanese giant a thing or two about off-road SUVs.\n\nSecond Place: Jeep Wrangler 4xe Willys \u201941\n\nPros Quick for a Wrangler\n\nDeep heritage\n\nMakes Jeep purists smile Cons Rides and handles like a Wrangler\n\nElectric range is puny\n\nNot as capable as we hoped\n\nVerdict\n\nA great-looking Wrangler that oddly disappointed us in the dirt.\n\nFirst Place: Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium\n\nPros Best driving non\u2013Land Cruiser SUV Toyota makes\n\nSurprising off-road capability\n\nHandsome Cons A bit slow for the money\n\nTrue off-road chops will cost you more\n\nThe interior isn\u2019t as exciting as the exterior\n\nVerdict\n\nToyota comes out swinging in the latest round of a long fight.",

            "content": "For the fifth consecutive year, Toyota is the biggest car maker in the world. As you can imagine, it takes more than selling Corollas and RAVs to grab and keep the sales crown for so long to the detriment of the VW Group. Toyota's massive product portfolio includes some dirt-cheap models, like the $10,000 Corolla Axio sedan and Corolla Fielder wagon. Those dirt-cheap JDMs are going away, but there's another car available for about the same money.\n\nWe're not cheating by talking about kei cars, which can be had in the Land of the Rising Sun for less than $7,000. The Probox is a regular car, measuring 167.1 inches long, 66.7 inches wide, and 60.2 inches tall. It fits into the compact segment and is manufactured by scandal-ridden Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu in Japan. A badge-engineered Mazda is also available as the Familia Van.\n\nThe Probox starts at 1,529,000 yen or $10,200 at current exchange rates. Regarding space and practicality, it's a lot of car for the money, although we'll admit the styling looks like it's stuck in the 1990s. The van/wagon mashup has been around since 2014 in its second generation, while the original model was launched in 2002. The Probox gets a naturally aspirated 1.3-liter gas engine with just 94 horsepower and 90 pound-feet of torque in its most basic form.\n\nBut you're not stuck with this spartan version riding on 14-inch steelies. Toyota Japan also sells the Probox with a slightly more potent 1.5-liter engine, and you can even opt for a thrifty hybrid setup and all-wheel drive. It's a no-nonsense practical car that gets the job done without pretending to be something more sophisticated. There will always be demand for basic transportation, and the Probox delivers it at minimal cost. Even the most expensive version starts at 2,057,500 yen or approximately $13,700.\n\nThe Probox doesn't necessarily skimp on features, especially if you step up to a higher trim level. While the base model is stuck with manual air conditioning, nicer ones get automatic AC and a heated driver's seat. Other goodies include power windows, radio, and remote locking. There's even Toyota Safety Sense with lane assistance, automatic high beams, and other driver assistance systems to keep you out of trouble.\n\nToyota Probox 10\n\nThe interior's modularity is also a strong point. The Probox quickly transforms from a wagon into a van by folding the rear bench. The flat cargo floor can store items as long as 71.2 inches behind the front seats. Toyota engineered the workhorse with a boxy tailgate for a wide access area, making it easy to load and unload voluminous items.\n\nOf course, that shockingly low asking price wouldn't be possible without a favorable JPY/USD conversion rate. As we mentioned in the article about the old Corolla going away, the yen lost about a quarter of its value compared to the dollar in the last five years. However, there are still other regions of the world where $10,000 buys you a new car. China would be the most obvious example, but we recently talked about a four-figure Skoda crossover in India where Honda and Suzuki are selling sub-$10,000 sedans.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nSource: Toyota\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Although Toyota seems to be opting for a heavy revamp rather than a new model, the Hilux is still expected to get significant upgrades\n\nThe next-gen Toyota Hilux is expected to make its global debut in the second half of 2025.\n\nThe midsize pickup has been accurately rendered based on recent spy shots from Thailand.\n\nThe new generation looks more like an extensive facelift rather than a clean sheet design.\n\nUpdate 2/24: We\u2019ve added new illustrations based on the most recent spy shots of the refreshed Toyota Hilux, along with all the latest intel gathered over the past few weeks on the next generation of the popular midsize pickup truck, which is expected to debut later this year.\n\nThe upcoming launch of the 2026 Toyota RAV4 might be grabbing most of the headlines these days, but another customer-favorite from the Japanese automaker is also set for a major update later this year. Spy shots of the next-generation Toyota Hilux testing in Thailand have given digital artists the inspiration to create realistic renderings of the midsize pickup, one that\u2019s clearly aiming to challenge the Ford Ranger.\n\nMore: 2026 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ Small Off-Roader Expected To Debut This Fall\n\nIn many markets outside North America, the Toyota Hilux has cemented itself as one of the most popular choices in the pickup segment. Over decades, it has earned a reputation for rugged reliability and versatility. However, even icons need a refresh, and the current generation is long due for an overhaul.\n\nSharpened Up Looks\n\nWhile Toyota is keeping tight-lipped about specifics, all signs point to the new Hilux arriving in the second half of 2025. Digital rendering specialists Theophilus Chin and Nikita Chuicko have combined their expertise with some educated guesses to give us an early look at the redesigned truck, drawing inspiration from camouflaged prototypes spotted during testing.\n\nThe front end looks set for a complete overhaul, with a much sharper, more aggressive stance. Expect slimmer headlights paired with a boxier grille, while the front bumper will likely feature sculpted side sections and a prominent skid plate for that rugged, off-road vibe.\n\nRenderings: Theottle, Kelsonik\n\nThe fenders will also be updated, incorporating plastic cladding for a rugged aesthetic. At the rear, the truck will likely sport a redesigned bed with fresh taillights and integrated steps on the bumper, adding both style and functionality.\n\nA Sneak Peek Under Wraps\n\nSpy photos, shared by Thai automotive site Headlighmag last month, gave us our first real-life look of the next-gen Hilux in prototype form.\n\nThe truck showed off an updated front and rear design, while leaving the middle portion largely unchanged, signaling that Toyota has kept the existing cab structure, roof, doors, and greenhouse design intact. The spotted dual-cab model will almost certainly be joined by single-cab and chassis-cab variants when the truck launches.\n\nWhile interior details are scarce, we can anticipate a revamped cabin with higher-quality materials, updated technology, and overall improvements in fit and finish.\n\nSpy Shots: Headlightmag\n\nA Familiar Platform with Key Upgrades\n\nToyota has been tight lipped about the debut of the next generation Hilux, but all signs point to a heavily updated model rather than a clean-sheet design. This aligns with the brand\u2019s approach for the Camry sedan and the upcoming RAV4 SUV.\n\nIn the same context, the new Hilux is expected to ride on an upgraded version of its predecessor\u2019s tried-and-true IMV ladder-frame platform rather than using the more modern TNGA-F architecture found in the Tacoma and the Land Cruiser.\n\nMore: Toyota Tests Hydrogen Hilux With Mirai Tech And 373-Mile Range\n\nDespite the carry-over chassis, Toyota engineers will likely work on the suspension and steering setup, resulting in a more refined ride and better handling. The potential introduction of electric power steering could pave the way for a more sophisticated ADAS suite. Additionally, the Hilux may benefit from the inclusion of disc brakes on both axles across the lineup, further modernizing the truck\u2019s capabilities.\n\nAs for powertrains, it\u2019s likely the new Hilux will stick with the mild-hybrid 2.8-liter four-cylinder diesel already available in the outgoing model, alongside non-electrified gasoline and diesel options depending on the market.\n\nAdditionally, Toyota has showcased prototypes with fully electric and hydrogen fuel-cell powertrains and has officially confirmed that a Hilux EV will go into production in Thailand by the end of 2025, most likely based on the next-generation model.\n\nThe Toyota Hilux BEV prototype based on the current generation.\n\nA Name to Watch\n\nAnother sign of things to come is the Hilux Travo trademark, which was filed on December 23, 2024, with Thailand\u2019s Department of Intellectual Property (DIP). Naturally, this has stirred speculation among local media that the \u201cTravo\u201d name will serve as a suffix for the ninth-generation model in the region, following the example set by the eighth-gen Hilux Revo and the seventh-gen Hilux Vigo.\n\nHowever, in most other markets, the truck is simply known simply as the Hilux. No extra frills, just the truck people know and trust.\n\nMore: 2027 Toyota Corolla Could Launch Next Year With A Plug-In Hybrid Option\n\nThe current Hilux generation has been with us since 2015, staying relevant through a series of updates in 2017, 2020, and as recently as 2024. The latest revamp added a redesigned nose with a sculpted bumper and a modern grille, along with a mild-hybrid diesel, but the rest of the bodywork and the interior can\u2019t hide the truck\u2019s age, especially when compared to newer rivals.\n\nRivals to Beat\n\nSpeaking of competitors, the Hilux is up against some serious heavyweights. The Ford Ranger, which debuted in 2021, is set to receive a mid-cycle update in 2025, keeping it fresh and highly competitive.\n\nOther regional rivals include the Mitsubishi L200/Triton, Isuzu D-Max, Mazda BT-50, VW Amarok, the newly introduced Kia Tasman, and an ever-growing army of Chinese contenders like the GWM Cannon Ute and the BYD Shark. It\u2019s clear that Toyota needs to bring its A-game with the next Hilux if it wants to maintain its spot at the top.",

The bolts holding the seat backs to these plates may not have been torqued to specification at a separate facility, according to the NHTSA documents.\n\n2025 Toyota Sienna\n\nIf the seat bolts aren't sufficiently tightened, the seats may not perform as designed in a crash, the NHTSA said, providing less occupant protection. Toyota estimates that less than 1% of the recalled vehicles actually have this issue, which the automaker said was discovered during an inspection at a production facility.\n\nToyota plans to notify owners of the recall by mail starting Mar. 31, instructing them to take their vehicles to dealerships, where the seat-back bolts will be tightened to the proper spec free of charge. In the meantime, owners can call Toyota's customer service department at 800-331-4331 for more information. Toyota's reference number for this recall is 25TA05.\n\n2025 Toyota Sienna\n\nThe Sienna is EPA rated at 36 mpg combined in its standard front-wheel drive configuration, and 35 mpg combined with optional all-wheel drive. In a first drive, we found that this efficiency plus the Sienna's newfound design flair helped make the minivan relevant again.\n\nNearly all of the few minivans still available in the U.S. offer hybrid powertrains. The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid is a plug-in hybrid with 32 miles of EPA electric range. The Kia Carnival added a hybrid powertrain option for 2025, rated at 33 mpg combined, leaving the Honda Odyssey as the only non-hybrid minivan.",

Just heard about the Toyota Land Cruiser 250 and I think it\u2019s even cheaper than the 1958 ($57,000). It\u2019s not a hybrid. Do you think it will sell here?\n\n\u2014 WikFlash778\n\nA: That\u2019s a big \u201cno\u201d from me, but I\u2019ve been wrong before.\n\nI have a few reasons for my answer, mainly \u2013 the powertrains. You are correct: it will be less expensive as it is not a hybrid; however, there are many reasons why Toyota simply cannot sell it here. I\u2019ll show you a quote below\u2026\n\n\u201cThe \u201c250\u201d series is available with two types of powertrains: a 2.8-liter direct injection turbo diesel engine with Direct Shift-8AT and a 2.7-liter gasoline engine with 6 Super ECT, both delivering powerful driving and environmental performance.\u201d Toyota\n\nA Toyota turbo diesel will not sell here, period. The company has remained firm about not attempting to enter our market with their diesels. Believe me, I\u2019m not against a diesel off-roader. In fact: I think they are the best way to overland and whatnot, but modern ones only seem to work out in domestic market, heavy-duty pickup trucks.\n\nWith all that being said, there is that 2.7-liter gas engine. I believe this is a non-turbo, entry-level gas engine and it\u2019s paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. This is similar to the old-school inline-four Toyota used in its previous version of the (base model) Tacoma. Less than 160 horsepower, and around 180 lb-ft of torque. Not a ton of power, to be sure, but it\u2019s known as a reliable and fairly efficient powertrain.\n\nIf you do the basic math, this combination should be much less expensive than the current 1958 model. It would probably be cheaper than the new 4Runner \u2013 which is one of the reasons it makes little sense hitting our market. Additionally, there\u2019s something to be said about current emissions requirements.\n\nMaybe, one day we\u2019ll see slightly less Land Cruisers in our country, but I doubt it.\n\n\u2014 N\n\nThe last question comes from a Nissan fan who is worried about the recent news regarding Honda. I think..\n\nQ: (Via: Facebook \u2013 NathanAdlenJournalist) RE: Is it okay to tow with a Maverick hybrid?\n\nQuick question for you Nathan. I was thinking about buying a new or used Ford Maverick hybrid and I wanted to know if it\u2019s safe to tow a 1,800 boat?\n\n\u2014 Wilson FKP\n\nA: Yep \u2013 you truly can tow with the Maverick Hybrid. However\u2026\n\nIf you opt for the older Maverick hybrid, it is rated at 2,000-lbs, meaning that you\u2019re approaching its maximum with 1,800-lbs. Remember: the load in your truck will affect the overall weight as well. As such, I would recommend the current Ford Maverick hybrid as it has different cooling, and an updated powertrain. It has a maximum tow rating of 4,000-lbs IF you get the correct tow package.\n\nIt\u2019s better to have a higher capacity as it puts less stress on your vehicle \u2013 and you.\n\n\u2013 N",

Some older Tundra owners, like Damien, who has a 2022 Tundra, are experiencing rapid depreciation, leaving them with a useless vehicle. Check out my report here.\n\nAnd he's not alone\n\nTake Kirk Cashen, for instance, who purchased a new 2025 Tundra only to have the engine fail on him only 1,528 miles in. I found his post on the 2023-2025 Toyota Tundra Owners Facebook page.\n\nKirk says, \"So, I just bought this beast in December. I headed out on a trip to Maryland, and we made it about 400 miles. It broke down with only 1528 miles on the truck. I'm sitting at the Toyota dealership with a locked motor waiting on it. They said I needed a new motor swap. I have a 2025 TRD PRO Hybrid.\"\n\nIf you've read my report on the Toyota Tundra engine issue, you're aware of the magnitude of the problem. The Japanese automaker must replace over 100,000 - 2022 and 2023 Tundra pickup and Lexus LX SUV engines with the V35A twin-turbo 3.4-liter V-6 power plant. This recall is a minor inconvenience and a significant disruption for Tundra owners.\n\nNow 2025 Tundra Engines are Failing\n\nImagine buying a new 2025 Tundra truck and can't wait to take it on a road trip. However, 400 miles into the trip, your vehicle begins to make a terrible sound and smoke, and you have to pull off the highway.\n\nYou have the new truck towed to the Toyota dealer, and they tell you it needs a new engine. It's covered under warranty, but they will have to keep it for weeks before you get your truck back because of the backlog of other Tundra trucks that also need new engines.\n\nIn my previous report on the Toyota Tundra recall, I detailed the lengthy process customers must endure to fix their trucks. Toyota has to replace the defective engines with new ones, which will take 13 to 21 hours for each engine.\n\nWith 100,000 engines being replaced, customers are waiting to finish the work.\n\nToyota's Reputation for Reliability is Tanking\n\nToyota's excellent reputation for building reliable vehicles is in severe decline. The recent Tundra recall to replace its 3.4-liter V-6 is the latest problem the automaker is facing.\n\nKirk Is Not the Only 2025 Tundra Owner With Engine Problems\n\nReddit user Zachy2227 says, \"I purchased the new 2025 Tundra SR5 (non-hybrid) with the TRD Off-Road package, and 4 days into me owning it, the engine started ticking with a sort of metal on metal rubbing noise that is rhythmic with the ticking. There are only 522 miles on this truck.\"\n\n\"Two weeks later, Toyota still doesn't know what's wrong with it, and they said that it could take around 2 to 3 additional weeks for them to figure out the problem and fix it. I paid around $64,000 for them to have it longer than I have. Does anyone else have the same problem? What should I do?\"\n\nUpdate: He says, \"I got word from the dealer today that it was a bearing in the engine's bottom end.\"\n\nEastern_Natural9051 says, \"Yes, I bought a 2025 SRr5 and had mine for 20 days and only 1,000 miles, and the check engine light went on. It took them three days to tell me what was wrong with my truck. They called me today and told me that it apparently indicates that extra debris is accumulating in the engine. This is a three-week-old truck we are talking about.\"\n\ndeadsetweir-do - \"My new 2025 Tundra has 248 miles on it, on the 24th it will be 30 days in the shop with literally no ETA on when it will be fixed, because they don't know what's wrong with it. They will throw a new rear diff on and see if that helps.\"\n\n\"The problem is that the diff is on backorder for an unspecified period. I'm 100% pursuing the lemon law. So pissed. Toyota brand engagement told me they would respond to my request for a replacement within 60 days and not expect interaction in the meantime. It only has 248 miles and $60,000 in the shop since I bought it almost a month ago.\"\n\nFinal Thoughts and Questions for 2025 Toyota Tundra Owners\n\nWith these new reports, Toyota has not fixed the engine issues and reliability problems with the new 2025 Tundra trucks. However, not all trucks are affected, as many owners report no problems with them.\n\nI've seen many posts like this from another Reddit user.\n\nSnippiestOrb73 says, \"I have a '25 Platinum. There is nothing wrong, and I have about 2,000 miles. Edit: up to 4500 miles, still no issues. I now have 5,800 miles, and still no issues.\" This shows that not all 2025 Tundra owners are experiencing these issues.\n\nAre You a Toyota Tundra Owner?\n\nWe value your experience and insights.

            "content": "Toyota is working on a new smaller Land Cruiser model, expected to debut later this year.\n\nAn earlier teaser revealed a compact off-roader with rugged styling and a boxy shape.\n\nThe Land Cruiser FJ may share its ladder-frame underpinnings with the Hilux Champ.\n\nUpdate 2/22: We\u2019ve received new information about Toyota\u2019s highly anticipated Land Cruiser FJ\u2014or FJ Cruiser, as some rumors suggest it might be called\u2014including reports that its introduction date has been pushed to the end of the year. We\u2019ve updated this story to reflect the latest details.\n\nThe Land Cruiser nameplate has long been synonymous with exceptional off-road capability, so it\u2019s no surprise that Toyota intends to carry on this tradition with upcoming models. Among them is the eagerly awaited compact SUV rumored to be built on ladder-frame underpinnings. This \u201cbaby\u201d Land Cruiser is now expected to debut later this year, possibly carrying the FJ moniker in some form in its name.\n\nThe new model made its first appearance in an official teaser in 2023, as the smallest member of the Land Cruiser family next to the classic 70 Series, the modern 250 Series (the one we get in North America), and the 300 Series (unavailable in the States). This was followed by a trademark filing, sparking rumors about the possible use of the Land Cruiser FJ nameplate for the compact off-roader.\n\nCompact Footprint, Rugged Styling\n\nThe single teaser image, which inspired our speculative rendering, hints at a boxy SUV drawing design cues from the 2021 Toyota Compact Cruiser EV concept. While it keeps the upright stance and modern LED accents, the production model appears slightly larger, featuring ample ground clearance, robust tires, and a flat tailgate with a mounted spare wheel.\n\nMore: Everything We Know About The 2026 Toyota RAV4\n\nThe Land Cruiser FJ is expected to have a footprint slightly larger than the Corolla Cross but possibly smaller than the RAV4. Initial estimates indicate dimensions of around 4,500 mm (177.2 inches) in length, 1,830 mm (72 inches) in width, and 1,850 mm (72.8 inches) in height, with a wheelbase of 2,750 mm (108.3 inches).\n\nIf these numbers are correct, the Land Cruiser FJ will be notably smaller than North America\u2019s Land Cruiser that measures 4,925 mm (193.9 inches) long, but larger than the 4,387 mm (172.7 inches) long Ford Bronco Sport.\n\nThe official teaser from August 2023\n\nLadder-Frame Underpinnings\n\nBesides the notable exception of the Suzuki Jimny, the majority of small and compact SUVs have transitioned to unibody architectures. Luckily for adventure-seekers, this doesn\u2019t appear to be the case with the Land Cruiser FJ, which is believed to ride on a ladder frame chassis.\n\nRather than using the TNGA-F platform found in the larger and more expensive Land Cruiser 250 and 300 Series, the compact off-roader is expected to ride on the IMV 0 architecture shared with the Toyota Hilux Champ / Ranga pickup.\n\nMore: 2026 Toyota Hilux Spied Looking Like An Extensive Facelift\n\nThis choice preserves the rugged Land Cruiser heritage while allowing Toyota to offer the model at a more accessible price point. Naturally, the SUV will feature improved noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) characteristics and more refined driving dynamics compared to the Hilux Champ, which prioritizes affordability in emerging markets.\n\nFurthermore, a 4WD system with a Torsen limited-slip differential will most likely be included as standard, allowing it to tackle harsh terrains in combination with the generous ground clearance and the grippy tires.\n\nPowertrain Options\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of speculation surrounding the powertrain options for the upcoming Land Cruiser FJ (or whatever Toyota ends up calling it). Early reports suggested it could come with both internal combustion and hybrid powertrains, with the possibility of a fully electric version to be added to the range later on.\n\nHowever, more recent reports claim that Toyota has scrapped plans for hybrid powertrains in favor of a traditional gasoline engine. Still, this information should be taken with a grain of salt, as powertrain options may vary by region. Given market trends, Toyota will likely offer a hybrid version outside of Japan, especially in North America and Europe where demand for fuel efficiency and lower emissions remains strong.\n\nThe Toyota Hilux Rangga SUV is a special version of the budget-friendly pickup for Indonesia.\n\nOne of the most likely options to power the Land Cruiser FJ is the naturally aspirated 2.7-liter four-cylinder 2TR-FE gasoline engine. This engine is already used in the mechanically related Thai-spec Hilux Champ, as well as in the EU-spec and JDM-spec versions of the Land Cruiser Prado (250 Series). However, it may only be available in markets like Japan and other Asian regions where the Hilux Champ is sold.\n\nIn these regions, the engine produces 161 hp (120 kW / 163 PS) and 246 Nm (181 lb-ft) of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission and a capable 4WD system. While this power output should be sufficient for a compact off-roader in many markets, it may not satisfy the more power-hungry demands of North American buyers. For comparison, the Ford Bronco Sport offers a base 181-hp 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder and an optional 245-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder.\n\nMore: Toyota Hilux Champ Turns Into A Seven-Seater SUV\n\nThat said, Toyota has a variety of engines at its disposal, including options found in the Corolla Cross, RAV4, and even the Prius for enhanced hybrid power, if it opts to go that route. For example, in North America, the Corolla Cross offers a 169 hp 2.0-liter inline four, the RAV4 can be had with a 203 hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder, and the new Prius is equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder hybrid gasoline engine producing 194 hp, along with a plug-in hybrid variant with 220 hp.\n\nWhen Will It Arrive?\n\nIt was initially expected that the Toyota Land Cruiser FJ would debut in late 2024, but that obviously didn\u2019t happen. Over the past year, the automotive landscape has shifted dramatically, with manufacturers delaying projects and refocusing on gasoline and hybrid powertrains. This change in strategy is largely a response to evolving market demands and growing uncertainty due to potential trade conflicts and regulatory changes.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no official confirmation about the Land Cruiser FJ\u2019s debut, the latest reports from Japan\u2019s Best Car now suggest that it could make its local debut in fall 2025, followed by a global rollout.\n\nAs for pricing, the latest reports suggest that the Land Cruiser FJ could be priced between \u00a54-4.5 million in its home market, which translates to approximately $26,600-$30,000 at current exchange rates. For comparison, the Land Cruiser 70 Series starts at \u00a54.8 million ($32,000), the 250 Series at \u00a55.2 million ($34,700), and the 300 Series at \u00a55.1 million ($34,000) in Japan.\n\nPrices will naturally vary by market, but depending on where it\u2019s manufactured, the North American model is expected to start at around $35,000 and could go over the $45,000 mark for the top-end versions. This would position it well below the $56,450 starting price of the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser in the United States.\n\nIllustrations John Halas / Carscoops",

            "content": "Toyota has gone through dozens of pairs of shoes dragging its feet on battery-electric vehicles. There may be no more notable laggard on electric vehicles (though, neighboring Honda gives it a run for its money). I pointed out yesterday that despite all of its hype for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the past couple of decades, Toyota has sold barely more than 27,000 Mirai in 10 years, while it has sold almost 10 times as many battery-electric vehicles. The company may not be blasting this from the rooftops, but its most recent financials report for investors makes it clear in various places that the future is indeed electric vehicles using batteries.\n\nHere are some of the battery or EV highlights from the report:\n\n\u201cAt the briefing, Toyota also outlined the establishment of a new company that will develop and produce Lexus battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and automotive batteries in China.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, Toyota announced that its American battery manufacturing company (Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina (TBMNC)) is ready to begin production and plans to begin shipping batteries in April.\u201d\n\nSo, like others that are finally taking BEVs seriously, Toyota is getting more and more involved in producing its own batteries, including in the US.\n\nToyota in China\n\nActually, Toyota then had a full section of its report focused on this matter, titled \u201cAccelerating BEV/battery development and production in the U.S. and China.\u201d Here\u2019s a brief infographic from that section on the China news:\n\nDoes Toyota deserve some praise for this newfound interest in batteries and BEVs? Maybe, but given how late it is, it\u2019s hard to feel too much excitement for Toyota\u2019s arrival. Also, we\u2019re talking 100,000 units, not 1 million or 2 million.\n\n\u201cFirst was the launch of a new company in Shanghai, China, tasked with the development and local production of Lexus BEVs and batteries,\u201d Toyota added. \u201cEstablishing a company that handles everything from development to production will enable Toyota to offer vehicles tailored to local needs swiftly.\u201d Frankly, with China passing 50% plugin vehicle sales, Toyota has no choice \u2014 it either starts doing something more seriously on BEVs in the Chinese market or it leaves. Hard leadership decision there, eh?\n\nToyota in USA\n\nThis may have been more stimulated by Biden and the Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act, which may well be canceled or gutted soon, or maybe it\u2019s because the US is such a big market for Toyota, is obviously electrifying as well even if more slowly, and is becoming more protectionist (under both Trump and Biden). In any case, here\u2019s a short infographic on Toyota\u2019s US EV plans:\n\nThis is Toyota\u2019s first overseas in-house battery manufacturing facility. Of course, as the infographic notes, the facility will be producing batteries for conventional hybrids, plugin hybrids, and full battery electric vehicles. At $14 billion of investment and creating 5,000 jobs, though, it\u2019s no small move.\n\nHere\u2019s some soft, generic language on what these projects mean to the company: \u201cThe development and production of electrified vehicles and batteries will further strengthen a multi-pathway strategy tailored to local needs. Toyota strives to be a \u2018best-in-town\u2019 company that is loved and trusted in every country and region where it operates.\u201d The good news is simply that EV matters are finally dominating Toyota\u2019s agenda and financials report. Will we be seeing much more of this in coming quarters and years?",

            "content": "Toyota\n\nThe all-new, sixth-generation Toyota 4Runner is finally here, ending a 15-year reign in showrooms for the previous version of Toyota's rock-crawling mid-sized SUV. Toyota's new interpretation of the 4Runner is decidedly more modern than the truck it replaces, but the two share some key similarities and design elements.\n\nTo see how the changes stack up, Road & Track was able to get a 2025 4Runner Trailhunter and a customer-owned last-generation 4Runner TRD Off Road together at the launch of the former. We weren't able to drive them back to back, but we were able to scope them out next to each other to get a sense of how Toyota has modernized its U.S.-focused off-roader's looks and features.\n\nToyota\n\nAlthough the more extreme Trailhunter trim exaggerates the effect, side-by-side photos illustrate just how much taller, wider, and larger the new 4Runner is than the SUV that came before it. A new 4Runner TRD Pro weighs 5455 pounds, over 600 lbs heavier than its direct predecessor. It's also 3.8 inches longer, 4.1 inches wider, and 2.5 inches taller than the previous 4Runner TRD Pro.\n\nToyota\n\nThe new 4Runner is bulkier and beefier-looking than its predecessor, but the two share a similar design language and a few key visual cues. The biggest is the final window, which is divided by a diagonal pillar facing toward the roof. Both also have boxy flared fenders, small spoilers over the rear window, and metal-colored front bumper cover components meant to take a beating on the trails.\n\nToyota\n\nBoth trucks feature a roll-down rear window, something that Toyota initially considered dropping for the newest generation of the SUV. As chief 4Runner engineer Keita Moritsu told Road & Track, the brand had initially planned to cut the feature as a way to save weight and boost efficiency. After speaking with customers, however, the R&D team would come to realize the celebrated retractable glass was a key part of the truck's appeal among American buyers. It was thus retained, and a system was designed to ensure that the truck could detect where the roll-down window was placed and apply force correctly to the massive hydraulic struts that power the 4Runner's automated rear liftgate.\n\nToyota\n\nThe biggest difference between the two 4Runners is under the hood. Most copies of Toyota's last-gen model were sold with a naturally-aspirated V-6 engine, while the newer truck is only available with a turbocharged four-cylinder. Many variants come with Toyota's i-Max hybrid system, which brings the SUV's output up to 326 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque. That makes the turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid variants notably more powerful than the six-cylinder model it replaces, but the change in how that power is made and delivered may ruffle some loyal buyers.\n\nThe newest Toyota 4Runner starts at $40,770 and goes all the way up to $66,900 before destination charges for the overlanding-focused Trailhunter model. Toyota and Lexus also offer six other trucks and SUVs on the same TNGA-F platform, so returning 4Runner buyers put off by the four-cylinder have a few other options within the modern Toyota family.\n\nYou Might Also Like",

I\u2019m not a whole lot involved, but definitely like helping our guys out. The 54 is a very special number to me, of course. It is just fun to be around them and help Taylor (Gray) out and the guys out. It is really fun, but also to get a feel of looking at it from a different perspective is helpful to me and just hanging out and watching some racing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve seen you do the same with the ARCA team. What is different from that team to Xfinity?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a level above, but I think they all equally work as hard. Our ARCA guys are a very special group of guys and they\u2019ve been working together for a long time. I loved racing with them and miss that. I think Xfinity is a level up, but I think \u2013 racing is racing, and trying to make the best of it.\u201d\n\nHow did that conversation start about being the listed owner of the 54 Xfinity team?\n\n\u201cI would love for the 54 legacy, the number, go on and not stop. In 2024 it wasn\u2019t there, and 2023, but Taylor (Gray) came to me and asked me if he can run the number, and I was like yes, for sure. I grew up around the Gray family too. It would definitely be really special if Taylor could do it. Of course, that was going to happen, and of course, I was like the 54 is really special to me \u2013 I would love to be a part of that and see what I can do to help and give back to my family that has been given so much to me. I think it all just worked out, but it has been very special. I really appreciate being just a little part of it.\u201d\n\nHow important is it for your team to bring new partners?\n\n\u201cFor sure. It is really special to have SAIA come on board. This is basically their home track \u2013 they are based out of Georgia, up the street. This is super special to me. I\u2019m really appreciate of the opportunity to run these colors and be a part of it, and to be able to get to know those guys. Ray (Raymond Ramu, executive vice president and chief customer officer, SAIA) and the guys are just awesome, Mona (Gore, senior director of corporate communications, SAIA), they are just great \u2013 to be able to run these colors is super special. I feel like I see the SAIA trucks on the road like everywhere \u2013 I think we all do \u2013 it is really cool to run it, and hopefully this turns a long relationship, and I think it will. I\u2019m excited to run it. It\u2019s really special.\u201d\n\nWhat has surprised you about what it takes to race here at Atlanta?\n\n\u201cWell, the surface is wearing out, which I think is good. Hopefully, they will let us go back to full power eventually, one day. It\u2019s been cool. It has been a lot different. Of course, I didn\u2019t get to race at the previous Atlanta. I really wish I did, because the place seemed fun, but it has definitely surprised me how much it has worn out, which might play in our favor. I don\u2019t know how much longer we will be packed up together close because the surface is so worn out. I think in the spring race, it is really cold out, so that tends to be higher speeds and lower grip, but in the summer in a couple years, I don\u2019t know, maybe it is going to be so worn out and we can\u2019t really run close together. What surprises me is I think I wreck six, seven times every time I come here, and I finish ninth? (laughter). That\u2019s what surprises me. That\u2019s my answer.\u201d\n\nToyota Racing PR",

            "content": "Test 3: Rock crawl\n\nIn the 4Runner, with its worse approach and departure angles, we had to be a lot more careful with how we tackled this obstacle. Thankfully, while in low-range four-wheel drive, the hybrid powertrain's output was incredibly smooth and it was easy to dial in the exact amount of oomph needed to get up on the next rock. And the Toyota's various camera views prominently displayed on its 14-inch screen also made life a little easier, as we could also see our spotter when pitched up. We had to take a different route to get on the rocks than in the other two vehicles, which simply climbed straight onto the course. But the 4Runner made it through with minimal scraping.\n\nThe Wrangler's forward visibility was superior to that of the other two vehicles, but its camera system was not in the same league. You get a forward-facing camera but it's lower-resolution and doesn't have guidelines to see where the front tires are. We were surprised at the jumpiness of the powertrain, even in low-range four-wheel drive. Other versions of the Wrangler don't feel this way; we chalked it up to a poor power blend between the electric motor and the gas engine. Still, the Jeep's superior clearances and flexibility made this obstacle a breeze.\n\nSimilarly, the Ford's ground clearance and approach angle made easy work of the rock crawl and it kept its skid plates off the rocks even more than the Wrangler. Having the biggest tires also helped the Ford here. Its cameras were fantastic, and that's great because seeing over that big hood proved to be a challenge.\n\nTest 4: Trail ride\n\nThe 4Runner's powertrain was great at lower speeds, but it did run out of breath when we really wanted to get going. It was much harder to hang the 4Runner's tail out with the throttle and there was a touch of lagginess when we wanted max power all at once. The Trailhunter also comes with a snorkel to move its intake out of the dust, but it causes lots of wastegate and turbo noises right where the passenger sits, which got annoying after a while. It also made the cabin incredibly loud.\n\nAs much as we didn't particularly like the 4xe's performance at lower speeds, while running at higher speed on a trail, it was fantastic. The Wrangler had easy power at all times and the engine revved up quickly to meet the demand when greater throttle application was applied. The Wrangler was the worst of these three to drive on the street, but there's no surprises there. You're trading on-road comfort for maximum off-road capability.\n\nFord's Trail Turn Assist was a great feature here, dragging the inside rear wheel through turns, so it felt like the SUV cornered on a dime. It also had the best-sounding engine here by far and was the most fun to drive at higher speeds. We'd still give this one the edge on looks too.",

His post resonates with many Tacoma owners who share his frustration and ask, \"Can we turn it off?\"\n\nSurprisingly, Toyota is quiet about the Tacoma feature. I've found that the fake engine noise is only used on some trim levels.\n\nHere is what Daniel says,\n\n\"Did I read somewhere that the Tacoma (with the JBL sound system) pipes the engine noise into the cab? Please, No!\" \"I asked the AI gods - and they said yes, and the fix is to use a Carista OBD2 Scanner to turn that noise off. What? If this is true, it's disappointing that Toyota did this and I want to turn it off.\"\n\nHow Did Daniel Turn It Off?\n\n\"I bought Cartista to change settings that are not in the settings menu. Artificial engine sound is one setting I turned off.\" However, the current bundled discounts put the device and annual subscription at $89.\"\n\nWhat is the Toyota Engine Sound Enhancement?\n\nSome Toyota models have a system that plays engine sounds into the cabin. This system, called Active Noise Control (ANC), is designed to reduce unwanted cabin noise while enhancing the exhaust note.\n\nANC uses an Intake Sound Generator (ISG) and sport-tuned exhaust to create a deeper, sportier exhaust note. It also cancels out unwanted noise in the cabin.\n\nAccording to available information, the Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro is the trim level most likely to feature Engine Sound Enhancement (ESE), as it is typically included on higher trim levels that prioritize an enhanced driving experience, including a more robust engine sound.\n\nWhat is ESE?\n\nEngine Sound Enhancement is a technology that uses synthetic noise to amplify or modify the sound of an engine, often creating a more sporty or powerful audio experience.\n\nHow Does the Technology Work?\n\nSensors monitor engine data such as RPM and torque. The system then generates a synthetic sound that is played through the car's speakers.\n\nWhich Tacoma Trims Have It?\n\nToyota does not explicitly state which Tacoma trims and model years come with ESE; however, the Tacoma TRD Pro trim level is usually the one equipped with the piped-in sound technology.\n\nWhat Are Other Tacoma Owners Saying?\n\nHere are a few of the most relevant comments from other Tacoma owners.\n\nCurt Osborne - \"Yes. I had to access ECM to turn it off. Otherwise, if you add a sub, it will always sound like a chopper is flying above you.\"\n\nTony Latham - \"It's true, but I don't know if it's just those with the JBL system. You only hear it when getting into the throttle. I turned mine off, turned it back on, and decided I didn't like it. Turned it off.\"\n\nMarc Reish - \"Ask the dealer to turn it off during service. It should be free. It's called \"engine sound enhancement,\" just FYI. And yes, I turned mine off.\"\n\nLuis A. Perez Morales - \"Great call out, I hate that sound.\"\n\nDanny Guebara - \"It's true. I turned mine off. I think the new Tundra does as well.\"\n\nIn the Tacoma 4G Forum, Ridetime said,\n\n\u201cSo I just connected Carista and \"disabled\" the \"fake\" engine noise. After that, I drove a few miles to see if I could tell the difference, and I couldn't. It sounds the same to me. Others may be hearing or not hearing something I'm missing. The option is there to disable engine sound enhancement and separately ANC. I only turned off the engine sound enhancement.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife has a BMW, and I have used Bimmercode to change numerous settings in her car, but I have found a few that, even though I changed them in the app, did not change in her car. The 4th gen Tacoma may be the same way in that regard.\u201d\n\nTacoFreak said: Thanks - that is good to know. Some things no doubt changed for the 4th gen, but many things will stay the same.\n\nI can't get consistent info on fake engine noise in the 4th generation. The best source is hearing from people like you who own them. Just because it was used in the Tundra doesn't mean it is also in the new Tacoma, and I have seen nothing from Toyota.\n\nFinal Thoughts and Questions for Tacoma Owners\n\nIt's not just Toyota that is using this technology. Many car brands use the technology, sometimes referring to it as a \"sound symposer\" or \"active sound design.\"\n\nA report from Kelley Blue Book says, \"While some car purists may be against fake engine noise, it's the direction some of the biggest automakers are taking for their upcoming models.\"\n\nToyota and other car manufacturers pump the fake engine noise into the vehicle using the vehicle's speakers to amplify or modify the actual engine sound artificially. It's used to create a more sporty or powerful audio experience, particularly in certain driving modes or when accelerating.\n\nEssentially, it's a synthetic engine sound played through the car's speakers to enhance the driving experience by making the engine sound more appealing, particularly for drivers who desire a more aggressive or sporty sound.\n\nHowever, my question is, why doesn\u2019t Toyota tell Tacoma owners about the technology when they buy the vehicle?\n\nIt's Your Turn to \"Sound Off\"\n\nDo you own a Toyota Tacoma with the \"fake engine noise\" pumped into the cabin?

Some users suggest restarting the truck or phone, updating software, and even visiting the dealership to check for potential system glitches to resolve these issues.\n\nKey points from Reddit threads about 2024 Tundra Bluetooth issues:\n\n1. Frequent disconnects: Several users report their phone frequently disconnecting from Bluetooth while driving, even with seemingly good signal strength.\n\n2. Pairing problems: Some users struggle to initially pair their phone with the Tundra system, encountering issues with the pairing process not recognizing their device.\n\n3. CarPlay instability: Some users mention issues with Apple CarPlay dropping connection or intermittently freezing.\n\n4. Software updates: Many recommend checking for available software updates on both the phone and the Tundra's infotainment system as a first troubleshooting step.\n\n5. Dealer visit: If basic troubleshooting fails, some users suggest taking their Tundra to the dealership to check the system for potential software or hardware problems.\n\nMore Reddit user Experiences\n\nElectrical_Ad_374 - I had the same problem on my 2024 Tundra. I took it to the dealer, who set it up with a 6-digit code\u2014never popped up after that. I think it has something to do with your phone settings.\n\nthetopalovic - It's a reasonably simple fix; essentially, it's not recognizing you on startup and is probably pulling the guest profile. In the settings, link your driver profile to your key fob and phone; it won't ask for the pin anymore.\n\nsandiegosteves - This fixed it for me too. Since I paired my FOB, it hasn't nagged me.\n\nAnthony Did Figure Out His Bluetooth Paring Issue\n\nHe suggests that if you're experiencing this problem, you should consider resetting your phone's Bluetooth settings, updating your phone's software, and ensuring that your Tundra's software is up to date.\n\nFinal Thoughts and Questions For Toyota Tundra Owners\n\nThere were 266 comments from Toyota Tundra owners who were happy with their trucks. They highlighted the Tundra's reliability, towing capacity, and overall performance. There is a lot to like about the Tundra pickup.\n\nHowever, Toyota has had engine issues with the Tundra trucks. Over 100,000 have been recalled and will get new engines under warranty.

At one point he quit his reasonably steady gig to go backpacking in the Andes. While you were toiling away at A Real Job, he was posting images of himself at Burning Man.\n\nTime passes, and perhaps despite his best efforts not to, this same person lands in an actual career. Another few years down the road, and now the once-Burning Man is making good money \u2013 but the adventurous and fun-loving guy you used to know is now as dull as a box of rocks, and I mean rock-rocks, not cool geodes and crystals and stuff. Any non-work hours are devoted to \u201cfamily time\u201d with the kids, or falling asleep at 9:30 while watching the latest Bridget Jones thing his wife wants to see. What happened to him?\n\nIf there\u2019s a car equivalent of our once fierce, now flabby friend, it has to be the Toyota RAV4.\n\nFor millennia (well, it felt like millennia), the battle for the title America\u2019s Best-Selling Car was fought tooth and nail by the Ford Taurus, Toyota Camry, and Honda Accord. Later, it came down to a clash between Ford and GM full-sized trucks. And today? Behold: the RAV4 has unseated the Ford F-150 as the nation\u2019s best-selling car.\n\nThis actually makes sense; crossover SUVs are the default choice that sedans used to be for many buyers today, and the RAV4 is the Camry equivalent of the category. Undeniably, it\u2019s a good product, and if you were pressed to recommend a CUV to someone who doesn\u2019t know anything about cars and sees them merely as transportation appliances, you\u2019d probably go straight to the RAV4. You know that they\u2019ll be content and, more importantly, will never come back to blame you for recommending a piece of shit. As for a CUV you\u2019d want to own yourself, I bet the RAV4 is much closer to the bottom of your list than the top. It\u2019s just too boring, right?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis wasn\u2019t always the case. When the RAV4 first appeared in US showrooms some thirty years ago (whoa \u2013 in my mind, a thirty-year-old Toyota is a woodgrain-clad Corona wagon), it was a rather cheeky little rascal; the four-door wagon and two-door enclosed \u201ccoupe\u201d model had a rounded look with funky strakes molded into the flanks below the often-brightly-painted sheet metal. Toyota economy-utility could be fun. Sporty, even.\n\nThere was also a rare open-topped two-door RAV4 on offer that was so offbeat it seemed dramatically out of character for straight-laced Toyota. With a stubby wheelbase compared to the four-door model, lift-off roof over the front seat, and drop-down convertible top in the back, the RAV \u201ccabrio\u201d was like a Jeep Wrangler or Geo Tracker but with a smooth-riding car-based drivetrain.\n\nSales of the small RAV4 two-door in either open or closed form never set the world on fire in the US. When the second-generation model was introduced for the 2001 model year, the two-door version was no longer offered in America (and dropped entirely for the third generation worldwide). The four-door version soldiered on, climbing the sales charts to the pinnacle.\n\nConcessions must be made in order to become a best-selling car, and that typically means losing any quirkiness or nail-that-stands-up character that might prevent the product from having total mass appeal. Sadly, the RAV4 seems to have made that deal with the devil over the years. As a thirtieth birthday gift to this unsung hero of Toyota\u2019s model lineup, let\u2019s imagine a rebirth of the Wrangler-style RAV4.\n\nGoodbye Colorado Rockies, Hello Chuck E. Cheese\n\nIt\u2019s rather hard to believe today, but up until the mid-eighties, your choices for four-door sport utilities were pretty limited. Shoppers looking for full-sizers could choose a big Chevy Suburban, the aging full-sized SJ Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer, or the rugged (and rare) Land Cruiser wagon. But if you wanted a small- to mid-sized sport utility with four doors, you were outta luck: the S-10 Blazer and Bronco II were introduced as two-door models only. The Blazer didn\u2019t receive back doors until 1991, and the Bronco II never got them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven the luxury Range Rover wasn\u2019t available as a four-door until 1981, unless you made one yourself; conversions by outside coachbuilders like the one below once owned by Black Sabbath\u2019s Tony Iommi required large sums of cash earned by writing heavy songs about smoking pot.\n\nBut change was afoot. When Jeep debuted the XJ Cherokee in 1984 as a four-door SUV and legit substitute for the family station wagon, it forced the competition to scramble and add more doors to their Pathfinders, 4Runners, and the like. Of course every last groundbreaking innovation in off-road vehicles was going to be from Dick Teague at American Motors, right?\n\nThis opening of the floodgates to mainstream acceptance of SUVs was a double-edged sword. As more suburbanites flocked to SUVs and came to dominate daycare pickup lines and other Mommy-Daddy duties rather than sporty pursuits, the category slowly lost its cool factor. The shorter-wheelbase, two-door models that remained saw their sales dwindle, likely due to their compromised practicality and perhaps in part to their often-stubby proportions \u2013 consider the sawed-off Ford Explorer \u201cSport\u201d model and the rather comical-looking two-door Isuzu Trooper, especially.\n\nBrands that kept selling two-door utes often tried to market them as sporting propositions with standout looks. Notable examples included Isuzu\u2019s fun-loving Amigo (with its bizarre roof-wing-CHMSL) and their bonkers what-the-hell-is-it VehiCross.\n\nNiche products don\u2019t last forever, and by the early 2000s the Jeep Wrangler was one of the few small SUVs left that still offered a two-door version; even then the four-door flavors of that icon were gaining more market share.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nToday, any summer day in American will see people cruising in their two- or four-door Jeep JLs and Ford Broncos with the roof and doors removed, making them the convertible of choice for modern drivers despite the fact that will likely never take them off road. It\u2019s a shame that the loyal followers of mega-brand Toyota don\u2019t have a way to let the sun in; just because they religiously read Consumer Reports reliability charts doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to have fun, right? Let\u2019s do them a solid and fix that inequity.\n\nOpen Up A Bit\n\nFor what I\u2019m calling the RAV4/30 Anniversary Edition, I\u2019ll start with the sporting-looking Hybrid Woodlands edition with arguably the most outdoorsy style and coolest wheels.\n\nFor my two-door version, the wheelbase is only very slightly reduced, and longer doors attempt to keep the look from getting too ill-proportioned. Notice at the front I\u2019ve added fog lights into the grille with frames above the mock \u201cpush bar\u201d Toyota has designed below the grille to look sort of like rugged add-on aftermarket lamps so popular in the Malaise era.\n\nLike the original open RAV4 two-door we\u2019ll have an opening roof section over the driver and front passenger but keep the door frames and cant rails in place; sure, that\u2019s kind of Triumph Stag-like but the visual tradeoff for good weather sealing should be worth it. Unlike the 1996 car, the roof panel of the RAV4/30 will slide back electrically, and rear seat passengers will have power roll-down quarter windows (but it won\u2019t be a pillarless hardtop).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn back, the soft top can be folded manually or removed entirely and dropped into the cargo area. The hatchback now needs to be a pivot-down tailgate; the bottom edge of the soft top above can lift up to ease with loading if needed. An optional, rigid rear cap would be available that includes lift-up rear glass. Note the slight recess in the rocker panel to pay homage to the original RAV4\u2019s styling detail.\n\nHere are animations to take you through the changes and options:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSide views also tell the story, starting with the original four-door:\n\nHere\u2019s the two-door enclosed and opened up for fun\n\nAnd now, animation of the side views (four-door, then two door, then open to the sky):\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo, you can\u2019t remove the doors, but you couldn\u2019t on the 1996 RAV4 either, and the owners still had more fun than anyone in a budget Toyota had a right to.\n\nThe Fewer The Doors, The Greater The Cool\n\nTwo-door SUVs making a comeback is about as likely as Detroit-built \u201cpersonal luxury\u201d coupes making a triumphant return, and that\u2019s fine. The RAV4/30 would be a limited production special edition anyway; a Toyota twist on the Jeep or Ford approaches to open off-roading. If nothing else, as a sort of \u201chalo\u201d model, the RAV4/30 would add some interest and attitude to the highly successful but extremely staid line of Toyota best sellers. It\u2019s a throwback to a time that few recall, the brief era when the RAV4 was quirky and cool; let\u2019s jog some memories.\n\nA Ford Maverick Could Be The Affordable, Practical Convertible The Market Is Missing \u2013 The Autopian\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nConvertible SUVs And Crossovers Are Inevitable So We Might As Well Figure Out How To Make Them Work \u2013 The Autopian\n\nSubaru Needs To Bring The Weird Back With A New BRAT \u2013 The Autopian\n\nYou Asked For It: A Minivan Made Cooler And More Versatile At The Same Time \u2013 The Autopian",

Photo by Sean Thomas\n\nDowntown Houston was as wet as Detroit in(the good one) Tuesday night. I galaxy brained myself into trying to arrive at the Toyota Center in between bands of rain, and even after cooling my heels in my car for a half hour, I showed up looking like a wet rat anyway.For the fans that braved the elements to attend the \"For My Fans\" tour, they got to see Mary J. Blige run through her award-winning (nine Grammys, an Emmy, and two Oscar nominations) career with panache and energy that belied her 54 years.Hell, they even sang along to the DeBarge song.I was in college when Blige's debut album,, dropped. At the time, your humble writer was desperately trying to repair the damage done to his GPA by being a ... less than diligent student his first two years of school. Despite that, I was definitely *aware* of MJB, if that makes any sense. You couldn't escape that album, especially \"Real Love,\" which established Blige as a new R&B powerhouse.The show opened with the shimmering \"Take Me As I Am\" from, Blige's third consecutive No. 1 album. It's an empowering tune coming from the perspective of someone who's dealt with hardship, yes, but is emerging from the darkness. Fittingly, she rose up from beneath the far stage, in a white duster and bolero hat, before riding a crown across the arena to the main stage where another (bigger) crown was seemingly held aloft by giant, outstretched hands.Those themes, empowerment and strength, would permeate the entire show. Blige's struggles have been well documented, and haven't fully subsided, but she sounded a more contented note, noting as she introduced \"Keep Your Head\" that she'd forgiven her father, a Vietnam vet with PTSD, for abandoning her and her sister when they were kids.Blige has been a reassuring presence on the radio during the last 30+ years, singing about life's highs and lows in a way that her fans deeply identify with. Last night's show fully demonstrated that influence, as well as the abiding enthusiasm those fans have for the Queen of Hip Hop Soul.The 30+ song set list was a little deceiving, however, considering a good chunk of them were delivered in medley format. We've seen this before , and it makes sense when you're talking about a career shot through with certified bangers. Still, it would've been nice to hear a full version of \"Need You More.\" Blige's resume is impressive enough that she doesn't even need to perform \"Real Love\" anymore ('s other big hit, \"You Remind Me,\" did make an appearance).Technically, there were a few flaws.

Here\u2019s what we know about the upcoming Toyota RAV4 and a possible EV variant.\n\nWhen will Toyota launch the electric RAV4 EV?\n\nThe RAV4 was Toyota\u2019s top-selling vehicle in the US last year, moving over 475,000 units. Even more impressive, the compact SUV ended the Ford F-150\u2019s nearly four-decade reign (except for 2009) as America\u2019s top-selling vehicle.\n\nData from Jato Dynamics (via Forbes) shows Ford F-150 sales slipped 5% to 460,915 in 2024, while RAV4 sales climbed another 9% to over 475,000.\n\nThe RAV4\u2019s growing popularity is mainly driven by the rising demand for hybrid and electric vehicles. With the current generation released back in 2018, Toyota is expected to reveal the updated RAV4 this summer.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nAccording to local reports, internal documents reveal the next-gen RAV4 will ride on an improved TNGA-K platform. The updated SUV is expected to be slightly bigger than the current model, with an extended wheelbase to open up more interior space.\n\n2025 Toyota RAV4 PHEV (Source: Toyota)\n\nThe design is expected to mirror the new Prius and Camry models with a sportier, more modern look. The front end is due for a new grille, and wraparound LED daytime running lights.\n\nInside, the new RAV4 will likely gain a new infotainment system with AppleCarPlay and Android Auto support. Other premium features could include a head-up display, panoramic sunroof, and a wireless charger.\n\n2025 Toyota bZ4X Limited AWD interior (Source: Toyota)\n\nToyota is expected to launch the next-gen RAV4 with several powertrain options, including ICE, hybrid (HEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and a possible electric (EV) variant.\n\nAlthough no details have been confirmed, Toyota is said to be considering an electric RAV4 that will ride on a modified TNGA-K platform. The fifth-gen RAV4 is built on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA-K) platform.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nThe RAV4 is already about the size of Toyota\u2019s electric bZ4X SUV. At 184.6\u2033 long, the bZ4X is slightly longer than the RAV4 (180.9\u2033 long), but if the rumors are true that the next-gen model will be bigger, it won\u2019t make sense for both to be on the market.\n\nWith the bZ4X reportedly due for a rebrand, it could be sold as the \u201celectric RAV4\u201d or \u201cRAV4 EV\u201d as Toyota drops the bZ naming system.\n\nWould you buy an electric Toyota RAV4?

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nThis evening, while strolling through the \"TOYOTA TUNDRA 2007-21\" group on Facebook, I stumbled upon a post by Bobby Allen that instantly grabbed my attention. Bobby is currently facing a concerning issue with his 2010 5.7L Toyota Tundra, which has 135,000 miles on the clock. He's always used synthetic oil and Toyota filters, but for about a week now, he's noticed a decrease in oil pressure at normal operating temperature, specifically at idle. Recently, after starting the engine, he heard a lifter sound, indicating that the problem might extend beyond just the oil pressure sensor or sending unit. Bobby said in his post:\n\n\u201cWhat are the typical reasons for a decrease in oil pressure once the engine reaches normal operating temperature in my 2010 5.7L Toyota, which has 135,000 miles, has always used synthetic oil and Toyota filters, and has not produced any engine noise yet, but has displayed low oil pressure on the gauge only at idle and normal temperature for approximately a week, and today, after startup, produced a lifter sound, suggesting that the problem is not limited to the sensor or sending unit, and I would appreciate any information on this issue, considering my background in Chevy engines with single cams?\u201d\n\nBobby's dilemma is not uncommon among Tundra owners, and it sparked a lively discussion in the comments section. Byron Hill shared his experience, stating, \u201cSometimes mine will drop when idling. I\u2019ve had two, and both of them did the same thing. One had 260,000 miles when I wrecked it, and I had to go back to my old one to drive; it\u2019s got 436,000 on it. 135,000 is nothing. The 5.7 is noisy, not all the time, just sometimes. It always depended on where I got gas.\u201d This comment highlights a shared understanding of the Tundra's quirks and the varying experiences of its owners.\n\nAnother user, Jim DeMarco, provided a more technical perspective. He cautioned that \u201cthat low oil pressure, if correct, is too low. But gauges can be incorrect. Have it checked with a mechanical gauge. That said, in 40 years of experience, I would be surprised if the gauge is faulty. Check the oil filter for being crushed if the center support tube is missing. There are various places where oil pressure within the engine can bleed off, creating low oil pressure. If a heavier grade oil improves the situation at all, I would suspect a chain tensioner issue. It is unlikely an engine bearing at that lower mileage.\u201d Jim\u2019s advice underscores the importance of not just relying on the gauge, as there could be multiple underlying issues at play.\n\nKevin Hoover chimed in with a potential cause for Bobby's issue: \u201cIf this problem developed rather quickly, it could be a crushed oil filter. When you remove the filter housing, it should have a metal mesh piece in the center of the filter element. Sometimes, when removing the filter, this part will come with the filter, especially if the filter is twisted when it is pulled off. If it is discarded with the element, the replacement filter element will eventually collapse, causing a loss of oil pressure. I've seen seized Toyota engines because of this.\u201d Kevin\u2019s experience serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of proper maintenance, especially when it comes to something as vital as the oil system.\n\nWilliam Taylor added his two cents by sharing a similar experience with his 2013 Tundra. \u201cI just had the same thing on my 2013. I can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019s your issue, but it was the sending unit for me. The gauge was reading almost identical to yours. I\u2019d increase the RPMs, and the pressure would increase a bit but then go back down. Dealer fix: $200-ish.\u201d His comment suggests that sometimes, the issue may be less severe than it appears, pointing to a relatively simple solution.\n\nBobby's post and the ensuing comments highlight the various factors that can contribute to low oil pressure in the 5.7L Tundra. As we dive deeper into this topic, we\u2019ll explore the symptoms, potential causes, and lessons learned from these shared experiences.\n\nSymptoms of Low Oil Pressure\n\nLow oil pressure can manifest in several ways, and being aware of the symptoms is crucial for early detection and prevention of more severe issues. Common symptoms of low oil pressure include:\n\nOil Pressure Warning Light: This is often the first indication of low oil pressure. If the light illuminates on your dashboard, it's essential to take immediate action. Oil Pressure Gauge Reading: If your oil pressure gauge shows a reading below the normal range, it\u2019s a sign that something may be wrong. Unusual Engine Noises: Sounds such as knocking or ticking can indicate that the engine isn\u2019t receiving adequate lubrication. Poor Engine Performance: Low oil pressure can lead to reduced engine efficiency and performance, affecting acceleration and overall drivability. Increased Oil Consumption: If your vehicle is consuming oil at an unusual rate, it could be a sign of low oil pressure or other underlying issues. Overheating: Insufficient oil flow can lead to increased engine temperatures, which may cause overheating.\n\nUnderstanding these symptoms is crucial for Tundra owners to prevent potential damage and costly repairs.\n\nCommon Causes of Low Oil Pressure\n\nNow that we\u2019ve identified the symptoms, let\u2019s take a closer look at some common causes of low oil pressure in the 2010 5.7L Tundra:\n\nOil Pump Failure: The oil pump is responsible for circulating oil throughout the engine. If it fails or becomes inefficient, it can lead to low oil pressure. Clogged Oil Filter: A clogged oil filter can restrict oil flow, resulting in decreased oil pressure. As Kevin mentioned, improper filter installation can lead to this issue. Oil Leakage: If there are leaks in the oil system, whether from gaskets, seals, or oil lines, it can cause a drop in oil pressure. Worn Engine Bearings: Over time, engine bearings can wear out, leading to increased clearance and reduced oil pressure. Oil Quality and Viscosity: Using the wrong oil type or degraded oil can negatively impact oil pressure. It's crucial to follow the manufacturer's recommendations for oil type and change intervals. Faulty Oil Pressure Sensor: A malfunctioning oil pressure sensor can provide inaccurate readings, leading to confusion about the actual oil pressure. Temperature Effects: Oil viscosity can change with temperature. If the oil becomes too thin when warm, it may not maintain proper pressure.\n\nLessons Learned from Bobby's Experience\n\nBobby's post and the shared experiences of others provide valuable insights into addressing low oil pressure issues. Here are some key takeaways:\n\nDon\u2019t Ignore Symptoms: Low oil pressure can lead to severe engine damage if left unaddressed. Promptly investigating any warning lights or gauge readings is crucial. Check the Basics: Before diving into complex solutions, always start with the basics. Check the oil level, quality, and filter condition to ensure they are within the recommended specifications. Utilize Community Knowledge: The automotive community, especially platforms like Facebook groups, can provide invaluable advice and support. Sharing experiences and seeking guidance can help pinpoint issues more quickly. Consider Professional Help: If you\u2019re unsure about diagnosing or addressing the issue yourself, seeking assistance from a qualified mechanic can save time and prevent further damage. Document Your Findings: Keeping a record of any symptoms, maintenance performed, and repairs made can help you track recurring issues and provide valuable information to a mechanic if needed.\n\nThe Importance of Regular Maintenance\n\nRegular maintenance is vital for the longevity and performance of your Toyota Tundra. This includes:\n\nRoutine Oil Changes: Changing the oil and filter at the recommended intervals helps ensure optimal engine performance and can prevent issues like low oil pressure.\n\nChanging the oil and filter at the recommended intervals helps ensure optimal engine performance and can prevent issues like low oil pressure.

(LEX 18) \u2014 The pandemic robbed Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky of the opportunity to showcase its 9,000,000 square foot operation that\u2019s become an enormous part of central Kentucky\u2019s fabric, not to mention what it\u2019s meant to our economic landscape.\n\nDuring that period, when the visitor center was empty, Toyota officials decided it would be a good time to enhance the visitor experience, so they threw more than $2,000,000 into building a new space with interactive exhibits and videos that allow visitors to get an even greater sense of the work that goes into churning out 2,000 cars here daily.\n\n\u201cI think it's good for our guests to come in and understand what it takes to manufacture vehicles,\u201d President Kerry Creech said, while seated right in the middle of the new visitor space.\n\nCreech has been with TMMK for 35 years. His 8th promotion was into the President\u2019s seat during the summer of 2023, and while he\u2019s naturally quite proud of the work being done on this assembly line each day, he seems very pleased with how the new \u201cExperience Center\u201d turned out.\n\n\u201cWe have a video room to show what goes on and seeing them watch the video of everything happening in the plant, then going out to see it in the plant, for me is a really rewarding experience,\u201d Creech said.\n\nWhen visitors come to the \u201cExperience Center\u201d they\u2019ll have an opportunity to do some of the manual dexterity (and critical thinking) exercises that plant workers do to help increase efficiency. They\u2019ll also have a chance to get up close to the \u201cguts\u201d of a vehicle, and see how the men, women and robots assemble vehicles. It really adds to the experience of a guided plant tour, and it\u2019s all free of charge.\n\n\u201cToyota\u2019s philosophy is we want to build the cars or sell the cars, and we also want to be a good community partner,\u201d Creech said.\n\nSince its Kentucky inception in the mid-1980s, Toyota has made roughly $200,000,000 in community donations according to its website. The group has also become a primary sponsor for Kentucky\u2019s Honor Flights, which take military veterans to Washington, D.C. twice annually for various events there. The free plant tours are one way of growing their footprint on central Kentucky, where they employ roughly 10,000 people. The tours can also serve as a vehicle to a career for future generations of plant manufacturers, or other personnel that's needed to make this place run.\n\n\u201cIt shows everyone, that maybe is interested in a manufacturing job, that manufacturing isn't that dirty, grungy place that your grandfather, great grandfather or maybe your father worked in,\u201d Creech said. \u201cWe really made the paint scheme bright, polished the floors, what we call, \u2018clean, bright and quiet.\"\n\nWith or without the new \u201cExperience Center,\u201d Creech is just glad to see the public back in the building and learning, while enjoying the time there after the pandemic-induced hiatus.\n\n\u201cIt was lonely in the plant, not seeing those trams come through with people waiving at us, and getting to show off what we do,\u201d Creech said, before crediting Corporate Communications Manager, Kim Ogle for her role in devising the new center and getting the tours up and running in the post-COVID world.\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information about touring the Toyota plant, or to book a tour, click here.",

            "content": "Claim: In February 2025, Toyota and Honda were planning to shutter manufacturing plants in the U.S. as a result of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Rating: About this rating False\n\nIn February 2025, as U.S. President Donald Trump moved to impose new tariffs on imported goods, rumors began to spread online that auto manufacturers Toyota and Honda were planning to shutter manufacturing plants in the U.S as a result.\n\nFor example, a Snopes reader sent a meme in an email, asking whether its claims were true:\n\n(meme)\n\nThe meme appeared on a Feb. 17, 2025, Reddit post. \"FAILURE,\" the meme said, with Trump's silhouette for the letter I. It read:\n\nHonda and Toyota are preparing to execute plans to shut down assembly lines in the US because they are not willing to pay a 25% premium on materials. Tens of thousands of workers in plants in Ohio, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and Georgia will be sent home without pay. The effect on those workers and the communities they shop in will make the price of eggs seem completely insignificant.\n\nThe same claim appeared on Threads and Instagram.\n\nIt is true that Toyota owns plants in Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi. Further, Honda owns plants in Ohio, Alabama and Georgia.\n\nIt is also true that Trump imposed new tariffs on imported goods after he took office in 2025. On Feb. 1 he issued an executive order imposing 10% tariffs on Chinese goods and 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. He paused tariffs on the latter two nations for a month, extending that pause on March 6, 2025. Further, on Feb. 18 he proposed new 25% tariffs on automobiles, pharmaceuticals and semiconductor chips, saying he would provide more information on April 2.\n\nHowever, the rumor about Honda and Toyota closing plants is false. Representatives denied the claims in emails.\n\nThe rumor may have stemmed from a Feb. 3, 2025, report by the Alabama Political Reporter, a local political news site, speculating about the potential fallout from Trump's tariffs. The report quoted David Adams, president of the Global Automakers of Canada trade group, which represents both Honda and Toyota. Adams said at the time that such tariffs may lead to plants pausing production both in the U.S. and in Canada, causing severe damage to the economy of Alabama, one state where both Toyota and Honda have plants.\n\nA statement from the trade group quoted Adams as saying that the consequences of such tariffs would be dire both for the U.S. and Canada:\n\nOur members are gravely concerned. This will have immediate negative impacts to jobs and consumers on both sides of the border. Tariffs only serve to increase costs, hinder trade, impact economic growth, and hurt consumers and workers.\n\nAfter Trump announced the pause in implementing tariffs, Adams posted a statement on his LinkedIn page voicing relief. That statement read, in part:\n\nIn the end, tariffs increase cost, hinder trade, reduce economic efficiency, limit growth, and critically hurt consumers and workers. Canada and the United States should focus efforts on trying to make the North American automotive industry \u2014 which has been highly integrated between Canada and the United States for 60 years \u2014 as competitive as possible.\n\nNeither Toyota nor Honda announced that they had decided to close manufacturing plants in the U.S.\n\nIn emails, spokespeople from the U.S. operations of both Honda and Toyota confirmed that their companies were not shuttering plants. \"There is no truth to that rumor,\" the spokesperson for Toyota said. \"It did not come from Honda and is inaccurate from our standpoint,\" said Chris Abbruzzese, a spokesperson for Honda.\n\nReuters reported on March 3, 2025, that Honda had decided to cancel plans to build a new plant in Mexico in order to open it in Indiana as a way to skirt Trump's new tariffs on Mexico. \"Honda has decided to produce its next-generation Civic hybrid in the U.S. state of Indiana, instead of Mexico, to avoid potential tariffs on one of its top-selling car models,\" Reuters reported, based on anonymous sourcing.\n\nTrump himself mentioned this in his March 4, 2025 address to Congress, the first of his new term. \"Numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world,\" Trump said.\n\nHowever, in an emailed statement, Honda spokespeople replied that no such announcement had been made, and that Honda would not comment on Reuters' report, adding that Honda has been producing the Civic model in its Indiana plant since its opening in 2008. They also thanked Trump for recognizing Honda in his speech:\n\nWe thank President Trump for recognizing our commitment to manufacturing vehicles in America, and we look forward to working with the administration and Congress on pro-growth policies that support a robust U.S. auto industry. While Honda did not announce plans for a new plant in the U.S. at this time, we have invested over $3 billion in advanced vehicle manufacturing in America in just the past three years, with a cumulative total of more than $24.7 billion. We look forward to continuing to invest locally and build quality products in America, as Honda has been doing for the past 45 years.\n\nIn September 2024, Snopes published a primer on tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration and the expected consequences of tariffs proposed by Trump's reelection campaign in 2024.",

            "content": "Believe it or not, cars still account for about 20% of new vehicle sales. The many models of the Toyota Camry still outsell most other popular crossovers except for the Toyota RAV4. The newly redesigned Honda Accord suggests that Honda\u2019s not ceding to crossovers, either. This classic battle between two of the bestselling mainstream sedans in history rages on, even in the electrified era.\n\nThe 2025 Honda Accord arrives with its recently updated and tamer look, and a clean hybrid option that accounts for about half of Accord sales. The bestselling 2025 Toyota Camry makes its mark in the hybrid arena too: it\u2019s now hybrid-only, with an all-wheel-drive option lacking in the Accord.\n\nDespite their nuances, they\u2019re more similar than different, with starting prices below $30,000 and crash-minimizing standard safety features. Either one is a solid choice, but for different reasons. Here\u2019s how we rank these sedans, and a side-by-side look at their competitive advantages.\n\n2023 Honda Accord Hybrid\n\nHonda Accord vs. Toyota Camry price, trims, and warranty\n\nCamry ranges from about $30,000 to nearly $38,000\n\nAccord ranges from about $29,000 to more than $40,000\n\nBest picks: Honda Accord Hybrid EX-L, Toyota Camry XLE\n\nWhich Honda Accord should I buy?\n\nHonda prefers you to buy the Accord Hybrid. The base LX and SE (which replaces the EX) with the turbo-4 are cheaper, but the roughly $4,000 upcharge for the Hybrid includes a lot of feature upgrades as well. For about $30,000 including destination, the Accord LX comes with the basics expected in a new car, such as cloth seats, a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster, and two USB-C ports.\n\nStepping up to the base Sport Hybrid for $34,750 adds a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless smartphone compatibility and available wireless charging, a sunroof, a power driver seat, dual-zone climate control, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. For about $1,500 more, we\u2019d look at the EX-L for the Accord Hybrid best buy. It sticks with more efficient 17-inch wheels and tires instead of the 19-inch wheels on other Hybrids and adds leather seats, a power passenger seat, as well as heated front seats and side mirrors.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry\n\nWhich Toyota Camry should I buy?\n\nThe Camry comes in LE, SE, XLE and XSE trims, all with the hybrid powertrain. At just under $30,000 the base Camry LE comes with similar features to the Accord, in this case an 8.0-inch touchscreen with smartphone compatibility. But the infotainment interface feels a generation behind the new Accord\u2019s. All-wheel drive costs $1,525.\n\nWe like the Camry XLE for $34,495. It has power leather front seats that are heated, a wireless smartphone charger, twin 12.3-inch digital displays for the gauges and for infotainment, and options such as a panoramic sunroof and 9-speaker JBL audio.\n\nWhich car has the better warranty?\n\nHonda Accord and Toyota Camry warranties are nearly identical, with a three-year/36,000-mile basic warranty, and the first two years or 24,000 miles (Accord; Camry goes to 25,000 miles) of scheduled maintenance are included. But the Camry Hybrid gets the edge, because Toyota covers the battery for 10 years or 150,000 miles, versus Honda\u2019s eight-year/100,000-mile warranty for battery components\u2014useful information, since Toyota's no longer the most reliable car brand.\n\nAdvantage: It's a draw.\n\n2023 Honda Accord Hybrid\n\nAccord vs. Camry interior and exterior design\n\nThe Camry offers more personalities\n\nThe Accord wins on the interior\n\nIs the Honda Accord a good-looking car?\n\nIt is, though not as striking as it was a generation ago, when its fastback profile had a clear advantage over the Camry. Honda softened the latest design to something more conservative; it went from looking like an Audi to looking like a VW Passat. Growing 2.7 inches in length, the Accord goes for a long and low look, with a hood dipping down over a broad two-piece grille.\n\nInside, it adopts the Civic\u2019s mesh vent panel and clean dashboard. Honda ditched nicer elements such as fake wood trim and gear buttons for a mechanical shifter, but the low dash better integrates the available 12.3-inch touchscreen. A panel of dials and buttons for audio and climate reduce reliance on the touchscreen for everyday functions, and overall it\u2019s a clean, uncluttered cabin.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry\n\nIs the Toyota Camry a good-looking car?\n\nUnlike the Accord, the Camry wants to stand out, and nearly tries too hard in doing so. With its long nose and short trunk, it pretends to be a rear-wheel-drive grand tourer. Up front, Toyota carves out folds and creases as if it were a Star Wars fighter, though the restyled front end has resolved some of the complex line intersections. The roofline sails like a fastback, but the Camry has a short trunk lid over its sizable trunk.\n\nToyota has also tamed down some of the Camry\u2019s interior look. It now unfolds along a horizontal band with either an 8.0-inch or 12.3-inch touchscreen. The cohesive shapes still get divided, driver and passenger, with a trim panel.\n\nAdvantage: The Accord for its interior.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry\n\nCamry vs. Accord performance\n\nThis is where the sedans most deviate. Honda leans into the Accord Hybrid, but the base model\u2019s small turbo-4 strives more for efficiency than anything else. Toyota offers only hybrids with the Camry, with an added traction bonus.\n\nHow does the Toyota Camry drive?\n\nAs a reasonable commuter car without any fanfare, the newly standard 225-hp hybrid powertrain gets the job done smoothly and efficiently. It pairs a 2.5-liter inline-4 with a lithium-ion battery and electric motors. Available all-wheel drive gives it a leg up on the Accord as well as a little more power, for a total of 232 hp. Its hybrid transmission has eight programmed steps that simulate an automatic transmission, and the SE gets shift paddles for the mildly adventurous drivers.\n\nThe front struts and multilink rear suspension do a fine job of balancing the load, but drivers won\u2019t be tempted to cut corners or iron out road wrinkles. The Camry SE and XSE come with a sportier suspension and bigger wheels, which cancel out the other versions\u2019 resilient ride. We\u2019d stick with those, though in all Camry sedans, we\u2019re impressed by responsive steering, even with the base 16-inch wheels.\n\nHow does the Accord drive?\n\n192-hp 1.5-liter turbo-4 in front-wheel drive only\n\n204-hp Hybrid with a 2.0-liter inline-4\n\nQuickness is not the forte of the Accord, but the rigid body makes up for it with balanced handling despite being front-wheel drive only. The base 1.5-liter turbo-4 makes 192 hp and 192 lb-ft, and it\u2019s bound to a CVT that mostly operates in the background. Light but direct steering remains the Accord\u2019s strength. The engine lacks the guts of the Camry, but the handling and steering feel are better.\n\nThe Accord\u2019s two-motor hybrid system works with the 2.0-liter inline-4 to make 204 hp and 247 lb-ft of torque. At the start, it takes a beat for the power to come on when called, but the balance between the engine and motors is quiet, seamless, and seemingly effortless. Like an EV, paddle shifters enable six levels of regenerative braking with a near one-pedal driving mode, but it still has the creep of gas cars in gear.\n\nAdvantage: It\u2019s a draw.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry\n\nToyota Camry vs. Honda Accord fuel economy\n\nToyota Camry Hybrid LE: 53 mpg city, 50 highway, 51 combined\n\nHonda Accord Hybrid EX-L: 51/44/48 mpg with 17-inch wheels\n\nHonda Accord turbo-4: 29/37/32 mpg\n\nIs the Honda Accord good on gas?\n\nYes. With a small turbo-4 and a continuously variable transmission, it has an EPA rating of 29 mpg city, 37 highway, 32 combined. That\u2019s roughly the same as the Toyota Camry 4-cylinder, but the Accord is more efficient around town and the Camry better on the highway.\n\nThe wheel size makes a difference on the Accord Hybrid, as it does on every vehicle. The EX-L rides on 17-inch wheels with a smaller contact patch that results in a 51/44/48-mpg rating. The Sport, Sport L, and Touring models roll on fatter 19-inch wheels that look cool but drag efficiency down to 46/41/44 mpg.\n\nIs the Toyota Camry good on gas?\n\nThe Camry Hybrid outpaces the Accord on base front-drive LE versions (53/50/51 mpg) as well as with all-wheel drive (51/49/50 mpg).\n\nOther trim levels dip to 47 or 46 mpg, with the Camry XSE anchoring the lineup at a still impressive 44 mpg combined.\n\nAdvantage: The Camry\u2019s better, measure by measure.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry\n\nCamry vs. Accord size, roominess, and comfort\n\nThe Accord is bigger and roomier\n\nThe Accord has 16.7 cubic feet of trunk space versus 15.1 in the Camry\n\nThe Accord has 40.8 inches of rear legroom versus 38.0 inches in the Camry\n\nHow roomy is the Honda Accord?\n\nThe Accord is 3.0 inches longer than the Camry, but the 111.4-inch wheelbase is nearly the same. Yet, as in its other crossovers and cars, Honda excels at optimizing the interior space, from a recessed floor in the roomy trunk to deep door pockets and bins.\n\nThe base LX has cloth seats with manual adjustments, but most front seats sport heaters and power adjustments. Honda upgraded the seats with good cushion and support, and we prefer the narrower console to that in the Camry. Rear passengers get treated to a crossover-like legroom of 40.8 inches and good headroom, but in either car, the middle seat favors younger people at best, and at the expense of those in the outboard seats.\n\nThe 60:40-split rear seats fold down to expand trunk space, and both the Accord and Camry don\u2019t sacrifice any trunk space to hybrid battery packs. The Accord\u2019s is roomier, however, measuring 16.7 cubic feet versus 15.1 cubes in the Camry.\n\nHow roomy is the Toyota Camry?\n\nThe Camry measures up to the Accord by most metrics but doesn\u2019t feel as roomy. The front passenger seat is walled off from the console and pinches some legroom. The driver seat has power adjustments with lumbar support, and both front seats are supportive, however.\n\nThe rear seats offer up 38.0 inches of rear legroom but the high window line and low roofline cause rear passengers to duck in more than the Accord and feel slightly more cramped.\n\nAdvantage: The Accord.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry\n\nCamry vs. Accord safety\n\nThe NHTSA gives the Accord five stars\n\nThe IIHS gives the Accord and Camry a Top Safety Pick+\n\nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, active lane control, adaptive cruise control standard on both\n\nHow safe is the Honda Accord?\n\nThe IIHS gave it a Top Safety Pick+ designation, which is considered to be the highest safety rating in the industry, especially with more rigorous criteria introduced for 2023. have not tested it at the time of publication. We\u2019ll update this accordingly.\n\nBoth the Accord and Toyota Camry come standard with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitors, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, traffic jam assist, automatic high beam headlights, and a rear seat reminder\n\nHow safe is the Toyota Camry?\n\nWe expect the Camry to return with its former five-star designation from the NHTSA. The IIHS has granted it a Top Safety Pick+ award.\n\nAdvantage: The Accord, until Camry testing is complete.\n\n2023 Honda Accord Hybrid\n\nWhich is better: Honda Accord or Toyota Camry?\n\nBuyers have a real quandary here. The Camry earns a TCC Rating of 7.0 out of 10 based mostly on much improved fuel economy. But the Accord? It's a 7.3 out of 10. (Read more about how we rate cars.) We prefer the Accord\u2019s interior and its overall composure, while the Camry excels in fuel economy and steering feel. The Accord also feels fresher, roomier, and a bit more refined.\n\nWinner: The Honda Accord.",

Pictured from left during the Q&A were James Fakunle, assistant professor of entrepreneurship, with Suggs and Dr. Bradley Venable, chair of HPU\u2019s Department of Management and professor of supply chain management.\n\nHIGH POINT, N.C., Feb. 18, 2025 \u2013 Hundreds of High Point University students filled the Callicutt Life Skills Theater to learn from Sean Suggs, president of Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina and HPU\u2019s Technology Executive in Residence, during his visit to campus on Feb. 4.\n\nSuggs led a Life Skills and Leadership Series session entitled Embracing a Growth Mindset. During the session, he stressed to students the importance of constantly growing professionally. He discussed implementing several new principles at Toyota, including Kaizen, a Japanese word for having a mindset to improve continually and always seek a better way.\n\n\u201cKaizen is continuous improvement, and it\u2019s something we live by every single day at Toyota,\u201d Suggs said. \u201cIf we can get 5,000 new ideas every single day, think of the power that will give us to elevate and excel as a company. We\u2019re always looking for a better way, and there is no small kaizen.\u201d\n\nSuggs provided an update on Toyota\u2019s record-breaking $14 billion investment in North Carolina and the ongoing construction of a manufacturing facility to support electric battery vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric battery vehicles. Toyota is building a $50 million Center of Excellence at its battery manufacturing campus to house all its training and development for team members and new hires. Toyota also is in the process of hiring more than 5,000 employees, including accountants, engineers and marketing, sales, business administration and supply chain professionals. He spoke to the students about possibly filling some of these new positions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for talented, robust people who are interested in having a great career,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe when you have a job, you\u2019ve got a career for life.\u201d\n\nNoting 99 percent of HPU students are employed or continuing their education within 180 days of graduation, Suggs advised them to establish their own board of directors by finding a mentor, coach and sponsor. He said a coach is someone good at their job who you can learn from, while a mentor can provide encouragement. A sponsor can advocate for you in closed-door meetings with supervisors, he said.\n\n\u201cJust a couple of years ago, your great president at this university allowed us to use this site to create our vision and mission,\u201d Suggs said. \u201cWe brought our entire leadership team to High Point to make that happen, and we\u2019re living it every single day.\u201d\n\nSuggs participated in a Q&A with James Fakunle, assistant professor of entrepreneurship, and Dr. Bradley Venable, chair of the Department of Management and professor of supply chain management during his visit. He taught an introduction to leadership studies class and had lunch with global business students. He also shared a QR code to allow students to contact him personally.\n\nEarning a coachability certificate\n\nSuggs\u2019 Life Skills Seminar was the second session that allowed HPU students to work toward earning a tuition-free certification in coachability. Students who attend four designated Access to Innovators sessions can earn a Life Skills certification and enhance their professional credentials.\n\nHearing about Suggs\u2019 mission and vision for Toyota to be recognized as a global leader in the charge for sustainable electric and hybrid batteries resonated with Diego Rozo, a senior accounting major from West Boyleston, Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cOne big takeaway was how he explained the need for finding a mentor, a coach and a sponsor and how each one of those is different,\u201d Rozo said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s beneficial for students like us to have a mentor, a coach and a sponsor in many ways. The Japanese word kaizen was a new concept for me \u2014 where the more ideas you provide, the better.\u201d\n\nToyota\u2019s positive work environment and its team efforts to improve the future for other people impressed Jonathan Erris, a senior criminal justice major from Jacksonville, North Carolina.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just focused on the manufacturing of batteries but also to have the betterment of others and their well-being in mind, especially with their help with donations to schools,\u201d Erris said.",

As I delved into the 4th Gen 2024+ Toyota Tacoma Facebook Owners page, I stumbled upon this intriguing post by Joe Carter, a proud owner of a 2024 Tacoma. It ignited a heated debate over oil change intervals on the new Tacoma, making the discussion even more compelling.\n\nJoe says, \"I'm getting my free oil change with Toyota at 1,100 miles for peace of mind and to take care of this beautiful engine. Break in contaminants are real, but peace of mind is more real.\"\n\nSo, Joe barely had 1,000 miles on his pickup before he went to the dealer for his first oil change. After another 4,000 miles, he took his 2024 Tacoma in for his second oil change. His third oil change was at 10,300 miles, for an average of 3,500 miles between oil changes.\n\nIs This Overkill?\n\nHe says, \"My second oil change was at 5,000 miles. Now, I'm getting my oil changed at 10,300 miles; this is my third oil change since I bought the truck. I'm not messing around. You need to protect those turbos. This Tacoma will last the test of time.\"\n\nIt's as if Joe is speaking directly to us: \"I change the oil in my 2024 Tacoma every 3,500 miles. I don't really care that Toyota says I should wait and change it every 10,000 miles. I want my truck to last.\"\n\nJoe Loves His New Tacoma\n\nJoe continues, \"The Lord showed me a long time ago that when we take care of the blessings He bestows upon us (spiritual and material), it's indicative of our degree of gratitude towards Him\u2026.and\u2026. here's the beauty of it, He will entrust you with more!\"\n\nWhat are Other Tacoma Owners Saying?\n\nPaul Biondi: I do mine at roughly 3700 intervals and don't care what anyone else says. Turbos need clean oil, and it's cheap to do it yourself. If it weren't for the cover, we would need to remove it. I would do it in 15 minutes.\n\nJeff Young - I did my first at 4000 km, then 10,000 km. I plan to do every 10,000km, which is 6000 miles.\n\nAries Cruz - Mine is almost 10k; this will be my first oil change.\n\nOwen Watts: I'm a service advisor at Toyota. The engine is rated for 10k miles between oil changes and full synthetic. You can do what you wish, but this is simply a waste of money.\n\nA Reddit user says, I used to machine and build engines for a very reputable shop and was good at my job. What I do for myself is based on these experiences and knowledge.\n\nI change my oil every 5k with full synthetic. I have a 2022 V6. Toyota recommendeds 10k.\n\nThe 2 main reasons you change your oil are so it doesn't break down and to keep the inside of your engine CLEAN. Your oil picks up the shit that's in your engine. The dirtier it is, the more I wears out your bearings and journals in the engine. Oil filters do not pick up all of that debree. They're not perfect. The more frequently you change the filter and oil, the cleaner your engine is and the less these components wear.\n\nWhat Does Toyota Say about the 4th-gen Tacoma engine oil change interval?\n\nToyota says the 2024-2025 Toyota Tacoma, which requires 0w-20 synthetic oil, has been approved for extended oil change intervals of 10,000 miles/12 months. (However, you should continue to check the oil level regularly and top it off if needed. This will help your engine get the full benefit of synthetic oil.)\n\nWhat type of oil is recommended?\n\nThe Tacoma runs best on synthetic oil, calling for SAE 0W-20 or SW 5W-20. Toyota says if 0W-20 is unavailable, 5W-20 may be used, but it must be replaced with 0W-20 at the following oil change.\n\nAre there any exceptions to the recommended 10,000-mile oil change interval?\n\nToyota says that if the vehicle's operation meets the standard criteria for \"Special Operating Conditions,\" such as driving off-road, on dirt roads, towing a trailer, making repeated short trips under 32 degrees F, or extensive idling, the engine oil must be replaced at 5,000-mile intervals, regardless of the type of oil used.\n\nEven if the vehicle uses 0W-20 synthetic oil, the traditional 5,000-mile maintenance procedures should still be performed.\n\nOther Toyota Tacoma 10,000 maintenance procedures.\n\nThe Tacoma's 10,000-mile service also includes:\n\nInspecting and potentially replacing the cabin air filter\n\nInspecting the truck's brake drums and linings\n\nFinal Thoughts and Questions For Tacoma Owners\n\nMany Tacoma owners fall into the Special Operating Conditions category unless they live in a warm climate, drive for longer distances with minimal stop-and-go traffic, and do very little city driving.\n\nEven if you don't pull a trailer, drive on dirt roads, or go off-road, changing it every 5,000 miles is a good idea. It's a small price to pay for the long-term health of your engine. Regular maintenance is key to keeping your Toyota Tacoma, which you've invested $40,000 to $50,000 in, in top shape.\n\nOil changes are cheap compared with replacing a new engine.\n\nIt's Your Turn\n\nHow often do you change the oil in your Toyota Tacoma?

The company is recalling more than 106,000 vehicles, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nCertain configurations of the 2024-2025 Toyota Tacoma are being recalled over the potential for a brake fluid leak.

The Unreal scene is far from finished, with lighting and scene composition needing more work, so I opted to create a small environment in Toolbag just to showcase the car.\n\nFor the environment, I used assets from Megascans, such as a fully scanned mountain range in the background. I blended several gravel and soil materials in Quixel Mixer and scattered bushes and larger rocks around the scene. Since I knew most of these elements would be blurred by the camera\u2019s depth of field and the focus would be on the car, I didn\u2019t aim for perfection in the environment. Still, I was happy with the final result.\n\nThe lighting setup was straightforward. I didn\u2019t use any additional light sources, relying entirely on HDRI maps. I tested about ten different HDRIs, constantly switching between them to find the right mood for the scene.\n\n\n\nFinding the right angles for renders was one of the most time-consuming parts of this stage. I spent hours flying around the car, adjusting the lighting, and switching HDRIs. Eventually, I settled on ten fixed camera angles, and in combination with multiple lighting setups, I rendered about 100 images. Afterward, I spent a long time narrowing down the renders to a smaller selection for posting on ArtStation without overwhelming the viewer.\n\nOnce I selected the images, I moved on to post-processing in Photoshop. My workflow here is simple: I use the Camera RAW Filter and adjust sliders without a strict order until I achieve the desired contrast, brightness, and color balance. Here, I just follow my heart, as I have no master's degree in color grading, so at that stage, feedback collected from friends and colleagues may become very helpful.\n\n",

This led to an investigation, which eventually determined that the \u201cwebbing strength of second-row center seatbelts did not meet certain requirements\u201d of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.\n\nThe recall impacts the 2025 Camry as well as the 2025 Lexus NX250, NX350, and NX350h. Other impacted models include the 2024-2025 Lexus RX350, RX350h, and RX500h.\n\nOwner notifications are expected to be mailed out in late March or early April, and customers will be instructed to take their vehicle to the dealership. There, technicians will examine the seat belt webbing and replace the seat belt assembly if necessary.\n\nWhile Toyota believes that less than 0.1% of vehicles have bad seat belts, the recall impacts 32,529 Camry sedans. That\u2019s a bulk of the population and the second most impacted model is the Lexus RX350 at 3,242 units.",

Last year we missed out on the drivers\u2019 title so this year our target is to win both, but it will difficult. As well as a new manufacturer in Aston Martin, the returning manufacturers will come back stronger, and with more experience, so I expect it will be more competitive than ever. We have no advantages, and we will have to challenge ourselves to get better in every area to stay on top. We need to get more out of our car set-up at each race, show even more team spirit and fight for every position. We have great support from the rest of the Toyota family and our partners; every year I feel we are coming closer together and becoming stronger. We want to make an even stronger GR010 HYBRID this season and this will contribute to making ever-better cars through motorsports.\n\nMike Conway (Driver, car #7):\n\nA new season is always exciting, and I\u2019m always pumped up to start a new year fresh, looking forward to what we can achieve together as a team. We have clear goals this season and we are working hard in all areas to achieve them. Last season was pretty good, but we can still improve and that\u2019s been our focus, starting in Qatar. Over the past year we have had some great racing in Hypercar, and it looks like being even more exciting now, especially with a new manufacturer joining the field. I can\u2019t wait to get started and kick off a new season in Qatar.\n\nNyck de Vries (Driver, car #7):\n\nIt\u2019s exciting to start the new season and I\u2019m looking forward to a new year with new opportunities. My first season as a TOYOTA GAZOO Racing race driver was very enjoyable and successful. We had highs and lows, many different emotions, and we just fell short on some of our goals. We are ambitious and would like to win everything, but we didn\u2019t manage to win Le Mans or the drivers\u2019 championship so as a group we are very motivated and excited about the new opportunity. At the same time the competition is strong, so we need to make sure we bring our best performance to the fight.\n\nS\u00e9bastien Buemi (Driver, car #8):\n\nStarting a new season is very interesting and exciting. We won the manufacturers\u2019 World Championship last year and clearly, we want to build on that to achieve even more. We have worked together as a team to analyse anything that went wrong and improve in many areas to come back stronger than ever. Last year Qatar was not one of our strongest races, so we definitely want to perform better. We want to show from the beginning of the season that we are fighting at the front.\n\nBrendon Hartley (Driver, car #8):\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time and I\u2019ve been looking forward to the start of this season for a while. There are a few unknowns going into Qatar because our competitors will have been working hard over the winter just like us, and there is a new manufacturer to contend with. We want to be competitive from the start and that means having a stronger performance in Qatar than last year, when we were not where we wanted to be. We are ready for the challenges we will face, and we respect our competition, but we are going to give it everything this season to come out on top.",

            "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Toyota Tsusho's (TSE:8015) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.6% over the past three months. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Toyota Tsusho is:\n\n13% = JP\u00a5358b \u00f7 JP\u00a52.8t (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each \u00a51 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made \u00a50.13 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Toyota Tsusho's Earnings Growth And 13% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Toyota Tsusho seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 7.3%. This certainly adds some context to Toyota Tsusho's exceptional 23% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nWe then compared Toyota Tsusho's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 11% in the same 5-year period.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to , relative to its industry.\n\nIs Toyota Tsusho Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nThe three-year median payout ratio for Toyota Tsusho is 25%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 75%. So it seems that Toyota Tsusho is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.\n\nBesides, Toyota Tsusho has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Toyota Tsusho's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

The whole off-season everybody kept telling me the focus was trying to qualify better at superspeedways. That\u2019s something I really struggled at last year. For our 19 group to come here and sit on the pole at the biggest race of the year is pretty special.\u201d\n\nAside from the historical aspect, Toyota\u2019s pole win came on the same night as its official rebrand event and officially introduced motorsports journalists to Toyota Gazoo Racing. For 20 years, the racing division in America has been known as Toyota Racing but the new branding brings it under the global initiative.\n\n\u201cJust kind of a season kickoff,\u201d said Paul Doleshal, General Manager Motorsports and Assets for Toyota Motors North America. \u201cIt\u2019s our first year with Toyota Gazoo Racing in NASCAR. So, we wanted to get an opportunity for whoever wanted to come up with media from the NASCAR media to come out and just hear a little bit about it.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s just getting finally, everything transferred over. We transferred a couple of years ago to Toyota Gazoo Racing North America with NHRA \u2026 For all of our professional racing, we just decided to make the switch. We\u2019ve been monitoring the reception of Toyota Gazoo Racing within North America for about 10 years now. And you know, it started out with different impressions of what the name meant and or what they saw visually when they heard the name and we\u2019ve seen it change and transfer over the last few years, especially to just mean an \u2018exciting a real performance brand.\u2019\u201d\n\nDoleshal said that Toyota has made a significant investment not only in motorsports but in America with over 300,000 employees, numerous factories strategically placed around the country \u2013 one of those being in San Antonio, Texas and another in Georgetown, Kentucky. Those are just two but most recently, Toyota invested $15 billion into a battery plant in Liberty, N.C.\n\nHe said Toyota\u2019s philosophy is to provide drivers with options. For example, Toyota has developed hybrid vehicles for years, first introducing the Prius. That was an addition to their traditional internal combustion vehicles and they also have a hydrogen-powered vehicle in the Mirai.\n\n\u201cI think, as Akio Toyoda has said many times, we should not make the decision for the consumer. We should have options for the consumer to choose from, whatever fits their lifestyle and how they need to use that vehicle and we need to have a breadth of everything. We need to have power for towing trailers. We need to have fuel mileage for the commuter. We need to have a full-bed vehicle for that person who maybe, stays more local. And then you have hydrogen for those that are more cutting edge but want the best of both worlds, a little less range anxiety but they are burning clean with just water coming out of the tailpipe, so that\u2019s just a different approach, right? Rather than dictate to the market, we want the market to dictate to us what they want to drive.\u201d\n\nOf course, Toyota also has a racing simulator, something Doleshal tried out after most of the media had left the event Wednesday night. Racing against team owner and former racecar driver, Sam Hunt, his performance wasn\u2019t quite as good as that of Brisco\u2019s.\n\nPaul Doleshal, General Manager Motorsports and Assets for Toyota Motors North America, is hoping to find an edge at Daytona that he can pass along to his Toyota teams. Photo by Jerry Jordan/Kickin\u2019 the Tires\n\nAsked if Doleshal\u2019s contributions from his SIM time helped a Toyota driver get the pole, Tyler Gibbs, president of Toyota Racin Development, joked that they take data from both of them and file it in the correct receptacle.\n\n\u201cYeah, Paul and I are very similar,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cThe more we get close to the car, the more nervous the engineers get. We just stand back and we praise Paul for what a great job he did, and we immediately threw that in the trash (laughing), as I would expect him to do with me if I was on the SIM.\u201d\n\nGibbs did say that news of Briscoe sitting on the pole for the Daytona 500 did not go unnoticed by corporate leaders back in Japan. He said it was an great way to start the NASCAR season.\n\n\u201cYes, certainly for us, changing branding has been really \u2013 it\u2019s an honor for us,\u201d Gibbs explained. \u201cWhen you look at what GAZOO Racing means across the globe with the WEC (World Endurance Championship) program and the success they\u2019ve had, the WRC (World Rally Championship), the Dakar program; and for us to be part of that family, we\u2019ve always been a part of it from a technical perspective but now to be racing under that banner is really an honor for us and a great call for us.\n\n\u201cTo go out and set our first pole at the Daytona 500 is a great way to start that. A lot of excitement across the company for that. They all understand the Daytona 500, so we\u2019ve got a lot of work still left to do.\u201d",

            "content": "Despite the headwinds, the automotive industry remains on a path of steady growth. MarketsandMarkets\u2019 \u2018Global Automotive Outlook-2025\u2019 projects global light vehicle sales to grow 1.3% in 2025, reaching 85.1 million units. This growth will be fuelled by rising EV and hybrid adoption, advancements in battery technology, and the expansion of autonomous and connected vehicle initiatives. Automakers are also pushing for wider commercialization of self-driving technology, 5G connectivity in vehicles, and digital car sales platforms, shaping the industry\u2019s future. The report further elaborates that China continues to dominate the global automotive market, accounting for over 26 million light vehicle sales in 2024, nearly 50% of the global total. The country also leads EV battery production, manufacturing over 50% of the world\u2019s EV batteries and controlling 75% of key battery components. With a growing number of high-net-worth individuals in Asia-Pacific, the region is expected to drive market expansion in 2025, particularly in premium and EV segments.\n\nFitch Ratings, in a report published in December, assigned a \u2018neutral\u2019 outlook to the industry, expecting 2% growth in global light vehicle sales. Pricing pressure is likely to rise as competition in the EV segment intensifies, while inflation may shift consumer preferences toward more affordable vehicles. That said, they expect interest rate cuts could support stronger vehicle demand, and automakers\u2019 strategic diversification into EVs, autonomous tech, and digital mobility solutions remains a key growth driver.\n\nThe automotive sector is navigating a complex and uncertain landscape, shaped by economic volatility, regulatory shifts, and evolving consumer demand. One of the biggest concerns recently has been the proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, which triggered a strong response from MEMA, a leading vehicle suppliers trade association. MEMA warned that such tariffs could jeopardize thousands of American jobs, raise costs for consumers, and disrupt the highly integrated North American supply chain, which is essential to maintaining U.S. competitiveness in the global auto market. While a temporary agreement to delay these tariffs provides some relief, uncertainty remains, especially as new challenges emerge, including the halt in funding for the U.S. National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. This funding pause could slow the country\u2019s transition to EVs by limiting the expansion of charging networks and reducing incentives for adoption.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Automotive Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) stands against the other automotive stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn an article published on Forbes on January 13, 2025, Sarwant Singh, President and Chief Commercial Officer at MarketsandMarkets, highlighted some predictions made by his team for the automotive industry. One of their predictions is that EV growth will slow down due to specific policy changes making electric cars less affordable for many consumers. To counteract this, the team expects hybrid vehicle sales to increase substantially, as these vehicles combine the efficiency of electric power with the reliability of traditional engines. Additionally, software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where critical functions like steering, braking, and infotainment are managed by software, are projected to experience rapid growth over the next few years.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, the sector presents both risks and opportunities. While macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties persist, the industry\u2019s long-term potential remains strong, making it an attractive space for investment despite near-term risks. On that note, let us explore the 12 best automotive stocks to invest in according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the 12 best automotive stocks to invest in according to analysts, we compiled a list of U.S.-listed companies in the auto manufacturing and auto parts sectors with market capitalizations exceeding $2 billion. While we considered promising companies from both industries, we gave preference to pure-play auto manufacturers. We then ranked these companies based on their potential upside, placing the stock with the highest upside at the top. Additionally, we included the number of hedge funds holding stakes in these companies as of Q3 2024.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of market close on February 14.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWhy Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) is Declining?\n\nWorkers assembling a car in a modern manufacturing plant, emphasizing the company's sense of progress.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)\n\nUpside Potential: 21%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 18\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) is a global automobile manufacturer. It produces a wide range of vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, and trucks, with popular models like the Corolla, Camry, and RAV4. The company pioneered mass-produced hybrid technology with the Prius and continues to expand its electric and hydrogen-powered vehicle lineup, including the Mirai fuel cell car and the bZ4X electric SUV. The company is also investing in autonomous driving, AI, and mobility services.\n\nOn February 5, Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) reported its Q3 FY 2025 results (FY ending March 2025), where it witnessed a 4% year-over-year (YoY) decline in global vehicle unit sales for the first nine months of FY 2025. Japan unit sales were down over 10% whereas overseas units were down 2.1%. Despite this, total sales increased around 5%. Moreover, profit also increased due to ongoing cost-saving initiatives and improvement in product competitiveness which are supporting earnings. As per Statista, Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) had 10.7% global automobile market share in 2024 and thus holds the top position globally. The company continues to solidify its position as the global leader in the automotive industry, leveraging its diversified powertrain strategy, including hybrid, electric (EV), hydrogen fuel cell, and internal combustion vehicles.\n\nOn February 6, Macquarie analyst upgraded Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) from Neutral to Outperform. The analyst anticipated the company would report weaker earnings due to a slower-than-expected volume recovery. However, they also projected that Toyota's production would stabilize, resulting in less exciting earnings, but improved quarters ahead.\n\nOverall TM ranks 10th on our list of the best automotive stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of TM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nToday I was surfing the Toyota Tundra Nation group on Facebook and read a very interesting post by Aaron Polakiewicz, who writes the following:\n\n\u201cI have a 2021 Toyota Tundra with 31,000 miles. I've had the truck since new and keep up with oil changes every 5k. This oil change chain I just left told me I had sludge built up and offered to flush it for another $50. How likely is this to be true? I never had build-up issues. Toyota says 10K is fine with full synthetic but I don't go with that. The tech showed me oil on the dip stick not actual drained oil. My gut was telling me that he was trying to bs me and possibly put something else on the stick,\u201d Aaron writes.\n\nAaron\u2019s story is an example of why it pays to be informed and skeptical when visiting quick-lube shops. His maintenance history doesn\u2019t align with the claim of sludge buildup, and many experienced Tundra owners agree that this was likely just a sales pitch. While engine sludge is a real issue for neglected engines, a properly maintained Tundra should not have this problem at just 31,000 miles.\n\nWhy Engine Sludge Shouldn\u2019t Be an Issue at 31,000 Miles\n\nMany group members chimed in, questioning the legitimacy of the shop\u2019s claim. Steve Doucharm pointed out, \u201cUnless you're using coal tar in your engine it'd be virtually impossible to get sludge with those oil change intervals.\u201d This sentiment was echoed by Justin Prescott, who quipped, \u201cThey really wanna charge 50 bucks to pour 2 quarts extra.\u201d\n\nOther members had more cautious takes. Devin Fitzgerald noted that if cheap-quality oil was used, sludge could develop, though he found it unlikely at such low mileage. His advice? \u201cStop taking it to them and either DIY or find a legit shop.\u201d\n\nEarl Copeland backed this up with his own experience: \u201cI have 267,000 with synthetic oils, oil done every 5-7K average, all good, no flushes. They are probably trying to upsell you.\u201d\n\nThe Dangers of Quick-Lube Shops and Questionable Upsells\n\nMany truck owners remain wary of quick-lube chains, and for good reason. Tim Bradford, a top contributor in the group, strongly advised, \u201cDo yourself and your truck a favor and NEVER take it to an oil change chain. You'll sleep better at night knowing those guys aren\u2019t on your floor mats.\u201d\n\nRobert Collins also weighed in, sharing a similar experience his son had at a dealership: \u201cThose places will tell all kinds of lies to sucker people into spending more money. My son had his Mazda CX-5 at the dealer for a minor warranty repair. A guy from the shop came in, showed him a small vial of very black oil, and asked if he wanted them to change his oil \u2018because it was very old and dirty.\u2019 He told the guy he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about because he had just changed his oil the previous day.\u201d\n\nStories like these highlight why being an informed vehicle owner is essential. Scams and unnecessary upsells are far too common in the industry, and trusting the wrong shop can cost you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars over time.\n\nCan You Trust Your Car\u2019s Oil Life Monitor?\n\nOne of the biggest concerns with modern vehicle maintenance is the reliance on automated systems to determine when an oil change is needed. Many car owners trust their oil life monitor feature without question, but how reliable is it really? If you want to understand whether you can trust your car\u2019s oil life monitor feature and whether it might be leading you astray, check out this in-depth analysis on oil life monitors.\n\nBeware of Car Oil Change Maintenance Disasters\n\nMoreover, quick-lube shops are notorious for attempting to upsell customers with unnecessary services, and sometimes these extra services can do more harm than good. Some owners have even experienced catastrophic failures due to poor-quality oil changes performed by undertrained technicians. You don\u2019t want to end up with a car oil change maintenance disaster, so before you let a shop talk you into extra services, it\u2019s worth reading this guide on avoiding oil change mishaps.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Trust Your Gut and Find a Reputable Shop\n\nFor Toyota Tundra owners in particular, keeping up with oil changes and using high-quality oil is essential for longevity. However, knowing where to take your truck for service is just as important. Whether you prefer to do it yourself or take it to a trusted mechanic, avoiding shady quick-lube chains could save you a lot of unnecessary stress and expenses in the long run.\n\nThe takeaway? Stick to reputable service centers, ask for evidence before agreeing to extra services, and most importantly, trust your gut. If something sounds fishy, it probably is.\n\nArmen Hareyan is the founder and the Editor in Chief of Torque News.

But that only applies to certain models, such as this TRD Off-Road, that have the standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine and no third row. If you get the optional third row, space drops to 44.8 cubic feet. If you get a trim level with the i-Force Max hybrid powertrain that can't be paired with the third row, it goes down further to 42.6 cubic feet. Now, remember that the outgoing 4Runner's cargo capacity could be reduced by its own optional third row (43.3 cubes) as well as a handy sliding cargo floor (46.3 cubes). My cargo test of the previous generation had this sliding floor \u2014 I'd love to know if 4Runner owners will miss it.\n\nAnyway, that previous cargo test was Exhibit A for why I don't usually do cargo tests on two-row midsize SUVs. In short, I run out of luggage and must turn to random stuff, which diminishes whatever scientific element these tests have.

            "content": "With sleek design and 44 combined mpg, the new 2025 Toyota Camry now comes standard as a hybrid.\n\nAndy Stonehouse/Courtesy photo\n\nOver the last few months, I\u2019ve driven a variety of Toyota automobiles, with some featuring updates that are more substantial than others. Here\u2019s the rundown, while we wait for a new 4Runner or something more mountain-friendly that you\u2019ll probably find more appropriate.\n\nThe most changed model I sampled was the 2025 Camry, which has now become a hybrid-only vehicle and is one of three hybrids I\u2019ll touch on here. The good news is that Camry\u2019s fifth-generation, 2.5-liter hybrid setup produces at least 44 mpg anywhere, city or highway, and while the system is rated for only 232 horsepower, it feels like it has 100 more than that at all times.\n\nThe XSE trim that I drove, priced at about $44,000, was also equipped with all-wheel drive, though Camry\u2019s low and sleek shape does not exactly set it up for deep snow days. This XSE model was outfitted with a red leather interior, aluminum pedals, 19-inch wheels and sport tuning that made it look and feel very much like an F-Sport Lexus, complete with dual 12.3-inch screens.\n\nThe same can be said for the Nightshade trim of the still-unusual 2025 Toyota Crown that I also drove, priced a little more steeply at $50,000. Unlike the more powerful model I last drove a year and a half ago, the blacked-out Nightshade edition comes with Crown\u2019s standard 236-horsepower hybrid powertrain but gets a better combined 41 city/highway mpg, and still has electronic, on-demand AWD.\n\nCompared to that 340-hp, 30-mpg Hybrid Max version, which packs 400 lb-ft of torque thanks to an extra rear electric motor, the more simple Crown is not quite as instantly powerful, though it can still be pushed hard to keep up with Front Range freeway traffic.\n\nThe Crown remains a very distinctive, family oriented vehicle, with a tall roofline. On a closer inspection, its overall proportions and passenger room are nearly identical to Camry, and it\u2019s heavier as well, which doesn\u2019t help with its fleet-footedness.\n\nThe purest hybrid of this bunch is still the much-improved 2025 Toyota Prius, as we also had a chance to drive its more versatile Prime edition. That\u2019s the plug-in hybrid variant, priced at about $34,000 for a front-wheel-drive SE trim.\n\nHere, the 2.0-liter hybrid system produces only 220 horsepower, but the Prius\u2019s scale and size puts that to more speedy use than even the standard models. The plug-in aspect gives the Prius as much as 44 miles of all-electric range, and the combined system produces an impressive 127 electronic mpg, or still 52 mpg using just the gasoline-powered engine. The XSE Premium even includes solar panels to help passively recharge the car.\n\nYes, it\u2019s not quite the family friendly size you\u2019ll find on Camry or Crown, but comfortable and adaptable enough. The car\u2019s much-improved looks, here done up in a solid dark blue, actually made it look a bit like a scaled-down Lucid Air or a Tesla something-or-other; the cockpit is still a funky mess and it\u2019s necessary to drop the steering wheel into your lap if you want to see Prius\u2019s odd array of instruments.\n\nLastly, and probably the least likely to be seen in a Summit County snowstorm, is the 2025 Toyota GR Corolla\u2019s Premium Plus edition, retail priced at about $48,000, minus delivery charges. It\u2019s curiously the most powerful of this bunch, with a tiny 1.6-liter three-cylinder turbocharged to a screaming 300 horsepower and an increased 295 lb-ft of torque.\n\nThe GR Corolla bears zero resemblance to the civilian Corolla and is instead a totally dedicated racing machine, with a permanent all-wheel-drive system that would make it a fantastic ice-racing machine in Georgetown, with some crazy studded winter tires.\n\nI had ultra-slick summer tires on mine last fall and the car absolutely and relentlessly goes like hell, with further updates to its suspension and even a launch control system. The biggest change for 2025 is a new eight-speed automatic transmission. While I appreciated the six-speed manual on the model I previously drove, I tended to keep the GR Corolla in third gear at all times rather than use the heavy clutch every three seconds; the automatic transmission allows you to use the undersized paddles to do the same and instead concentrate entirely on high-speed cornering and emptying the tank in less than an hour. Mission accomplished.\n\nAndy Stonehouse\u2019s column \u201cMountain Wheels\u201d publishes Saturdays in the Summit Daily News.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) stands against the other Japanese stocks.\n\nAs the dangers of natural disasters increase and the expenses of social security continue to rise, the International Monetary Fund says Japan has to take quick action to strengthen its fiscal situation. The IMF's warning comes as Japan increases spending to meet a wide range of requirements, from initiatives to improve the birth rate to strengthening national security. This occurs concurrently with its borrowing costs gradually increasing due to rate rises by the Bank of Japan in the past year. Japan already has the highest amount of public debt of any major country. According to a Finance Ministry estimate released this January, the nation's debt payment expenses are expected to increase by 25% by fiscal year 2028 compared to the previous year, assuming a 3% annual economic growth rate and 2% inflation. Overall, the IMF forecasts that Japan's public debt will be 232.7% of GDP this year. In addition, at its January 24 meeting, the Bank of Japan voted to boost interest rates to 0.50%, the highest level in seventeen years. The current approach comes after decades of the BOJ's efforts to normalize interest rates. Despite the increasing balance sheet risk, the bank may be pushed to hike interest rates further if it observes a \"virtuous cycle\" of rising prices and rising wages, with board member Naoki Tamura stating that raising short-term interest rates to \"at least around 1%\" by the second half of fiscal year 2025 is \"necessary\".\n\nAccording to a Statistics Bureau of Japan estimate, average household expenditure in Japan in December was 352,633 yen ($2,332), up 7% in nominal terms from the previous year. In addition, Reuters revealed that Japanese household spending rose year-over-year in December 2024 for the first time in five months, and at a far faster rate than expected. However, the Japanese government notes that it was premature to call a bottoming out in the decreasing trend in consumption. Consumer expenditure also grew 2.7% in the same month compared to the previous year, above the median market forecast of 0.5% growth.\n\nJapan-U.S. Summit Meeting\n\nThe current environment around Japanese markets is one of concern and relief, especially after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump's threats to impose retaliatory tariffs on \"everyone\" have served as a harsh reminder of the dangers that all of America's trading partners, including Japan, face. With Trump aiming to reduce his country's trade imbalance with Japan, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to purchase more American LNG and disclosed plans for manufacturers such as Toyota and Isuzu Motors to invest more in the United States at their summit meeting on February 7. Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier in Singapore, had the following to say about the meeting:",

Toyota sold just shy of 20,000 of them last year. My test vehicle is the top-range Platinum trim that adds a few new goodies this year: a Head-Up Display, powered tilt and telescopic steering wheel, Dynamic Rear Steering, and hands-free power trunk.\n\nExterior\n\nWith its fastback shape, the Crown's bold design is so different from the rest of Toyota's sedan lineup that its Toyota badging is likely to be a surprise. My test vehicle's exclusive-to-the- Platinum Bronze Age and Black two-tone exterior paint is rather striking paired with 21-inch 10-spoke machined alloy wheels.\n\nThe Platinum's large black grille is flanked by slim Quad-LED low and high beam headlights. Other grade features include heated, power-folding outside mirrors with puddle lights.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Crown's 340-horsepower HYBRID MAX powertrain is a highlight. Available only on Platinum, the system pairs Toyota's hybrid system with a 2.4-liter turbocharged engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. Acceleration is really impressive - as is the 400 pound-feet of torque. All-wheel drive is standard.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Crown's mostly black interior is nice, but it's not the most exciting cabin ever. It did gain some upgrades in 2024, but I'm still looking for a bit more interest. Though I have to say the white contrast stitching and piping on the 8-way power leather-trimmed front seats is well-done. The front seats, both three-level heated and ventilated, are comfortable with cushiony side bolsters. A nicely heated, leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with paddle shifters thanks to the Platinum-only Hybrid max powertrain.\n\nCabin technology is great in the Crown which features two 12.3-inch screens. One is for the digital driver display, and wow are the graphics terrific. The other 12.3-inch screen is for the very responsive multimedia touchscreen, which runs the terrific Toyota Audio Multimedia system. Both the graphics and map quality are great. The system is compatible with Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and can receive over-the-air updates. Toyota's 'Hey Toyota' Intelligent Assistant is well-done, too. It helps you control things like heated seats using voice command. The Platinum is also equipped with a Panoramic View Monitor and 11-speaker JBL audio system.\n\nThere's no learning curve for the traditional non-haptic dual-zone climate controls on the center stack. A slim glossy black-trimmed center console integrates the gear shift, vertical smartphone charger, brake auto hold, the parking assist feature, and two USB-C ports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second row is a tale of two stories. Great on legroom but not so great on headroom due to its sloped roof design and stadium seating. It's not overall very practical. The middle seat is also an issue for those over 5'5\" inches tall. Passengers enjoy heated seats, A/C vents, 2 USB-C ports and a cushiony drop down armrest with cupholders. While there's not a lot of window real estate back here due to tall door panels, a large fixed panoramic glass roof lightens up the interior.\n\nThe Crown isn't short on cargo space. It's also easy to access with a new for 2025 power liftgate with kick sensor. An optional logo'd cargo mat gives it the cargo area an upscale appeal.\n\nOther Platinum standard features include in-cabin LED lighting, and rain sensing variable wipers.\n\nRide and Drive\n\nThe Crown's enjoyable ride and drive gets even better for 2025 thanks to Dynamic Rear Steering which improves handling. Overall, the ride is more crossover than sedan like due to its height (it has 3-inches of ground clearance over the Camry).\n\nThere is plenty of power and standard Adaptive Variable Suspension helps deliver a smooth and comfortable ride. Six drive modes include: NORMAL, ECO, SPORT, SPORT+, COMFORT or CUSTOM. Sport+ delivers the most engaging ride with the most responsive steering feel. For longer road trips, I'd opt for Comfort or Normal for their easy-going driving manners.\n\nSafety\n\nThe lineup is equipped with standard Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 which includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist, Lane Tracing Assist, Road Sign Assist, Automatic High Beams and Proactive Driving Assist. Blind Spot Monitor, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Rear Seat Reminder are also standard. In 2024, the Platinum added standard Traffic Jam Assist, Lane Change Assist.\n\nThe Platinum is the only grade with Toyota\u2019s Advanced Park system and a new for 2025 color Head Up display.\n\nOptions\n\nOptions include the premium paint ($425) and two-tone paint ($550) along with mudguards ($155), illuminated door sills ($345), side puddle lamp ($165), Key glove ($20), wheel locks ($105) and a Carpet mat package ($319).\n\nWhat You'll Pay\n\nI have to admit to a bit of sticker shock with this one. The Crown Platinum gets more expensive for 2025 - closing in on a Lexus-like $60K. The 2025 starts almost $2000 ($1,920) higher than the 2024 version, but okay, it does also get a few more standard goodies. This 2025 model also has more options than the one I reviewed last year, bringing the total MSRP to $58,169 - roughly $3K ($2,720) over the 2024's $55,449 sticker price.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Toyota Crown is a distinct vehicle with some really wonderful features including a fantastic powertrain that doesn't sacrifice fuel economy for power, wonderful driving dynamics and great in-cabin technology. As with the 2024, I'd still like to see more cabin upgrades to match the price point - though the soft-touch seat backs are worth noting.\n\nWhat I liked most: Power, smooth acceleration, cabin tech.\n\nWhat I would change: I\u2019d like to see more cabin upgrades.\n\nMSRP : Base price $54,990. As equipped $58,169 with transportation.\n\nFuel Economy: 29 city/32 highway/30 combined.\n\nOdometer reading when tested : 2,260 miles.\n\nOfficial Color: Bronze Age ($425) + Bi-Tone Paint ($550).\n\nWeight: 4,343 pound.\n\nLength-Width-Height: 196.1\" long/72.4\" wide/60.6\" high.\n\nFuel Tank Capacity: 14.5 gallons with filler on the passenger side.\n\nTowing Capacity: N/A.\n\nSpare Tire: Compact spare.\n\nFinal Assembly Point: Aichi, Japan.\n\n2025 Crown Platinum in a few words: A stylish crossover-styled sedan with great driving dynamics and technology.\n\nWarranty: 3-year/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper, 5-year/60,000 mile power train warranty, 8-year/100,000 mile hybrid warranty, 2 years free maintenance.\n\nManufacturer\u2019s website: Toyota\n\nClick on Right Arrow to Scroll.

            "content": "Minivans handle three-row family duty better than SUVs in almost all aspects. They may not tow as much or look as butch, but they\u2019re roomier, comfier, more flexible, and mostly more fuel efficient. Half of the four minivans on sale now offer all-wheel drive, and all but one new minivans come with a hybrid option.\n\nThe refreshed 2025 Honda Odyssey doesn\u2019t offer either. It\u2019s front-wheel drive only and it still rolls with a 3.5-liter V-6 that gets 22 mpg combined. Yet, it\u2019s still a great take on the minivan. As is the 2025 Toyota Sienna. It comes with front- or all-wheel drive, and gets up to an EPA-rated 36 mpg combined.\n\nBoth have much to offer, from features to safety tech. In the end, which one wins? Here\u2019s how we sort it out.\n\nHonda Odyssey vs. Toyota Sienna price and features\n\nHonda pared down the Odyssey lineup to EX-L, Sport-L, Touring, and Elite, priced from $43,315 to $52,275\n\nToyota Sienna hybrid ranges from $40,635 to $58,355 (all prices include destination)\n\nOur picks: Honda Odyssey EX-L and Sienna XLE\n\nWhich Toyota Sienna should I buy?\n\nA standard hybrid, the Toyota Sienna comes with several trim options, including LE, XLE, XLE Woodland, XSE, Limited, and Platinum. All-wheel drive costs $2,000 extra on all but the XLE Woodland, where it comes standard. Shoppers who need an eight-passenger layout should keep in mind that only the LE and front-wheel-drive XLE have that option.\n\nThe standard Sienna LE costs $40,635, including the $1,450 destination fee. It has the expected modern minivan basics, power sliding doors, a raft of safety technology, and a 9.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Step up to the Sienna XLE for a few thousand more, and you\u2019ll get a sunroof and synthetic leather upholstery. The fancy Sienna Limited adds in leather upholstery, JBL audio, navigation, and an in-car intercom for the driver to connect with passengers in the rear. A Sienna Platinum with all-wheel drive runs more than $58,000.\n\nWhich Honda Odyssey should I buy?\n\nThe Odyssey only comes in four well-equipped trims, but none of them are cheap, especially compared to the Sienna hybrid. The EX-L costs $43,315 with the mandatory $1,395 destination charge, and it includes a 7.0-inch instrument cluster juxtaposing a digital display with an analog speedometer, a 9.0-inch touchscreen with wireless smartphone connectivity and a wireless device charger. That\u2019s a good Odyssey.\n\nThe $44,465 Sport-L goes dark with black exterior trim pieces like so many SUVs and black leather upholstery with red contrast stitching, while the top Elite luxuriates in two-tone perforated leather upholstery, cooled front seats, a heated steering wheel, and a hands-free power tailgate among other upgrades for $52,275.\n\nAdvantage : Toyota Sienna, at the dealer and at home with a lower expected cost of ownership.\n\n2025 Honda Odyssey 2025 Honda Odyssey 2025 Honda Odyssey 2025 Honda Odyssey\n\nHonda Odyssey vs. Toyota Sienna performance, engine, towing\n\nOdyssey has a 3.5-liter V-6 rated at 280 hp, 262 lb-ft of torque; it has a 10-speed automatic and front-wheel drive only\n\nSienna combines a 245-hp 4-cylinder gas engine and either a pair or trio of electric motors, for front- or all-wheel drive\n\nHonda has a comfier ride, but Sienna handles with more agility\n\nBoth minivans can tow up to 3,500 pounds\n\nIs the Honda Odyssey 4WD?\n\nNo, it\u2019s only available with front-wheel drive.\n\nAll Odysseys come with a 280-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 paired to a 10-speed automatic. The combination hustles the portly people mover in an eager way, though the 10-speed automatic transmission can dither at low speeds when it\u2019s asked to shift quickly. Honda\u2019s independent suspension design does a superb job of muting the road and delivering a smooth ride, while it leans into corners.\n\nIs the Toyota Sienna 4WD?\n\nWoodland models turn the standard front-wheel-drive setup into all-wheel drive, otherwise it\u2019s a $2,000 option. With it, a third electric motor sends power to the rear wheels independently from the engine and front wheels. Toyota\u2019s hybrid setup here combines a 4-cylinder with two motors and a small battery pack to net 245 hp. It works better at low speeds, where it delivers good torque for stoplight launches, but that tapers off as speeds rise. The drivetrain isn't as smooth nor quite as strong as that in the Honda, but Toyota\u2019s suspension settles into corners better, and tracks well down the highway. The tradeoff\u2019s slight\u2014but the eye-popping difference in fuel economy is not.\n\nAdvantage: Honda Odyssey.\n\nHonda Odyssey vs. Toyota Sienna fuel economy\n\nThe Sienna earns 36 mpg combined with FWD or 35 mpg combined with AWD\n\nHonda Odyssey checks in at 22 mpg combined with FWD\n\nOdyssey is the only minivan without a hybrid option\n\nThe Toyota Sienna scores with its stock hybrid powertrain. With front-wheel drive, the EPA scores it at 36 mpg combined, and it still gets 35 mpg combined with all-wheel drive.\n\nHonda\u2019s Odyssey drains the tank at a rate of 19 mpg city, 28 highway, 22 combined. It\u2019s the only minivan without a hybrid option, including the Chrysler Pacifica and Kia Carnival.\n\nAdvantage: The Toyota Sienna.\n\n2025 Honda Odyssey\n\nToyota Sienna vs. Honda Odyssey interior and cargo space\n\nNeither has a fold-away second-row seat\n\nBoth have fold-away third-row seats\n\nHonda\u2019s middle row can be removed; Toyota\u2019s can\u2019t\n\nNeither of these minivans has the ultimate flexibility of the Chrysler Pacifica. Instead, they flip and fold second- and third-row seats out of the way to boost space for cargo or people, without tucking those seats into the floor.\n\n2025 Honda Odyssey\n\nHow much room is there in the Honda Odyssey?\n\nIn the Odyssey, Honda creates a great space for a driver and front passenger, surrounding them with storage for small items. Power front seats that are heated come standard. Eight people can sit in the standard minivan\u2014or seven, when the flip-out second-row middle seat is removed. When that\u2019s done, the outboard seats can push together for easier back-row access, or remain apart to create an aisle down the middle of the vehicle. Those captain\u2019s chairs can be removed, or they also slide back and forth, to flex the space available to the third-row seat, which has 38.1 inches of legroom\u2014enough in our experience for full-size passengers to feel comfortable.\n\nThe Odyssey has at least 33 cubic feet of space behind the third row; when it\u2019s folded down, it offers up 88.6 cubic feet of space. By removing the middle seats and folding down those in the rear, the Odyssey can handle up to 144.9 cubic feet of cargo. No car-based SUV can match that.\n\nHow much room is there in the Toyota Sienna?\n\nThe Sienna\u2019s no slouch, either. It has seats for up to eight people, too\u2014and all models get a power driver seat, and a useful storage shelf across the passenger side of the front seat. It has a two-tiered center console for deep storage, too. Leather\u2019s an option, if fancy minivans are your gig.\n\nThe second-row Sienna seats act more like airline-style thrones. With up to 25 inches of back-and-forth slide to them, as well as footrests on top-end models, the Sienna can accommodate two people in the second row in much higher regard, with more legroom as well. The tradeoff? The Sienna\u2019s middle seats can\u2019t be removed. Toyota\u2019s solution: allow the seat bottoms to flip up, so that the middle seats fold up against the front seat backs. Slide those middle seats forward and it\u2019s easier to access the third row, which tucks into the floor when not in use. In all, with the second and third rows pushed out of the way as best as possible, the Sienna can carry up to about 101 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nAdvantage : The Honda Odyssey .\n\nIIHS minivan crash-test results\n\nHonda Odyssey vs. Toyota Sienna safety\n\nBoth have standard automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and adaptive cruise control\n\nToyota offers a surround-view camera system\n\nBoth minivans earn an IIHS Top Safety Pick\n\nBoth vehicles come with standard automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, active lane control, automatic high beams, blind-spot monitors, and adaptive cruise control. A surround-view camera system\u2019s an option on the Sienna, but not on the Honda, though Honda has a camera that lets parents keep an eye on the third-row seat. Toyota offers a head-up display and a rear camera mirror for a better rearward view of the road.\n\nThose features appeal to different buyers in different ways, but crash-test scores come down in Toyota\u2019s favor. Both vehicles earn the IIHS\u2019 Top Safety Pick rating, as well as a five-star NHTSA rating, but the Odyssey didn\u2019t perform as well in front impact tests.\n\nAdvantage: Toyota does better in crash tests.\n\n2025 Honda Odyssey\n\nHonda Odyssey vs. Toyota Sienna design\n\nBoth vans mimic styling cues of their SUV siblings\n\nSienna has a more sophisticated interior\n\nHonda\u2019s lightning bolt has struck, and faded\n\nMinivans don\u2019t need to be styling leaders, but with the Chrysler Pacifica and Kia Carnival in the game, the Odyssey and the Sienna both need to pick up theirs.\n\nThe Sienna sports some of the bulky fenders of the related Toyota Highlander\u2014and for now, it works. The flares and tall grille give it some character that had been missing for a long time, though some editors refer to the front end in terms of cheese-grating tools. The interior\u2019s more cleanly composed and more friendly to use than in previous Siennas, too, though the most expensive models don\u2019t really look it.\n\nThe Odyssey\u2019s overdue for a redesign, as its last major makeover came in 2018. The big SUV-like streaks of black trim that divide its side glass have come and gone as a styling cue, though the Honda\u2019s front end looks significantly more trim and car-like than that on the Sienna. Clever storage abounds, but it\u2019s surrounded by a lot of metallic or glossy plastic trim. Honda\u2019s latest Pilot and CR-V SUVs do a fantastic job of answering the same user needs\u2014and looking more fashionable at the same time.\n\nAdvantage: Draw. The Sienna has the nicer interior, but neither appeal as much as the Kia Carnival or Chrysler Pacifica.\n\n2024 Toyota Sienna\n\nToyota Sienna vs. Honda Odyssey: Which one is the better minivan?\n\nThe Honda Odyssey scores a TCC Rating of 6.3 out of 10 compared to a 6.7 out of 10 for the Sienna. Honda gets the nod for driving dynamics, interior space, and as well as ride quality, but Toyota\u2019s Sienna fuel economy far outpaces that of the Odyssey. That makes almost all the difference here.\n\nThe Winner: The Toyota Sienna.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Toyota's latest hydrogen fuel cell system promises lower costs and more range.\n\nThe company said the third-generation system offers diesel-like levels of durability.\n\nToyota sold a total of 1,778 hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) globally last year. To make matters worse, last year\u2019s performance was down a whopping 55.8% compared to 2023, so you\u2019d think the Japanese automaker\u2019s foray into hydrogen propulsion would come to an end.\n\nBut no. For better or worse, Toyota is pushing ahead with the development of hydrogen powertrains, and it just revealed its third-generation fuel cell system as part of its \u201ccontinued efforts toward the realization of a hydrogen society.\u201d\n\nAccording to the auto giant, the third-gen FC System is smaller, lighter, more dependable and more efficient than its predecessor. Toyota said the system is up to two times more durable than before with dependability comparable to diesel engines, but with the added benefit of a maintenance-free design.\n\nFuel efficiency has also been improved. Toyota claims passenger vehicles fitted with the new system can drive 20% further than before. For reference, the Toyota Mirai FCEV has a manufacturer-estimated maximum driving range of 402 miles, if you can find a filling station. With the new fuel cell, it could theoretically drive up to 480 miles on a full tank.\n\nLastly, the company claims the third-gen FC System is much cheaper to manufacture, thanks to innovations in cell design and manufacturing processes. That should translate into lower starting prices for vehicles and stationary equipment powered by hydrogen.\n\nGallery: Toyota Third-Generation Fuel Cell System (3rd Gen FC System) 4 Toyota\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that despite the low sales of passenger FCEVs, Toyota has plenty of hydrogen applications in the commercial world. Its fuel cell system powers stationary generators, train locomotives, big rigs and construction equipment. Despite the limited availability of refueling stations for the general public, hydrogen can be a suitable solution for job sites where combustion engines and EVs just aren't viable. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and equipment don\u2019t emit any harmful gasses into the atmosphere, so they can be used in sensitive environments.\n\nToyota said its latest-generation hydrogen fuel cell system will be unveiled next week at the International Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Expo in Tokyo, Japan. The first commercial applications are expected to be implemented in Japan, Europe, North America and China after 2026 at the earliest.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Toyota is one of their biggest proponents and the company has released the first details about their third-generation fuel cell system.\n\nSet to be unveiled at the International Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Expo in Tokyo on February 19, the company\u2019s third-generation fuel cell system promises to be a major step forward. The automaker is also promising \u201csignificant cost\u201d reductions thanks to \u201cinnovations in cell design and manufacturing processes.\u201d\n\nMore: BMW And Toyota Expand Their Partnership To Save Hydrogen Cars\n\nBesides being more affordable, Toyota\u2019s latest fuel cell system promises to be up to twice as durable. In fact, the company says their third-generation system has durability comparable to a diesel engine.\n\nEngineers also focused on improving fuel efficiency and this results in a 20% increase in \u201ccruising range.\u201d While the current Mirai can travel 402 miles (647 km) between stops, hydrogen prices in California skyrocketed to record highs last year. This means any increase in fuel efficiency would be a welcome development.\n\nWe\u2019ll likely learn more next week, but Toyota said the third-generation fuel cell system can be installed in passenger cars, commercial vehicles, ships, trains, and stationary generators. It\u2019s slated to arrive after 2026 and will be offered in North America, Europe, China, and Japan.\n\nSince the Mirai was launched in 2014, Toyota has sold approximately 28,000 units globally. The company\u2019s fuel cell system has also been used in over 2,700 other applications ranging from buses to generators.",

            "content": "Toyota led the way in introducing gas-electric hybrid technology to the U.S. market more than two decades ago.\n\nFrom the boxy and upright early version of the Prius to a current lineup that includes the mighty Hybrid-Max Tundra full-size pickup, the Japanese auto giant effectively offers a fuel-efficient hybrid vehicle for nearly every taste and need.\n\nOne of the most recent arrivals to Toyota\u2019s showrooms is the Crown sedan. Sporting a slick and aerodynamic profile, upscale cabin brimming with tech features, and nearly luxury-level ride quality, it certainly fulfills its four-door duties. Meanwhile, a standard all-wheel drive system and elevated 5.8-inch ground clearance appeals to buyers who also might be considering a sport-utility vehicle or crossover.\n\nIn a sense, then, the Crown is a hybrid vehicle in more ways than one.\n\nIntroduced in the 2024 model year, the Crown entered its sophomore year largely unchanged save for the addition of a dark-tinted Nightshade trim level and the addition of heated and ventilated seats for all trims.\n\nThree of the trim levels \u2014 XLE, Limited and Nightshade \u2014 are powered by a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated inline-four that\u2019s mated to three electric motors. Total output is rated at 236 horsepower. Top-of-the-line Platinum-trimmed models get the company\u2019s more potent Hybrid-Max system that pairs a turbocharged 2.4-liter inline-four with two electric motors for a total of 340 horses.\n\nAll models are equipped with a rechargeable nickel-metal hydride battery pack and continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nPrices start at $41,400 for entry-level XLE-trimmed samples and climb to $54,990 for those in Platinum trim. Even in its simplest form, the Crown sports a long list of standard kit, including 19-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, a wireless phone-charging pad, a 12.3-inch infotainment touch screen, digital gauge cluster, heated steering wheel and more.\n\nRegardless of trim, every Crown is equipped with a battery of safety-sensing tech, including forward-collision warning, smart cruise, blind-spot warning and lane-keeping assist.\n\nOur tester came dressed in Nightshade duds, and as such featured a trim-specific, dark-gray/blue \u201cStorm Cloud\u201d paint job, set of black-matte 21-inch alloy wheels, and just about everything in Toyota\u2019s goodie bag save for the Hybrid-Max drivetrain. Included in the $48,765 base MSRP were leather upholstery, an 11-speaker JBL sound system, heated rear seats, dark window treatments, a panoramic powered sunroof, LED headlights and so forth.\n\nFactoring in a couple of three-figure charges for carpeted floor mats and side ground lamps along with the $1,095 delivery tab, the bottom line rose to a near-premium $50,344.\n\nThat\u2019s a Lexus-level pile of cash to pay for a four-door wearing a nonpremium badge on its grille, but the Crown gamely made its case with a supremely smooth and comfortable ride quality worthy of Toyota\u2019s premium division. The hybrid system felt more than stout enough for any highway merging or passing maneuvers.\n\nIn keeping with the trim\u2019s handle, the cabin\u2019s black-on-black palette, strips of bright aluminum-tinted accents, and prominent digital gauge cluster and infotainment display project an upmarket air of cool. Controls are thoughtfully arranged, although it took a day or so to familiarize ourselves with the row of small climate-control buttons located low on the center stack. The automatic transmission\u2019s low-set toggle shifter made for easy access to the conveniently located phone-charging pad.\n\nThe Crown\u2019s handling can\u2019t exactly be called sporting, but it\u2019s precise and nimble enough to make daily errand runs pleasant affairs. The only kvetch concerned the droning four-cylinder engine buzz during acceleration, a familiar condition in CVT-equipped hybrid vehicles.\n\nAdults will find plenty of head- and legroom in the front seats. The 60/40 split-folding rear bench should keep most folks happy for medium-longish trips. The 15.2-cubic-foot trunk is the equal of its corporate sibling, the Camry. Properly equipped, the 2025 Crown is rated to tow up to 2,700 pounds.\n\n2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade\n\nVehicle type: Four-door, five-passenger midsize hybrid AWD sedan.\n\nEngine and transmission: 2.5-liter naturally aspirated inline-four mated to three electric motors and rechargeable nickel-metal hydride battery pack (236 horsepower combined output), continuously variable transmission.\n\nBase/as-tested prices: $48,765/$50,344\n\nEPA estimates: 42 mpg city, 41 mpg highway, 41 mpg combined\n\nThe good: Smooth and quiet cruiser on the highway or around town; frugal gas-electric hybrid system delivers decent acceleration; standard all-wheel-drive and elevated ground clearance for when the going gets snowy; sleek exterior design; nimble-enough handling; roomy and well-organized cabin with plenty of standard tech features; ample rear cargo volume for a four-door.\n\nThe bad: Premium-level price for a mainstream badge; four-cylinder engine drone under hard acceleration.\n\nBottom line: A worthwhile alternative for buyers looking for a blend of sedan and crossover.",

You can\u2019t say or write anything remotely contentious without getting metaphorically duffed up \u2013 I should know. OEMs constantly get it in the neck for ignoring enthusiast demands and getting on with the business of building cars they know (or hope) will sell to normal customers. \u2018If only this car came equipped with x, y and z it would sell thousands more!\u2019 Or the classic \u201cI would have bought one of those but it costs $10k too much!\u201d And then there is the old \u201cI was interested in getting that car but twenty years ago the OEM let a minor defect get out which was blown out of all proportion on the forums so I\u2019ll never buy one their cars again.\u201d\n\nThis fickle attitude manifested in the return of a much storied and much loved nameplate: The Toyota Supra. At first the A90 was decried for containing too much Munich seasoning. Eventually it gained a manual transmission and a cheaper two liter model and it still struggled to sell more than 6 thousand units a year worldwide. Oh yeah, it was too expensive! Back in 1993 the inflation adjusted price of an A80 turbo was getting on for $86k \u2013 they were never the accessible rear wheel drive everyday coupe that exists solely in enthusiasts\u2019 minds. Now the A90 is dead. Twenty years hence people wearing a faded tee shirt with a stick shift graphic on it will be bemoaning the death of cars like this even though they didn\u2019t buy any at the time. Catering to these entitled babies-on-wheels is a tricky business, because like me they are never happy.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following along with this series for a bit you\u2019ll know it\u2019s not just about what\u2019s good and why or what\u2019s bad and why, but what examining a car\u2019s design context and history can teach us (or rather you because obviously I know it all already). It affords me the opportunity to talk about other aspects of car design and conception beyond just the drawing pretty pictures-part that some online commentators assume is the only thing (apart from talking utter bollocks) that car designers are capable of.\n\nBecause we\u2019re a dynamic and membership focused media organization at the Autopian, one of our mottos is customer service fourth \u2013 we listen to our members and then immediately get sidetracked by looking at cars shaped like boats or boats that are classed as trains, which actually happened the afternoon I started writing this. Recently a reader got in touch and wanted an expert take on the Toyota GT(R)86. More specifically comparing the first generation which they disliked and the second generation, which they adored. This sounded like a job for me so I\u2019m here to deliver. Less facetiously it gives me the chance to cover in more depth a couple of things I\u2019ve talked about tangentially in other articles; namely why cars targeted at enthusiasts must cater to a wider market and how the design of a car evolves over time.\n\nHow The GT86 Came Into Being\n\nThe story of the modern \u201c86\u201d begins with the Toyota FT-HS (FT standing for Future Toyota) hybrid sports car concept shown at the 2007 Detroit show. A joint product of Toyota\u2019s CALTY advanced design studio and the Advanced Product Strategy Group, it was envisaged as a 3.5 liter V6 with associated hybrid system combining for around 400bhp \u2013 a sports car for the eco-conscious generation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn odd mix of sharp creases and more rounded surfaces, the cab forward proportion and openings behind the doors gave the impression of the FT-HS being mid-engined but the powerplant was up front. Visually and conceptually, reall,y the FT-HS was a progenitor for the later 2014 FT-1 concept that became the A90 Supra; its relevance here is that it demonstrated Toyota was thinking seriously about a rear wheel drive enthusiast-targeted car, something they didn\u2019t sell at the time.\n\nThe concept that really marked the genesis of the GT86 was the FT-86 which debuted at the 2009 Tokyo show, designed by Toyota Europe Design Development (ED2) in the Cote d\u2019Azur in France. Nice work if you can get it.\n\nThis Flash Red five seat coupe contained hints of the earlier FT-HS but, with realistic sized wheels and calmer exterior surfacing, it was a lot closer to a realistic production proposal than fever dream show car.\n\nThe typical concept bullshit was mostly limited to the interior \u2013 funky secondary controls around the instrument binnacle and a CD slot concealed behind a zipper \u2014 fun and original but not a hope in hell of making production. The expensive 3.5 V6 hybrid powertrain bit the dust and was replaced by a more prosaic 2.0 boxer engine, and the 86 moniker left you in no doubt precisely where this new model was targeted.\n\nToyota then wheeled out the FT-86 II at the Geneva show in 2011. Again the work of the ED2 studio it was a gussied up version of the production car that finally broke cover at the Tokyo show in December of that year and appeared in showrooms in 2012. Subaru had recently started staying with Toyota at weekends so the new coupe was a joint effort; Subaru supplied the engine and built the whole car at their Gunma plant. Initially available in the U.S. and Canada as the Scion FR-S, it was called the Toyota GT86 everywhere else. The Subaru version nobody cared about was the BRZ. [Ed Note: Some people prefer the Subi! -DT].\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe brief was clear enough \u2013 create and build a stylish car that wouldn\u2019t empty your wallet and was fun to drive on the road, much like the original AE86 in the eighties. On the surface it looks like Toyota got things mostly right, but if we cast our designer\u2019s eye over it and consider the whole execution, some odd choices were made.\n\nToyota made a big deal about this car being the spiritual successor to the AE86. The bore and stroke of the engine are both 86mm. The diameter of the exhaust is 86mm. There\u2019s an 86 roundel flanked by opposing pistons in the scalloped area of the front fender. So far so on the nose.\n\nThe new car had a trunk as opposed to a hatch, even though part of their spiel to the aftermarket crowd was the ability to fold the rear seats flat so a set of wheels and tires for track days could be chucked in the back. Instead of a buzzing straight four motor it had a throbbing cast-iron stove of a boxer motor with a hole in the torque curve. A car aimed squarely at people who used to read Tarmac Scraping Hatchback and Swimsuit Model magazine on the toilet but now had real adult money to spend, it ended up being a simulacrum of an OEM tuner car created from expedient ingredients that sounded good on paper, but to some didn\u2019t quite add up to sum of it\u2019s parts. [Ed Note: Many people loved the BRZ/FR-S, though that hole in the torque curve was indeed strange. -DT].\n\nCritiquing The Design\n\nWhen it comes to the exterior of the GT86, there\u2019s not a huge amount wrong with how it looks (sorry John). The proportions are good, the surfacing is clean and it\u2019s not trying to be something it isn\u2019t. You view this car and understand what it is straight away.\n\nI think the shapes of the lighting units both front and rear are out of place and sit uneasily with the surrounding bodywork, and some of the detailing like the diffuser feel contrived. Other than being a modern rear wheel drive two door coupe there is nothing visually remarkable about it. The overall effect is fussily acceptable rather than heart-wrenchingly captivating \u2013 it\u2019s mildly anodyne with a few odd details in the bland grand Toyota tradition.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCars like this I always think of as being a bit \u201cthin\u201d \u2013 lacking in substance and depth. There\u2019s no love, personality or overarching style to draw you in and keep you there once you get past the driving experience. Offering special editions with trick aero and suspension pieces is admirable, but didn\u2019t broaden the appeal to offer anyone outside the enthusiast target market a compelling reason to buy one.\n\nNarrow appeal aside, one of the key issues with the design of the GT-86 is how Toyota marketed it. Toyota released a series of videos with chief designer Akihiro Nagaya outlining how the exterior of the GT-86 was directly influenced by the Toyota 2000GT \u2013 a Yamaha built straight six Japanese E-Type that went on sale in 1967. I thought the GT86 was supposed to be a modern incarnation of the original Hachi-Roku? Now it\u2019s here you\u2019re pointing out how the curved body side and DLO (the outline of the side glazing) and the humps on the instrument panel upper are meant to deliberately evoke a completely different car from forty five years ago?\n\nWhile we\u2019re about transposing visual motifs, those odd lighting shapes are meant to represent a piston and con-rod \u2013 something that is replicated again in the trim piece at the base of the gear shifter. I\u2019m always against this sort of thing because taking A and slapping it on B and calling the result C is not useful design \u2013 it\u2019s too literal an interpretation. This sort of post-modernist bullshit is fine for art, fashion, architecture or interior design if you enjoy that sort of playschool whimsy, but here it\u2019s misplaced. A Memphis Group designed car as a thought exercise might amuse design bores but as a design movement the ideas and style of overt post-modernism are rarely suited to mainstream automobiles, even if it\u2019s just sparingly done on the details. It feels corny to me but I\u2019m a snob.\n\nGT86 Becomes The GR86\n\nThe GT86 became the GR86 for the arrival of the 2021 second-generation car. More significant than the letter change was the concerted effort Toyota made to make the car more attractive to the wider market. The power deficit was addressed by punching the boxer motor out to 2.4 liters. Michelin Pilot Sport 4s replaced the Prius spec ditch finders on the first gen and the exterior was given an extensive makeover. Designed by Kosuke Kobo and Kazuhiko and led by chief designer Koichi Matsumoto, according to Kubo one the stated intentions was:\n\n\u201cto create a simple and timeless design by trimming away all excess, so customers can treasure it for a long time\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOut went the odd lights and slightly fussy detailing for a much smoother, joined up muscular look. The scallop in the front fender which served no purpose other than providing somewhere to put the 86 logo was banished and replaced by a vent that neatly flows down to run along the rocker, adding solidity and width between the wheel arches.\n\nThe rear diffuser and lights are far tidier and compliment each other much better this time around. They look like they were drawn by an adult as opposed to someone coming off an all night Initial D bender. The trunk volume actually got smaller, demonstrating what a load of bollocks that spare set of wheels and tires thing was, and the trunk lid itself received a more convincing duck tail style spoiler ameliorating the need for aftermarket tea trays. It just looks like a completer and more grown up car.\n\nIt Needed Wider Appeal\n\nNone of these improvements should come as a rattling surprise. OEMs solicit feedback constantly \u2013 not just from customers who bought their car but crucially from those who didn\u2019t.\n\nA year or so after the on-sale date when it\u2019s time to start thinking about the facelift or replacement they have a fairly good idea of what changes need to be made. At Land Rover during a quiet afternoon I would dig around on the company intranet and read these reports to try and better inform my work. Toyota had the best of intentions designing a car to appeal to a specific subset of the enthusiast market: In Japan the GT86 was even available with a stripped out interior, unpainted bumpers and steel wheels. But crucially by accommodating the type of customer who enjoys fitting aftermarket parts and personalizing their cars, they designed everyone else out. Regular drivers won\u2019t be thanking you for engineering in easy oversteer when they gun the motor on a wet on-ramp.\n\nThe problem was the first generation was just too single minded to capture the type of customer who just wants to walk into a dealership, slap down a check, slip the sunglasses on and drive out in style.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaking it an unfinished blank canvas for drifting fans meant it had no hope of peeling customers out of Miatas. Toyota must have realized this quickly; it seems the reason the GT86 had a trunk instead of a hatch is because it was design protected from the beginning to offer a convertible version.\n\nDesign protection is when you try and anticipate future variants and make the necessary engineering accommodations. For example I would be floored if the new Dodge Charger cannot accommodate the Hemi V8 \u2013 even though it\u2019s not currently in the product mix. We don\u2019t know exactly why the convertible GT86 never happened \u2013 Toyota showed it twice in 2013 at the Geneva and Tokyo shows but Subaru chief Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said the car would need complete re-engineering but in the same interview admits there had been requests from the U.S. market for an open GT86. A convertible would certainly have added to the GT86\u2019s rather lackluster sales figures, which cratered two years after release dropping from around 40k to just over 20k worldwide, suggesting everyone caught up in the initial hype bought one, and didn\u2019t buy another. Sales picked up slightly when the second generation went on sale to about 25k, but because of the EU implementing Global Safety Regulations 2 , the latest model has been pulled from the European market.\n\nUnderstanding The Market\n\nIt\u2019s easy to sit at our keyboards and throw stones at enthusiasts for wanting what they can\u2019t have and at OEMs for not building what enthusiasts want, but the reality is much more nuanced. A point I\u2019ve made elsewhere before is we used to get cars like the original AE86 because they were the consequence not the conclusion \u2013 that car was built during Japan\u2019s bubble period and was based on the previous generation Corolla from 1979.\n\nThe new car market has changed out of all recognition since then. The Miata has endured for thirty five years because it overcame the stigma of being a car for dog walkers and hairdressers. The ND made a marked departure from the cutesy design of previous generations. Mazda also offers the RF giving the security and style of a hardtop (if not the practicalities) for those customers who want it, cleverly without requiring any alterations to the existing body in white (the underlying structure). There\u2019s even a smaller 1.5 liter engine available in non-US markets. With a niche vehicle you have to offer as much choice as possible \u2013 the success of cars like the Fiat 500 and Dodge Challenger and even the 911 is proof of that.\n\nToyota had become the beige cargo shorts and fleece normcore dad; boring and utterly dependable. The first GT86 was a hail Mary to prove they were still cool \u2013 ripping the fleece off to reveal a Pixies tee shirt underneath. Their intention was commendable but it took ten years and a second generation to become the car it arguably should have been in the first place.",

What should I do?\n\nThis is the exact dilemma Mariah Cheri Cuthrell (@mariahcheri) faces. In a recent TikTok video, she showcased her husband's Acura with its sleek leather seats, a feature she now wishes her own car had.\n\nShe says,\n\n\u201cI just bought a 2024 Toyota RAV4 and I love the car, but should've gone with the leather seats. My husband's Acura feels so much cleaner with them. It's like having ugly carpet versus beautiful hardwood flooring.\"\n\nWhat Should Mariah Do Now?\n\nShe loves the car but can't trade her new RAV4 SUV in because she will lose too much money. She would lose thousands by selling it to the Toyota dealer and trading it for the higher trim level with leather. What should she do?\n\nIt sparked a cloth versus leather debate. Which do you prefer?\n\nCheck out some of the comments Mariah received after she posted her short video clip.\n\nJJ - I strongly prefer cloth seats bc they don't crack or rip or wrinkle\n\nMariah says, My parents prefer cloth for that reason, too.\n\nMichael_Webb, Consider getting Katzkin leather installed. It's of higher quality than Toyota's factory leather and cheaper than buying a new car!\n\nDanielle Johnson - Leather is a must-have for kids; do what anyone says! So easy to clean!\n\nMariah - Yes, one of the main reasons I want leather\n\nnatalie :) - I will always get leather seats because fabric is so hard to clean\n\nMariah - Yes!! And I have young kids, so it's even harder to keep clean with fabric seats.\n\nBamBam - I'm a cloth fan. It's harder to clean them in the short term, but they are so much more comfortable. I hated my RAV4 seats specifically, though, along with the rest of the interior. I spilled water and stained that fabric.\n\nMariah - I do feel like it stains so easily\n\ncrystalmushroomz - I got Katskin leather put in; it's like $1,500-1,700, but SO worth it\n\nKyu - My mom has a RAV4. I think the cloth is more comfortable, but the leather looks nicer\n\nMariah Has Another Option\n\nIn the comments section, Mariah is told by at least six others to check out Katzkin. They manufacture unique custom leather seats for car owners like Mariah who wish they had a leather interior.\n\nMariah says, \"Thanks to these comments, I'm getting the Katzkin with the black leather. I can't wait! I just scheduled an installation appointment for the leather seats with Katzskin on March 3rd! I'm so excited.\"\n\nShould She Buy Aftermarket Seat Covers?\n\nYou may have seen the aftermarket seat covers that look fake and cheap. You know, you can buy the ones at the parts store. They are not a good option unless you have a $1,000 car.\n\nThis is not an advertisement for Katzkin, but it's one way a Toyota RAV4 or other vehicle owner can upgrade to leather seats and not have to buy a new car to get them. And they look like a factory install.\n\nKatzkin is a brand of custom leather upholstery for cars, trucks, and SUVs. Katzkin leather can be purchased as an aftermarket installation, dealer accessory, or factory-offered option.\n\nFeatures\n\nInstallation: Katzkin leather replaces the existing cloth upholstery in your vehicle.\n\nDesign: Katzkin offers a variety of design options, including standard designs and custom creations.\n\nMaterials: Katzkin leather is made from imported automotive leather.\n\nDurability: Katzkin leather is designed to meet or exceed factory performance specifications.\n\nBenefits\n\nProfessionally installed leather can transform the look and feel of your vehicle's interior.\n\nLeather is easier to clean and maintain than cloth.\n\nKatzkin leather is water-resistant and mold-resistant.\n\nHow to Get Katzkin Leather Installed in Your Vehicle\n\nCapitol One Auto Navigators says,\n\nKatzkin leather can be used for aftermarket installations, dealer accessories, or sometimes as a factory-offered option. While the company is best known for leather, it also sells vinyl seats, which some vehicle owners might prefer for open-top vehicles.\n\nThe first step to acquiring a Katzkin-sourced interior for your vehicle is to go to the company's online configurator. The tool lets you select your car's make and model and browse design possibilities ranging from established packages to fully customized original creations.\n\nKatzkin offers various options, allowing customers to experiment with different looks and combinations. Both leather and non-leather materials are available and can be made with multiple textures and stitching, ranging from bright red to subtle gray.\n\nFinal Thoughts and Questions for Toyota RAV4 Owners\n\nShould you opt for a Toyota RAV4 with comfortable cloth seats or go for the luxurious feel of leather? Mariah, a recent RAV4 owner, has made the decision to go with a leather seat install and cover her cloth seats.\n\nThe cost to upgrade to professionally installed leather seats is about $2,000, much less than what Mariah would lose if she traded in her Toyota RAV4 for a higher trim level. So, it's a good option for her now. She doesn't have to live with it for the life of her car loan.\n\nHow About You?\n\nWhat's your preference? Cloth or leather?

            "content": "There's more evidence that a new Toyota Celica is actually happening. Not only that, it appears a performance-oriented version could be part of the car's rebirth. A trademark filing from Toyota in Brazil features the Celica name with two critical letters in front of it: GR.\n\nThe GR Celica trademark is very recent, dated January 15, 2025, and published in early February. Aside from being classified as a trademark for \"automobiles and their structural parts,\" nothing more is mentioned about this. We nosed around the internet for other GR Celica trademarks but came up empty. That's not to say GR Celica hasn't been trademarked anywhere else. But such filings\u2014if they exist\u2014haven't yet been published.\n\nPhoto by: Brasil.gov\n\nThat said, Toyota has recently trademarked Celica all over the globe. That includes the United States, where the 2021 filing status was published in November 2024. That lines up with rumors of a Celica reboot, which have floated around the internet for years at this point. Things stepped up a notch in October 2023, when Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda said flat-out that he asked top executives to build one. A few months prior, Toyota CEO Koji Sato said he'd like to see one, but left it at that.\n\nAdding even more fuel to the rumor mill, Toyota's Grip animated series briefly showed a list of cars and Celica Mk8 was among them. Celica production ended with the Mk7 in 2006. Lastly, a report from Best Car claims Toyota Chief Technology Officer Hiroki Nakajima straight-up said \"We will make the Celica.\"\n\nTo be clear, Toyota hasn't officially confirmed anything regarding a Celica reboot. Furthermore, the company isn't commenting on rumors or trademark filings. Automakers constantly refile and renew trademarks simply to protect the name, oftentimes with no imminent plans to use it. However, seeing a GR Celica trademark suggests there's more happening here beyond protecting intellectual property. That, combined with on-the-record comments from Toyoda and Sato voicing support for a new Celica makes a return feel imminent. It's not a case of it, but when.\n\nAs soon as we know, you'll know.

            "content": "In a perfect world, housing would be affordable enough, salaries would be high enough and cities would be walkable enough that anyone who wanted a sports car owned one. Sadly, we don't live in a perfect world, and it's getting harder and harder to justify buying a two-door car regardless of whether it's a coupe or convertible. That also makes it harder for automakers to justify redesigning their sporty cars since even Miata sales were down 10 percent in 2024. Maybe it's time for Mazda and Toyota to work together.\n\nCollaborating on a platform that works both as a two-seat roadster and a four-seat coupe would be a challenge, and I guarantee the internet would lose its collective mind, but let's take a step back for a second. All together, the Miata and GR86 sold a grand total of 19,529 cars in 2024. Meanwhile, the Subaru BRZ only added another 3,345 sales to the total. That isn't horrible, but those aren't exactly the numbers that scream, \"You'll definitely make your money back if you redesign your sports car.\" For comparison, Ford sold nearly 50,000 Mustangs last year, and that doesn't include the Mach-E, either.\n\nSo sales already aren't inspiring confidence, but it gets more complicated from there. While Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing their best to ensure climate change causes as much devastation and suffering as possible, other countries aren't nearly as ready to set the planet on fire. Because of that, there's a good chance the next Miata and GR86 will have to go hybrid, and that's only going to drive the price up further, limiting sales even more. Combining forces would allow Mazda and Toyota to split the bill, helping keep the price more reasonable and ensuring neither car suffers as a result.\n\nBut what about the Subaru engine? Isn't that an important part of the GR86 formula, and wouldn't the car gods rain hellfire down on the first hybrid Miata with a boxer engine to roll off the production line? Possibly, but if we're going hybrid, do we really need Subaru to be involved in this? Toyota knows hybrids better than anyone, and Mazda's the authority on making lightweight cars fun to drive, so you don't necessarily need Subaru. It can still come along for the ride, though. Or maybe they stick with the boxer engine. I'm not an engineer. I'm just a guy with a laptop playing product planner on the internet.\n\nThe real genius of this plan is that it would also allow Mazda to build my pipe dream, a car I like to call the Miata But Bigger. Tall people can't fit in the Miata, so why not sell a longer Miata with more room for the tall folks? Because it would no longer be a Miata at that point and should come with a different name? Well, then how would we explain the fact that it looks exactly like the Miata, only bigger?\n\nHeck, while we're just throwing around ideas, why not give the Miata 2: More Room For Me And You an electric powertrain with a rotary range extender? It's crazy, but hey, Mazda would save so much money developing the new Miata, maybe it could afford to have a little fun in the powertrain department. Would it drive exactly like an ND Miata? Probably not, but that's why I would reserve it for the Miata+, which already won't be quite as sharp as the regular Miata due to its added length.\n\nSince they'll be working together, they'll also be able to better differentiate the two cars to ensure they offer distinct driving experiences and don't step on each other's toes too much. It's a win-win for everyone involved. Does that mean I want it to happen, though? Of course not. I prefer to live in a world where the Miata and GR86 both sell so well that both automakers could justify developing them separately. But if we're looking at an alternative where both cars might go away altogether, I'm fine with making a few compromises to keep them on the road.\n\nSee, everyone who correctly insists auto journalists make terrible product planners. I can have genius ideas, too.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nShould you buy a Toyota Supra? Are they reliable cars?\n\nWhile researching the Toyota Supra, I came across this 2020 Supra owner, who I will call Julian (@thatkswappedek), who lives in Lake Placid, Florida; he's wondering what happened to his dream car. It now needs over $4,000 in repairs, and he isn't sure what to do now.\n\nImagine being the owner of a 2020 Supra, your dream car, now facing over $4,000 in repairs. This is the dilemma of a car lover, torn between his affection for the Supra and the practicality of keeping it. What would you do in his shoes?\n\nHe says,\n\n\"Yep, that's over $4,000 in repairs for my Toyota Supra that's not even five years old. I don't know what I should do now. The Toyota dealer offered me money to trade it in, get rid of it, and get it out of my sight. Should I keep it or sell it?\"\n\nJulian Loves the Supra But Is Having Second Thoughts About the Car\n\nHe says, \"I'm at the Toyota dealer, and I'm going to get this thing diagnosed and see how much it's going to cost to fix my Supra.\"\n\n\"So, I just got back from the Toyota dealer and got news that I didn't want to hear. My 2020 Toyota Supra is not even five years old and needs over $4,000 in repairs. The steering just decided to quit on me.\"\n\n\"I want to show you what it's doing. The problem is that BMW helped develop this Supra.\"\n\n\"Listen to this,\" he says as he turns the steering wheel back and forth. You can hear the steering gear making a loud noise.\n\nJulian was further shocked when he saw the repair quote from the Toyota dealer.\n\nThen, he held up the problem diagnosed by the Toyota dealer with the cost of repairs. The Supra quote says the Supra needs a new rack and pinion assembly. The cost? $4,355.70.\n\n\"I don't know, boys. I don't know what to do. The Toyota dealer offered me money to trade it in, get rid of it, and get it out of my sight.\"\n\n\"I love the car; it was my dream car when it first came out, but that is unbelievable because it's not even five years old, and it already needs close to $5,000 in repairs.\"\n\nJulian Decides to Park the Car and Wait\n\n\"The crazy thing is that even if I decide to fix the car and do the repairs myself, the parts alone are over $2,000. So, it's still a crazy amount. I will park it and decide later on what to do with it.\"\n\n\"But, it's insane; I guess they don't build Toyotas like they used to,\" he concluded.\n\nIs Toyota Still a Reliable Car Brand?\n\nToyota is known for building the most reliable cars. Every year, Consumer Reports lists the most reliable brands, and Toyota was in the top three. While it's true that Toyota is one of the most reliable car brands, not all of its models rank high.\n\nThe Supra is not one of Toyota's best models for reliability. There are seven recalls for the 2020 model year. You can check it out here.\n\nIt's important to note that the Supra was not recalled for rack and pinion steering issues.\n\nWhen the Supra first came out, I drove this sports car and had this review. Here are a few excerpts from my review in June 2020.\n\nIn the review, I said, \"The new GR Toyota Supra cockpit reminds me of a BMW interior, and the ignition chime is even sourced from the Bavarian automaker. The interior quality feels like that of a BMW, and the fit and finish are upper-class. The gear shift, climate controls, and infotainment screen all look like they came from the BMW Z4 convertible.\"\n\n\"When I first looked at the Supra's specs, I was disappointed in the 335 horsepower. However, after giving the new sports car a thorough test this week, it has enough power to excite most driving enthusiasts. A true rear-drive sports car is not just about straight-line speed but also power-to-weight ratio and overall balance. In the case of the Supra, that balance is an even 50:50.\"\n\n\"I drove the 2020 Supra in the mountains of Colorado and experienced the sports car through tight, twisty turns. The 50:50 weight balance is evident as it's easily controllable through corners with no body lean. The Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires help, too, as they provide plenty of grip on the pavement. When you need, the Brembo four-piston front and rear brakes offer plenty of stopping power.\"\n\nConclusion: You Really Can't Go Wrong\n\n\"The 2020 Toyota GR Supra is simply a fun car to drive! Enthusiasts will find it's a good option for about $50,000, considering the level of performance you get. At the end of the day, it offers surprising acceleration, good grip through the corners, and overall superior driving dynamics.\"\n\nWhen Julian took a test drive, that's what he would have experienced, and I can understand why it was his dream car.\n\nThe Supra was developed in collaboration with BMW, which is why it's so fun to drive. However, this partnership could also be a factor in the sports car's reliability issues.\n\nWhat Do Toyota Supra Owners Say?\n\nI checked the 2020 Toyota Supra owners' comments on Reddit, and here are a few of them, which are all positive experiences.\n\nStonerThoughts001 - I'm a 2020 owner and bought mine in May 2021 with 8k miles. It's been my daily ever since. I'm currently at 34k miles. There are no significant issues. Needed nothing but regular maintenance.\n\nKamikazesuper - I've been driving the heck out of my 20 supra since 2021; it has 54000 on the dash. The only issue I have so far is my tires. They deflate here and there, but that's probably just me doing full throttle here and there. Besides that, I don't have any other issues.\n\nsatmajesty - I've had my Supra Launch Edition for 4.5 years, since 2019. It hasn't needed any work besides oil changes and brake fluid at 3 years.

            "content": ".The recently redesigned Toyota Tacoma pickup is still a sales darling for the Japanese automaker, and it remains one of the most popular trucks in the country. Now, however, it seems you can play too hard with one, and cause some braking issues in the process. That's the latest according to a recall notice filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) this week, claiming over 106,000 pickups could have mud or dirt build up\u2014you know, not an uncommon scenario for Toyota's more adventurous customers\u2014and wear down an important part. Here's what we know:\n\nSo far, NHTSA documents show 12 warranty claims and five field reports of issues potentially related to the recall. According to NHTSA documents, Tacomas equipped with 16-inch brake systems positioned inside 17-inch wheels have a tight tolerance, and if mud and dirt build up on the interior of the wheels when off-roading, eventually contact can be made with the components and the intruding mud, which could lead to damage and wear through the brake lines, causing a fluid leak, and eventually a decline in braking performance and stopping distance, which could lead to a gnarly crash.\n\nToyota says it's still investigating this issue on its other braking configurations for the Tacoma but has nothing to report so far. Again, it's only four-wheel drive Tacomas equipped with 17-inch wheels and the 16-inch braking kit in the rear; Toyota specifies that it's exploring \"2-wheel drive and a combination of 16-inch brakes with either 17-inch or 18-inch Toyota wheels, and other 4-wheel drive Tacoma vehicles with 16-inch brakes and 18-inch Toyota wheels to determine whether there is a potential for a brake fluid leak.\"\n\nToyota says it was first alerted to a potential issue back in July of 2024. Owner notifications will be sent out by April, and the remedy is to reattach the brake lines or move them. It goes without saying almost that this sprays a little mud in Toyota's face, since, well, the Tacoma\u2014like other midsize trucks\u2014is marketed as a rugged, go-anywhere personal adventure machine.\n\nOn the other hand, though NHTSA's posting is somewhat confusing. No Tacoma has 16- or 17-inch brake rotors, the braking components most often referred to by a measurement in inches, at either end, only 12.6- or 13.4-inch front rotors or 12.2- or 13.20-inch rears, so the measurement's size reference is odd. Extrapolating a relative comparison, though, from NHTSA's filing, we take it to mean trucks with the smaller of the two available brake packages, 17-inch wheels, and four-wheel drive are affected. Diving into the Tacoma's specs, that suggests this issue affects only certain basic SR and SR5 trim levels, which aren't off-road-specific variants like, say, the (rear-drive) TRD PreRunner or four-wheel-drive TRD Off-Road, TRD Pro, or Trailhunter models.",

According to a filing by the NHTSA, exactly 106,061 examples of the 2024 and 2025 model year Tacomas have just been recalled because their real brakes can fail. The reason isn't a mechanical issue, but because if certain models are equipped with four-wheel drive, the 16-inch brake package and 17-inch wheels get too dirty, the rear brake lines may wear, leak, and lead to brake failure.\n\nToyota is issuing the recall, which means the automakers wasn't forced to do so by the NHTSA. According to the documentation supplied by the NHTSA, Toyota first started receiving reports from dealerships in July of 2024. Toyota technicians noticed that some rear brake hoses were worn through and that the rear brake hose was \"able to rub against mud and dirt that was built up on the inside of the rear wheels.\" Toyota was able to replicate the issue, but only on models with four-wheel drive, the 16-inch brake package and 17-inch Toyota wheels. The root cause was that, despite the brake line design following the proper routing, the clearance between the brake system itself and the lines was different in this configuration than in other models. Toyota says it continues to investigate whether the issue affects 2024-2025 Tacomas with other wheel and brake size specifications.",

The initial recall covers around 106,000 Toyota Tacomas manufactured between 2024 and 2025. Toyota officials say the rear brake hoses can break over time, resulting in a brake fluid leak and raising the danger of a crash.\n\nThe other recall affects some 2025 Toyota Camry and Lexus NX vehicles as well as select 2024 and 2025 Lexus RX cars \u2014 about 41,000 vehicles in total. Officials believe the vehicles may have defective seat belts that might not fulfill certain strength requirements. This may increase the likelihood of injuries during a crash.\n\n\n\n\n\nToyota and Lexus dealers will provide free repairs for the recalled vehicles.\n\nTo determine whether either recall applies to your vehicle, input your vehicle\u2019s VIN into Toyota\u2019s website or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s website. Otherwise, the automaker will contact customers by early April if their vehicles have been recalled.\n\nToyota Is the Latest Car Manufacturer Affected by a Recall\n\nThis is the latest car recall faced by consumers. Last month, Ford recalled nearly 300,000 F-series vehicles due to faulty fuel pumps.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to CBS News, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that a defective gasoline pump might trigger a power outage, increasing the risk of an accident.\n\n\u201cBiodiesel deposits may form on the pump drivetrain roller components, which could lead to failure of the high-pressure fuel pump,\u201d the NHTSA stated at the time.\n\nWhen a vehicle\u2019s fuel pump fails, drivers may experience \u201cextended crank while starting, a Check Engine Light (CEL), noise, and reduced engine power.\u201d\n\nThe Ford recall included no reports of accidents, injuries, or fires related to the fuel pump issue. The models affected by the Ford recall included:\n\n2020-2022 Ford Super Duty F-250, F-350, F-450, F-550, F-600\n\n2021-2022 Ford F-650, F-750\n\nAccording to the automaker, Ford dealers can update the powertrain control module software for free. On Jan. 13, 2025, impacted car owners began receiving notification letters in the mail. Owners can contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332 and reference the recall number 24S78.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nTwo of the most highly-anticipated Japanese sports cars are the sixth-generation Toyota GR Supra and the long-overdue, Mazda RX-7 successor. Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru have established a partnership, ensuring the longevity of the internal combustion engine. Toyota and Mazda have been working in tandem for a while as the former owns five percent of the latter. It appears this partnership deepens still as the two sports cars will have more in common than we initially believed.\n\nKirk Kreifels recently reported on a scoop from a reputable Japanese outlet, and part of the report downright contradicts some of the things we already know. The most surprising thing is that despite Mazda being a much smaller company than Toyota, it could contribute significantly to the next-generation Supra.\n\nMazda's chassis, apparently, wasn't up to the task\n\nI know earlier I said that Mazda will contribute to the next-generation Supra in a major way, but Toyota will be doing the same for Mazda's future sports car. There have been reports that Toyota and Mazda's future rear-wheel-drive sports cars will share a platform, and now we know why.\n\nMazda developed a new rear-wheel-drive platform for its SUV models, for use in the CX-60 through CX-90. The same chassis, or a version of it, could also be used for a rear-wheel-drive Mazda 6, but whether it goes into production depends on how Mazda's SUV models perform on the market. According to the latest reports from Japan, Toyota deemed Mazda's new platform to be too heavy and not rigid enough to underpin a sports car. Kirk Kreifels notes that a large number of Mazda engineers went to Toyota's Gazoo Racing division.\n\nRemember, the Toyota GT3 Concept and Mazda RX Vision Concept? Both concepts share very similar proportions, depicting the classic sports car silhouette with a long front hood, short rear deck, and short overhangs. The Toyota version will, reportedly, first arrive as a Lexus and will feature a twin-turbo V-8 hybrid powertrain. As for the platform both sports cars would use, it sounds like it's going be a shortened version of the Toyota GT3 platform.\n\nToyota is eyeing Mazda's new inline-six engine\n\nThe most interesting bit from these latest reports concerns the next-generation Supra's engine. While Toyota was involved in \u201cperfecting\u201d the BMW B58 engine, the sixth-generation Toyota Supra will not make use of this engine.\n\nWe know Toyota's new 2.0-liter turbo-four will be used in a wide variety of upcoming Toyota and Lexus products, including the 2026 Toyota GR Celica. Toyota also planned on using this engine, in hybrid form, in the sixth-generation Toyota Supra, but things may have taken a different turn.\n\nApparently, someone at Toyota is adamant that the Supra needs to have an inline-six. Like other JDM enthusiasts, I completely stand behind this. Even if Toyota's new four-cylinder proves to be \u201cthe next 2JZ\u201d, sharing an engine with the \u201clesser\u201d Toyota models could dilute the Supra nameplate. Currently, Toyota doesn't have its own inline-six. Since BMW will no longer be involved in the next GR Supra, Toyota is eyeing Mazda's inline-six engine.\n\nIn its current form, Mazda's 3.3-liter, turbocharged, Skyactiv-G engine produces 340 horsepower at 5,000 RPM and 369 pound-feet (500 Nm) at 2,000 RPM. While respectable, these numbers are nowhere near what the next-generation Supra needs to have. My guess is that Toyota could take this engine and make a few tweaks. Perhaps, add an extra turbocharger, revise the heads, etc. As for Toyota's 2.0-liter turbo-four, a normally aspirated version of that engine could be found in the next-generation GR86.\n\nThese reports contradict what we learned early on. Carmakers don't make it easy on us, as they, often, give out cryptic messages. Kirk Kreifels also notes that even reputable publications like Best Car Web cannot outright say certain things. Self-censorship is strong in Japanese media. Japan ranks 70th in press freedom, so you can understand why we have to take many of the scoops with a pinch of salt.\n\nStill, what are your thoughts on the Toyota and Mazda's joint efforts at a sports car? I think an inline-six is a must-have feature on the Supra, and apparently, someone at Toyota seems to agree. Would you prefer a four-cylinder hybrid? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nDimitar Angelov's automotive interests made him an expert in a wide variety of vehicles.

The outcome will be closely watched by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government as it steps up calls on businesses to increase pay more sharply than price rises.\n\nThe Bank of Japan sees sustainable wage hikes as a prerequisite to lift its key policy rate for monetary normalization.\n\nToyota's union does not disclose specific amounts for its requests regarding monthly salary but said it is seeking annual bonuses equivalent to 7.6 months of pay, also the same as last year.\n\n\"We want to discuss how Toyota and the automotive industry as a whole can grow together with others and create the future together,\" Toyota said in a release after receiving the union's request.\n\nLast year, Toyota's management offered a pay rise that fully met the union's demand, the largest hike since 1999. The monthly pay was raised by up to 28,440 yen ($187).\n\nAmong other automakers, Nissan Motor Co.'s union called for an 18,000 yen increase in monthly pay, the same level as last year's, but it lowered its annual bonus demand to 5.2 months of monthly pay, down 0.6 month, due to poor business performances.\n\nHonda Motor Co.'s union, meanwhile, demanded a 19,500 yen hike in monthly pay.\n\nIn other sectors, unions of major steel and heavy machinery manufacturers all demanded a monthly rise of 15,000 yen last Friday.\n\nJapan's biggest union group Rengo, or the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, said earlier its members are targeting a pay increase of 5 percent or more in this year's wage talks.\n\nAccording to Rengo, its tally of the results of pay negotiations from over 5,000 member unions last year showed Japanese companies agreed to raise wages by an average 5.10 percent, offering a more than 5 percent increase for the first time in 33 years.\n\nIshiba has called for companies to realize \"significant salary hikes\" at annual wage negotiations to increase disposable income amid inflation as the country faces rising prices due in part to higher import costs from the weaker yen.\n\nThe outcomes of the wage negotiations at most major Japanese companies are expected to be reported on March 12.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nJapan logs record 29 tril. yen current account surplus in 2024\n\nNissan tells Honda it intends to end merger talks: source\n\nFOCUS: Honda-Nissan tie-up failure leaves Japanese automakers' future hazy",

            "content": "The Toyota RAV4 Hybrid is one of the brand's most successful electrified vehicle offerings in the U.S., so there are plenty of people keen to know how much it costs to replace the RAV4's supplementary hybrid battery pack. Whether you already own a RAV4 or you're just curious as to the cost, we're here to help.\n\nA highly sought-after gasoline-electric crossover, the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid blends performance and efficiency together in one dependable and convenient powertrain. While not the most affordable hybrid option on the market, it does benefit from being a fantastic value proposition with a diverse set of trims and packages.\n\nAnother thing to take into consideration is Toyota's reputation for reliability, a reputation earned thanks to decades of over-engineering its components to ensure they last for as long as possible. But as reliable as they may be, it's inevitable that, at some point, you're going to need to replace the RAV4's supplementary battery pack. As you can imagine, it does come at a substantial cost, but it's nowhere near as much as how much it would've cost 20 years ago, thanks to advancements in battery technology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Toyota's website and other authoritative sources, including the EPA, Consumer Reports, J.D. Power, the NHTSA, and TopSpeed.\n\nHow Much Replacing the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid's Battery Costs\n\nFront of army green 2024 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid parked on grass with trees int he background at nightfall.\n\nAccording to Toyota, the cost of having a new 0.9 kWh nickel-metal hydride battery packed installed in the RAV4 Hybrid is anywhere between $3,000 and $8,000. There's the option of a refurbished pack, which lowers the price to between $1,500 and $,3,500, but expect these to be slightly less reliable and have a possible shorter lifespan.\n\nThankfully, all RAV4 Hybrid models come with the brand's class-leading 10-year or 150,000-mile battery warranty as standard. This covers all manufacturer-related faults and defects.\n\nToyota also has a pretty comprehensive online parts catalog, however, it doesn't list a replacement HEV battery pack part, so we're unable to reference an exact figure.\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 Hybrid's Battery Technology\n\nToyota equips the current-generation RAV4 Hybrid with a nickel-metal hydride battery, known for its durability and efficiency.\n\nThe hybrid battery features a compact design to minimize weight and optimize interior cargo space, without compromising performance.\n\nThe battery supports a regenerative braking system that captures and stores energy during deceleration to recharge itself.\n\nIt works seamlessly with the hybrid powertrain to deliver enhanced fuel efficiency and smooth transitions between electric and gasoline power.\n\nToyota has engineered the battery to withstand extreme temperatures, ensuring consistent performance in varying climates.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you purchase a new Toyota RAV4 Hybrid and maintain it to the manufacturer's specification, it's highly unlikely you'd encounter any battery-related faults within the first 10 to 15 years.\n\nBut even if you did, there's a strong chance that Toyota's replacement battery packs will be substantially cheaper than what they are today.\n\nWhat Happens When Your RAV4 Hybrid Battery Expires\n\nToyota\n\nOnce the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid's battery reaches the end of its lifespan, several symptoms will start to present themselves. The first to be impacted is fuel economy, which will drop significantly, as the hybrid system heavily relies on this part to aleviate consumption from the ICE system. When this happens, inconsistent or reduced acceleration due to diminished power output from the hybrid battery will also occur.\n\nAnother common symptom is increased frequency of the gasoline engine starting up, even at low speeds or idle, which is caused by the weakened battery providing insufficient electric power.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dashboard will light up like a Christmas tree, with several warning lights and messages illuminating, signaling diagnostic trouble codes have detected an issue with the hybrid battery system.\n\nThe problems don't end there, though, as the battery fan is also likely to be problematic. For context, this unit cools the battery pack when in use, but when the battery pack is on its way out, the fan will run louder or more often as the system works harder to manage the battery's declining efficiency and overheating risk.\n\nFurther, there have also been cases of a fluctuating state of charge on the dashboard display, where the battery level rapidly swings between full and low, reflecting a loss of the battery's ability to hold a steady charge.\n\nThe symptoms mentioned often appear gradually, but ignoring them can lead to more noticeable performance issues or even complete battery failure. As soon as symptoms are noticed, it's advisable to book an inspection with a Toyota-certified technician who will confirm if the hybrid battery needs replacing.\n\nThe Toyoyta RAV4 Hybrid Makes 219 Horsepower\n\nToyota\n\nBeneath the hood of the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid lies a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder Atkinson-cycle engine, generating 176 horsepower and 163 pound-feet of torque without any electrical assistance, with a dual-motor setup for the all-wheel drive system.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Toyota doesn't quote combined torque figures for the vast majority of its hybridized products, the automaker confirms the RAV4 Hybrid's system generates a combined 219 horsepower output. The ICE element produces 176 horsepower, while the front electric motor geneates 118 horsepower and 149 pound-feet or torque, and the rear motor produces 54 hoesepower and 89 pound-feet of torque.\n\nToyota RAV4 Hybrid Performance Specifications\n\nPowertrain 2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder And Two Permanent-Magnet Motors Horsepower 219 HP Torque 163 LB-FT Transmission Direct Drive eCVT Driveline All-Wheel Drive Battery 0.9 kWh Net Range 566 Miles Fuel Economy 37-39 MPG 0-60 MPH 7.8 Seconds Top Speed 112 MPH Towing Capacity 3,500 Pounds\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 Hybrid benefits from some incredibly-high reliability scores. For instance, Consumer Reports issues the model with an 83/100 predicted reliability rating\u2014one of the highest marks you'll see in this segment. J.D. Power scores the RAV4 Hybrid strongly, too, issuing an impressive 80/100 quality and reliability rating.\n\nWhat's interesting, though, is that the NHTSA hasn't subjected the RAV4 Hybrid range to any recalls whatsoever over the last three model years. That's an incredible result for a vehicle that's been sold so extensively during this period, which highlights Toyota's commitment to long-term dependability and reliability.\n\nHow Much A New Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Costs\n\nToyota\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe base model Toyota RAV4 Hybrid LE starts at $31,900, while the top-of-the-range Limited is priced from $40,205. The Woodland Edition (pictured above) costs $35,120 and is basically an XLE with off-road-inspired exterior and interior trimmings included.\n\nBut if you'd prefer an XLE, that will set you back $33,410. If your budget stretches to $36,300, you could opt for the XLE Premium. There aren't many optional extras offered for the RAV4 range, but there are some available packages for select trims.\n\nThe Hybrid LE, for example, can be specified with a $680 blind-spot monitor and rear-cross traffic alert and $90 rear cargo cover packages.\n\n2025 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Pricing\n\nModel MSRP LE $31,900 XLE $33,410 SE $34,595 Woodland Edition $35,120 XLE Premium $36,300 XSE $37,560 Limited $40,205\n\nThe Hybrid XLE is available with the $925 Winter Package, $1,265 Convenience Package, and $2,190 Premium Convenience Package. These packages include a host of features, including an electronic tailgate, sunroof, a heated leather steering wheel, and heated front seats.\n\nFor an additional $2,485, the XLE Premium can be specced with a 10.5-inch touchscreen and 11-speaker JBL audio system. This can be merged with the aforementioned packages for $3,125 and $3,750, respectively. The Limited model has access to three package groups, the most expensive of which is the $2,540 specification, which adds most of the aforementioned features, as well as a panoramic roof and digital rearview mirror.",

I\u2019ve documented what\u2019s going on in my report here. However, I found a unique story from Duane Henderson\u2019s Facebook post on the Toyota Tundra Owners page.\n\nImagine buying a new 2024 Toyota Tundra SR5 TRD Sport, and it starts smoking randomly when you start it, and it only has 11,000 miles. You take it to the dealer three times, and they can finally replicate the issue.\n\nToyota keeps the truck, puts you in a loaner, and then tells you it needs a new engine. However, Toyota makes it right, buys back your vehicle and you get a new Tundra Limited for the same price. Here is Duane\u2019s unique story.\n\nHe says,\n\n\u201cI have a 2024 Limited 4x4 Off-Road and hands down the best I\u2019ve owned! I\u2019ve owned every other make out there, and this is absolutely a better vehicle than any of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, it has little quirks\u2026but don\u2019t they all? I don\u2019t worry about the fuel mileage; I wouldn\u2019t have bought a truck if I had been worried about fuel mileage. And the engine, well, I don\u2019t worry about that either, as it seems Toyota has stepped up to the plate.\u201d\n\nHowever, the story starts with Duane\u2019s 2024 SR5 TRD Sport.\n\nDuane says, \u201cI had another 2024 SR5 TRD Sport before this for about 6 months, and at 11,000 miles, something happened that it was smoking really bad on start-up and heavy acceleration.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I took it to the dealer. They said they couldn\u2019t get it to do it on the first two trips. Finally, on the third trip, they got it to do it. They said it was a PCV valve on the passenger side, so they replaced the valve cover. They fixed the issue for about five days, and it started smoking again.\u201d\n\nHe scheduled to drop it off again.\n\n\u201cThen on the way to the dealer, it started running like absolute crap. It would hardly stay running. So I finally limped it into the dealership, and they put me in a loaner.\u201d\n\nSomething Unexpected Happens\n\n\u201cSo, 10 minutes after leaving the dealer, the Toyota manager called, offered to buy my truck back, and put me in this 2024 Tundra Limited for about the same monthly payment. How could I pass that up?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy payment did go up by $100 because they offered me all the extended warranties, gap insurance, paint protection, and wheel and tire protection at cost. And the manager offered to pay to have my new truck\u2019s windows tinted since I paid to have mine tinted.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay what you want about Toyota, but they stood behind their product and took care of me. That alone sold me on Toyota.\u201d\n\nThe Toyota Dealer Took Care of This Issue Quickly\n\nDuane is happy with the way the Toyota dealer handled this issue quickly. They knew his SR5 TRD Sport had serious engine issues, put him in a new truck, and saved what could have been a bad situation.\n\nWhat are Other Tundra Owners Saying?\n\nHarry Fisterbottom - Same here! We bought a 2022 SR5 and loved that truck. Unfortunately, we were one of the few who were unlucky to have an engine failure, but Toyota bought it back and worked with the dealer to get us into a 24 Limited. This truck is just awesome!\n\nTimothy C. Hicks - I was a diehard Ford guy for years (A 88 Ranger, 93 Bronco Eddie Bauer, and 4 F-150s) until I got my first Tundra, a 2012 5.7 SR5 that I totaled in 2018 with 194k miles (got zero % interest), loved the truck so much I bought a 2016 5.7 SR5 Louisiana Edition with insurance money ended up putting 218k miles on it before trading in for current 2024 TRD Sport in October\u2014no problems with any of my Tundras. The dealership had my 2016 sold in two weeks. I never had the longevity or durability with my Fords that I have had with the Tundra.\n\nFinal Thoughts and Questions For Tundra Owners\n\nThe Tundra engine failure appears not limited to the 2022 and 2023 model year trucks. Now, some 2024 Tundra trucks are experiencing issues. However, there is no recall of the 2024 Tundras. Toyota doesn\u2019t want more negative exposure, so they take care of customers quickly.\n\nDuane concludes by saying, \u201cThe conversations I\u2019ve had with total strangers asking about and/or complimenting my new Tundra Limited is enough to make me want to buy another one. Oh, and no, I\u2019m not a fanboy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNegative comments will be incoming, I\u2019m sure, and that\u2019s fine; I\u2019ll just keep liking my truck, and they can hate theirs. Their choice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Your Turn\n\nDo you own a 2024 Toyota Tundra, and have you experienced any engine issues? Your experience matters.

The program will give students and teachers access to innovative tools and programs designed to provide foundational skills, build confidence and forge an individualized path to success. Additional wraparound services will support basic needs that prepare students for learning. San Antonio is the ninth location to launch within this national program to promote workforce development, education and community engagement.\n\n\"For more than 20 years, Toyota has played a critical role in the booming Texas economy,\" said Governor Greg Abbott. \"Part of what made Texas the eighth-largest economy in the world is our growing and skilled workforce. This $6.5 million in grants to East Central ISD will help equip students in San Antonio with the skills they need to get good-paying jobs in high-demand industries like auto manufacturing. I thank Toyota for their ongoing partnership and investment in the better job and bigger paycheck opportunities that we provide in Texas. Working together, we will build a stronger and more prosperous Texas that will endure for generations.\"\n\nAs Toyota commemorates this STEM education investment in San Antonio, Toyota Texas continues to celebrate its expansion with the addition of the $531 million rear axle plant announced in June 2024. With this new asset, the plant will supply rear axles for the Toyota Tundra and Sequoia assembled onsite and the Toyota Tacoma assembled in Mexico. Facility construction and hiring are underway to prepare for the start of operations in 2026.\n\n\"Education and workforce development are longtime priorities for Toyota Texas,\" said Susann Kazunas, president of Toyota Texas. \"The future of our company and other companies across Texas depend on strong pipelines of students prepared to be the workforce of tomorrow. As Toyota grows in San Antonio\u2014with the construction of our new rear axle plant, and now the implementation of Driving Possibilities in our community\u2014we are proud of how that growth reflects our commitment to South Texas.\"\n\nDriving Possibilities in San Antonio is launching as a collaboration between Toyota USA Foundation, East Central ISD, Texas A&M University San Antonio's Institute for School and Community Partnerships, and United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County. Select schools in East Central ISD will build out an innovative STEM program and participate in experiential learning. Teachers will benefit through professional development, mentorship, coaching and tools needed for confident STEM instruction. Families throughout the district will have access to a new Family Resource Center launched by United Way. Additional collaborators may be added in the coming years.\n\n\"East Central ISD is proud to partner with the Toyota USA Foundation's Driving Possibilities initiative to bring cutting-edge STEM education to Pecan Valley STEM Academy,\" said Roland Toscano, superintendent of East Central ISD. \"Toyota's commitment to giving is truly remarkable, lifting up students and inspiring them to reach their full potential. Together, we are customizing learning experiences that challenge every student to grow academically and personally, helping to inspire their success in the classroom and beyond.\"\n\nUnited Way joined the initiative as a wraparound services provider with the Family Resource Center and Dual Generation initiative. The new Family Resource Center located on Pecan Valley STEM Academy's campus will meet basic needs and increase family engagement to help support all East Central ISD students learn and thrive at school. The addition of the Dual Generation initiative will provide families in the district with workforce training, education programs and high-quality childcare to support their student's academic success.\n\n\"We believe all students deserve access to opportunities and a pathway to high-growth careers, no matter their background,\" said Ana Meade, vice president of sustainable development at Toyota. \"Through Driving Possibilities, we aim to create limitless possibilities for all in our work with communities to address barriers so that everyone can participate in the quality STEM jobs of the future.\"\n\nDriving Possibilities\n\nIn 2022, the Toyota USA Foundation's Driving Possibilities initiative was launched a unique way to bring together educators, local and national nonprofits, industry and communities to create limitless possibilities for all. With more than 65 years of active community support across the U.S., efforts span the PreK-12 education continuum, with a foundation in the model developed in the West Dallas area. This is the largest and most comprehensive social innovation effort in Toyota's history.\n\nTo date, more than $75 million has been announced through multi-year grants with local and national nonprofits, education partners and the communities where Toyota team members live and work. The initiative is funded by Toyota USA Foundation with additional funds provided by Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) and Toyota Financial Services (TFS).\n\nToyota USA Foundation\n\nThe Toyota USA Foundation is a private foundation supporting education and community programs serving kindergarten through 12th-grade students and their teachers in the United States, with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).\n\nAbout Toyota\n\nToyota (NYSE:TM) has been a part of the cultural fabric in the U.S. for nearly 70 years, and is committed to advancing sustainable, next-generation mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands, plus our nearly 1,500 dealerships.\n\nToyota directly employs nearly 48,000 people in the U.S. who have contributed to the design, engineering, and assembly of more than 35 million cars and trucks at our 11 manufacturing plants.

The bill now goes to the Texas House for consideration.\n\nToyota\u2019s \u201cDriving Possibilities\u201d initiative is a collaboration between Toyota USA Foundation, East Central ISD and Texas A&M University San Antonio\u2019s Institute for School and Community Partnerships. Credit: Scott Ball / San Antonio Report\n\nThe student population in the sprawling East Central ISD is expected to double in the next eight years. But in 2024 voters rejected a proposed tax increase and three bond issues that would have helped the district upgrade aging sports facilities and build new school facilities as it grapples with its exploding enrollment.\n\nAlso, without that funding, the district estimated its projected $2.4 million budget shortfall would balloon to roughly $9 million in the coming years.\n\nRear axles\n\nIn 2024, Toyota announced plans to invest $531 million in expanding the factory, building a new rear axle plant. The company estimated the facility will bring 411 new jobs to the area with a base hourly wage of $20.54, and an average annual salary of $68,245.\n\nOfficials from both the city and county approved economic development incentive packages tied to the project.\n\nWhen complete, the plant will supply rear axles for the Toyota Tundra and Sequoia models assembled on-site, and the Toyota Tacoma assembled in Mexico. It is expected to start operations in 2026.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of how that growth reflects our commitment to South Texas,\u201d Kazunas added.\n\nToyota opened the $2.1 billion plant and in 2015 started to build a line of full-size Tundra trucks. In 2010, the company put another $100 million into the plant to support production of the mid-size Tacoma.\n\n\u201cFor more than 20 years, Toyota has played a critical role in the booming Texas economy,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThis $6.5 million in grants to East Central ISD will help equip students in San Antonio with the skills they need to get good-paying jobs in high-demand industries like auto manufacturing.\u201d",

            "content": "A division of Japan-based automaker Toyota has signed one of the largest leases in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth region in years with its deal to occupy the area's first mass-timber office building.\n\nToyota Financial Services has signed a lease taking the seven-floor, 242,000-square-foot mass-timber building developed by Dallas-based Crow Holdings off the leasing market. The building at 4401 Cirrus Way in Frisco, Texas, a northern suburb almost 30 miles from downtown Dallas, sits in a part of the region with more than 8.1 million residents that has become a maturing office destination with a lower vacancy rate compared with the rest of North Texas, according to CoStar's latest market report.\n\nIt's the biggest new office lease to land in the Dallas-Fort Worth region in nearly two years, confirmed CoStar's Director of Market Analytics Bill Kitchens, who tracks the North Texas office market. The largest leases in recent years reflect competition among major users for the newest office spaces, Kitchens said.\n\nToyota Financial Services' deal for the first mass-timber office building developed in the Dallas-Fort Worth region signals demand for this kind of office space as companies seek to minimize their carbon footprint.\n\n\"When we began developing The Offices at Southstone Yards, our goal was to build a welcoming, collaborative, sustainable space for a forward-thinking tenant like Toyota Financial Services that wanted to create an elevated workplace for its team,\" said Cody Armbrister, a senior managing director of the office team for Crow Holdings' Development, in an email to CoStar News.\n\n\"We see Southstone Yards as emblematic of the future of what the office can be \u2014 specifically a place where people want to spend the majority of their day,\" Armbrister added.\n\nTerms of the lease were undisclosed. Toyota Financial Services did not respond to requests from CoStar News seeking comment about its new office lease. The company is leasing 242,000 square feet of space in the building, where it expects to move into by year's end, according to CoStar data.\n\n\"This is one of the largest office leases to be completed in 2025\" in Texas, according to Steve Triolet, a senior vice president of research and market forecasting for real estate services firm Partners, who added the mass-timber construction of the office building makes it stand out amid a challenged office environment.\n\nRise of timber\n\nMass-timber construction produces lower carbon emissions compared with concrete and steel construction, attracting big tenants \u2014 such as Walmart and Google \u2014 to these spaces. Walmart's multibillion-dollar mass timber campus in Bentonville, Arkansas, opened its doors last month.\n\nFor large, publicly traded companies, green building techniques \u2014 including mass-timber \u2014 can be looked upon favorably as these Fortune 500 companies seek to lower greenhouse emissions, Triolet said, adding every major Texas city has a mass-timber building on the ground or space available for lease. The appeal of mass-timber construction could shake up Texas cities weighed down by the steel and concrete construction of 1980s-era, he said.\n\n\"Only time will tell if mass-timber is a driver of office leasing, but it doesn't seem like there's much downside risk to it,\" Triolet told CoStar News. \"From a political and environmental standpoint, it makes sense for new office buildings to use more environmentally friendly materials.\"\n\nHoward Hughes plans to complete Bridgeland Green, the greater Houston region's first mass-timber office building, by this summer. Howard Hughes, along with an insurance company, has already leased some of the building's space. Likewise, Hines has landed several tenants for a three-story mass-timber office building that opened in 2023 in Austin. The Houston-based developer told CoStar News it hoped to replicate the mass-timber office building elsewhere.\n\nIf The Soto, a six-story, 141,453-square-foot office building, in San Antonio is any indication of leasing performance for mass-timber office buildings, Triolet said it shows what a few years can do for a mass-timber building in Texas. The building, completed in 2020, is more than 91% leased, according to CoStar data.\n\n\"All of these buildings were speculative, and it looks like they are landing leases,\" he added. \"I think we're going to see more copycat developments in the future.\"\n\nTenant-driven move\n\nToyota Financial Services was seemingly the right office tenant to bet on a mass-timber office building in North Texas, with the automaker's North American headquarters in nearby Plano spanning 2 million square feet of office space across seven buildings on a sprawling 100 acres offering some insight into its desires.\n\nThe 100-acre office campus is centered on sustainability, with more than 20,000 solar panels that produce up to 33% of the hub's daily electricity needs, with the remainder of the electricity coming from nearby wind farms. The campus also harvests about 400,000 gallons of rainwater in a cistern water storage system to help irrigate the landscaping and repurposed in toilets.\n\nLike the Toyota North America campus, the speculative mass-timber office building in Frisco was built with green space in mind, with 22% of the 45-acre tract earmarked for open green space, per city zoning regulations, and the mass-timber construction leading to a 32% smaller carbon footprint compared with typical concrete construction, the developer said. DudaPaine Architects was the design architect, with Gensler being the architect-of-record in North Texas.\n\nEven with the rise of mass-timber office projects, it doesn't always mean there's a tenant waiting to sign a lease, with U.S. office markets still struggling with fragile demand.\n\nIn the greater Atlanta region, the office leasing results have been a little more mixed with Jamestown Properties' 619 Ponce, which combines 87,000 square feet of offices and 27,000 square feet of retail, getting off to a good start by being 70% leased after opening its doors last year.\n\nMeanwhile, another mass-timber office building in Atlanta has struggled to find tenants, despite its high-profile location in the Atlantic Station district. Hines\u2019 T3 West Midtown opened in 2019 with three tenants occupying about a third of the building: Interior Architects, Facebook and Haworth. About 75% of T3 remains vacant.\n\nDespite headwinds tied to the office market, developers could build more mass-timber office projects in the future. Two years ago, Crow Holdings CEO Michael Levy told North Texas real estate executives in an invitation-only discussion with the legendary Herb Weitzman of retail services Weitzman that his team planned to lean into mass-timber projects.\n\nHe said, \"A lot of corporate users have told their stakeholders they will be carbon neutral by some date and so we will develop into that theme. \"\n\nStaff Writer Andy Peters, who covers the greater Atlanta region and architecture, contributed to this article.",

            "content": "The eighth generation of the Celica is currently under development by the Toyota Gazoo Racing division\n\nToyota Motor Corporation recently filed a trademark for the GR Celica nameplate in Brazil.\n\nCompany officials have confirmed the Celica\u2019s return to the lineup in the near future.\n\nThe model will likely feature a new turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, producing up to 400 hp.\n\nToyota has confirmed the Celica nameplate is making a comeback, set to be sold alongside the next-generation GR 86. Now, a newly uncovered trademark filing suggests the revived model will be called the GR Celica, bringing it in line with Toyota\u2019s performance-focused GR lineup.\n\nThe trademark was filed by Toyota Motor Corporation with Brazil\u2019s National Institute of Industrial Property and Ministry of Economy, with an application date of January 15 and a publishing date of February 4. Unfortunately, beyond the name, the filing doesn\u2019t offer any new details about the upcoming eighth-generation sports car.\n\nA Global Launch? Maybe\n\nToyota securing the trademark in Brazil suggests the GR Celica could be sold in South America alongside key markets like Japan and Europe. However, its availability will ultimately depend on Toyota\u2019s broader strategy and whether the car\u2019s powertrain meets regional emissions regulations\u2014both of which remain unclear at this stage.\n\nMore: Everything We Know About The 2026 Toyota RAV4\n\nThe return of the Celica has been heavily rumored for years, despite the fact that the seventh-generation model was discontinued all the way back in 2006 without a direct successor. Toyota finally put speculation to rest in November 2024 when Vice President Yuki Nakajima confirmed at a public event in Japan:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the Celica.\u201d\n\nThe seventh-gen Toyota Celica (1999-2006)\n\nA 400-HP AWD Turbo Coupe?\n\nToyota\u2019s new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, currently in development, seems like a strong candidate for the GR Celica. Reports suggest it could produce up to 400 hp (298 kW / 406 PS) in road-going form. If so, the powertrain would likely be paired with AWD, possibly incorporating the rally-bred GR-Four system from the GR Yaris and GR Corolla hot hatches.\n\nMid-Engined or Traditional Front-Engined Layout?\n\nHistorically, all seven generations of the Celica sold between 1970 and 2006, featured a front-mounted engine. Logic suggests the new model will follow suit, but recent reports from Japan claim the GR Celica could instead adopt a mid-engine layout. This speculation gained traction after Toyota showcased a mid-engined GR Yaris prototype at the Tokyo Auto Salon, initially believed to preview the next MR2.\n\nJapanese publication Best Car recently suggested the Celica and MR2 successors are actually the same car. While that would make sense from an R&D and cost-sharing perspective, it contradicts an earlier comment from a Gazoo Racing driver teasing an \u201cMR-something.\u201d\n\nMore: Toyota Hints At \u2018MR-Something\u2019 Mid-Engine Sports Car With 2.0 Turbo And AWD\n\nFurthermore, an earlier teaser from the Toyota GRIP anime series included both the eighth-gen Celica and the fourth-gen MR2 as part of the brand\u2019s future GR lineup. However, Toyota officials have yet to confirm the new Celica\u2019s powertrain layout, leaving open the possibility that it could share development with the MR2.\n\nWith no official launch date for Toyota\u2019s latest GR lineup addition, we\u2019ll have to wait for more details later this year. In the meantime, the GR Yaris M Concept is set to make its racing debut at the Super Taikyu Series in July 2025, as Toyota continues developing its mid-engine platform.",

            "content": "The Vietnamese builders spent an entire year on the project, resulting in a convincing replica of the Swedish hypercar\n\nThe crew from NHET TV built a convincing Koenigsegg Jesko replica from the ground up.\n\nThe fiberglass body sits on a custom chassis, with power coming from a Toyota engine.\n\nThe replica features inboard suspension and automatic dihedral doors for added realism.\n\nThe Koenigsegg Jesko is a hypercar that\u2019s as rare as it is fast, an absolute beast of a machine that\u2019s virtually unattainable for most of us due to its astronomical price tag and limited production. But leave it to a team of Vietnamese builders to turn heads by creating a convincing replica using parts from an old Toyota sedan.\n\nThis project comes courtesy of NHET TV, a YouTube channel that has become a go-to for hypercar replica fans. If you think this is their first time attempting such a feat, think again. In 2022, they built a Bugatti Chiron, followed by a La Ferrari in 2023, and a Pagani Huayra in 2024. It\u2019s safe to say they\u2019ve mastered the art of automotive fabrication, proving that practice does indeed make perfect.\n\nMore: Vietnamese Builders Create Incredible La Ferrari Replica With Toyota Parts From Scratch\n\nThe journey started with little more than a metal tube skeleton, crafted by referencing photos of the Jesko. This skeletal frame became the foundation for a full-size clay model, which was then used to create the fiberglass bodywork that would ultimately bring the hypercar replica to life.\n\nRather than slap a replica body onto an existing vehicle, the team went all in and built a custom steel chassis. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, they also designed a fully-independent inboard suspension and tested its durability by literally dropping the rolling chassis from a significant height. The result? A replica that stayed true to the proportions of the original Jesko, making it far more believable.\n\nThe body of the Koenigsegg Jesko replica was mounted on a custom chassis.\n\nThe pictured Toyota Corona donated its engine, gearbox, and other mechanical components.\n\nA Toyota Corona Powertrain? Sure, Why Not\n\nThe next step was to find a powertrain. The builders turned to the most unlikely of sources: a ninth-generation Toyota Corona (also known as the Carina E), which was reportedly picked up for just $100. While the car\u2019s body was in rough shape, its drivetrain was still in good working order. The team managed to repurpose not just the engine, but also the gearbox and other critical mechanical components.\n\nThe Toyota\u2019s naturally-aspirated 1.8-liter engine was mounted in the rear-midship position on the custom chassis. While it\u2019s obviously no match for the 1,600 hp (1,193 kW / 1,622 PS) twin-turbo 5.0-liter V8 in the actual Jesko, the Toyota engine is a cheap, reliable solution that keeps things running.\n\nMore: $11k Homemade Cybertruck Is Both Hilarious And Impressive\n\nBack to the bodywork of the replica, it was painted in a vibrant red shade, accented with white stripes and black details. To stay as true to the original as possible, the team crafted custom headlights and taillights, while recreating the oversized aero components of the Jesko Attack, which are designed for maximum downforce. They also added fake brake discs with green calipers.\n\nCustom Details, Inside and Out\n\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive than the cosmetics is that the Vietnamese builders created custom opening parts like the dihedral doors, hood, and rear clamshell. This is one of the toughest aspects of building a vehicle from scratch, especially for those without experience in automotive production.\n\nThe final phase involved fitting the interior panels, which stay true to the original design, though with obviously cheaper plastic and dummy screens. The bucket seats feature light blue upholstery with a diamond-shaped pattern, while the center console includes two cup holders.\n\nAccording to NHET TV, the entire process took a full year, highlighting the dedication of everyone involved. As with their previous replicas, this model wasn\u2019t built for commercial use and isn\u2019t street legal due to missing basic safety features. Still, it\u2019s an impressive project that\u2019s helping the builders hone their skills while generating millions of views on social media\u2014likely their primary source of funding.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about the full process, NHET TV has uploaded a nearly one-hour-long video detailing the build. Check it out below, along with a gallery of screenshots capturing the key moments.\n\nScreenshots: NHET TV / YouTube",

            "content": "January saw plugin EVs take 96.9% share in Norway, up from 93.9% year on year. BEVs alone took almost 96% of the market. Overall auto volume was strongly up on seasonal norms, at 9,343 units, up 82% YoY. The Toyota BZ4X was the best-seller.\n\nJanuary\u2019s auto sales saw combined EVs take 96.9% share in Norway, comprising 95.8% full electrics (BEVs), and 1.0% plugin hybrids (PHEVs). These compare with YoY figures of 93.9% combined, with 92.1% BEV, and 1.8% PHEV.\n\nJanuary is habitually the lowest-volume month of the year for the overall auto market, but this year saw an unusually high volume. This is perhaps because consumers are feeling more optimistic that the economy has recently been somewhat positive and stable following the mid-2023 downturn, and thus feel it is a \u201csafe\u201d time to stretch for a new car (this perspective is also shared by Norway\u2019s OFV).\n\nThere were no substantial changes (as far as I can find, comment if you know otherwise) to the taxation rates for different vehicle powertrains in January 2025, so the month did not see any step-changes in the balance of powertrains. What January did see was the continuing inexorable climb of BEVs.\n\nThe OFV reports that only two auto models in the top 50 overall autos were not BEVs (and the first of them appearing at 34th rank). OFV doesn\u2019t give the details of which models these were, but the usual candidates are the Toyota Yaris, Corolla, or RAV4 hybrid. There may be a Skoda diesel in the mix also.\n\nRegardless, no other powertrain is above 1.5% of the market now, with diesels in that position. HEVs come next at 1.3%, followed by PHEVs at 1.0% and petrol-only at just 0.35% (and 33 units).\n\nBest-Selling Models\n\nThe Toyota BZ4X was the best-selling auto in January, with 863 units, ahead of the Volkswagen ID.4 (542 units), and Nissan Ariya (403).\n\nThe Toyota BZ4X\u2019s lead appears to be due to a batch shipment arriving in January, boosting its total, and representing its personal best performance in Norway. Its average monthly volume over the past 12 months has been slightly over 500 units \u2013 decent, but only enough to put it in 5th spot over this longer period. Let\u2019s see if Toyota supplies a sustained higher volume this year.\n\nThe other top 20 models are familiar faces, and it\u2019s worth noting that the new Audi Q6 e-tron seems to be stabilizing near 10th position, an impressive result given its high price point.\n\nIn terms of new models arriving in Norway for the first time, the Hyundai Inster appeared in January, with just 4 initial units. This is a subcompact \u201cSUV\u201d measuring 3,830 mm in length, with MSRP starting from 231,000 NOK (19,900\u20ac). For more details on the Hyundai Inster, see Jose\u2019s recent summary. Offering a well-thought-out package, at good value, I\u2019d expect the Inster to climb close to the top 20, although \u2014 at almost half a meter shorter than the Volvo EX 30 \u2013 it may be a little too small for most Norwegian car buyers.\n\nAs for recently arriving models, the Opel Grandland followed its 3-unit December debut with a decent 37 units in January. The Audi S6 e-tron climbed to 17 units, up from just single units over the previous two months. The new Dongfang Nammi Box (from 17,200\u20ac) got back to a decent 20 units after having taken an early pause at just 6 units in December (from its November 23-unit debut). Even the MG Cyberster convertible climbed again in January, to 8 units during the Norwegian winter. Perhaps the Cyberster can get to 20 or 30 monthly units in the summer? Let\u2019s wait and see.\n\nHere\u2019s the 3-month chart:\n\nDespite a moderate January, the Tesla Model Y still has a strong lead, built on big November and December volumes. Depending on how quickly the refreshed Model Y can be pushed out (starting in March), it may or may not lead Q1\u2019s rankings. Given the technical refresh, however, coming on top of how overwhelmingly dominant the Model Y was in 2024, it would be unwise to bet against it leading again in 2025. With more and more good BEVs on offer, the Model Y\u2019s lead may shrink, but is unlikely to be overturned.\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 took second place, and the Volkswagen ID.4 came in third. Further back, the only notable trends in the table are a couple of recent climbs. The most significant of these was the Ford Explorer, which had only just arrived in the previous period (August to October), though had already achieved a respectable 20th place. Now it has climbed further, to 10th, a great result for Ford. The other newish model still climbing is the Audi Q6 e-tron, just behind the Ford, in 11th spot, also a great result.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether the Opel Grandland, or the Hyundai Inster, can step into the top 20 in the months ahead \u2013 what do you think? Let us know in the comments.\n\nOutlook\n\nAs noted earlier, the year-on-year growth in the Norwegian auto market seems to reflect the recent broader upturn in the country\u2019s economy, following the downturn in 2023. The latest confirmed macro data remains that from Q3 2024, which saw GDP up a healthy 3.5% YoY. The Q4 figure is forecast at 3.2% YoY growth, though the actual figure will arrive next week. Inflation now stands at 2.2%, and interest rates remain at 4.1%, unchanged in over a year, but expected to fall soon. Manufacturing PMI was 51.2 points in January, up from 50.4 points in December.\n\nAlthough Norway is already at the culmination of the EV transition, the remaining few % share will be helped by the arrival of more affordable BEVs stemming from the Europe-wide emissions tightening rules in 2025. As discussed in recent reports, other underserved niches (like medium-sized pickup trucks) will also see BEV options arriving in 2025, also helping the BEV share fill out the remaining few % of the market.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Norway\u2019s auto market?

The Camry\u2019s high quality cameras all around the car make it much more reliable to check if I\u2019m in between parking lines, as well as backing up so that I don\u2019t hit the car behind me.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly a cut above the cameras I\u2019ve seen in other gas-powered cars, like the Volkswagen Jetta GLI Autobahn, just because it looks as though Toyota\u2019s applying some HDR-like effects that casts an even exposure to the shadows and highlights. And it helps that there\u2019s a lot of detail.\n\nPanoramic sunroof\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / John Velasco)\n\nSunroofs might seem like a common feature in today\u2019s cars, but panoramic ones are usually reserved for much pricier models. That\u2019s why I\u2019m surprised that the Toyota Camry XSE features a sprawling one that makes it feel more like a luxury car.\n\nEven though it\u2019s technically broken up into two panels, this allows the front glass to open completely or vent a little bit if you don\u2019t want too much drag while driving. Either way, it adds to the car\u2019s premium aesthetics \u2014 and makes for a distraction for your rear passengers.\n\nOutstanding adaptive cruise mode\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / John Velasco)\n\nAs much as I continue to dream about being in a reliable, fully-automated car, the Toyota Camry XSE has a feature right now that supplements my driving. It\u2019s called adaptive cruise mode that offers assistive driving in the form of braking the car when needed, as well as nudging me over if I\u2019m drifting into an adjacent lane.\n\nThey\u2019re more like safety features than anything else, but I appreciate how they enhance my driving in the event I\u2019m not as attentive. This is separate from its adaptive cruise control system that will apply braking and acceleration while in cruise control, which is also just as reliable and if not one of the best systems I\u2019ve tested.\n\nFuturistic body design\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / John Velasco)\n\nI\u2019m familiar with the design of the Camry, but this year\u2019s model looks like it\u2019s adopted the same futuristic design cues of the latest Prius models \u2014 and I love it! From the side, it clearly isn\u2019t afraid of making itself known as a full-sized design with its elongated looks.\n\nHowever, I love how the front features a tapered design that\u2019s accentuated by the oblong-shaped honeycomb pattern of the grill. And with its sleek looking headlights, it definitely looks a lot more futuristic looking than most cars on the road.\n\nHead up display\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / John Velasco)\n\nThe $42,459 cost of the Camry I tested comes included with the Premium Plus Package that adds on a heads-up display. Not only is it super sharp and bright, but it helps me to keep focus on the road as opposed to constantly looking down to check my speed. That\u2019s because it supports CarPlay and Android Auto wirelessly, which also displays navigational directions on when and where to turn with their native map apps.\n\nAffordable\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / John Velasco)\n\nCost has been a prohibitive factor in the growth of EVs, which is why sales have slowed tremendously. Hybrid cars, with their lower price point and excellent fuel efficiency, offer a compelling alternative for buyers.\n\nDespite the hefty $42,459 cost of the specific model I tested, the base trim of the Camry at $28,700 makes it much more obtainable than the cheapest EVs. With its futuristic design and an EPA-estimated 51 mpg combined fuel economy, the Camry offers strong appeal to buyers across a range of budgets.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry XSE: What I Don't Like\n\nOverwhelming cluster display\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / John Velasco)\n\nThe reason why I rely a lot on the heads-up display is because the cluster display right above the steering wheel can be overwhelming to look at. There\u2019s a lot of information displayed on it, like the odometer, fuel economy, engine temperature, and all the other icons on there.\n\nIt\u2019s very busy and even though there\u2019s the option to customize it, I wish there was a simplified version that only shows the most important details about my driving. However, this isn\u2019t isolated to the Camry because the same overwhelming display is also on the Lexus RX450h+ and Lexus RZ 450e.\n\nNo driver seat settings\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / John Velasco)\n\nDespite all of its features, the one thing I find oddly missing is the option to save driver seat settings \u2014 so that the position of the driver\u2019s seat can be switched between two people. Unfortunately there are no physical controls on the armrest for this, nor could I find a setting in the software either. It\u2019s just one of those things you expect in any modern car.\n\nReal world fuel economy could be better\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / John Velasco)\n\nToyota claims that the XSE AWD trim is capable of achieving a combined fuel economy of 44 mpg. I didn\u2019t get close to that in my week\u2019s worth of driving. I\u2019ll admit that the 36.7 mpg fuel economy is still decent for a full-sized sedan, but I would\u2019ve loved to see it exceed the 40 mpg mark to make it a more compelling option. If it\u2019s not close to achieving that, then there\u2019s no way it will after several years of driving it.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry XSE: Bottom Line\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / John Velasco)\n\nHonestly, I could see myself buying the 2025 Toyota Camry XSE AWD because of its smooth driving, excellent assistive cruise mode, and all the premium features it packages to make it feel much like some pricey luxury vehicles I\u2019ve driven \u2014 plus it can comfortably seat four adults, making it perfect family car.\n\nPerhaps it could\u2019ve been my driving, or simply that I needed to drive it more, but I was hoping to get better fuel economy out of it. Regardless of that, I think it\u2019s a hybrid worth considering if EVs are still too expensive for your budget. And of course, you get Toyota\u2019s legendary reliability and extra resell value.",

            "content": "It\u2019s to put the all-new 6th-generation 2025 Toyota 4Runner on the Ike GauntletTM \u2013 the world\u2019s toughest towing test. We want to see exactly how it compares to the new Toyota Land Cruiser (250 series), so we are pulling the same 5,500 lbs trailer. Both, the new 4Runner and the new Land Cruiser have 6,000 lbs maximum tow ratings. We did not expect the 4Runner to be considerably better\u2026 Here\u2019s what happened.\n\nThanks to Granger Warranty for making this Ike GauntletTM video possible. They are the top sellers of factory-backed extended warranty for new and used vehicles. Take a look and save some money on the coverage.\n\nWe physically could not do this test without the Weigh-Safe hitches. There are made of aluminum, they are lightweight and very tough.\n\nWe measure the Tow/Haul driving mode on the way down the mountain and how it manages downhill grade shifting in order to keep speeds in check. We count brake applications in order to bring the speed from 61 MPH (the speed limit is 60 MPH) to 50 MPH. We crest the top of the mountain at 50 MPH because this is the speed limit inside the tunnel.\n\nThe Ike GauntletTM is an 8-mile stretch of I-70 in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. It\u2019s a steep 7% grade.\n\nThe new 4Runner surprises us with 8 brake applications (8.5 applications because I had to slow down a little due to traffic). This is not the best results we have ever seen, but it\u2019s significantly better than the 12 brake applications that the Land Cruiser hybrid needed to descend the same mountain.\n\nOn the way up, it\u2019s the test of power, acceleration, and cabin comfort. The new 4Runner is powered by the same engine as the new Tacoma pickup truck. It\u2019s a 2.4-liter turbocharged four cylinder with 278 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. It\u2019s mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission and it has a part-timer 4\u00d74 system. It means that we run the entire Ike Gauntlet in 2WD (rear wheel drive).\n\nThe 4Runner took 14 seconds to accelerate from 35 MPH to 60 MPH up the merge lane. The cabin is very quiet. We measured 60-61 dB inside when driving at 60 MPH up the mountain grade. In the end, the 4Runner made it up in just under 8 minutes, which is the perfect benchmark time to make this 8-mile run. The 4Runner trip meter showed 6.2 MPG, which is better than the Land Cruiser\u2019s 5.8 MPG with the same load.\n\nThe 4Runner offers an optional trailer brake controller for $400. We recommend you get this option if you plan to pull any trailers with electric brakes that weigh above 2,000-3,000 pounds.",

            "content": "The move to China is the car manufacturer\u2019s first fully owned EV manufacturing initiative in China. In the past, it relied exclusively on joint ventures with local companies, including GAC Group and FAQ Group, due to the Chinese government\u2019s stringent restrictions requiring all foreign manufacturers to partner with a Chinese company on the ground.\n\nHowever, Toyota is taking advantage of China\u2019s policy changes initiated in 2018, which allows foreign car manufacturers to open wholly owned car manufacturing operations in the country. The move will make Toyota only the third foreign car manufacturer to establish wholly owned manufacturing operations in China, after Volkswagen and Tesla.\n\nProduction is expected to begin in 2027, with an expected annual capacity of 100,000 units and 1,000 jobs during its startup phase. Alongside vehicle production, Toyota has already made plans to work with the Shanghai Municipal Government on its carbon neutrality plans, which are expected to be completed in 2060.\n\nToyota\u2019s move is part of the car company\u2019s wider strategy of improving its presence within the world\u2019s single-largest auto market. However, it already faces considerable competition from Chinese car manufacturers, which already have a stranglehold on the Chinese market, including Chery, Geely, and BYD.\n\nThey also see an opportunity to take advantage of one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing EV markers. According to FT.com, China\u2019s EV market has already established the country as the global leader in production and adoption. The latest statistics reveal that 60% of the world\u2019s new energy vehicles are made in China, with big investments in charging infrastructure, competitive domestic manufacturers, and strong government support seen as the most significant contributors to the country\u2019s position.\n\nWith China\u2019s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, Toyota sees an opportunity to benefit from the country\u2019s evolving market dynamics and challenge its domestic manufacturers as it capitalizes on new demand for luxury EVs.\n\nShould Toyota\u2019s gambit succeed, there\u2019s the potential that it will reap the rewards of getting in on the ground floor and encourage other foreign car manufacturers to establish operations in the country.",

You can also contact Toyota's customer service line at 1-800-331-4331 with any questions you might have.\n\nIf you do receive a notice this spring, it will provide instructions for what you need to do. Usually, you'll just schedule an appointment with your local Toyota dealer. They'll inspect your vehicle and make the repair free of charge if a repair is necessary.\n\nHow to find out if your vehicle is affected by a recall\n\nBelieve it or not, recalls are hard to chase down sometimes. One time I took my car in for an oil change and was surprised to find I had an outstanding recall. Thankfully, the dealership took care of it promptly.\n\nAnd this isn't an uncommon thing: There are almost 60 million vehicles in the U.S. with an open safety recall. Keep in mind recalls could impact anything from safety to vehicle performance, so staying on top of these things is essential.\n\nBut how? If you don't receive notices from your manufacturer, you might be in the dark on how to look for recalls. Thankfully, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a lookup tool you can use. All you need is your license plate number or VIN to search for recalls.\n\nIs your car insurance rate affected by open recalls?\n\nWhile you're checking for any open recalls on your vehicle, it might also be a good time to review your car insurance \u2014 especially if your policy renewal is coming up. Some insurers take vehicle safety into account, and keeping up with recalls may help ensure you\u2019re getting the best possible rate.\n\nWith the average cost of full coverage car insurance being $2,670 annually, comparing quotes could be a simple way to find potential savings.

We\u2019ve also added a second render, based on a recent leak from China, which is believed to show the domestic-market Toyota Wildlander.\n\nToyota\u2019s wildly popular RAV4 continues to dominate sales charts, having ended the Ford F-150\u2019s reign as America\u2019s best-selling vehicle in 2024 after many years and, in the process, printing money for the Japanese automaker, even as new competitors line up for a piece of the action. As the fifth-generation RAV4 approaches the end of its current lifecycle, Toyota is preparing to replace it, but don\u2019t expect a complete reinvention.\n\nFuture Cars: Everything We Know About The 2026 Subaru Outback\n\nRecently spotted testing in Metro Detroit following multiple sightings in Japan, the upcoming RAV4 appears to be in for a significant visual update. However, it might not be as extensive as most full redesigns that we have come to know. Much like the latest Camry, the new model is expected to retain the existing platform and powertrains. While the exterior gets a sleek new polish, there are clear signs that this isn\u2019t an \u201call-new\u201d model in the traditional sense.\n\nEvolutionary Design\n\nIllustrations Josh Byrnes / Carscoops\n\nWhen the current fifth-gen RAV4 debuted in 2018 at the New York Auto Show, it stood out with its sharper and more aggressive styling, a clear departure from the softer designs of its immediate predecessors. Even today, it still looks fresh. For 2026, the design remains familiar but with subtle aerodynamic tweaks here and there.\n\nThe front fascia embraces Toyota\u2019s latest design language, as seen on the Prius and the new Camry. It sports wrap-around DRLs with hammerhead inner sections and a honeycomb grille. We expect a few differences from our preliminary illustration that\u2019s based on prototypes spied in Japan, so the final product may look squarer with more contrasting elements.\n\nFrom the side, the RAV4 maintains its recognizable silhouette, with two-tone roof options and bold contrasting lower cladding. The glasshouse and pillar layout are nearly identical to the current model. Around back, you\u2019ll likely see a full-width LED taillight cluster paired with squared-off lower cladding that features silver inlays for a modern touch.\n\nGiven Honda\u2019s recent announcement of a more rugged CR-V TrailSport trim coming later this year as part of a mid-cycle facelift, it\u2019s highly likely that Toyota won\u2019t want to be left behind in this growing segment. To stay competitive, Toyota may tap into its off-road expertise, introducing a rugged TRD Pro trim similar to what\u2019s offered in the latest 4Runner.\n\nWhat About the Leaked Photo?\n\nA leaked image of what\u2019s belived to be the 2026 Toyota Wildlander, China\u2019s version of the new RAV4.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that our original rendering was created before the leaked photo, which allegedly surfaced on a backscreen during a media presentation in China. The vehicle in question is believed to be the successor to the Toyota Wildlander, a China-only version of the RAV4, developed in partnership with FAW and sold by GAC domestically.\n\nCompared to the international RAV4, the current Wildlander features distinct front and rear fascias. At this point, it\u2019s unclear whether the next-generation RAV4 and Wildlander will retain their mild styling differences or converge into a single, unified design.\n\nChina\u2019s current 2025 Toyota Wildlander (above) and North America\u2019s 2025 Toyota RAV4 (below).\n\nUnder The Skin\n\nWe\u2019ve yet to catch a glimpse of the new RAV\u2019s interior. However, if the redesigned Camry is anything to go by, expect higher-quality materials and an improved tech roster compared to the current car. Internal dimensions? We don\u2019t anticipate much change here.\n\nThe tech roster will likely include an expansive infotainment display with sharper graphics and support for Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Amazon Alexa for enhanced voice recognition control of various functions. Premium touches such as a head-up display (HUD), panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, and wireless charging are also expected to carry over.\n\nAs for underpinnings, it will likely use the current model\u2019s TNGA-K architecture with improvements to crashworthiness to help it pass more stringent IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) crash test protocols.\n\nEV and Hybrid Power\n\nBaldauf / Carscoops\n\nRumors have been circulating about Toyota\u2019s new 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, but it\u2019s unlikely to make its way into the sixth-generation RAV4. Instead, the 2026 model could go hybrid-only, featuring a powertrain similar to the latest Camry, with slight improvements in both power and efficiency over the current version.\n\nIf the Camry\u2019s setup is any indication, the new RAV4 may feature a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with two electric motors in front-wheel drive form, producing a combined 225 hp (168 kW / 228 PS). The all-wheel-drive variant will add a rear-mounted motor, enhancing traction in all conditions and boosting total output to 232 hp (173 kW / 235 PS). After the launch of the standard hybrid models, a plug-in hybrid variant is also expected to join the lineup.\n\nThe more significant news lies in the possibility of a fully electric variant. Details are slim, but word is revisions to the TNGA-K platform have considered full electrification. If Toyota goes down this path, we won\u2019t see silly BZ4X-like nomenclature again.\n\nRivals and Reveal\n\nThe new VW Tiguan (Photo Stephen Rivers / Carscoops)\n\nThe RAV4\u2019s next iteration will face stiff competition in a crowded segment. Rivals like Mazda\u2019s all-new CX-5 hybrid, the Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester, Kia Sportage, Hyundai Tucson, and Ford Escape are all aiming for a slice of the compact SUV pie.\n\n2026 Mazda CX-5: After 9 Years, New SUV Coming With Big Changes In Tow\n\nToyota is expected to officially unveil the updated RAV4 later this year, with sales likely starting in the fall as a 2026 model. Unless Toyota surprises us with a non-hybrid base variant, pricing is expected to remain in the same range as the current hybrid version, starting in the low $30,000s.\n\nWhat do you think of the RAV4\u2019s heavily revised new appearance? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nBaldauf / Carscoops",

According to Pennlive, the rear brake hoses in these vehicles can be damaged over time due to a build-up of mud and dirt in the rear wheels. This could typically arise when there is more off-roading of these vehicles, and if this phenomenon occurs, a brake fluid leak could occur, resulting in a fatal crash.In the case of Camry and Lxus, its second-row center seatbelt could be weaker and may have been damaged during the manufacturing process. They may not have the expected strength that is required to ensure maximum safety of the passenger, says the report.As of now, nearly 140,000 Toyota cars across different models are being recalled.The reason for the Toyota recall is mainly vehicle safety issues.",

Toyota and its Chemical Engineering Division are working on a new way to recycle batteries without releasing greenhouse gases.\n\nBut let us take a step back. Today,' recalls the Japanese group, ' spent batteries are treated in an incineration plant, before the rare metals are collected and further processed. However,' he adds, 'the combustion process results in the loss of some recyclable materials and the production of large amounts of CO2.\n\nMore materials and less CO2\n\nInstead, Toyota's engineers came up with a different system: \"The electrolyte fluid in the batteries, which promotes the movement of the ions, is highly flammable\".\n\n\"To eliminate the risk of fire during processing, this electrolyte fluid is distilled and extracted. The battery cells are then shredded, sorted and fed back into the production process. The recovered parts are large pieces containing aluminium or iron or the so-called 'black mass', a powder containing various rare metals. The recovered raw materials are then further processed by partner companies to produce new batteries\".\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Toyota tests a new recycling method for electric car batteries\n\nNew jobs\n\nThis could revolutionise an industry that needs to adapt to new EU rules to produce more batteries made in the EU.\n\n\"It is crucial to consider the life cycle of a car holistically\", comments Yumi Otsuka, chief sustainability officer of Toyota.

Chances are, you know someone in your community who has experienced a TBI. \u200b Despite their frequency, there\u2019s a significant gap in knowledge, resources, funding, and care.\n\nWatch the video below to hear more about the project.\n\nThe WFF grant will create Driscoll\u2019s Heads Up: Concussion Care for Kids Program at London ISD. The new concussion care program is an initiative to support people impacted by significant injuries, starting with a focus on children recovering from traumatic brain injury.\n\nPhase two of the program will expand to other school districts, further increasing access to care for students across the community. As part of the program, specialized training will empower school staff and families to make informed decisions about an athlete\u2019s health, ensuring that student safety remains the top priority both on and off the field.\n\nAccording to National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), TBI is a major pediatric health condition that is often under-recognized, and urgent and long-term care are often under-resourced.

            "content": "You'll get up to 37 mpg combined in the Honda CR-V Hybrid with all-wheel drive, per the EPA's estimates. It uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder (the nonhybrid CR-V uses a turbo 1.5-liter) with two electric motors feeding off a 1.1-kWh battery pack, producing a combined 204 horsepower. As for the Toyota RAV4, it returns up to 39 mpg combined from its 2.5-liter engine, dual electric motors, and 1.6-kWh battery. Its hybrid system provides the most power out of the bunch, with 219 horsepower. Toyota is also one of the few automakers that offers a plug-in hybrid powertrain in its crossover. The RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid is a little pricier than the standard hybrid, but it gets up to 38 mpg and can travel up to 42 miles on electricity alone.\n\nThe Subaru's key advantages\n\nAll of these hybrid crossovers offer all-wheel drive, whether it's standard or available as an option. Here's where the Forester Hybrid makes up for the lack of mpgs: Subaru uses its Symmetrical AWD system, which is permanently active, continuously sending power to all four wheels. Other all-wheel-drive systems, like Toyota's Electronic On-Demand All-Wheel Drive and Honda's Real Time AWD with Intelligent Control System, are part-time systems, meaning they operate in front-wheel drive most of the time until extra traction is needed. This is one of the ways Subaru has positioned itself well as a rugged adventure brand. Inside, the Subaru Forester gets an 11.6-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It's not our favorite system, but Subaru also added a 12.3-inch digital gauge display. Base models come with smaller screens, but in the CR-V, there's an available 9-inch display, and in the RAV4 Hybrid, a 10.5-inch infotainment screen is available on higher trims.",

Locked in a decades-long battle for midsize sedan supremacy, both of these cars are at the top of their game with spacious interiors, excellent fuel economy, and the latest technologies, all with reasonable pricing and outstanding resale value.\n\nLet\u2019s compare the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry to see which gets the upper hand in 2025.\n\n2025 Honda Accord\n\nThe Honda Accord is a stalwart in midsize sedans for good reasons. Now in its 11th generation, the Accord lineup consists of a turbo gas engine for its LX and SE trims while every other trim has a hybrid powertrain. Pricing starts at $29,390.\n\nHonda Accord Highlights\n\nTwo engine options: While the Toyota Camry is hybrid only, the Honda Accord still offers a choice between a hybrid powertrain and a more conventional turbocharged gas engine. We prefer the hybrid but appreciate the variety.\n\nMore interior space: The Honda Accord has more backseat legroom and a slightly bigger trunk than the Toyota Camry. Both of these midsize sedans are pretty roomy, but the Accord is the roomier of the two.\n\nClass-leading resale value: This is a close one, but the resale value of the Honda Accord is a little better than that of the Toyota Camry. That means a little extra money in your pocket when it\u2019s time to sell or trade in.\n\nRead our Honda Accord Expert Review or see 2025 Honda Accord models for sale near you.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry\n\nAmong the things Toyota does well are hybrids and midsize sedans. When the ninth generation of the Camry debuted for 2025, Toyota decided to make it hybrid-only with impressive combined fuel economy ratings ranging from 46 to 51 mpg, depending on the configuration. Pricing starts at $29,795.\n\nToyota Camry Highlights\n\nBetter fuel economy: The Toyota Camry has a standard hybrid powertrain with an outstanding maximum combined fuel economy rating of up to 51 mpg. Meanwhile, the most efficient version of the Honda Accord Hybrid returns 48 combined mpg.\n\nAvailable AWD: All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on the Toyota Camry and unavailable on the Honda Accord. If this is a must-have feature for you, then the Camry is the way to go.\n\nMore affordable hybrid: The Toyota Camry and Honda Accord have similar starting prices, but the most affordable hybrid version of the Accord costs about $5,000 more than the Camry\u2019s. The Toyota saves you money both at the dealership and at the fuel pump.\n\nRead our Toyota Camry Expert Review or see 2025 Toyota Camry models for sale near you.\n\nSimilarities\n\nThese two midsize sedans have a lot in common in terms of sizing, pricing, and overall quality and reliability.

Toyota says it was able to achieve a high level of profit due production recovery in Japan and other improvement efforts it made in the first half of the period.\n\nThe automaker forecasts that its full-year consolidated vehicles sales will reach 9.4 million units. Revenue is expected to reach 4,700 billion yen ($309.2 billion), which is 400 billion yen ($2.6 billion) higher than its previous forecast. Operating income is forecast to reach $30.9 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, which represents roughly a 10% margin if Toyota achieves its goal.\n\nToyota said its full-year forecast was revised based on improvement efforts in the first half of the year, including product competitiveness and value chain earnings, according to its financial report.",

            "content": "A new RAV4 launches this year but the old one enjoyed huge demand in 2024, Jato Dynamics says\n\nToyota\u2019s RAV4 was the best-selling individual model in 2024, Jato Dynamics data shows.\n\nThe RAV\u2019s ascent to P1 ended the Ford F-150\u2019s four-decade run at the top of the table.\n\nRAV4 sales grew 9 percent even though a successor is due; F-150 dropped 5 percent.\n\nPresidents come and go, and gas prices ebb and flow, but for over 40 years there\u2019s one thing Americans have been able to rely on, and it\u2019s that the Ford F-150 is the country\u2019s favorite vehicle. But that tradition ended in 2024, when The Toyota RAV4 knocked the F-150 off the top spot, industry figures show.\n\nF-150 sales dropped 5 percent to 460,915 last year, according to data from Jato Dynamics, while Toyota RAV4 registrations increased by 9 percent to 475,193. The RAV has been snapping at the F-150\u2019s heels for several years, but it\u2019s never managed to topple it before. When the F-Series was crowned best selling vehicle in 2023, it was the 42nd time the Blue Oval truck had achieved the feat.\n\nRelated: 2026 Toyota RAV4 Spied In America, Could Go Hybrid-Only\n\nJato Dynamics\u2019 global analyst Felipe Munoz notes that other figures coming out in the next few days or weeks might show a different outcome, but if they do it\u2019ll be because they\u2019ll be referring to the wider F-series family, including the F-150, F-250 and F-350, while this list is only concerned with single models.\n\nWhat makes the RAV4\u2019s achievement all the more impressive is that the SUV managed it in its twilight years. The current RAV debuted in 2018 and Toyota is expected to unveil an all-new model this summer. We\u2019ve already seen prototypes testing and two weeks ago a leaked photo surfaced online allegedly taken at a dealer event and showing the Chinese version of the future RAV4, the Wildlander.\n\nCredit: Felipe Munoz/Jato Dynamics\n\nGetting back to Jato\u2019s best-sellers list, the Honda CRV grew its sales by 11 percent to 402,791, but the fifth-placed Tesla Model Y shrank 3 percent to 372,613, perhaps in part because buyers knew the facelifted model, revealed last month, was on the horizon.\n\nChevy\u2019s Silverado slipped a couple of percent but the Camry (up 7 percent) and Corolla (up 22 percent) gave Toyota even more reasons to smile. The Nissan Rogue, Honda Civic and GMC Sierra 1500 rounded out the first 10, which notably, did not contain a single Stellantis product.\n\nMunoz and Jato also catalogued 2024\u2019s sales according to brands, the data again showing Toyota on top with just shy of 2.04 million registrations (up 6 percent), with Ford in second place (1.96 million, up 3 percent), and Chevrolet in third spot (1.73 million, up 2 percent). Looking at the automaker group numbers, however, both Toyota and Ford conceded to GM. Check out Munoz\u2019s post below to see the full data sheets.\n\nUpdate: Ford\u2019s Response on F-Series Truck Sales\n\nFord reached out to provide a statement regarding the findings:\n\n\u201cAll Ford F-Series trucks, from F-150 to F-600, share a common cab architecture from the A-pillar to the C-pillar. We offer multiple ICE, EV and hybrid powertrains, frames and exterior style choices depending on trim series and work needs. Other vehicles, like Toyota RAV4 or Porsche 911, also offer multiple powertrains, driveline options, engines, chassis and styling choices for their customers, depending on customer needs and use.\u201c\n\nTo clarify, as we\u2019ve already noted in the article, Jato Dynamics is specifically referring to F-150 sales, not the broader F-Series range, which we\u2019ve covered in previous articles like this one. We also want to highlight that the differences between an F-150 and an F-600 are far more significant than those between, for example, a Toyota RAV4 and RAV4 Hybrid, or a Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and the GTS.",

Meanwhile, Toyota revealed separate plans to challenge BYD and other EV leaders in China.\n\nToyota will begin building EV batteries in the US in April\n\nA little over three years after Toyota revealed plans to build a new EV battery plant in North Carolina, the facility is about to open its doors.\n\nAfter releasing Q3 earnings on Wednesday, the company announced that the Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina (TBMNC) plant had finished preparations. Toyota said the facility \u201cis ready to begin production and will start shipping batteries for North American electrified vehicles in April.\u201d\n\nThe plant will produce batteries for Toyota electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), and hybrid models.

The plant will finally begin shipping batteries in April. When fully operational, Toyota expects output to reach over 30 GWh annually.\n\n(Source: Toyota)\n\nIn a separate press release on Wednesday, Toyota announced it will establish a wholly-owned company in Shanghai, China, to produce EVs and batteries for the Lexus brand.\n\nAccording to Toyota, local Chinese companies \u201cwill take the lead in planning and developing BEVs\u201d as it looks to keep pace with BYD and other domestic EV makers.

In comparison, Japan\u2019s Honda sold over 33,000 Prologue models in the US in 2024, and it began deliveries in March. Even the Nissan Ariya outsold the bZ4X with nearly 19,800 models sold.\n\nThe situation is even more severe in China, where Toyota is losing ground to low-cost domestic EVs. After sales fell 9% in China last year, Toyota blamed \u201cthe shift to new energy vehicles\u201d and \u201cintensifying price competition.\u201d\n\nCan Toyota turn things around?

Even better, because the new 4Runner's seating position is lower, you no longer feel like you're sitting on the car. The view out down the hood is clear, and side and rear visibility is pretty good too. The 4Runner might look huge and rugged, but it doesn't feel intimidating to drive. That said, it's still a truck, and the compromises made for this off-road-focused Trailhunter trim make it somewhat ponderous and discombobulated on the road. The dampers are too firm (likely to cope with big impacts off-road) and the springs are too soft \u2014 the result on the road is an immense, completely uncontrolled amount of body roll whether you're braking, turning or accelerating. The sensations of brake dive, squat under acceleration, and lean in the corners are almost comical (until you start to get sick, as I did). And it's not like that roly-poly character is made up for by ride comfort. Every impact, no matter how small, is translated straight from the road surface into your backside.\n\nThe new 4Runner drives far too similarly to the new Tacoma. The Land Cruiser does a far, far better job of managing itself on the road. The ride is more composed, road imperfections are properly absorbed, and when you're at speed it is far, far quieter. It also benefits from slightly sharper, more accurate steering and a brake pedal that more neatly blends together regenerative and friction braking. Simply put, everything about the Land Cruiser has more engineering polish. Even the simple fact that there are fewer interior plastics means there's less creaking and better sound insulation from the outside world. If the 4Runner is a great deal of individual parts doing their best to work together, the Land Cruiser was hewn from a single block of marble \u2014 it's just so much more solid.",

The battery plant in the U.S. will create some 5,000 jobs, according to Toyota.\n\nToyota\u2019s push also comes as worries grow around Asia about a potential trade war brewing after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs to take effect Feb. 10.\n\nImage\n\n\u201cWe have always tried to be a company that will be loved wherever we do our business. That has never waffled,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Miyazaki told reporters without addressing the tariffs.\n\nAlso Feb. 5, Toyota reported fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 61% from the previous fiscal year to 2.19 trillion yen ($14 billion), on 12.4 trillion yen ($81 billion) sales, up 3% on-year.\n\nToyota officials said sales were recovering from the drop earlier this fiscal year after some production was suspended over a certification scandal in Japan.\n\nLast year, Toyota acknowledged wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of the vehicles, and only affected production in Japan.\n\nToyota revised its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 to 4.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) from the previous projection for a 3.6 trillion yen ($24 billion) profit, thanks to the positive effect of the foreign exchange rate and cost reduction efforts. The new projection still falls short of what Toyota racked up the previous fiscal year at 4.9 trillion yen.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nThe new company in China is part of Toyota\u2019s drive to meet the high demand for EVs in China, according to Toyota. Toyota already has China FAW Group Co. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. as its longtime partners in China, and those will continue unchanged, he said.\n\nToyota said it hopes to contribute to the Chinese government\u2019s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\n\u201cLocal Chinese members will take the lead in planning and developing BEVs that match the unique needs of Chinese customers.

However, as today's results showed, it's navigating the difficult auto market far better than rivals.\n\nToyota beats and announces EV investments\n\nUnlike some of its electric vehicle (EV) and legacy auto rivals reporting this earnings season, Toyota's results were stronger than expected. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, ended Dec. 31, 2024, was $80 billion and earnings per share was $1.07, well ahead of the $77 billion and $0.64 predicted by Wall Street analysts. While auto sales were down 4% in the quarter, this was relatively better than feared. Toyota also bumped up its profit outlook for the fiscal year ending in March to $31 billion, up from a prior outlook of $28 billion.\n\nRelative to rivals, Toyota has been more deliberate in making the costly electric vehicle transition, instead focusing on hybrids. That appeared to pay off, as hybrid vehicles rose to 50% of sales, up from 40% last year.\n\nStill, Toyota isn't shying away from electrification. Management also announced a new investment in battery production in North Carolina, which can supply both hybrids and battery-only electric vehicles. It's also developing an electric vehicle production plant in Shanghai, China, where it will produce Lexus-branded vehicles for the Chinese market. Of note, China has adopted all-electric vehicles to a much greater extent than the U.S. or Europe.\n\nToyota's pragmatism makes it a strong stock\n\nElectric vehicle growth has slowed dramatically over the past two years, hurting companies like Tesla, which posted declines in revenue and profits last year, as well as legacy automakers aggressively attempting the transition.\n\nHowever, Toyota's more deliberate approach, focusing on hybrids and only investing in electric vehicles where there is apparent demand, like China, seems to have been the better approach.\n\nStill trading at a P/E ratio below 10, Toyota looks like a solid value stock.",

            "content": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Toyota is developing and making electric vehicles and EV batteries in China, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday, under a new partnership with the Shanghai government.\n\nToyota Motor Corp. also announced it will start producing batteries for EVs, hybrids and plug-ins at a new $14 billion facility in North Carolina, with shipping starting for North American models in April.\n\nThe moves highlight Toyota\u2019s aggressive push in electric cars, a sector where some critics have said it\u2019s fallen behind rivals like Tesla and BYD at a time when the Chinese EV market is booming and the world\u2019s concerns about sustainability are increasingly crucial.\n\nToyota is setting up a company in Jinshan district in southwest Shanghai for that effort, with production of the new Lexus EVs starting in 2027.\n\nInitial production capacity there totals 100,000 vehicles a year, which will create about 1,000 jobs, the world\u2019s top automaker said. The battery plant in the U.S. will create some 5,000 jobs, according to Toyota.\n\nToyota\u2019s push also comes as worries grow around Asia about a potential trade war brewing after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs to take effect next week.\n\n\u201cWe have always tried to be a company that will be loved wherever we do our business. That has never waffled,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Miyazaki told reporters without addressing the tariffs.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Toyota reported fiscal third quarter profit jumped 61% from the previous fiscal year to 2.19 trillion yen ($14 billion), on 12.4 trillion yen ($81 billion) sales, up 3% on-year.\n\nToyota officials said sales were recovering from the drop earlier this fiscal year after some production was suspended over a certification scandal in Japan.\n\nLast year, Toyota acknowledged wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of the vehicles, and only affected production in Japan.\n\nToyota revised its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 to 4.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) from the previous projection for a 3.6 trillion yen ($24 billion) profit, thanks to the positive effect of the foreign exchange rate and cost reduction efforts. The new projection still falls short of what Toyota racked up the previous fiscal year at 4.9 trillion yen.\n\nThe new company in China is part of Toyota\u2019s drive to meet the high demand for EVs in China, according to Toyota. Toyota already has China FAW Group Co. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. as its longtime partners in China, and those will continue unchanged, he said.\n\nToyota said it hopes to contribute to the Chinese government\u2019s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\n\u201cLocal Chinese members will take the lead in planning and developing BEVs that match the unique needs of Chinese customers. Our goal is to become a company that is more loved and supported by the people of China,\u201d said Miyazaki.\n\n___\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.net/@yurikageyama",

Now for the 6th gen, it\u2019s emerged as an all-new adventure vehicle down for anything mother nature throws at it.\n\nWe waited roughly fifteen years for a new 4Runner. Was it worth the wait? Toyota invited us to a First Drive outside San Diego to find out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m behind the wheel of the all-new 2025 Toyota 4Runner. Right now I\u2019m at Vogt Ranch going off-roading and so far today is a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nThe 2025 Toyota 4Runner now offers two powertrains, including a hybrid, and nine grades that include the first ever Trailhunter and Platinum grades.\n\nThe base powertrain is a 2.4-liter turbo four cylinder i-force engine which is standard on the SR5, TRD Sport, n TRD Sport Premium and available on other grades. It offers up to 278 hp and 317 lb ft or torque.\n\nA 2.4-liter turbocharged i-FORCE MAX hybrid powertrain is standard on the TRD Pro, Trailhunter, and Platinum and available on other grades. The i-FORCE MAX hybrid produces up to 326 hp and 465 lb ft of torque. So it has substantially more power and torque than the standard engine and compared to last year\u2019s V6, this new hybrid powertrain greatly improves fuel economy to an EPA estimated 24 MPG highway rating.\n\nBoth engines have an 8-speed automatic transmission with optional 4-wheel drive.\n\n\u201cSo far it\u2019s handling really well, it\u2019s very capable on the trails.\u201d\n\nThe mid-size 4Runner uses the same basic, very stiff body-on-frame platform as the Tacoma, Tundra, Land Cruiser and Sequoia which results in a more comfortable ride. As I drove through the off-road trails, 4Runner\u2019s great ground clearance and advanced multi-terrain management systems were especially helpful while off-roading.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m noticing its traction for 2025 is really impressive.\u201d\n\nAs I mentioned earlier there are nine grades to choose from for 2025, the Trailhunter is built for overlanding and comes standard with off-road equipment from Old Man EMU.\n\n\u201cI found a secret compartment in this Trailhunter. Check this out, you turn it and then pull it out of here and it actually becomes a flashlight that you can take with you. It has several different modes as well which is really great.\u201d\n\nFor 2025, 4Runner even offers a luxury experience with the first ever Platinum grade. It includes unique black exterior styling elements, premium leather trimmed seats and a standard tow tech package.\n\n\u201cAnd not to worry, the fan favorite novelty feature- the power back window didn\u2019t go anywhere. It\u2019s been around since the first gen.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s still standard on all models.\n\nInside 4Runner, there are a lot of positive changes. It feels spacious and has a rugged and bold aesthetic yet it\u2019s modern and tech-savvy with more available features than ever before. There\u2019s a giant available 14-inch multimedia touchscreen that\u2019s easy to operate plus several USB-C ports and a wireless charging pad.\n\n4Runner does have an available third row and can now tow 6-thousand pounds.\n\nAs we found out during our California adventure, 4Runner is up for anything and proved it\u2019s just as refined off road as it is on road.\n\nThe 2025 4Runner is starting to arrive in dealerships now. Pricing starts at around $41-thousand dollars. We\u2019ll have much more on the all-new 2025 Toyota 4Runner coming up soon on MotorWeek.",

            "sentiment": null,
            "probability": null,
            "content": "The Toyota Tacoma has always been the safe play. You want good resale value? You got it. Want reliability? Look at the badge on the grille. Want simplicity? It just ditched rear drum brakes last year. And while my only evidence is anecdotal, I believe that\u2019s why the Tacoma has topped the segment\u2019s sales charts for more than two decades running. So what happens now that Toyota has flipped the script and turned the Tacoma TRD Pro into a complex hybrid performance pickup?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to call, but at this stage, it\u2019s impressive. I have no idea how the electrified 2.4-liter turbo engine will hold up in the long run, nor am I sure how durable the red leather is on the interior. But you know what I can tell you? The front seats have friggin\u2019 air shocks in \u2018em. That\u2019s crazy.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nThere are other trims for people who prefer a typically tame Toyota, but the TRD Pro Taco isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s the one to compete with the Ford Ranger Raptor and Chevy Colorado ZR2, except it has more torque than both of \u2018em. You pay for that, too, as it\u2019s also the most expensive of the bunch. It\u2019s a departure from the Tacoma you and I have always known, for better or worse, and it\u2019s here for a good time if not for a long one.\n\nThe Basics\n\nFor the new generation, the Tacoma shares more in common with its Tundra big brother than it ever did before, and it\u2019s even evident in the truck\u2019s styling. While they have their differences, like their headlight designs and side profiles, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to confuse the Tacoma for a Tundra from afar. Both of them are all angles with sharp lines jutting out everywhere, from the front fenders and doors to the bedsides. The Tacoma is smaller but not by that much, and they even ride on the same body-on-frame platform these days.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nAnd if you showed someone the interior, it would be almost impossible to tell the Tacoma and Tundra apart\u2014especially the hybrids. Both TRD Pro models have red upholstery throughout (Tacoma also comes in black), plus a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.0-inch infotainment display. Thankfully, buttons and switches still adorn the lower half of the center stack. The only difference\u2014which is a big one, I admit\u2014is the crazy pneumatic suspension in the Tacoma TRD Pro\u2019s seatbacks.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nDriving the Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro\n\nThe Tacoma lineup offers two powertrains: a gas-only 2.4-liter turbo four and a hybrid version of that same engine. As you might expect, the TRD Pro model comes exclusively with the latter, meaning it makes 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission handles the shifts and sends power to the rear or all four wheels through a true two-speed transfer case. It\u2019ll run around on electric power only for a while, but once the ICE kicks in, it growls. It\u2019s kinda fun if you\u2019re a 12-year-old like me.\n\nHaving just tested a new Land Cruiser with this same powertrain the week before, I was curious if the Tacoma TRD Pro would be so\u2026 boring. I mean, it doesn\u2019t look like it would be, but I almost loathed the 2.4-liter hybrid in the other application because it was that dull. I\u2019m glad to report that isn\u2019t the case with this peppy pickup, which supports my statement that Toyota tuned all the fun out of the Land Cruiser so people would still have a reason to buy the 4Runner.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nSorry, sorry. I\u2019m here to talk about the Tacoma. It\u2019s good in every scenario where it fits with its wide haunches and tall body straddling every gully from here to the coast. I was thankful for that height more than once while driving it around my family\u2019s creekside property as I never once got it to drag its belly\u2014an impressive feat where I live. The terrain is pretty much all gravel that\u2019s often loose, and with some pretty deep pits, I\u2019m able to test out a rig\u2019s ground clearance as well as its approach angle, departure angle, and suspension articulation.\n\nYou can see what that looks like here in the TRD Pro. I\u2019m a pretty tall feller at six-foot-five and climbing back in from taking these pictures took a mighty stretch. It didn\u2019t phase the truck, though:\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nI had the Tacoma\u2019s transfer case in 4LO there with its Multi-Terrain Select system set to Loose Rock mode. It\u2019s almost like it was made for this! That MTS tech controls wheelspin at low speeds by modulating the throttle and brakes automatically. It\u2019s handy if not entirely necessary much like Crawl Control, the off-road cruise function for going up and down steep grades that\u2019s vastly improved for this generation.\n\nNothing around my humble abode could really stump the TRD Pro. That\u2019s what you want when you own a $67,000 truck, of course, but it also proves the truck\u2019s excessiveness. Unless you live near the desert (or drive a semi, I guess), when will you ever need air-sprung seats? You won\u2019t, and I couldn\u2019t truly test those high-performance thrones at high enough speeds to tell how big of a difference they make. I assume they could save your back while bashing through the Baja, but will anyone in the middle of the country ever need them? Probably not.\n\nI\u2019m a big boy at 6\u20195\u2033 and 290 pounds but just look at this. Caleb Jacobs\n\nInstead, people who buy these will need to carry stuff and maybe even people in the backseats. That\u2019s undoubtedly the TRD Pro\u2019s biggest flaw because with those bulky front chairs, there is absolutely no room to sit behind them. Midsizers aren\u2019t that roomy to begin with, and once you add in furniture like this, you might as well forget it. Just take the backseats out and mount a cooler or something. Or, if you insist on getting a top-tier Tacoma and you need to carry people in the backseat, get the Trailhunter. That thing is chock-full of off-road accessories and has the same hybrid powertrain, just without the seats that are cool in concept but less than ideal in everyday execution.\n\nI also towed a side-by-side with the Tacoma TRD Pro, which was a super experience. The Can-Am Maverick R is 2,250 pounds on its own without any gas, and the utility trailer it was parked on weighs right around 1,500. Toyota rates the truck\u2019s max towing capacity at 6,000 pounds so we were well underneath that at only 4,000 or so. Still, it\u2019s a load that owners will realistically tow and there was plenty of power for interstate cruising. Can you imagine saying that about the old, anemic V6? I can\u2019t. And better yet, it was perfectly stable. I had fun cosplaying as a well-off jerk for the day and if I actually were one, then hey, I\u2019d probably cop both of these machines, too.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nThe Highs and Lows\n\nY\u2019know, as much as I didn\u2019t like the 2.4-liter turbo hybrid in the Land Cruiser, it\u2019s one of the best parts about the Tacoma TRD Pro. The loud exhaust roars like a big cat when the gas engine kicks on, and it\u2019s just as much of a caricature as the rest of the truck. Since it isn\u2019t full-time 4WD like the Land Cruiser, it\u2019s quick to throw gravel when you have it in two-wheel drive, and it can crawl at low speeds or haul at high ones with a load on the back. This powertrain just suits the Tacoma so much better.\n\nI just wish people could sit in the backseat. I would feel bad asking anybody to ride behind me if I was driving\u2014even my six-year-old son. Sure, the air shocks are a cool gimmick, but the trade-off just isn\u2019t worth it if you drive the truck every day.\n\nTacoma TRD Pro Features, Options, and Competition\n\nThe TRD Pro and Trailhunter sit alongside each other as flagships of the Tacoma lineup. Clearly, the TRD Pro\u2019s focus is on wide-open performance, which is why it gets Fox QS3 internal bypass shocks with rear remote reservoirs rather than the Trailhunter\u2019s Old Man Emu suspension that\u2019s meant for lower speeds. That also explains why it\u2019s the only trim with those IsoDynamic front seats. The TRD Pro\u2019s LED headlights also get a unique signature while the 18-inch black alloy wheels are trim-specific too.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nAs far as options go, the TRD Pro is pretty much loaded from the get-go. My tester had a few extras including mud flaps ($200), a bed mat ($70), a bed rail Go Pro mount ($56), a dash cam ($499), and a trailer camera ($1,550). You could probably survive without those, save for the mud flaps if you care about your rig\u2019s paint.\n\nThis Toyota mainly competes with the Ford Ranger Raptor ($57,065 base) and Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 ($51,195) as it\u2019s in a league above the more pedestrian but still good Nissan Frontier Pro-4X. Of those, the Tacoma TRD Pro is the priciest by far. Thankfully, it makes the most torque with 465 lb-ft compared to the Ford and Chevy\u2019s 430 lb-ft. It\u2019s right in the middle in terms of hp, making 16 more ponies than the Colorado\u2019s 2.7-liter but 79 less than the Blue Oval\u2019s 3.0-liter EcoBoost V6. It\u2019s the only hybrid of the bunch, but its suspension is also the least advanced given the Ford\u2019s Fox LiveValve shocks and the Bowtie\u2019s Multimatic DSSV dampers.\n\nFuel Economy\n\nEPA\n\nDriving the Tacoma TRD Pro, I wasn\u2019t all that impressed with the fuel mileage. Looking at this sheet helps me realize that it could have been a lot worse, though. It\u2019s still pretty thirsty for a hybrid, but it clearly has the leg up on the gas-only Ranger Raptor, Colorado ZR2, and Frontier Pro-4X. It should be noted, though, that the Frontier is the only rig with a naturally aspirated engine and it got second place.\n\nValue and Verdict\n\nWhen I tested the previous-gen Tacoma TRD Pro in 2023, I said it was a solid truck you should skip. People hated me for it then, but my argument was that for $50,000, it\u2019d be better to wait for the next-gen truck with hybrid power and other modern hardware (y\u2019know, like disc brakes). Looking back, it\u2019s hard for me to say if I was right.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nOn the one hand, I think this new high-po Tacoma is way more fitting of the TRD Pro badge. It\u2019s a true competitor to the Ranger Raptor and Colorado ZR2 whereas the old one just wasn\u2019t that exciting. It was simple, though, and I have a feeling most folks will miss that a few years down the line. Plus, it\u2019s so much more expensive now\u2014the 2023 Tacoma TRD Pro that I drove stickered for $51,229 whereas this 2024 model is $67,974. Wow.\n\nThe performance is there, no doubt, and it\u2019s darn near a midsize super truck. You just have to pay to play, and my guess is if you\u2019re in the market for a pickup like this, you can afford to.\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro Specs Base Price (as tested) $65,395 ($67,974) Powertrain 2.4-liter turbo-four | 8-speed automatic | part-time 4WD with 2-speed transfer case Horsepower 326 @ 6,000 rpm Torque 465 lb-ft @ 1,700 rpm Seating Capacity 5 Max Towing 6,000 pounds Curb Weight 5,100 pounds Ground Clearance 11.0 inches Off-Road Angles 33.8\u00b0 approach | 23.5\u00b0 breakover | 25.7\u00b0 departure EPA Fuel Economy 22 mpg city | 24 highway | 23 combined Score 8/10\n\nQuick Take The Tacoma TRD Pro is an entirely new beast that will win new fans but maybe lose some old ones.\n\nGot a tip or question for the author?

            "content": "A professional driver pauses at the turn as everyone inside the SUV checks their seatbelts, readying for a stunt jump worthy of an action movie. The vehicle reaches the front side of a dirt ramp at precisely 33 miles per hour and launches into the air. With high-end Fox shocks at each corner, the 2025 Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro touches down with a jolt that ends almost as soon as it begins. Once again, the ride smooths out as the passengers shake off the spine compression and they silently thank those shock absorbers.\n\nThe 2025 4Runner is finally all new after a run of 15 years in the same body. Fresh styling, a more efficient powertrain, and updated technology takes the 4Runner into its sixth generation, and it\u2019s better than ever. Now on a new platform, the geometry and the linkages have been redesigned and optimized for better on-road and off-road performance, and each grade gets a unique tune. While Toyota\u2019s quintessential SUV has always been durable and resilient, the newest version is tuned for more comfort.\n\nRemote reservoirs in the shocks provide heat management, preventing \u201cshock fade.\u201d Image: Kristin Shaw/Popular Science\n\nMost drivers won\u2019t tackle a jump like this and many 4Runners will never leave the pavement, but owners like to know that it can. And with off-roading, camping, and overlanding trends continuing on an upward trajectory, one never knows when they might feel a strong urge to hit the dirt.\n\nPerformance shock absorbers that soak up the whoops\n\nWhen Toyota launched the all-new Tacoma in 2023, it debuted with an available adaptive variable suspension that adjusts to road conditions. Each grade of the Tacoma includes progressively tougher shocks to fit specific lifestyles, and Toyota followed the same strategy for the new 4Runner. As you work your way up the trim chain, the vehicles get more and more comfortable in rougher and rougher conditions.\n\nIt starts getting serious with the TRD Off-Road grade, which is equipped with monotube Bilstein remote reservoir shocks that include an end stop control valve, which is new for this generation. After running it through its paces on a packed-dirt test track on and off the highway, I can vouch for its cushiony feel.\n\n\u201c[The Bilstein equipment] varies the damping and the travel at the extremes of the shock absorber,\u201d explains Warren Chou, an executive program manager at Toyota. \u201cYou have good compliance in the center travel range, and at the extremes you get an increased damping force that protects you from the bottom-out or whoop events that you might be traveling through.\u201d\n\nWhoops, by the way, is short for \u201cwhoop-dee-doos,\u201d or rolling bumps on the route. It can be fun to cross a bunch of whoops, but only if you have good shock absorbers on your vehicle. Otherwise, hold onto your teeth.\n\nToyota gave the 4Runner unique shock absorbers depending on the trim. TRD Off-Road gets Bilstein shocks, TRD Pro uses Fox QS3 adjustable dampers, and Trailhunter uses the same Old Man Emu shocks as Toyota\u2019s newest Tacoma. Images: Kristin Shaw/Popular Science\n\nMoving up the trim line, the 4Runner TRD Pro is fitted with specially-tuned Fox QS3 three-way adjustable internal bypass shocks with remote reservoirs. For the Trailhunter version, Toyota chose Australian-made Old Man Emu monotube shocks (also with remote reservoirs), so named for the emu\u2019s ability to maintain stability when moving over uneven terrain. The TRD Pro is also equipped with an air intake and exhaust snorkel that\u2019s bolted to the A-pillar on the passenger side. This accessory allows the hybrid engine to breathe even in a very dusty environment, and it sounds kind of like Darth Vader when it\u2019s working.\n\nFor the 4Runners with Bilstein, Fox, and Old Man Emu shocks, the remote tank provides heat management: As the vehicle moves, the fluid in the shock gets warm, which reduces the viscosity. That can cause what\u2019s called \u201cshock fade,\u201d which results in loss of ride comfort. Extra oil in the shock reservoirs increases overall cooling capacity by providing more surface area for heat dissipation. Ultimately, that means you can drive the 4Runner harder and go longer and still get a comfortable ride.\n\nAdjustable shock settings\n\nIn the TRD Pro 4Runner, owners can adjust the Fox shock absorbers with a three-setting knob. Turning the front wheels makes it easier to access the knobs, and it requires a little arm yoga to reach the ones in the rear. It\u2019s worth the effort, though, as the settings will significantly affect the ride depending on the terrain. For the jump in California, the pro driver set the front shocks to level 3 for a stiffer rebound and the rear shocks to level 2.\n\n\u201cShock settings will vary case by case depending on the shape of the jump or what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Chou says. \u201cFor example, if you\u2019re cresting and land front wheels first, you might want a little bit more damping force on the front as you\u2019re coming down.\u201d\n\nChou states these enhancements improve the capability of the new 4Runner and fine-tune the offering for customers who may need vastly different things. Desert drivers want to drive fast and kick up the dust, while overlanders may be picking their way across rock gardens and climbing craggy trails.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to go more extreme with the TRD Pro and more extreme with Trailhunter,\u201d Chou says. \u201cBefore, people were buying the TRD Pro trim to go overlanding and to drive Baja-style fast across the desert. By creating Trailhunter, we could give each of those customers more of what they wanted and be more extreme in both scenarios to give them a better experience.\u201d",

All but two of the current 120 minor league stadiums across the country had to make renovations. One of those is Toyota Field.\n\nThe City of Madison is trying to decide whether to simply do the minimum required by MLB \u2014 which would cost around $12 million \u2014 or use this as an opportunity to make major renovations that could cost more than $30 million.\n\nHere are some talking points regarding the renovations:\n\nBoth the grounds crew garage conversion and construction of a new grounds crew facility and the one-story building in left field are sunk costs to the City, currently estimated at $10 million \u2013 $14 million, when combined with the parking improvements.\n\nAs the owner of the stadium and per current stadium lease terms, the City of Madison is responsible for the cost of both the stadium improvements and parking improvements.\n\nThe current proposal calls for the City to issue a bond to cover the additional cost of floors 2-4 and parking improvements.\n\nThere are currently lodging taxes allocated to the stadium. Those lodging taxes would be used to help pay for both the existing stadium bond and the new stadium bond. Lodging taxes are not currently sufficient to cover both bonds.\n\nThe current proposal does not contemplate any changes to taxes for residents.\n\n(Rocket City Trash Pandas)\n\nWant to stay in the know about what\u2019s new and happening in and around Huntsville?

            "content": "The all-new sixth-generation 2025 Toyota 4Runner has arrived, and from our time behind the wheel, it\u2019s the best iteration yet. But where does it stand against its pricier sibling, the North American Land Cruiser? Toyota\u2019s decision to bring back the Land Cruiser at a higher price point has raised plenty of questions about how the two SUVs compare. So, let\u2019s settle this debate.\n\nWe\u2019ve driven both\u2014back to back, on the same roads and off-road trails\u2014during the 4Runner\u2019s first drive event, where Toyota conveniently had both models on hand. The experiential information gathered there combined with the data provided by Toyota makes an interesting case for each SUV.\n\nReview: 2025 Toyota 4Runner Balances Old-School Toughness With New-Age Comfort\n\nLet\u2019s break down the details including pricing, standard features, options, driving impressions, and more. In the end, we\u2019ll paint a clear picture of which of the two is the better overall value.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nModel 2025 4Runner 2025 Land Cruiser Starting MSRP $40,770 $56,700 Engine: 2.4-Liter 4-cylinder turbo\n\n\n\n(i-Force Max = Hybrid) 2.4-liter 4-cylinder turbo hybrid HP / Torque: 278 hp (207 kW) / 317 lb-ft (429 Nm)\n\n\n\nHybrid 326 hp (243 kW) / 465 lb-ft (630 Nm) 326 hp (243 kW) / 465 (629 Nm) Transmission / Drive 8-Speed Automatic / 4WD 8-Speed Automatic / 4WD Fuel Economy: 22 (Hybrid 23.0) mpg combined 23 mpg combined* Width 78.0 inches 77.9 inches Length 194.9 inches 196.4 inches Height 72.6 inches 75.7 inches Wheelbase 112.2 inches 112.2 inches Cargo Behind 2nd Row 48.4 cu. ft.

Curb Weight 4,455 lbs (5,455 lbs Hybrid TRD) 5,360 lbs Towing Capacity 6,000 lbs (2,721 kg) 6,000 lbs (2,721 kg) Manufacturer SWIPE\n\nSimilarities\n\nPhotos Stephen Rivers / Carscoops\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that these rugged SUVs share plenty of similarities. Both ride on Toyota\u2019s TNGA-F platform, the same underpinnings found in the Tacoma and Tundra. This common architecture allows Toyota to use many of the same components across models.\n\nFor example, both the Land Cruiser and 4Runner have the same 112.2-inch wheelbase, the same eight-speed automatic transmission, and nearly identical width, with most trims measuring 77.9 inches across. They also share a 6,000-pound towing capacity when properly equipped.\n\nIn addition, Toyota equips the upper-level trims of the 4Runner with its i-Force Max 2.4-liter turbocharged hybrid four-cylinder. That just so happens to be the only engine available in the Land Cruiser. On top of that, they both make the same 326 hp (243 kW) and 465 lb-ft (630 Nm) regardless of application. However, the 4Runner also offers a non-hybrid version of this engine, making 278 hp (207 kW) and 317 lb-ft (429 Nm)\u2014a noticeably weaker option.\n\nReview: The New Toyota Land Cruiser Is The 4-Runner For Grown Ups\n\nWhile that powertrain hasn\u2019t yet built a reputation for dogged reliability, Toyota also offers the same warranty package on both vehicles. That includes three years or 36,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage, five years, or 60,000 miles of powertrain coverage, and eight years or 100,000 miles of hybrid component coverage.\n\nDifferences On Paper\n\nPricing is the first major place where things start to diverge for these two SUVs. Much of that comes down to the trim lineup for each vehicle. For example, the Land Cruiser starts at $56,700 for the 1958 Edition, with its fully loaded trim topping out at $61,470, a relatively modest $4,770 gap between the base and the highest-spec model.\n\nOn the flip side, the 4Runner starts at just $40,770 but the pricing gap between the top and the bottom is a chasm that not even the most robust Toyota could span.The TRD Pro and Trailhunter trims each carry a $66,900 MSRP, a staggering $26,000 jump from the entry-level model. Why such a wide spread? A key factor is the non-hybrid powertrain offered in the lower trims, whereas the Land Cruiser comes standard with Toyota\u2019s hybrid setup.\n\n2025 Toyota 4Runner\n\nPhotos Stephen Rivers / Carscoops\n\nSimply dubbed the i-Force, it consists of an almost identical 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder but without the hybrid technology. It makes 278 hp (207 kW) and 317 lb-ft (429 Nm) of torque and offers up to 20 mpg in the city, 26 mpg on the highway, and 22 combined according to Toyota.\n\nRead: Toyota Dealers Adding $5,000 Markups Onto New 4Runner\n\nInterestingly, the Land Cruiser actually bests that combination of figures overall. Despite having more horsepower on tap, it achieves up to 22 mpg in the city, 25 mpg on the highway, and 23 mpg combined. That\u2019s even more impressive when considering that the base 4Runner that achieves the above-mentioned fuel economy scores is rear-wheel drive. Every Land Cruiser comes with four-wheel drive.\n\n2024 Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nPhotos Stephen Rivers / Carscoops\n\nIn addition, the Land Cruiser offers more interior space for passengers, with nearly two extra inches of headroom in both rows and over an inch more legroom. If that wasn\u2019t enough, it also provides more cargo space than a hybrid-equipped 4Runner at 46.2 cubic feet versus 42.6 cubic feet.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a tradeoff. All Land Cruiser models are strictly five-seaters due to the placement of the hybrid battery, while some 4Runner trims offer a third-row option for those needing extra seating capacity. That said, the third row in the 4Runner is best suited for kids or smaller passengers, making it more of a convenience feature than a true people-hauler.\n\nFor some, those small differences aren\u2019t enough to deter them from spending more to go farther off-road. With that in mind, let\u2019s break down the off-road equipment and driving experience to see how each SUV handles when the pavement ends.\n\nOff-Road Differences\n\nOne statistical point regarding off-road prowess seems to stick out in comparison tests; ground clearance. By that marker, the 4Runner is a clear winner here. The SR5 boasts 8.1 inches of it and every other model ranges from 8.8 inches all the way up to 10.1 for the TRD Pro and Trailhunter trims.\n\nOn the flip side, the Land Cruiser only has a maximum of 8.7 inches of ground clearance regardless of which trim one picks. In reality, though, ground clearance doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Many off-roading experts will say that anywhere between 8-10 inches of ground clearance will enable a vehicle to tackle light rock crawling, overlanding, and shallow mud.\n\nBig rocks, deep mud, and bigger challenges require, at minimum, 10 inches meaning that the TRD Pro and Trailhunter trims could in theory, do these types of obstacles but only just barely. In fact, those figures suggest that even the humble SR5 with 4WD (and perhaps some all-terrain tires) could tackle the vast majority of what the rest of the trims could.\n\nRead: 2025 Toyota 4Runner Starts Under $41,000, Nearly $16,000 Less Than The Land Cruiser\n\nAgain though, ground clearance isn\u2019t the whole story. Approach angle is another factor and the Land Cruiser is the clear winner here with a 30/31-degree approach angle. The 4Runner TRD Pro and Trailhunter both beat this with 33 degrees but every other 4Runner falls short of even 20 degrees.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the departure angle to talk about. The Land Cruiser matches the base 4Runner along with the Limited, Platinum, and TRD Sport trims with a 22-degree departure angle. The TRD Off-Road, TRD Pro, and TRD Trailhunter all have a 24-degree departure angle to achieve a small victory. Of course, that victory feels short-lived when I tell you that the Land Cruiser has a 25-degree breakover angle whereas the most robust 4Runner has a 24-degree breakover angle.\n\nOff-Road Equipment\n\nAll of this is to say nothing about the physical equipment on each SUV. The 4Runner does have some big benefits when it comes to things like shock technology. For example, the TRD Sport gets TRD-branded shocks, the Limited gets Adaptive Variable Suspension dampers, the TRD Off-Road comes with Bilstein shocks, the TRD Pro gets FOX internal bypass shocks, and the Trailhunter gets ARB Old Man Emu dampers.\n\nToyota doesn\u2019t offer anything as bespoke for the Land Cruiser. Instead, it gets dampers built by Tokiko on both trim levels. That means that buyers won\u2019t get that super-customized ride available with the 4Runner. At the same time, that doesn\u2019t take away from the serious equipment that comes standard on the Land Cruiser.\n\nEvery LC gets locking rear and center differentials. They also come with full-time four-wheel drive and the top trim is available with a sway-bar disconnect feature. The 4Runner isn\u2019t available with those features in one package unless you\u2019re willing to drop at least $66,900 for the Trailhunter or TRD Pro.\n\nThe Driving Experience\n\nThe 4Runner might have bespoke dampers for basically every trim but having driven them, they\u2019re not glaringly different. Sure, the idea of having a set of high-end purpose-built shocks on my SUV is attractive, and no doubt very useful for the five percent (I\u2019d guess it could actually be less) of people who will truly push this Toyota to the brink of its off-road capability.\n\nFor everyone else, the Land Cruiser shocks will do just fine. Don\u2019t forget that the LC is built to feel and be a little more luxurious overall. That\u2019s one reason it offers more interior volume and why, in our testing, it was quieter in the cabin overall. When the road runs out, the Land Cruiser literally cruised over the exact same trails, obstacles, and steep pitches that the 4Runner did with the same aplomb as the 4Runner.\n\nI\u2019m not a hardcore off-road enthusiast but I\u2019ve gotta believe one could outfit their Land Cruiser with upgraded dampers for far less than the $5,430 price difference between a top-end LC and a 4Runner TRD Pro or Trailhunter with zero additional options.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nThe 4Runner is an especially strong value in this field for those who want the lower-end trims. The SR5 with four-wheel drive will do, on its own, what the vast majority of buyers will ever need when it comes to off-road capability. It\u2019s also the only 4Runner currently available with third-row seating.\n\nIn addition, Toyota offers other attractive trims like the TRD Off-Road ($49,190) and the TRD Sport Premium ($52,610) that are even more rugged while remaining less expensive than the base Land Cruiser. Beyond those trims, the Land Cruiser begins to look dramatically more attractive.\n\nIt\u2019s more comfortable, has as much or more power than any 4Runner, offers more cargo space than the hybrid and equally powerful 4Runner, and costs considerably less than similarly equipped 4Runners when it comes to off-road equipment.\n\nWhen we compare apples to apples, it\u2019s clear that the Land Cruiser offers a lot more for the same price as the 4Runner TRD Pro and Trailhunter. The X factor that we haven\u2019t even hit on is that dealers are already marking up the 4Runner so that it\u2019s even less attainable for die-hard Toyota fans willing to part with nearly $70,000. But that could change.\n\nAt the end of the day, we\u2019re in a really interesting moment in the history of Toyota. While fans might prefer the 4Runner or the Land Cruiser over the other, both are sincerely capable SUVs. What\u2019s more, is that we get to see how well this strategy of having two very similar products selling alongside one another works out. Which would you pick and why? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nPhotos Stephen Rivers / Carscoops",

A week after hosting the Winter X Games, the popular ski-trip destination hosted professional freeski and snowboarders for a World Cup competition \u2014 the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix.\n\nUnlike the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix at Copper Mountain Resort last December, the Aspen event featured freeski and snowboard halfpipe competitions as well as slopestyle contests.\n\nMen\u2019s snowboard halfpipe\n\nThe four-day competition kicked off on Thursday, Jan. 30, and several Summit County riders competed in the men\u2019s snowboard halfpipe competition.\n\nAfter taking fourth overall at the X Games last week, Telluride product and Summit County resident Lucas Foster managed to qualify for his first World Cup final of the 2024-25 season. Foster put together two clean runs in heat 2 of the men\u2019s snowboard halfpipe qualifiers, earning a top score of 80.50.\n\nFoster claimed the third overall qualifying spot in the heat while Hailey, Idaho\u2019s Chase Josey finished a place behind him in fourth (80). Leadville\u2019s Chase Blackwell and Jason Wolle also competed in the men\u2019s snowboard halfpipe qualifiers on Thursday, but failed to score high enough to advance to the 10-man final.\n\nBlackwell placed sixth overall in heat 2 (74.75) and Wolle took ninth in heat 1 with a score of (68.50).\n\nIn the final on Saturday, Feb. 1, Foster put together a solid third and final run. The impressive performance earned the 25-year-old rider a score of 80.25 which was enough for sixth place.\n\nJapan swept the podium with Ruka Hirano taking first (93.25), Ayumu Hirano finishing in second (89.50) and Ryusei Yamada taking third (88.25).\n\nFrisco\u2019s Lily Dhawornvej flies of one of the slopestyle jumps at the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix in Aspen on Friday, Jan. 31, 2025. Isami Kiyooka/U.S. Ski and Snowboard\n\nWomen\u2019s snowboard slopestyle\n\nOn Friday, Jan. 31, Frisco\u2019s Lily Dhawornvej sealed a spot in her third World Cup final this season in the women\u2019s snowboard slopestyle competition. Fresh off her first X Games medal, Dhawornvej put down a fairly clean first run to score 60.35.\n\nThe run was enough for Dhawornvej to take seventh overall and advance to the eight-woman final on Sunday, Feb. 2. Silverthorne\u2019s Kaitlyn Adams also competed in qualifiers on Friday afternoon, taking 26th overall with a top run score of 27.45.\n\nDhawornvej ended up placing sixth overall in the final on Sunday with a top run score of 36.73. New Zealand\u2019s Zoi Sadowski Synnott took first with a score of 87.80 while Truckee, California\u2019s Hahna Norman finished in eighth (17).\n\nMen\u2019s snowboard slopestyle\n\nThe men\u2019s snowboard slopestyle qualifiers saw two Summit County riders advance to the 16-man final on Friday. Silverthorne\u2019s Jake Canter(89.75) and Chris Corning (88.25) both placed third overall in their respective heats in order to make their second World Cup final of the season.\n\nAfter winning his second-career X Games gold medal last week, Silverthorne\u2019s Red Gerard was slated to compete in the competition, but did not take a run in qualifiers. Frisco\u2019s Caleb Dhawornvej took 16th in heat 1 with a score of 56.25.\n\nCanter took 10th overall (59.23) in Sunday\u2019s final while Corning finished in 11th (54.85). Canada\u2019s Francis Jobin won the competition with a score of 79.30. Hood River, Oregon\u2019s Sean FitzSimons was the top American in third (77.43).\n\nChris Corning performs a board slide while practicing for the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix men\u2019s snowboard slopestyle in competition in Aspen on Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025. Isami Kiyooka/U.S. Ski and Snowboard\n\nMen\u2019s and women\u2019s freeski halfpipe\n\nIn the freeski halfpipe competition, Summit High School senior Evan Wischmeyer took 15th overall (57) in heat 1 of qualifiers on Friday. Aspen\u2019s Alex Ferreira topped the first heat with a score of 91 while Nick Goepper topped heat 2 with a score of 92.25.\n\nIn the women\u2019s freeski halfpipe qualifiers, Winter Park\u2019s Svea Irving successfully made it to the eight-woman final, taking fifth overall with a score of 81.75.\n\nAfter losing to Goepper on his home turf at the X Games , Ferreira reclaimed his spot at the top of the awards podium. Ferreira laced his final run to top the results with a score of 95.75, Goepper took home the silver medal (94) and Rye, New York\u2019s Matt Labaugh took third (93).\n\nBend, Oregon\u2019s Hunter Hess finished in fourth (92.50) while Winter Park\u2019s Birk Irving finished in seventh (91). Aspen\u2019s Tristan Feinberg rounded out the men\u2019s freeski halfpipe results in 10th (59.75).\n\nSvea Irving took fourth overall in the women\u2019s freeski halfpipe final with a score of 84.50. With China\u2019s Eileen Gu still sidelined with an injury she suffered at the X Games, Great Britain\u2019s Zoe Atkin took first (90), China\u2019s Fanghui Li took second (88.50) and Canada\u2019s Amy Fraser finished in third (86.75).",

Something that\u2019s even better, of course. In the case of our Best Buy Award winner among midsize cars, the new champ is the 2025 Toyota Camry, and it just unseated the Honda Accord, which has won the Best Buy Award an astonishing nine out of the past 10 years the awards have been in existence.\n\nBut not this round. For the first time in the history of our Best Buy Awards, the Toyota Camry is our winner in the midsize car segment, unseating its longtime archrival.\n\nRivalries don\u2019t get much better than this one, and the contest was close. But in the end, the all-new Camry\u2019s blend of features, value, and efficiency propelled it to best-in-class status.\n\nFirst Win for Familiar Name\n\nYou know the Camry, of course. Toyota\u2019s midsize sedan has been around for over 40 years, and in that time has become a bedrock of the automaker\u2019s lineup and among the easiest recommendations in its class. Cars just don\u2019t get much more sensible than the Camry.\n\nIt still retains that trait for 2025, but adds so much more to its winning formula. This year marks a complete overhaul for the Camry and the sedan\u2019s ninth generation on American roads. One of the biggest changes for the sedan is both radical yet not surprising, given who makes it: All 2025 Toyota Camry models are hybrids. That means that no matter which of the four trims you choose, you\u2019re going to get exceptional fuel efficiency \u2014 up to 51 mpg combined.\n\nWhile the Honda Accord also offers a hybrid powertrain, it is reserved for higher \u2014 and pricier \u2014 trims. With the Camry, it\u2019s standard \u2014 and wonderful.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Toyota is arguably the best out there when it comes to making hybrid cars. It certainly has deep experience making such models, including creating the Prius around the turn of the millennium, which went on to practically become synonymous with the word \u201chybrid.\u201d\n\nToyota has long made hybrid versions of its Camry, too, to go along with past models\u2019 4-cylinder and V6 offerings. You won\u2019t miss either of those former engines in the all-new 2025 Camry. Yeah, even the V6. Put the latest one in Sport mode, mash the accelerator pedal, and you\u2019ll be grinning as your practical and efficient sedan blasts down the freeway on-ramp.\n\nYou do get a choice when it comes to traction. Another feather in the Toyota\u2019s cap is that it offers all-wheel drive (AWD) in lieu of the standard front-drive setup. In addition to the enhanced traction that all-wheel drive offers \u2014 a boon for drivers who regularly deal with slick, wintry roads \u2014 these models also get a bit more power. All-wheel-drive Camry models make a combined 232 horsepower, seven more than front-wheel-drive models. Regardless of which you choose, we love that because of the Camry\u2019s electrified powertrain, it always feels like there\u2019s extra power on hand. All use a continuously variable automatic transmission that feels astonishingly similar to a traditional automatic.\n\nWherever we drove the 2025 Camry, be it on freeway commutes, grocery runs around town, or even a favorite winding road, we always got out impressed. Yet for all its newness, the Camry retains perhaps the most important trait it\u2019s always had: It is just stupendously easy to live with.\n\nAll the Latest Features\n\nAs an all-new model, the Camry brings the best of Toyota\u2019s current technology \u2014 and Toyota\u2019s is among the best in the business. Of course, the 2025 Camry comes with features like automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control, which are becoming standard issue in many new cars.\n\nYet the Camry has an ace up its sleeve, and a feature not available in any other midsize sedan \u2014 or any other vehicle that\u2019s not from Toyota, for that matter. It\u2019s called PDA, and not the kind you think. That\u2019s short for Proactive Driving Assist. It\u2019s an ingenious system that can run in the background to make driving safer and less stressful. It will automatically slow the car as it enters a curve, comes to a stop, and much more.\n\nBeyond robust safety systems, the Camry is stocked with tech like wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, a crisp 8- or 12.3-inch touchscreen, and available goodies like a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and head-up display.\n\nIt\u2019s Stylish, Too!\n\nThe Camry\u2019s 2025 revamp brought exterior styling that is just enough daring and eye-catching without going overboard. Compared to more conservative rivals \u2014 yes, including the Accord \u2014 the Camry is sure to turn some heads, especially if you opt for a two-tone paint color with a contrasting roof.\n\nInside, the Camry is roomy, sensible (there\u2019s that word again), and has seats that are all-day-long comfortable. And sun lovers will be happy to know a panoramic moonroof is optional.\n\nShockingly Good Value\n\nSealing the deal for the Camry\u2019s win is the factor that, for many shoppers, will seal their deal: the price. At $29,835 including the destination charge, the Camry starts under $30,000 yet brings all its wonderful Camry-ness. That base price is just $390 off a base Accord, but the massive caveat is that\u2019s not a hybrid Accord. While one of those starts at a higher trim level, it costs $34,805 \u2014 about $5,000 more than a Camry hybrid, which for 2025 is just called a Camry.\n\nAdd it all up, and it\u2019s easy to see why the 2025 Toyota Camry now rightfully wears the crown.\n\nPhoto Tour\n\n2025-toyota-camry-front-left 2025-toyota-camry-exterior 2025 Toyota Camry 2025 Toyota Camry 2025 Toyota Camry 2025 Toyota Camry 2025 Toyota Camry 2025 Toyota Camry 2025 Toyota Camry 2025 Toyota Camry 2025 Toyota Camry\n\nMore 2025 Toyota Camry\n\nRead our full review\n\nBuild and price your own\n\nBrowse listings near you\n\nOur 2025 Best Buy Award Winners",

Here are some of the items affected by proposed tariffs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and an added 10% duty on those from China starting Tuesday, demanding those countries stop the flow of fentanyl and the flow of immigrants in the case of Canada and Mexico, into the United States.\n\nAround 90% of auto exports from both Mexico and Canada go to the U.S., according to the Mexican Automotive Manufacturers' Association and the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association.\n\nDetroit is at the epicenter of domestic impact, and the Detroit Regional Chamber and its MichAuto affiliate on Saturday evening the tariffs \u201cwill have detrimental effects to our automotive industry in Michigan, the Great Lakes Region and across the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur economies are inextricably linked by manufacturing and many other critical industries,\u201d Glenn Stevens Jr. the executive director of MichAuto said in a statement. \u201cMichAuto and its constituents are concerned about the collateral damage that will be done to manufacturing, the impact it will have on Michiganders' jobs, and the fact that the consumer will feel the increased cost of doing business in the prices they pay from vehicles in the showrooms to the grocery store.\n\n\u201cWhile the administration works to stem the flow of illicit drugs and illegal immigration, this should exclude the use of punitive tariffs, which are counterproductive to commerce,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cMichAuto urges that the proven tools at hand such as the reopening of the USMCA (trade agreement among the U.S., Mexico and Canada) and the direct input and involvement of our vital industry be utilized in a manner that does not stymie commerce and negatively impact companies and the consumer, but rather works toward solutions that preserve our strong trade partnerships and protect American jobs.\u201d\n\nUAW President Fain reaction\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement that Trump's move was the wrong way to use tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe UAW supports aggressive tariff action to protect American manufacturing jobs as a good first step to undoing decades of anti-worker trade policy,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe do not support using factory workers as pawns in a fight over immigration or drug policy. We are willing to support the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs to stop plant closures and curb the power of corporations that pit U.S. workers against workers in other countries. But so far, Trump\u2019s anti-worker policy at home, including dissolving collective bargaining agreements and gutting the National Labor Relations Board, leaves American workers facing worsening wages and working conditions even while the administration takes aggressive tariff action.\n\n\"If Trump is serious about bringing back good blue-collar jobs destroyed by NAFTA, the USMCA and the WTO, he should go a step further and immediately seek to renegotiate our broken trade deals,\" Fain said.\n\nReuters provided this rundown of automakers that would be affected, in alphabetical order:\n\nAudi\n\nVolkswagen's Audi plant in San Jose Chiapa, Mexico, makes the Q5, employing just over 5,000 people. It produced nearly 176,000 cars in 2023, its website showed. In the first half of 2024, nearly 40,000 were exported to the U.S., according to Mexico's AMIA.\n\nBMW\n\nBMW's plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, produces the 3 Series, 2 Series Coupe and M2, with nearly all output going to the U.S. and other markets worldwide, according to the carmaker. From 2027, it will produce the all-electric Neue Klasse model line.\n\nFord\n\nFord has three plants in Mexico: its Chihuahua engine plant, and two assembly plants in Cautitlan and Hermosillo.\n\nIt exported just under 196,000 cars from Mexico to North America in the first half of 2024, with 90% of vehicles going to the U.S., according to Mexico's AMIA.\n\nIn Canada, it has an assembly plant in Oakville where it plans to produce a larger, gas-powered F-Series pickup truck from 2026.\n\nFord spokeswoman Robyn Jackson told the Free Press Sunday afternoon that the automaker \u201chad nothing to add for now\u201d on how the tariffs will impact the automaker, or if Ford\u2019s leaders were having conversations with the Trump administration about ways to mitigate the impact of the tariffs.\n\nIn early January, at the Detroit Auto Show, the automaker's Executive Chair Bill Ford told reporters that he got an unexpected call from then-President-elect Trump and the two had a lengthy conversation about the importance of manufacturing and the auto industry to the United States economy.\n\nFord said Trump is tuned into Ford's concerns about the impact of tariffs on Mexico and Canada as well as if Trump were to rescind any tax incentives attached to the Inflation Reduction Act that have benefitted automakers. Ford said Trump indicated that he supports a strong American industry. He said Trump wants to work with the industry to strengthen it further.\n\nCEO Jim Farley told the media at the auto show that his perception of the Trump administration is that it \u201cis very focused on policy. They got elected because Americans want change, and they know exactly what they want to change: Tax, border, energy \u2026 and supporting companies like Ford. They\u2019re very focused on taking action quickly.\"\n\nMore: Trump signs Canada, Mexico tariffs, Michigan faces extreme economic exposure\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nGM imported roughly 750,000 vehicles from Canada or Mexico in 2024 to the U.S., with most manufactured in Mexico, according to business analytics firm GlobalData.\n\nThey include some of GM\u2019s most popular vehicles, including the Chevy Silverado, GMC Sierra full-sized pickups, and mid-sized SUVs.\n\nGM's Mexican plants also build two of its critical new electric vehicles, battery-powered versions of its Equinox and Blazer SUVs.\n\nIn Canada, GM operates three plants, producing electric vans, the Chevrolet Silverado Heavy Duty truck, and the V8 engine and dual-clutch transmission for shipment worldwide.\n\nGM CFO Paul Jacobson said during a fourth-quarter and year-end earnings call last week that the automaker does have \u201ca playbook\u201d of plans it can tap in response to tariffs. He also said GM has tried to \u201ctake down some of our international inventory in Mexico and Canada and expedite shipments to the United States\u201d before tariffs were put in place.\n\nIn her letter to shareholders, CEO Mary Barra said GM has been proactive by having conversations with Congress and the administration to stress the importance of a strong manufacturing sector and American leadership in advanced technologies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that we share a lot of common ground, and we appreciate the dialogue,\u201d Barra wrote.\n\nIn GM\u2019s call with Wall Street analysts Tuesday, Barra said if tariffs are enacted, the company has several levers that it can pull.\n\n\u201cWe build cars in Mexico, Canada and the United States,\u201d Barra said. \u201cWe have the capacity in the United States to shift some of that. We also sell trucks globally, so we can look at those areas where we can mitigate some of that\" impact from tariffs.\n\nHonda\n\nHonda Motor sends 80% of its Mexican output to the U.S. market. It warned on Nov. 6 that it would have to consider shifting production if the U.S. imposed permanent tariffs on Mexican imports.\n\nKia\n\nSouth Korea's Kia Corp. has a factory in Mexico that makes its own vehicles and some Santa Fe SUVs for its affiliate Hyundai Motor for export to the United States.\n\nMazda\n\nMazda exported around 120,000 vehicles from Mexico to the United States in 2023, but has said it may reconsider further investments if tariffs are imposed.\n\nNissan\n\nNissan Motor has two plants in Mexico where it makes the Sentra, Versa and Kicks models for the U.S. market. It produced nearly 505,000 vehicles in Mexico in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nStellantis\n\nStellantis operates two assembly plants in Mexico: Saltillo, which makes Ram pick-ups and vans, and Toluca, for the Jeep Compass mid-sized SUV.\n\nThe Franco-Italian-American group also owns two assembly plants in Ontario: Windsor, where it makes Chrysler models, and Brampton, currently under retooling and scheduled to resume production in 2025 with a new Jeep model.\n\nIn early December, Stellantis CFO Doug Ostermann told a Goldman Sachs conference that the company could shift production to \u201cunallocated plants\u201d in the United States, such as Belvidere Assembly in Illinois, and make other adjustments.\n\n\u201cWe have available capacity in the U.S. that will allow us to adjust,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal for us, as it won\u2019t be for other automakers.\u201d\n\nToyota\n\nToyota Motor builds its Tacoma pick-up truck at two plants in Mexico. It sold more than 230,000 of them in the U.S. in 2023, representing about 10% of its total sales in that market. Toyota used to produce the Tacoma in the U.S. but now ships all of them from Mexico.\n\nVolkswagen\n\nVolkswagen's factory in Puebla is the largest auto plant in Mexico and one of the largest in the Volkswagen Group, according to the carmaker's website. Nearly 350,000 cars were made there in 2023, including the Jetta, Tiguan and Taos, all for export to the U.S.\n\nIn Canada, Volkswagen is building a battery gigafactory in St. Thomas, Ontario, investing up to C$7 billion ($4.9 billion) with a view to use the batteries for cars it sells in North America. Production is expected to begin by 2027.\n\nIn addition, a number of auto suppliers, including tire makers Michelin and Pirelli, and brake maker Brembo.\n\nThis is a developing story.",

Back it came for the 2024 model year\u2014redesigned, of course, with a smaller, more fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain, squarish retro looks, and slightly diminished dimensions.\n\n1 of 7 \u2014 land cruiser left front.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser left front Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 2 of 7 \u2014 land cruiser overview.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser overview Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 3 of 7 \u2014 land cruiser profile.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser profile Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 4 of 7 \u2014 land cruiser nose.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser nose Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 5 of 7 \u2014 land cruiser right rear.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser right rear Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 6 of 7 \u2014 land cruiser angled tail.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser left end Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 7 of 7 \u2014 land cruiser roof rack.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser roof rack Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels\n\nJust an inch shorter than before, the Cruiser still rides on a 112.2-inch wheelbase and now weighs just over 5,000 pounds. But the big news\u2014beyond its nifty two-tone paint job and styling\u2014is the engine.\n\nGet this: Gone is the mighty 5.7-liter V8, replaced by a hybrid version of Toyota\u2019s 2.4-liter turbocharged inline-four, known as the i-Force Max. And Max it is, because this little gem pounds out 326 horsepower and 425 pound-feet of torque. Consider those numbers for a second\u2014300+ horsepower and 400+ pound-feet of torque from a tiny four-cylinder engine. Ain\u2019t technology great?\n\nAnd because its hybrid system uses two electric motors to provide power at low speeds\u2014when gasoline engines are least efficient\u2014its fuel ratings are impressive compared with the Jurassic-age V8.\n\nThe EPA rates it at 22 mpg city and 25 mpg highway. The previous V8 was rated at just 13 mpg city and 17 highway. I got 13.3 mpg in the V8 Cruiser and 17 in this one. That was still disappointing considering the EPA ratings, but I was driving primarily around town and had it during a cold snap when 20 degrees felt like a warm day.\n\nStill, a jump of 4 mpg is notable, and in warmer weather, one might expect to hit at least 20 mpg.\n\nMore to the point of functionality, the Land Cruiser is still a performer when trundling off-road. It retains all the same gear as before, including both high and low 4WD, along with five off-road settings\u2014one specifically for snow, which, in a normal winter, would be helpful in Wisconsin and other northern climes.\n\nThat\u2019s all handled via a dial on the console, while additional buttons allow the differential to be locked and the sway bars to be disconnected for rock crawling and other tough terrain. Easy peasy!\n\nThree drive modes can also be selected: Eco, to save gas; Normal; and Sport, which firms up steering and aids low-end torque for faster acceleration. You\u2019d think Sport mode would be used frequently for more oomph in a 5,000-pound vehicle, but this doesn\u2019t feel underpowered. Nope\u2014this turbo is smooth and gutsy, making acceleration surprisingly quick. Car & Driver says it goes from 0 to 60 mph in just 7.7 seconds. Again, you\u2019re in a mid-size SUV, folks\u2014so not bad at all.\n\nYet it\u2019s the handling that impresses most on a daily basis. The Land Cruiser feels easy to maneuver in town and in parking lots, despite its 193.8-inch length. The turning radius is moderate for a big truck, making it relatively easy to slip into parking spaces and change lanes on the freeway. Even in heavy winds, the Cruiser remained extremely stable.\n\nThe ride is also well-controlled\u2014no heavy thumps when traversing Milwaukee\u2019s street moonscape, just minor jiggles.\n\nThe new Cruiser\u2019s looks are retro-mod, with squared-off features at both the nose and tail. This tester also featured a classy Smoky Blue (blue-gray) body with a white roof, a mere $350 extra. Surprisingly, even to me, its looks garnered more positive comments than most of my test vehicles over the past year.\n\nInside, however, it felt more pedestrian\u2014though still more modern than past models.\n\n1 of 3 \u2014 land cruiser seats.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser seats Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 2 of 3 \u2014 land cruiser interior.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser interior Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 3 of 3 \u2014 land cruiser dash.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser dashboard Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels\n\nThis one featured a chocolate brown leather interior with contrasting stitching, though a fair amount of hard plastic topped the dash and surrounded the driver\u2019s instrument cluster. Plus, the sun visors were made of hard plastic, which felt out of place for a vehicle at this price point. More on that in a sec.\n\nSeating was comfortable, but the Cruiser has just two rows\u2014unlike its cousin, the Lexus GX 550, which has three rows and is four inches longer than the Toyota. A third row isn\u2019t even an option here.\n\nNaturally, the dash has been updated with a 12.3-inch touchscreen that\u2019s easy to use. Toyota also includes buttons and toggles below the screen to adjust the heated and cooled front seats, the heated steering wheel, and all climate controls. The Lexus, on the other hand, insists on handling all that through its larger 14-inch screen. I prefer the buttons and toggles, and you will too\u2014especially if you\u2019re wearing gloves in winter!\n\nOther pluses include a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel and a moderately sized sunroof overhead. This one also had the optional wireless charger, plus a cool box in the console. Press a button, and the storage container between the front seats will chill a beverage or keep a snack cool on a long drive.\n\nThe driver\u2019s seat powers back once the ignition is off, making it easier to extract oneself from behind the wheel. Running boards come standard, making climbing in and out simple\u2014further aided by the generous grab handles at each door.\n\nWith no third row, the Cruiser provides a generous 37.5 cubic feet of cargo space under the power hatch, which is split. That means you can pop open the hatch\u2019s window to load cargo or flip up the entire hatch. Fold the second row down, and there\u2019s a massive 82 cubic feet of storage room.\n\nNote that the cargo bed is slightly raised, but it still seems easy enough to load and unload under the hatch.\n\n1 of 3 \u2014 land cruiser rear seat.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser rear seat Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 2 of 3 \u2014 land cruiser stack.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser stack Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 3 of 3 \u2014 land cruiser hatch.jpg 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser hatch Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels\n\nThe Land Cruiser comes equipped with plenty of standard safety features, but an additional $4,600 premium option package adds even more. This package includes lane-change assist, front cross-traffic alert, and traffic jam assist. It also bundles in the cool box, wireless charger, and a 14-speaker JBL sound system. Additionally, the package includes a power moonroof, leather-trimmed seats, a head-up display (HUD), and a digital rearview mirror.\n\nA roof rack enhances the Cruiser\u2019s rugged look but tacks on another $1,440 to the price tag. The 20-inch alloy wheels? Another $1,240. Ouch. Other options were minor.\n\nOne misstep in an otherwise well-designed mid-size SUV is the overly complex driver instrument cluster. It looks fine, but adjusting it\u2014just to get something as simple as the trip odometer to appear\u2014feels like an exercise in futility. There are way too many choices. Be sure to make any adjustments before driving.\n\nWhich brings us to price\u2014and a comparison with its cousin, the more luxurious three-row Lexus GX 550.\n\nThe Toyota starts at just $57,345 for the base 1958 edition, named for the year Toyota entered the U.S. market and sold its first Land Cruiser. That\u2019s a significant drop from the $87,000 base price of the 2021 Land Cruiser, thanks to the loss of the V8 and the Lexus GX 550 taking over the top pricing tier.\n\nThis tested Land Cruiser had a base price of $63,345 but climbed to $71,469 with options\u2014almost exactly the same as the Lexus GX 550 I tested last year. However, the Lexus packs a twin-turbo 3.4-liter V6 that delivers 349 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque. It also boasts an 8,000-pound towing capacity compared to the Land Cruiser\u2019s 6,000 pounds.\n\nBoth vehicles require premium fuel.\n\nEssentially, the Toyota runs about $5,000 less than the Lexus while offering a more off-road-friendly design. The Lexus, on the other hand, features a more refined interior, a larger engine, and greater towing capacity. If your adventures lean toward off-roading, you might be better off with the Land Cruiser\u2014or even the base 1958 model\u2014and save the extra cash for fixing dents, dings, and scrapes.\n\nFAST STATS: 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nHits: Good smooth power, true off-road ability, nimble handling for big truck, AWD, well-cushioned ride, improved fuel economy.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer looked closely at.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s first few weeks in office on the financial markets. Cramer pointed out that while some investors had expected severe tariffs under Trump\u2019s administration, many have begun to believe that these expectations may be exaggerated.\n\nAccording to Cramer, Wall Street initially became excited about a potentially more flexible approach under Trump. Investors were concerned that Trump might take a hard stance against Mexico and Canada, but as the situation developed, it became clear that his actions would not be as extreme as initially feared. He added:\n\n\u201cBefore taking the White House, he talked about putting 25% tariffs on our two longstanding trading partners immediately but then when the America First Trade policy memo came out, we saw that the administration wants to study the situation.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently\n\nCramer remarked that although Trump had made bold statements about renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America,\" his actual policies have been more tempered. Cramer noted that if Trump can find someone in Canada willing to negotiate, he would pursue that, and he\u2019s already receiving business-like responses from Mexico\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum. He added:\n\n\u201cAgain, the rhetoric was hot, but the reality was cool. Sure there are some real harsh words for a lot of the environmental rules and regulations and grants that President Biden jammed through the last four years. Trump has no time for these.\u201d\n\nIn addition to trade policies, Cramer also commented on Trump\u2019s stance regarding environmental regulations. Trump has made it clear that he has no patience for many of the environmental rules and grants implemented during the previous administration. Cramer pointed out that Trump views oil and gas as essential to America\u2019s economic strength, believing that increased drilling and production would lead to lower oil prices and enhance U.S. power abroad.\n\nHowever, Cramer acknowledged that it\u2019s unclear how much influence Trump can exert over the oil and gas industry. He emphasized the need for more infrastructure, particularly pipelines, to facilitate both domestic and international distribution of natural gas. While oil executives are aware of the political pressure to increase production, they also know that any loss of discipline in response to presidential demands could lead to plummeting prices and financial losses.",

This is demonstrated by an agreement to launch a new generation of refuelling systems that will make stops at the pump even quicker and more efficient.\n\nA new impetus has been given to this refuelling by the agreement between Toyota Motor Europe, Hydrogen Refuelling Solutions (HRS) and ENGIE.\n\nRapid refuelling for trucks and vans\n\nFunded by the European Union through the Clean Hydrogen Partnership, the RHeaDHy (Refuelling Heavy Duty with very High Flow Hydrogen) project will focus on the development of high-performance refuelling stations capable of refuelling 700 bar hydrogen trucks with 100 kg of hydrogen in 10 minutes. Testing will begin in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the aim of accelerating the transition to more sustainable freight transport.\n\nToyota explains that the new Twin Mid Flow technology with which these stations will be equipped will allow heavy vehicles to refuel in less than 10 minutes and light vehicles in less than 5 minutes. In practice, a 40-tonne truck will be able to refuel for 600 km (373 miles) in 8 minutes and for 900 km (560 miles) in 12 minutes.\n\nAs well as increasing speed, the company says the new solution will significantly reduce the cost of installing refuelling stations, helping to meet the EU target. The EU's Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation requires publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling stations to be installed every 200 km along major European roads by 2030.\n\nA strategic alliance\n\nToyota will provide a test bed and a truck equipped with Twin Mid Flow technology to test the new refuelling solutions. Hydrogen Refueling Solutions (HRS) - a leading manufacturer of high-capacity hydrogen refuelling stations - will develop the next generation dispensers using its expertise in manufacturing modular and scalable stations at its industrial facility in Grenoble, France.\n\nFinally, ENGIE - a giant in the low-carbon energy sector - will provide its expertise through ENGIE Lab CRIGEN, its hydrogen research and innovation centre, which is coordinating the RHeaDHy project.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

(Courtesy image)\n\nATHENS, Texas \u2013 The 2024 Toyota ShareLunker season reached new heights thanks to 371 anglers who entered a record 689 lunker largemouth bass into the program throughout the year from 89 Texas public waterbodies.\n\nThe total included 467 in the Bass Pro Shops Lunker Class (weighing between eight to 9.99 pounds or at least 24 inches), 190 Strike King Elite Class (weighing 10 to 12.99 pounds), 18 Legacy Class (weighing 13 pounds or more and caught between Jan. 1 and March 31) and 14 Lew\u2019s Legend Class Lunkers that were 13 pounds or more caught outside the collection season.\n\nThese entries provided valuable data to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) biologists across Texas in their ongoing efforts to manage largemouth bass populations. Anglers also submitted 82 DNA samples from their catches in 2024. The samples enable TPWD researchers to determine if the fish was a pure Florida largemouth bass, if it was hatched at TPWD hatchery or related to any other ShareLunkers that were submitted to the program.\n\nOne notable finding from complete DNA analyses in 2024 was from an 8.15-pound fish caught from Bois d\u2019Arc Lake. The fish was a pure Florida largemouth bass and determined to be the offspring of ShareLunker 577, a 14.57-pound fish and lake record caught at Marine Creek Lake on Jan. 26, 2019. It would make the aforementioned Bois d\u2019Arc Lake fish a little over five-years old.\n\nIn addition to helping produce bigger, better bass for Texas lakes, anglers who enter their big bass catches in the program receive special recognition and prizes, including an entry into a year-end drawing to win a $5,000 Bass Pro Shops shopping spree.\n\n\u201cThank you to everyone who submitted their lunker bass and DNA to the Toyota ShareLunker program,\u201d said Natalie Goldstrohm, Toyota ShareLunker coordinator. \u201cThe 2024 ShareLunker season has come to a close, and we\u2019re delighted to conclude it with the year-end grand prize drawing. We\u2019re excited to announce that Mason Merryman\u2019s catch was randomly selected as the winner among all eligible 2024 entries, securing a $5,000 Bass Pro Shops shopping spree. Make sure to submit your Lunker bass through the ShareLunker app or website for a chance to be part of the drawing for the 2025 season and help make Bigger, Better Bass in Texas.\u201d\n\nMerryman hooked his 9.34-pound Bass Pro Shops Lunker Class on Oct. 12 during a tournament on Lake Granbury. The fish was entered into the program along with a DNA scale sample for genetic analysis by TPWD researchers and it was determined to be a pure Florida largemouth bass. A relationship analysis will be conducted at a later date to determine if this fish was related to any other ShareLunker.\n\n\u201cThis fish was a blessing,\u201d said Merryman. \u201cWe were in the middle of the tournament with only a two-pound bag on Lake Granbury. My partner Colton Elias and I decided to head back to a certain marina to try there one more time. We pulled between two docks and while he tossed a red shad power worm in, I rigged up my pole. As soon as I got done, he missed a fish, so he said, \u201d flip your worm I got a hit!\u201d Sure enough, the ShareLunker inhaled it, and I was lucky enough to bring it in.\u201d\n\nMerryman\u2019s fish broke his personal record by three pounds.\n\n\u201cTo this day it\u2019s crazy to me that I caught a Sharelunker in a tournament and ended up winning the year end grand prize out of so many other contestants,\u201d added Merryman. \u201cMy experience was crazy and amazing, especially getting to experience this at 14 years old as a freshman in high school. I\u2019m thankful and proud of not only myself but my team, Captain Gino Napoli and teammate Colton Elias. It was a team effort to get that trophy fish.\u201d\n\nMerryman wasn\u2019t the only angler to have a memorable experience with the Toyota ShareLunker program. Lawrence Lee of Tolar entered an incredible number of catches during the 2024 season.\n\nIn addition to Legacy Class ShareLunker 651, Lee entered a season high of 74 catches into the year-round ShareLunker program. Included in those entries were a trio of Lew\u2019s Legend Class fish, a 13.72-pounder on Oct. 12, a 13.04-pounder on July 19 and a 13.75-pound lunker on June 20 from J.B. Thomas.\n\nJ.B. Thomas led all waterbodies with 156 entries during the 2024 season followed by Lake Fork (109) O.H. Ivie (83), Sam Rayburn (26), and Toledo Bend (21) to round out the top five. The complete list of 2024 entries can be viewed on the Toyota ShareLunker archives page.\n\n\u201cWith a historic 2024 in the books we are excited to see what 2025 has in store for the big bass anglers of Texas,\u201d said Goldstrohm.\n\nDuring the first three months of the season (Jan. 1 through March 31), anglers who reel in a 13-plus pound bass can loan it to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for the ShareLunker selective breeding and stocking program. These anglers can call the ShareLunker hotline at (903) 681-0550 to report their catch 24/7 through March 31, 2025.\n\nAnglers must weigh their potential Legacy Class fish on a certified scale. A list of official weigh stations can be found on the ShareLunker Official Weigh and Holding Stations website.\n\nAnglers that catch and loan a 13-plus pound lunkers earn Legacy Class status, receive a catch kit filled with merchandise, a 13lb+ Legacy decal for their vehicle or boat, VIP access to the Toyota ShareLunker Annual Awards event, a high-quality replica mount of their fish from Lake Fork Taxidermy, ShareLunker branded apparel provided by AFTCO, and Bass University will provide a swag pack and annual subscription. Anglers also receive entries into two separate drawings \u2013 a Legacy Class Drawing and the year-end Grand Prize Drawing. Both drawings will award the winner a $5,000 Bass Pro Shops shopping spree.\n\nThe year-round Toyota ShareLunker program offers anglers three additional levels of participation for catching bass over eight pounds or 24 inches in Texas public waters. Each of these levels provide vital data to TPWD fisheries biologists, helping them continue to create bigger, better bass in Texas.\n\nAnglers who enter data for any lunker they catch greater than eight pounds or 24 inches also receive a catch kit, a decal for their vehicle or boat, a one-month subscription to Bass University and an entry into the year-end Grand Prize Drawing to win a $5,000 Bass Pro Shops shopping spree. ShareLunker entry classes include the Bass Pro Shops Lunker Class (8 lb.+), Strike King Elite Class (10 lb.+) and Lew\u2019s Legend Class (13 lb.+).\n\nOnce a lunker is reeled in, anglers need to enter the catch data on the Toyota ShareLunker mobile app \u2013 available for free from the Apple App Store and Google Play \u2013 or at TexasSharelunker.com.\n\nIn addition to providing basic catch information, anglers have the option to send a DNA scale sample from their lunker bass to TPWD researchers for genetic analysis. Anglers who contribute a sample to the program will receive a Lew\u2019s baitcast reel valued at up to $200 while supplies last, with a limit of one reel per angler. Anglers who send in a genetic sample will also get a three-month subscription to Bass University. Instructions for submitting DNA samples are located on the Toyota ShareLunker website.\n\nThe Toyota ShareLunker Program is made possible in part by the generous sponsorship of Toyota. Toyota is a longtime supporter of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation and TPWD, providing major funding for a wide variety of fisheries, state parks and wildlife projects.\n\nAdditional vital program support comes from Legend class category prize sponsor Lew\u2019s, Elite class category prize sponsor Strike King, Lunker class category prize sponsor Bass Pro Shops, AFTCO, Bass Forecast, Bass University and Lake Fork Taxidermy.\n\nFor updates on the Toyota ShareLunker Program, visit facebook.com/sharelunkerprogram/, https://www.instagram.com/TexasShareLunker/ or TexasSharelunker.com.\n\n\u2014 Texas Parks and Wildlife Department",

The pre-sale already opened in December last year with a price range of 100,000 \u2013 200,000 yuan (13,800 \u2013 27,500 USD).\n\nConsumers can choose from seven exterior paints: two shades of white, gray, silver, black, pink, and gold. Positioned as a compact SUV, the GAC-Toyota bZ3X has a length, width, and height of 4600/1875/1645 mm, respectively, and the wheelbase is 2765 mm.\n\nOne highlight of the car is its Momenta 5.0 advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), powered by an NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin X chip and realized via 27 sensors, including 11 high-definition cameras, 12 ultrasonic radars, three millimeter-wave radars, and a lidar. The ADAS does not rely on a map and supports 25 capabilities, including a pre-collision system, blind spot monitoring, remote parking, an emergency driving stop system, traffic light assist, lane departure assist, and lane change assist.\n\nPower comes from a front electric motor (model TZ175XSAY501) with a maximum power of 150 kW (201 hp). The lithium iron phosphate battery packs are available in three capacities: 50.03 kWh, 58 kWh, and 67.9 kWh, which correspond to a CLTC cruising range of 430 km, 520 km, and 610 km, respectively. Under fast charging, it takes 24 minutes to replenish the battery from 30% to 80%. Slow charging takes 10 hours.\n\nComing inside, the interior is available in three color schemes: beige, black, and orange. The cockpit features a layered dashboard that hosts a dual-color multi-function steering wheel, an 8.8-inch LCD instrument panel, and a 14.6-inch floating central control screen powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip, supporting voice recognition and OTA updates.\n\nOther configurations include 32-color ambient lights, seven airbags, 11 Yamaha speakers, mobile phone wireless charging, a panoramic sunroof, and a foldable rear armrest for the back seats.\n\nIn 2024, the GAC-Toyota joint venture sold 770,100 vehicles, down 14.5% from 901,000 vehicles in 2023. Among its models, the sales of smart plug-in hybrid models have increased, accounting for 48% of the total sales.

One Toyota Highlander owner found this out the hard way after buying a 2001 model with just over 100,000 miles (160,000 km). A trip to the shop for what they thought would be minor repairs resulted in a $8,913 estimate.\n\nAccording to their post on Reddit, it all began with a seemingly reasonable $5,000 purchase of the Toyota SUV last month. Then about a week ago, they noticed something \u201cweird on the front driver side around the wheel,\u201d that they could feel and hear. Like any responsible car owner, they took it to the shop. Then, the shocking part happened.\n\nRead: New Mach-E Owner Says His Paint Looks Like An Orange Peel And Ford Dealer Won\u2019t Help\n\nThe repair estimate quickly spiraled into an extensive list of recommended work. Right off the bat, the shop included new shocks and struts for all four corners. While replacing the front or rear pairs together is fairly standard practice, doing all four at once might be overkill, unless they were truly shot. If the front ones are worn, it\u2019s fair to assume the rears aren\u2019t far behind, but that alone doesn\u2019t justify the massive price tag.\n\nPhoto Toyota\n\nThen, the shop added new lower control arms and sway bar end links for the front of the Highlander. It\u2019s certainly plausible that these contribute to whatever the sound is. Beyond those items, it seems that the mechanic is also tacking on whatever else the vehicle might need and that list is a touch more suspect.\n\n$212 For Mounting New Tires\n\nFor starters, they wanted $212.24 to mount and balance tires that they\u2019d also like to sell the customer for $611 before adding another $100 for a tire protection plan. Having run a wheel and tire shop for years, I can tell you that most shops will mount and balance for free if you buy the tires from them. Why this shop is so drastically different I can\u2019t say.\n\nThings got even stranger when they listed an alignment estimate\u2014twice. They also include a battery replacement and an $89 electrical test service where they clean out the battery tray and clean off the battery terminals. All of this somewhat pales in comparison to the $1,158 they\u2019d like to replace the rear brakes, do a brake fluid flush, and \u201cclean all oil after oil leak repair.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, as some have pointed out in the comment section, the shop might just be doing its due diligence to a degree. If we ignore the pricing, it does seem as though the mechanic is trying to address what the tech sees as potential causes or contributing factors to the customer\u2019s complaint and additional safety concerns. Hopefully, they\u2019ll get a second opinion, something plenty of people online have already suggested.",

            "content": "Reviewed by Bob Hernandez\n\nThe hybrid model is the stronger choice in the current Highlander lineup for its blend of efficiency and performance. It\u2019s possible that the next-generation Highlander, expected to debut for 2026, will be available exclusively with hybrid powertrains, following in the footsteps of the hybrid-only Camry, Sequoia, and Sienna. Slotting above the RAV4 and below the Grand Highlander in the brand\u2019s SUV range, the 2026 Highlander Hybrid will compete against the Ford Explorer Hybrid and Kia Sorento Hybrid. (2025 model pictured above)\n\nDon\u2019t need as much space? Toyota sells the also hybrid Crown Signia\u2014read about it here.\n\nWhat\u2019s New\n\nFor the Highlander\u2019s 2026 redesign, the lineup might adopt only hybrid powertrains. New and expanded technology features and updated design should also be part of the model reset.\n\nHighlander\u2019s Hybrid Powertrain\n\nIf the Highlander indeed goes hybrid-only for the 2026 redesign, Toyota already has the powertrain. The previous-gen setup mated a 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder engine and two electric motors to make a total of 243 hp\u2014not massive, but useful. AWD fuel economy came out to a good 35/35 mpg city/highway, especially considering this is a big SUV. It seems like the easiest thing would be to simply port over this powertrain.\n\nA Second Hybrid Powertrain?\n\nTo take the Highlander a little more upmarket and increase capability, Toyota could introduce a second, more powerful hybrid setup as an upgrade. The automaker has both inline four-cylinder and V-6 based systems, so the only real question might be which one to use.\n\nThe full-size Sequoia\u2019s 3.4-liter twin-turbocharged V-6 with an electric motor that makes 437 hp would be bonkers in the Highlander, especially since the model previously ran a V-6. Output might be too much of a jump from the base model, though.\n\nThe Grand Highlander\u2019s Hybrid Max powertrain system seems the more logical candidate. The bigger three-row SUV\u2019s upgrade comes with a 2.4-liter turbo-four and motors that makes up to 362 hp. If the Highlander were to also make the same amount of torque, 400 lb-ft, it would almost certainly improve drivability and could increase towing capacity. The 2025 Highlander Hybrid can tow only 3,500 pounds when properly equipped, trailing behind the Hybrid Max\u2019s 5,000 pounds in the 2025 Grand Highlander.\n\nIt's not out of the realm of possibility that Toyota would offer a plug-in hybrid Highlander. The automaker has plug-in versions of the Prius and RAV4, both of which boast more than 40 miles of all-electric range.\n\nSpace Improvements\n\nWe\u2019re not sure the Highlander Hybrid can get much bigger given there\u2019s already a closely associated bigger model, the Grand Highlander Hybrid. We commended the previous-gen Highlander for its spaciousness and great packaging, especially given there\u2019s no room penalty for being a hybrid (some hybrids\u2019 underfloor batteries can cut into cabin space). This also means the third row will likely still be on the small side.\n\nThe 2026 model\u2019s interior dimensions should be about the same as the previous model year. That should give the new model more second-row legroom and standard cargo capacity (behind the second row) than the 2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid.\n\nLegroom (first/second/third row):\n\n2025 Toyota Highlander Hybrid \u2013 40.4/41.0/27.7 inches\n\n2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid \u2013 41.4/40.7/29.6 inches\n\nCargo space (behind third/second/first rows):\n\n2025 Toyota Highlander Hybrid \u2013 16.0/48.4/84.3 cubic feet\n\n2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid \u2013 75.5/45.0/12.6 cubic feet\n\nTechnology\n\nToyota Safety Sense 3.0 should be included with the 2026 Highlander Hybrid, or possibly a newer version if that becomes available. Standard features will probably include automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping and centering, traffic sign recognition, and automatic high-beams. Self-driving tech could even debut with the next Highlander Hybrid.\n\nThe lineup\u2019s 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen was previously an upgrade but should become standard with the 2026 model. The previous year SUV came with a tiny standard 8.0-inch screen. Lexus\u2019 14.3-inch touchscreen might be a suitable upgrade, and if Toyota wants to get real fancy, they could put a screen in the dash ahead of the front passenger. Highlander Hybrid drivers already get a nice 12.3-inch display, and we believe that could carry over to the 2026 model.\n\nHow Much? When?\n\nLook for 2026 Highlander Hybrid base model prices to start at roughly $49,000, while the top model should start closer to $57,000. The production model should debut in the middle of 2025, with deliveries beginning later that year.\n\nOther 3-Row Hybrid SUVs:\n\n\u25cfFord Explorer Hybrid\n\n\u25cfKia Sorento Hybrid\n\n\u25cfToyota Grand Highlander Hybrid",

            "content": "Toyota's hybrids crushed it last year. While the company has been slow to launch compelling electric cars, its hybrid dominance continues to expand. Sales of hybrid models grew 21.1% across the globe last year, according to the company's year-end sales report.\n\nWe already knew that Toyota hybrids had a good year in America. The company now offers hybrid versions of all of the important models it sells (Sorry Toyota GR 86, Supra and Lexus IS, but your sales barely register). The Camry, Land Cruiser, Sienna, Venza and Sequoia are only available as hybrids, and we expect the best-selling RAV4 to go the same direction when it's redesigned.\n\nThe new Land Cruiser is available exclusively as a hybrid. Same for the Camry, Sienna, Venza and Sequoia.\n\nThe company's dominance makes sense. It popularized the hybrid with the launch of the Prius over 20 years ago, and has continued to refine its technology. Toyota hybrids are reliable, efficient and affordable, so it's a win worth celebrating.\n\nIt's also one I feel compelled to recognize, because we at InsideEVs have been tough on Toyota. That's justifiable, I think. The company has more experience with electrification than anyone else, and has thus far failed to convert that into success in the EV era. Its sole Toyota-branded EV offering in the U.S., the bZ4x, feels half-assed. I wasn't impressed with the Lexus version, either. And while Toyota swears more and better EVs are coming eventually, other competitors have those on sale right now.\n\nBut its hybrids are great options for those who are not ready or unwilling to take the electric plunge. It's a sad fact that many people don't have reliable charging access, and the cost barrier to EVs remains too high. Hybrids serve as a natural, people-pleasing middle step. They may not be as clean as full EVs, but they're a big improvement over traditional ICE vehicles. I especially appreciate their reliability, as Toyota's consistent refinement has produced durable powertrains bound to last longer than you'd keep a car for. I can't count how many times I've been in a Prius taxi with over 250,000 miles, and I firmly believe that reliability is key to sustainability. A sustainable society would not produce disposable objects.\n\nOf course, that focus on reliability leads Toyota to often be a late adopter of new tech. The company is still getting the hang of turbocharged engines, a decade after they went mainstream. This strategy doesn't always pay off\u2014despite being ten years behind the curve on turbocharging, for instance, Toyota has still had massive issues with the Tundra's new turbo V-6. But the bZ4x has so far been mostly free of the reliability issues we've seen in other first-draft EVs. So maybe they're onto something.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nEither way, it's clear that Toyota's EVs are not yet an important part of its portfolio. Worldwide, the company sold just 139,832 EVs. That's a small number relative to Ford, Hyundai, General Motors, Tesla or the Volkswagen group, but it's a 34.5% gain over last year. That means the EV market is growing faster than the hybrid market even for Toyota, though from a much, much lower baseline. Toyota moved 4.14 million hybrids last year. EVs have a lot of catching up to do.\n\nAs a further baby step, plug-in hybrids are doing well too. Toyota sold 153,829 PHEVs globally last year, up 23.4% year over year. I'd note, too, that this appears to be supply-limited. RAV4 Primes remain highly in-demand and often transact for over MSRP. That's in comparison to the bZ4x, which required a lot of incentives to sell this year. So I'm not sure if EVs will surpass PHEVs on Toyota's global sales chart next year; EVs have the momentum, but PHEVs have been constrained more on the manufacturing side.\n\nThe Rav4 Prime is a great option, if you can find one on a dealer lot.\n\nEither way, the company is showing solid growth across its electrified offerings. The one categorical exception is its hydrogen fuel-cell offerings. FCEV sales fell 55.8% last year worldwide That's from a pretty low starting point: 4,023 cars in 2023, now down to 1,778 sales this year. Yowch.\n\nStill, there's a lot of optimism in this report. The world's fleet is electrifying. Though it may happen more slowly than we hoped, that's almost always true with human progress. Things may not happen as quickly as we want them to, but they move generally in the right direction.\n\nSo if a hybrid is what it takes to wean you off gas, do it. By the time you buy your next car, the EV offerings will be even better.\n\nContact the author: Mack.Hogan@insideevs.com.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

It is testament to our engineers and our designers that it happened.\n\n\"If you have a smaller restrictor then your engine characteristics change mostly around the rev range, so it becomes more important to use the rpm lower than before which affects the tuning of the engine, so the engine jokers were changed at the last minute.\n\n\"We always have a new engine for Monte Carlo and we changed the development plan in October and November last year when the restrictor size was coming as news.\n\n\"We did some camshafts and an exhaust manifold which are tuned specifically for the new intake size. So that's two jokers on the engine for those parts.\n\n\"Then at the same time, we used a chassis joker to change the gear ratios in the gearbox and again that was a last-minute change as we are not planning to do that.\"\n\nAll of the upgrades were fitted to three of the five GR Yaris in Monte Carlo with Takamoto Katsuta and Sami Pajari set to receive the full 2025 package at a later date.\n\nIt proved to be a successful debut for the team as Sebastian Ogier and Elfyn Evans headed a one-two with Kalle Rovanpera finishing fourth.\n\nWatch: Rallye Monte-Carlo Wolf Power Stage highlights",

Sales in China fell 6.9 percent to 1.78 million vehicles amid stiff price competition.\n\nSales of hybrid vehicles rose 21.1 percent to 4.14 million vehicles, lifted by increasing demand in key markets such as North America and Europe amid a cooling boom for EVs globally.

Auto Show, activists from Public Citizen called on Toyota Motor Corp. to stop funding the campaigns of climate change deniers. The activists disrupted a presentation to Toyota during the U.S. News & World Report Best Cars for the Money Awards.\n\n\u201cToyota has been funding a small army of climate denying lawmakers, empowering a dangerous cadre of politicians that are accelerating climate change,\u201d said Adam Zuckerman, senior clean vehicles campaigner with Public Citizen\u2019s Climate Program. \u201cWalking around the DC Auto Show, it is evident that electric vehicles are not only the future, they are the present. Yet, Toyota insists on financing the campaigns of extremist lawmakers, while lobbying aggressively against stronger emissions and fuel economy standards. The world\u2019s largest automaker is pursuing policies that will roll back the modest progress made to protect our communities and planet.\u201d\n\nThe activists unfurled banners reading \u201cToyota: stop driving climate denial!\u201d and \u201cToyota: stop funding climate deniers!\u201d and chanted \u201cHey Toyota, stop toying with the climate!\u201d The action comes two weeks after Public Citizen published a report that found that by the end of the 2024 election cycle, Toyota had donated to over four times as many climate change denying members of Congress as Ford Motor Company and nearly twice as many as General Motors.\n\n\u201cDespite over a decade of record-setting global temperatures, Toyota continues the company\u2019s futile effort to hold onto internal combustion and fossil fuels,\u201d said Zuckerman. \u201cWhile the company continues to play into the extreme politics of climate change denial, Toyota is failing to innovate and plan for a cleaner transportation future. Automakers have a responsibility to prioritize the health of our families and communities. A major part of that responsibility requires the auto industry to start making affordable electric vehicles available to consumers.\u201d\n\nPhotos from the event are available here.

            "content": "They might be a tough sell, considering Hertz is asking more for these used SUVs than Toyota charges for a new one\n\nToyota just launched a brand new 4Runner but Hertz has a selection from last year now up for sale.\n\nThe rental giant might struggle to move these SUVs, as their prices often exceed those of new 4Runners.\n\nIn fact, they\u2019re sometimes more expensive than the vehicle would\u2019ve been when brand-new itself.\n\nRental vehicles are often maligned on the used-car market for being ridden hard and put up wet, so to speak. While that\u2019s certainly not true of every rental, it\u2019s a genuine concern for buyers, one that can be enough to steer them away. Hertz\u2019s pricing seems to suggest that it believes its rental cars are actually worth more after time in service.\n\nIt has a large batch\u2014149, to be precise, at the time of publishing\u2014of previous-generation 2024 Toyota 4Runners up for sale, many with surprisingly low mileage, and the prices are very strange.\n\nMore: Hertz Selling Its Shelby Mustang Mach-E Fleet For A Price That\u2019ll Short-Circuit Your Wallet\n\nTake for example this 4Runner SR5 with 20,177 miles on the odometer for sale from Hertz in Baltimore, Maryland. While SR5 is the base trim of the 4Runner, this at least has 4WD as an additional option. Beyond that though, there isn\u2019t much to get excited about, and even less so when you see the price tag. Hertz\u2019s \u201cNo Haggle Price\u201d is $47,488.\n\nFor the record, the lowest-mileage 4Runner SR5 models\u2014of which there seem to be a few with under 10,000 miles\u2014hover around the $45,000 mark.\n\nThat might not sound too high considering that the new-generation 4Runner that we recently reviewed has multiple trims priced at $66,900 before dealer markups, but let us give you some perspective here. The base 4Runner SR5 4X4 from 2024 had an MSRP of $42,705 when it was brand-spanking-new. That\u2019s not all though, there\u2019s more. A very quick search online garners several examples of the 4Runner with similar mileage and identical features for thousands less.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the real issue which is that Toyota itself is undercutting Hertz with the all-new 4Runner! That\u2019s right, you\u2019ll be better off rolling over to your local Toyota dealer and buying a brand-new 4Runner rather than buying a used one from Hertz. The base SR5 goes for $42,220 and including 4WD only pushes that price up by another $2,000\u2014again, that holds true as long as Toyota dealers don\u2019t mark up the price.\n\nNotably, Hertz has some TRD Sport and TRD Off-Road trims of the 4Runner available as well but those aren\u2019t dramatically better from a value perspective. This two-wheel drive 4Runner TRD Sport has a price of $44,213 with 25,565 miles on the odometer. That said, it\u2019s worth mentioning that Hertz could lower these prices over time, just as it did with the Shelby Mach-Es we recently told you about.\n\nRead: Hertz Offers Teslas For Under $20K, But You Probably Shouldn\u2019t Jump On It\n\nNevertheless, right now, for $4,500 more, a buyer could get a sixth-generation 2025 4Runner TRD Sport with all of the new bells and whistles that come with it. We\u2019ve reached out to Toyota for additional information on its pricing strategy here and we\u2019ll update this post if we hear back.",

Including the Daihatsu and Hino subsidiaries, deliveries reached 10,821,480 units, down by 3.7% versus 2023.\n\nToyota hasn't published full sales results for 2024, but it already has a reason to celebrate. Through November, it sold 9,857,938 vehicles globally. For clarity, the number also includes units sold by its Lexus, Daihatsu, and Hino subsidiaries. This week, the Volkswagen Group announced its complete sales results for the last 12 months, during which shipments fell by 2.3% to 9,239,500 cars and trucks.\n\nEven without factoring in its December sales, which have yet to be reported, Toyota already has a significant advantage of 618,438 vehicles over the VW Group. For the fifth year in a row, the Japanese giant is the world's biggest automaker. That's despite a 3.6% decline in sales between January and November compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nAlthough Toyota's electric vehicle efforts have had a rocky start, its huge range of combustion-engine cars has enabled the company to reach every corner of the world. From diminutive kei cars for Japan to full-size SUVs for America, we cannot think of a gap in Toyota's lineup. It has sedans, wagons, trucks, minivans, and even a few performance cars, although models like the GR86 and GR Supra are niche products and consequently don't move the needle.\n\nOnce again, the VW Group failed to catch up despite having far more sub-brands under its vast corporate umbrella. The German automotive conglomerate also offers a broader array of plug-in hybrids and EVs, but that wasn't enough to dethrone Toyota.\n\nThe Hyundai Motor Group, which includes the main brand Hyundai together with Kia and Genesis, is likely to claim the last spot on the podium after registering 7.23 million sales in 2024, or 1 % less than the year before.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nSource: Toyota\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Despite this milestone, Toyota experienced a 3.7% decline in total group unit sales, including those from its subsidiaries, Daihatsu and Hino Motors.\n\nThe primary factor behind this decline was a significant drop in domestic sales in Japan, primarily attributed to management challenges at Daihatsu concerning certification test procedures.\n\nSign up for CBT News\u2019 daily newsletter and get the latest industry stories delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSales Performance and Market Impact\n\nFurther, Toyota\u2019s parent-only vehicle sales, encompassing the Toyota and Lexus brands, fell by 1.4% to 10.2 million units. A double-digit decrease in Japan drove this, although the company posted strong overall sales due to growing demand for hybrid vehicles in the U.S.\n\nIn China, however, Toyota faced a 6.9% drop in unit sales, impacted by fierce price competition in the world\u2019s largest car market.\n\nHybrids account for a record 40.8% of Toyota\u2019s total sales, while battery electric vehicles (BEVs) account for 1.4%. Despite the global challenges, Toyota\u2019s focus on hybrid technology continues to drive sales, especially in key markets like the U.S.\n\nOn the other hand, Volkswagen, Toyota\u2019s main competitor, reported a 2.3% decline in sales, selling just over 9 million vehicles in 2024.

Designed for extreme conditions, this off-road beast is more than just an upgraded SUV\u2014it\u2019s a machine engineered to conquer snow, sand, and rocky landscapes with confidence.\n\nScheduled for release in 2025, the Arctic Trucks AT37 takes the legendary Toyota Land Cruiser and pushes its off-road capabilities to new heights. With a lifted suspension, oversized tires, and reinforced chassis, this modified 4\u00d74 is built to handle anything the wild throws at it.\n\nUpgraded Suspension & 37-Inch Tires for Superior Ground Clearance\n\nThe Arctic Trucks AT37 features a 1.5-inch suspension lift, providing the extra height needed to accommodate 37-inch BFGoodrich tires. This modification enhances ground clearance while maintaining OEM-like ride quality and handling, thanks to Arctic Trucks\u2019 R53 suspension system.\n\nWith a wider track and extended wheelbase, the AT37 improves stability on rough terrain, making it an ideal choice for off-road enthusiasts who demand performance and control in unpredictable conditions. Whether navigating deep snow, rocky inclines, or muddy trails, this Land Cruiser is built to handle it all.\n\nReinforced Frame & Flared Fenders for Extra Durability\n\nArctic Trucks didn\u2019t just focus on ride height and tire size\u2014they also reinforced the frame to handle heavier loads and extreme stress. This upgrade ensures that the AT37 can withstand the demands of expedition-style travel or intense off-road excursions without compromising structural integrity.\n\nFlared fenders complete the aggressive stance, providing extra clearance for the larger tires while protecting the body from debris, mud, and harsh elements. These modifications don\u2019t just improve function\u2014they give the AT37 a bold, commanding presence.\n\nCentral Tire Inflation System for Instant Adjustments\n\nA standout feature of the Arctic Trucks AT37 is its Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS). This advanced setup allows drivers to adjust tire pressure on the fly, optimizing traction for different terrains. Lowering pressure improves grip on sand and snow, while increasing it ensures stability on paved roads.\n\nFor those who frequently transition between highways and off-road trails, this system eliminates the hassle of manually adjusting tire pressure, making adventure travel more seamless than ever.\n\nDesigned for Arctic Conditions & Extreme Adventures\n\nArctic Trucks is known for building expedition-grade vehicles, and the AT37 follows in that tradition. Their modifications have been tested in some of the world\u2019s harshest environments, from the icy landscapes of Antarctica to the rugged trails of Iceland.\n\nWith its reinforced frame, lifted suspension, and terrain-adaptive tires, the AT37 is built for adventurers, off-road enthusiasts, and explorers who refuse to be limited by geography.\n\nExpected Release & Availability\n\nThe Arctic Trucks AT37 Toyota Land Cruiser is set to be available in 2025. As anticipation builds, off-road enthusiasts and adventure seekers can expect further details on pricing and customization options in the coming months.\n\nFor the latest updates, visit Arctic Trucks\u2019 official website.",

Since its 1997 launch, global Prius sales have reached more than 5.3 million units, including 350,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n\nAs a pathfinder for new technologies, Prius has consistently pioneered new innovations. Sold exclusively as a plug-in hybrid in Europe, the fifth generation is the cleanest and most efficient Prius ever, as well as possessing the power to surprise with a total system output of 223 DIN hp (164 kW).\n\nWith its dual DNA of true electric vehicle driving and the convenience of hybrid, the latest Prius achieves a driving range of up to 86 km (WLTP combined) of near-silent electric driving with no tailpipe emissions, enough for full electric driving on most daily journeys. When driven exclusively on city or urban roads, Prius\u2019 equivalent all-electric range increases to 110 km.\n\nFor longer trips, or when charging is not practical, the latest plug-in hybrid technology delivers low-emission power without compromise. On the most efficient grade, fuel consumption is just 0.5 l/100 km, with an ultra-low combined WLTP CO 2 emissions rating of 11 g/km - the lowest ever for a Prius.\n\nAs the first Toyota to feature upgraded solar charging, the fifth-generation Prius can even charge itself with the equivalent of up to 8.7 km in electric driving range per day.\n\nThe 2025 line-up maintains the Prius tradition of innovation and improvement by introducing an intelligent geo-fencing function for enhanced efficiency and convenience, becoming just the second Toyota to feature this system, following the Toyota CH-R.\n\nThe geo-fencing system analyses road and traffic conditions via the cloud navigation. This data is combined with ongoing learning of a user\u2019s regular routes and driving style to enable the Prius to maximise battery charge for upcoming low emission zones by automatically switching between hybrid and electric modes. If the route passes through a BEV-mandatory zone, the geo-fencing system ensures sufficient range to do so entirely in EV mode, while if the destination is within a low emission zone, the system automatically retains charge to complete the journey in electric mode.\n\nIn addition to the geo-fencing technology, the 2025 Prius line-up includes additional premium features as standard on all grades. An app-based digital key gives up to five users the convenience of accessing and starting the car with their smartphone, while devices can be easily charged via a wireless charger in the front cabin.\n\nAs well as new standard features, the 2025 Prius continues to make safety a priority and comes with the latest generation of Toyota\u2019s T-Mate system and Toyota Safety Sense. These include the latest driver assist and accident prevention features alongside systems to enhance safety, ease of use and peace of mind.\n\nThe 2025 Toyota Prius is on sale now across Europe.",

Carpenter also paces Ludden (12-3) in points, steals, and made threes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me, it\u2019s definitely my teammates,\u201d said the 2024 All-CNY large school girls basketball team selection. \u201cLooking at the stats, sometimes I lead in points and assists, but it really is a group effort and I could not do it without my teammates.\u201d\n\nCarpenter and Co. sit second in the Section III standings, behind only Weedsport (12-2). The Gaelic Knights can improve their standing Friday night at rival Bishop Grimes. Three weeks ago, Carpenter played a large part in taking down the Cobras; at the time the top-ranked team in Class B. The guard led all scorers with 20 points while setting her career-high in assists with 11. Following the graduation of All-CNY large school All-Star Bridget Dunham, Carpenter has stepped up in more ways than one.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always about the we and not the me,\u201d stated head coach Carm Petrera. \u201cThat\u2019s just the type of kid she is. She\u2019s one of those athletes that you gravitate towards because she truly believes in what she\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nPetrera gravitated towards Carpenter over three years ago, when the coach brought her on varsity in eighth grade. As a sophomore last season, the guard was already Bishop Ludden\u2019s third-best scorer. Carpenter helped the Gaelic Knights to an 18-4 record and a trip to the sectional semifinals, where they lost to Cicero-North Syracuse.\n\n\u201cIn sectionals, we definitely got a good shot [this year],\u201d Carpenter said of Ludden\u2019s chances to win it all. \u201cWe really need to play our best games, which we\u2019ve been doing lately.\u201d\n\nOver Bishop Ludden\u2019s recent four-game win streak, its average margin of victory is 35 points. Carpenter during that stretch? 19 points, 5.5 assists, and 5.3 steals a night. The junior notched a career-high 25 points and seven triples last Tuesday against Homer.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t teach her work ethic because it\u2019s so contagious,\u201d added Petrera. \u201cEveryone underestimates this kid.\u201d",

            "content": "Tacoma is the first Midsize Pickup Truck to Win the Top Honor at the Texas Auto Writers Association Annual Truck Rodeo\n\nPLANO, Texas, Jan. 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The all-new, fourth-generation Toyota Tacoma was awarded the title Truck of Texas by the Texas Auto Writers Association (TAWA) at their 31st annual Texas Truck Rodeo event. It is the first time a midsize pickup truck has earned Truck of Texas. This marks the third time in four years a Toyota pickup has taken the top award at the Truck Rodeo, with the full-size Tundra earning the honors in 2022 and 2024.\n\nToyota Tacoma Named Truck of Texas\n\nTAWA awarded the all-new Lexus GX 550 the other top award at the Truck Rodeo: SUV of Texas. It also voted on category and technical awards at the media drive event. Tacoma earned Midsize Truck of Texas, while the GX 550 is Midsize SUV of Texas. Toyota's Wireless Trailer Camera received the Best Towing Technology award, and the Best Driver Assist or Safety Feature went to Toyota's Safety Sense 3.0.\n\n\"After being the most popular midsize pickup in the U.S. the last 20 years in a row, it's great to see the all-new Tacoma be presented Truck of Texas,\" said Dedra DeLilli, Toyota vice president - Vehicle Marketing and Communications. \"We are honored that TAWA recognized the Tacoma as the first Truck of Texas from a segment other than full-size pickup.\"\n\nThe new generation Tacoma debuted in the spring of 2023 with two new powertrains, including the i-FORCE MAX hybrid powertrain, with a total system output of up to 326 horsepower and a whopping 465 lb.-ft. of torque, a 75 percent increase in torque compared to the previous generation V-6 powered truck. Designed by Calty Design Research in California, engineered by TMNA R&D in Ann Arbor, and assembled for North America, Tacoma offers 11 unique grades to fit various lifestyles and customer needs. The new Trailhunter grade builds upon Toyota's legendary off-road and overlanding credibility with purpose-built engineering and robust components.\n\nThe Baja-inspired TRD Pro debuted the segment-first IsoDynamic Performance Seat for enhanced off-road driving control and comfort, while the first-ever Trailhunter grade is a factory-developed overlanding rig built from the ground up with the latest integrated off-road equipment from ARB, Old Man Emu, and RIGID.\n\nTAWA's annual Texas Truck Rodeo brings together journalists to evaluate automakers' latest trucks and SUVs on an off-road course and a street drive. The fall event was held at Eagles Canyon Raceway in Decatur, Texas. Vehicles from the world's top manufacturers were evaluated on interior, exterior, value, performance, and personal appeal.\n\n\"The Truck of Texas award is prestigious and competitive, and the Tacoma has truly earned the title,\" said TAWA President Cory Fourniquet. \"The Tacoma impressed our members with its diverse grades and new powertrains.\"\n\nTAWA is a Texas-based nonprofit association for automotive journalists promoting professionalism and quality in journalism for more than two decades. TAWA has grown to become one of the most influential and recognized automotive journalist associates in the U.S. The group produces two annual events \u2013 Texas Auto Roundup and Texas Truck Rodeo \u2013 that allow members to experience vehicles from various manufacturers in one place, at one time.\n\nFor more information on the Toyota Tacoma, visit the Toyota Newsroom.\n\nAbout Toyota\n\nToyota (NYSE:TM) has been a part of the cultural fabric in the U.S. for nearly 70 years, and is committed to advancing sustainable, next-generation mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands, plus our nearly 1,500 dealerships.\n\nToyota directly employs nearly 48,000 people in the U.S. who have contributed to the design, engineering, and assembly of more than 35 million cars and trucks at our 11 manufacturing plants.

            "content": "Back when Toyota first launched the Prius as a compact alternative to gas-guzzling vehicles on the market, it was a revelation. Its small but mighty motor lent its power to the internal combustion engine to improve overall fuel efficiency. Toyota has kept on hybridizing its lineup over the years, and the most recent model to get hybrid power is, you guessed it, the new 4Runner.\n\nThe 2025 4Runner hybrid isn't as focused on fuel efficiency as it is on power and performance. With the i-Force Max setup, a turbocharged 2.4-liter engine works with the electric motor to produce 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque, and it gets up to 24 mpg, according to the EPA. Without the electric motor to help it out, the gas-only variant is good for 278 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque and gets up to 26 mpg on the highway.\n\nThis became evident when I tested the 4Runner TRD Off-Road back-to-back with the hybrid setup and without. On a closed off-road course, the gas-only 4Runner was just as capable as its predecessor \u2014 it's safe to say I do not miss the 4.0-liter V6 from the last-gen 4Runner. The hybrid is more potent on paper, and on the road the difference is even bigger than the numbers suggest. The hybrid models have more immediate shove. On steep hills, the electric motor steps up for duty, bridging the gap as the turbocharger spools up and scaling challenging angles and hillsides with no hesitation.\n\nToyota says the hybrid is not in production quite yet, with an on-sale date set for the end of March. In the meantime, the gas-only version is available right now.\n\nOff-Road or Off-Road Premium?",

            "content": "Hybrids are hot right now, and you have lots of choices if you\u2019re considering a hybrid SUV. For years, the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid has been the go-to model for hybrid SUV shoppers. It\u2019s no surprise since Toyota has earned a strong reputation for its hybrids, but the RAV4 Hybrid also delivers SUV necessities such as roomy seating, a large cargo area, and plenty of tech features. However, the Toyota faces ever stronger competition these days, and one of the latest newcomers is the Hyundai Tucson Hybrid. It\u2019s sleek, modern and packed with impressive tech. But is it the better hybrid SUV? Edmunds compared both compact hybrid SUVs to find out.\n\nPower and fuel economy\n\nPowering the RAV4 Hybrid is a four-cylinder engine paired with a hybrid system that produces a combined output of 219 horsepower. When we tested the RAV4 Hybrid, it went from 0 to 60 mph in a respectable 7.8 seconds. The ample power is complemented by an impressive EPA-estimated 39 mpg in combined city/highway driving and 37 mpg combined for the rugged Woodland Edition.\n\nThe Tucson Hybrid utilizes a more powerful hybrid powertrain that\u2019s based on a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It produces 231 horsepower, which helped it achieve a slightly quicker 7.7-second 0-60 mph time. However, the Hyundai delivers a lower 38 mpg combined in the base Blue trim level and 35 mpg combined in all other trim levels. On our mixed-driving testing route, the Tucson Hybrid delivered 34 mpg versus the RAV4 Hybrid\u2019s 35 mpg.\n\nAlthough the Tucson Hybrid is more powerful and quicker, hybrids are about fuel efficiency, so the RAV4 Hybrid wins this category.\n\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid\n\nTechnology and driver assist features\n\nBoth hybrid SUVs come standard with a package of advanced driver assist features including emergency automatic braking and lane keeping assistance. A helpful 360-degree camera system is standard on the highest trim of the Tucson Hybrid, but it\u2019s optional on the RAV4 Hybrid\u2019s top trims. The Tucson Hybrid also offers a more advanced highway driving assist system that helps make highway driving easier by doing most of the work for you.\n\nThe Tucson Hybrid also has the advantage in tech thanks to most models having a large 12.3-inch driver display and center touchscreen. The RAV4 Hybrid starts with an 8-inch center touchscreen but offers a larger 10.5-inch unit. The standard Toyota driver display is part analog and part digital, and a fully digital 12.3-inch display is only available on the higher trim levels. Wireless smartphone connectivity is standard on both vehicles, but the Tucson Hybrid has a wireless smartphone charger as standard. It\u2019s optional on the Toyota.\n\nThe Tucson Hybrid\u2019s superior tech gives it the win here.\n\nWinner: Tucson Hybrid\n\nComfort and cargo space\n\nBoth hybrid SUVs provide comfortable and supportive seats, but the Tucson Hybrid\u2019s are more plush. Both hybrid SUVs boast comfortable ride quality; however, the Hyundai has an edge, with its smoother ride giving it the advantage. The Tucson Hybrid also has a quieter hybrid powertrain. The RAV4 Hybrid tends to drone when accelerating.\n\nAs for passenger space, it\u2019s pretty even, although the Tucson Hybrid offers a few more inches of rear legroom and more room for infant car seats. Both hybrid SUVs provide among the most cargo space in their class, but the Tucson Hybrid has slightly more: 38.7 cubic feet vs. 37.6 cubic feet.\n\nWinner: Tucson Hybrid\n\nPricing and value\n\nThe RAV4 Hybrid has a starting price of $33,295 for the base LE trim. The top Limited trim starts at $41,600. The Tucson Hybrid\u2019s base Blue trim starts at $34,815, and the top Limited trim has a starting price of $42,645. However, the Tucson\u2019s higher base price is justified because it comes with more standard features such as heated front seats, a larger center touchscreen and a hands-free power liftgate. It\u2019s the same for the top trims, the Tucson\u2019s Limited trim has more features than the RAV4\u2019s including the previously mentioned 360-degree camera system, a panoramic sunroof and a heated steering wheel.\n\nAnother way the Tucson Hybrid offers greater value is that the RAV4 Hybrid is starting to show its age. It hasn\u2019t been redesigned since 2019, while the Tucson Hybrid\u2019s 2022 redesign and 2025 refresh make it much more modern-looking inside and out. The Hyundai also boasts a more refined and premium feel. To top it off, the Tucson offers longer warranties.\n\nWinner: Tucson Hybrid\n\nEdmunds says\n\nThe Hyundai Tucson Hybrid\u2019s superior comfort, value and tech make it the winner of this comparison. Even though it\u2019s slightly less fuel-efficient, the more modern Tucson Hybrid is the better buy. However, a redesigned Toyota RAV4 is right around the corner and should be significantly better.\n\n____\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\n\nMichael Cantu is a contributor at Edmunds.",

            "content": "A redesigned sixth-generation Toyota RAV4 is anticipated to debut in 2025\n\nThe new RAV4 may be offered exclusively with hybrid powertrains\n\nThe starting price should continue to remain in the low $30,000 range\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 has stood for decades as a symbol of an affordable and practical vehicle with stellar dependability. However, with the current fifth-generation model, Toyota dialed up the performance by adding a plug-in hybrid powertrain packing 302 hp.\n\nThe current RAV4 has been on sale since 2018, making it one of the oldest vehicles in Toyota's lineup. That won\u2019t be the case for long, as a new sixth-generation model has been spotted testing ahead of an expected debut later this year.\n\nThrough the camouflage, we can see that the designers have opted for a much more chiseled look for the new RAV4, along with a headlight and grille combination similar to what\u2019s found on the Toyota Crown Signia introduced for the 2025 model year. There also appears to be a more steeply raked windshield compared to the current RAV4, plus a much more upright tailgate, which should result in increased cargo space.\n\nToyota hasn\u2019t shared details about the new RAV4 yet, though an electric powertrain isn't expected, even though Toyota engineers were spotted testing prototypes alongside a Tesla Model Y, according to our photographer. Instead, it\u2019s more likely that Toyota will offer an all-hybrid lineup, something we've already seen with the latest Camry launched for the 2025 model year. A senior Toyota official stated last year that the automaker was considering offering only gas engines paired with hybrid technology in the U.S.\n\n2026 Toyota RAV4 spy shots - Photo via Baldauf\n\nEvery 2025 Camry has a 2.5-liter inline-4 rated at 184 hp. It pairs with a hybrid system to generate a peak of 225 hp in front-wheel-drive models. All-wheel-drive models get an electric motor at the rear axle, along with a slightly higher combined output of 232 hp. Expect similar offerings in the RAV4. A plug-in hybrid powertrain should also be offered, though perhaps not at launch.\n\nThe platform for the new RAV4 is likely to be the latest evolution of the TNGA-K modular platform that underpins the current RAV4. There are rumors that more aluminum will replace non-structural steel elements to help reduce weight.\n\nThe new RAV4 is expected to reach U.S. showrooms later this year as a 2026 model and with a base price expected to remain in the low $30,000 range. The formula is one Toyota won\u2019t want to get wrong. With 475,193 units sold in the U.S. last year, the current RAV4 is Toyota\u2019s most popular vehicle and the third-best-selling vehicle overall, trailing only the Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks.",

            "content": "When the Toyota 4Runner debuted in April, many Toyota fans were confused. The brand had recently revealed a new Land Cruiser, which, unlike its predecessor (which was built on its own special platform) now shared the \u201cTNGA-F\u201d bones with its stablemates the Tacoma, Sequoia, and Tundra. So when this new 4Runner \u2014 which was similar in size, also TNGA-F-based, and powered by the same 2.4-liter engine hooked to an eight-speed transmission \u2014 showed up, many thought it seemed too similar to the Land Cruiser. Almost redundant. Well, I just had a chance to drive the 4Runner alongside the Land Cruiser; here\u2019s what I found.\n\nRight away, the answer is yes: There\u2019s plenty of overlap between the two vehicles. Toyota, of course, wants to market the machines to different customers so as to cast as wide a net as possible in hopes of perhaps snagging a Bronco or Wrangler or even Cayenne customer. \u201c4Runner is a North America-focused product for North American taste, so the driving dynamics and styling are very different,\u201d a Toyota representative told me at the 4Runner\u2019s first-drive media event. \u201cOne of [the chief engineer\u2019s] top three goals was to make it fun to drive and sporty,\u201d he continued. \u201cLand cruiser is a global vehicle based on global heritage and tastes, from a driving dynamics standpoint.\u201d\n\nIn short, the way Toyota wants the world to see the two vehicles is: 4Runner = aggressive, Land Cruiser = premium \u2014 and that means both from a styling/fit and finish standpoint as well as from a vehicle dynamics standpoint.\n\nWhat Is It?\n\nToyota\u2019s rep told me the 4Runner is a lot of things, and looking at the trim level breakdown, that\u2019s quite true. Whereas the Land Cruiser comes in only two trims \u2014 1958 and Land Cruiser \u2014 the 4Runner is available in nine variants, starting between $42,220 and $68,350:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSR5 ($42,220 for 4\u00d72, $44,220 for 4\u00d74))\n\nTRD Sport ($48,700 for 4\u00d72, $50,700 for 4\u00d74)\n\nTRD Sport Premium ($54,060 for 4\u00d72, $56,060 for 4\u00d74)\n\nTRD Off-Road 4\u00d74 ($50,640)\n\nTRD Off-Road Premium 4\u00d74 ($56,420)\n\nLimited ($56,850 for 4\u00d72, $58,850 for 4\u00d74)\n\nPlatinum 4\u00d74 ($64,310)\n\nTRD Pro 4\u00d74 ($68,350)\n\nTrailhunter 4\u00d74 ($68,350)\n\nThe top three trims come solely with the 2.4-liter hybrid \u201ci-Force Max\u201d powertrain (shown above), which makes 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. This is a familiar powertrain to anyone familiar with the Tacoma or Land Cruiser.\n\nWhile the Limited, TRD Off-Road, and TRD Off-Road Premium all come standard with the regular 278 horsepower, 317 lb-ft 2.4-liter \u201ci-Force\u201d engine (shown below) that are the only available engines in the SR5 and TRD Sport, the three offer the hybrid for an extra $2,800.\n\nOnly the SR5 and non-hybrid Limited offer ($600) third-row seating, and that\u2019s because the hybrid battery under the rear cargo area takes up a lot of space. You can see what I mean on this Trailhunter:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHere\u2019s a three-row SR5, a trim that doesn\u2019t come with the hybrid powertrain. (Note: The TRD Sport and TRD Off-Road non-hybrids would have space for a third row, but Toyota says historically it\u2019s only offered the third row on Limited and SR5 \u2014 based on customer demand and dealer feedback. Personally, I\u2019d like a third row in the TRD Off-Road). You can see how the rear cargo floor is much lower on the non-hybrid:\n\nAs for the actual bones of the 4Runner, it\u2019s all familiar. Here\u2019s the front suspension of the Tacoma:\n\nHere\u2019s the Land Cruiser:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd here\u2019s the new 4Runner\u2019s front suspension:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou\u2019ll notice differences in control arms (some of that varies based on trim level), and there are definitely plenty of geometry differences in the actual links themselves, but the suspension mounting points to the frame (which shares the same pitch/rail width across all vehicles) are the same, and so is the basic design \u2014 double-wishbone independent front suspension with coilovers. Ditto with the coil-sprung solid rear axle.\n\nHere\u2019s the Tacoma:\n\nHere\u2019s the Land Cruiser:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd here\u2019s the 4Runner\u2019s rear suspension:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs for dimensions, they\u2019re quite similar between the 4Runner and Land Cruiser, which is 194 inches long, 84.2 inches wide, and 73.2 inches tall. The 4Runner is about an inch longer, about the same width, and the height of Limited/TRD Sport/Platinum 4Runner trims is roughly the same as the Land Cruiser. Even ground clearance is about the same between the Land Cruiser and those three 4Runner trims.\n\nTowing capacity \u2013 6,000 pounds \u2014 is shared between both vehicles, and combined fuel economy (23 MPG) is the same between hybrid 4Runners and the hybrid-only Land Cruiser. You can see that non-hybrid 4Runners give up one or two combined MPG:\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s talk about how the 4Runner drove, and then tie that into what the Land Cruiser was like.\n\nWhat\u2019s It Like To Drive?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe event started in downtown San Diego, where I hopped into a 4Runner TRD Pro and hit the highway. The interior is pretty much exactly the same as that of the Toyota Tacoma that I drove recently, with a 14-inch touchscreen slapped on the center stack and a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster. It\u2019s rather chunky, with blocky TOYOTA letters on the dash, a Tonka-Truck-like shift lever, a thick grip on the center tunnel for the passenger, and interior materials that are rather\u2026 uh, durable (i.e hard).\n\nI noticed some less-than perfect trim on the preproduction TRD Pro I was sitting in; here\u2019s some interesting interior fitment near the glovebox:\n\nThe journalist in the driver\u2019s seat was throwing the truck around a bit to test its agility and speed; neither of us were particularly blown away by that, but the ride quality was decent, and it\u2019s a big truck on 33-inch tires so less-than-tight handling is to be expected.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe big black non-functional hoodscoop shook around a bit at highway speeds just like it does on the Tacoma; I find that big chunk of plastic to be rather silly.\n\nSpeaking of the TRD Pro\u2019s plastic, upon arrival Toyota did a little presentation in front of one, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice how badly that piano black swirls. Just look at this:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the owner of a BMW i3S that\u2019s covered in Piano black, I can tell you that it\u2019s annoying seeing those swirls all over your otherwise-nice car. This is not an appropriate material for any vehicle, let alone an off-road machine. For this to be on the top-spec TRD Pro is silly.\n\nThe Cheapest 4Runner Is Good\n\nThe first vehicle I drove was the base-model, bargain-basement 4Runner SR5 in two-wheel drive \u2014 asking price: about $43,000. I immediately liked it.\n\nOn-road, it was my favorite of the 4Runners I would drive later that day, in part because \u2013 at 4,455 pounds \u2014 the rear-drive SR5 weighs 1,000 pounds less than the TRD Pro. A thousand! At that point, its 278 horsepower, 317 lb-ft 2.4-liter non-hybrid turbo engine made the vehicle feel just as quick as the 326 horsepower, 465 lb-ft TRD Pro. Honestly, maybe a bit quicker. And overall, the car felt smaller, lower, nimbler and just more pleasant to drive.\n\nThe 2.4-liter turbochared inline-four is a little buzzy, and not particularly interesting in any way, but it\u2019s powerful enough, and the eight-speed automatic snaps off shifts crisply and with no drama. It\u2019s a decent powertrain and drivetrain, but unremarkable like that of many 4Runners that came before.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe inside of the SR5 makes do with an eight-inch screen, which was big enough, and if I\u2019m honest felt a bit less \u201ctacked on\u201d than the 14-incher found in the higher trims. The light cloth seats both looked great and felt great.\n\nGetting Into The Third Row\n\nThe optional third-row was interesting. I\u2019d never experienced the \u201cjump seats\u201d of the outgoing 4Runner, but these are similar. Because the articulation of the solid rear axle requires a rather tall rear frame \u201ckick\u201d and thus rear floor, the seats stand only a few inches high, and \u201cslip\u201d down and backwards when folded.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEntry via the second row is a little challenging due to the rear wheel arch, but \u2014 with the second row folded by simply pulling a lever \u2014 it wasn\u2019t too bad.\n\nHere\u2019s the third-row folded flat:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou can use either this handle\u2026.\n\n\u2026 or this strap to release the seatback and raise it:\n\nYou\u2019ll then see the seat cushion slotted down below:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou reach through this strange rubber-ish barrier to pull the seat up:\n\nThen boom: You\u2019ve got a jumpseat:\n\nLifting the headrest and having a seat, I found that, at five-foot eight-inches, my legroom was a bit tight. Not bad for a short trip, but definitely pushing it:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe biggest issue was the headroom, which was rough for an adult; my balding noggin hit the headliner. This rear seat would be totally usable for small children, but probably not teens.\n\nThe 4Runner Trailhunter Is Legitimate\n\nFrom the base SR5 I jumped into a pair of Trailhunters. That\u2019s the \u201coverlanding\u201d version of the 4Runner (the other top-dog off-road trim, the TRD Pro, is more \u201crally\u201d oriented). At $68,350, the Trailhunter is expensive, but it is formidable off-road, offering lots of underbody protection, a sway bar disconnect for added front axle articulation, meaty 33-inch tires, a rear locker, and a snorkel. Plus, it\u2019s pretty well decked out on the inside, too:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe off-road trail was absurdly easy for the Trailhunter. The sway bar disconnect didn\u2019t yield impressive front axle articulation due to the nature of the independent front suspension, but that coil-sprung five-link rear axle flexed nicely, and crawling through uneven terrain was smooth and easy, especially thanks to that front-facing camera.\n\nThe hood, with its nice low-spot in the center, was pleasant to look over and made navigating the trail a breeze, and if I\u2019d somehow still missed my line on one of the small rock gardens, I\u2019d have been well protected by underbody skidplates on the front end, fuel tank, and transfer case:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith 10.1-inches of ground clearance, a rear locker, and a disconnecting front sway bar, the Toyota 4Runner Trailhunter may seem like a hard-core off-roader, but it\u2019s got a big belly and a large arse \u2014 the resulting 24-degree breakover and departure angle aren\u2019t amazing. They\u2019re decent, but not anywhere near on the same level as, say, a Ford Bronco or Jeep Wrangler.\n\nThe TRD Pro \u201cRally\u201d SUV Is Fun At High Speeds\n\nI had a chance to drive the TRD Pro around a high-speed dirt track.\n\nThe truck, thanks in part to \u201c3-way adjustable Fox 2.5-in internal bypass Q3S shocks with rear piggy-back remote reservoirs\u201d floated over everything nicely.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nToyota even took the 4Runner TRD Pro on a jump. I gotta hand it to Toyota; this is no joke:\n\nStill, I\u2019m not a huge fan of the TRD Pro trim; the piano-black exterior cladding bothers me, and the big fake plastic bulge that shakes around is also annoying:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPlus, the underbody protection, shown below, isn\u2019t quite as thorough as it is on the Trailhunter, a vehicle that, it\u2019s worth noting, isn\u2019t exactly terrible on higher-speed desert terrain (it has \u201cOld Man Emu\u00ae 2.5-in forged shocks with rear piggyback remote reservoirs\u201d).\n\nBut as much as I liked the Trailhunter and at least appreciated the TRD Pro, after driving most of the 4Runner variants I found myself reaching a conclusion that seemed rather familiar.\n\nThe Trailhunter is legitimately good off-road thanks to its locker, sway bar disconnect, big tires, decent geometry, and thorough skidplating. But it\u2019s pricy and maybe a little on the gaudy side with that snorkel. The TRD Pro is similarly capable off-road, but tacky, not as well protected underneath, and also rather overpriced. The TRD Off-Road seems like the Goldilocks trim.\n\nThe TRD Off-Road Is The Goldilocks Trim\n\nI reached this conclusion \u2014 the exact same one I reached after I drove all the Tacoma trims \u2014 after setting foot in a pair of TRD Off-Road models. It\u2019s this trim \u2014 my favorite one \u2014 that I will compare with the Land Cruiser in a moment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe TRD Off-Road model starts at $50,640, while the TRD Off-Road Premium costs $56,420. Compared with, say, a Ford Bronco four-door or a Jeep Wrangler four-door, that\u2019s about $10 grand more. But 4Runners have always cost more than Jeeps and Broncos, and people still buy them. A lot of this has to do with brand reputation, some has to do with refinement \u2014 we don\u2019t need to go into that now; what matters is that the TRD Off-Road seems like the best 4Runner there is per dollar.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI first hopped into the TRD Off-Road Premium hybrid you see above and below. That\u2019s an over $60,870 machine. It\u2019s got a nice faux-leather interior, the big screen, a front-facing camera, and a moonroof (in addition to the standard TRD Off-Road stuff like the 33-inch tires and rear locker).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI didn\u2019t do any crazy off-roading with the 4Runner TRD Off-Road, but it was clear to me that it offers plenty of capability for even the avid off-road enthusiast. There\u2019s great forward visibility, especially with the optional Camera (standard on the TRD Off-Road Premium); the 9.1 inches of ground clearance is plentiful; and those generic-looking matte-black fender flares? Nice and boring (i.e. functional), just how I like them:\n\nThere\u2019s no sway bar disconnect in the 4Runner TRD Off-Road, but that\u2019s fine given how little flex the front suspension has anyway, and though underbody protection leaves something to be desired (I\u2019m fairly sure the front skidplate is composite, and there\u2019s nothing protecting the transmission \u2014 the fuel tank and transfer case have a bit of sheet metal protection, though), that can be fixed in the aftermarket:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI then jumped into a completely optionless base-model, non-hybrid TRD Off-Road \u2014 the $50,640 vehicle, and immediately I knew I\u2019d found my favorite of them all:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe optionless TRD Off-Road 4Runner is nothing special inside or out, really. It\u2019s functional. It\u2019s got nice cloth seats, a rear locker, some decent 33-inch tires, a little bit of underbody protection (as shown before), a gasoline 2.4-liter turbocharged motor hooked to an eight-speed automatic, and a low-range transfer case \u2014 it\u2019s everything I need and not a bit more.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOK, I do wish it came with a front-facing camera (especially for off-roading, especially a modern car with a tall hood), and I would definitely ditch the running boards on the car I drove, but otherwise it seems like the best bang-for-your-buck 4Runner, and at 4,850 pounds it\u2019s also over 600 pounds lighter than the Trailhunter or TRD Pro.\n\nThat helps make the power deficit from not having the hybrid motor less obvious; that weight, along with the added cargo space and the fact that the delta in fuel economy would take a decade to pay back, has me thinking that skipping the hybrid is the move. Of course, I\u2019ll solidify that recommendation when I have a better idea of real-world fuel economy and reliability, but based on the info I have now, I\u2019d skip the i-Force Max.\n\nToyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road Vs Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nOK, so why would you buy a Land Cruiser?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at pricing. The 4Runner I showed just above costs $50,640, which is nearly seven grand cheaper than the base $57,400 Land Cruiser. Yes, the base Land Cruiser gets the bigger infotainment screen, a hybrid powertrain, and a full-time four-wheel drive system with locking Torsen LSD for the center differential, whereas the 4Runner makes do with a smaller screen, a part-time four-wheel drive system, and a less powerful gasoline powertrain.\n\nBut the base \u201c1958\u201d Land Cruiser\u2019s interior quality is really not much better than the 4Runner\u2019s (you have to step up a trim level in the Land Cruiser before the door and dash plastics stop becoming hard), and like I said before: I don\u2019t think the hybrid powertrain is worth the loss in interior volume or the price jump in the 4Runner.\n\nAs for interior styling, here\u2019s the base Land Cruiser:\n\nHere\u2019s the base 4Runner TRD Off-Road:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother angle of the Land Cruiser:\n\nAgain the 4Runner TRD Off-Road:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLand Cruiser 1958:\n\nBase 4Runner TRD Off-Road:\n\nI\u2019d give the edge to the Land Cruiser on interior design elegance. What about the outside?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI\u2019d probably give the edge to the Land Cruiser again. I think the roofline is more squared off and the nose looks less \u201csquished\u201d than the 4Runner.\n\nWhat about off-road capability (see my Land Cruiser off-road test here)? Well, the two SUVs are quite evenly matched. They both come standard with a rear locker (the Land Cruiser has a locking center diff, which the 4Runner doesn\u2019t need since the front and rear driveshafts are locked anytime it\u2019s in four-wheel drive), they both have some basic underbody skidplating, and both come with Toyo all-terrain tires.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the tires aren\u2019t the same size; the Land Cruiser has 245/70R18 tires while the 4Runner \u2018s 265/70R18 all-terrains are about an inch larger in diameter. This helps explain the 4Runner\u2019s 9.1-inches of ground clearance compared to the Land Cruiser\u2019s 8.7.\n\nBut off-road capability isn\u2019t just about ground clearance; yes, the most important element in a vehicle\u2019s off-road capability is geometry, but that also includes overhangs, and on that front, the Land Cruiser offers an approach angle of 30 degrees, a departure angle of 22 degrees, and a breakover angle of 25 degrees. The 4Runner TRD Off-Road\u2019s approach angle is 19 degrees, the departure angle is 24 degrees, and the breakover angle is 24 degrees.\n\nNormally, if a vehicle has an 11 degree advantage in approach angle (the most important of the three angles, since once can use momentum to overcome deficits in the other areas), it\u2019s almost always the better off-roader, but in this case, that\u2019s not necessarily true. First, the Land Cruiser\u2019s 22-degree departure angle really limits that 11-degree approach angle advantage, anyway. And second: I don\u2019t actually believe that the 4Runner TRD Off-Road vehicles that I drove had the 19-degree approach angle that Toyota claims. It just doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\n\nHave a look at this base-model SR5, which has smaller tires than the TRD Off-Road and a rather hideous chin spoiler:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe SR5\u2019s approach angle is, per Toyota, 18 degrees. If you look at the image above, you\u2019ll see that just removing that chin spoiler clearly adds more than a single degree to the approach angle. The TRD Off-Roads at the press event did not have that spoiler and they had larger tires, so how could they have 19-degree approach angles?\n\nThis is a bit strange, since Toyota\u2019s TRD Off-Roads do have this spoiler on the online configurator:\n\nIt\u2019s possible Toyota took the spoilers off the TRD Off-Road models; if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d probably do the same, because that would probably jack the 4Runner TRD Off-Road\u2019s approach angle up to around 30 degrees given that the Trailhunter/TRD Pro have 33-degree faces.\n\nIn any case, based on my experience driving the Land Cruiser 1958 and 4Runner TRD Off-Road, they really do feel similarly capable off-road. So that\u2019s a bit of a wash, the styling goes in favor of the Land Cruiser (in my eyes), and pricing is clearly in favor of the 4Runner. But what about interior volume and driving dynamics?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCargo-volume wise, the two hybrids are basically a match, with the 4Runner TRD Off-Road offering 82.6 cubic feet behind the front row and 42.6 cubic feet behind the second row. The Land Cruiser offers just 0.5 cubic feet less behind the front row at 82.1 and actually more space behind the second row at 46.2 cubic feet. The non-hybrid 4Runner blows them both out of the water with 90.2 cubic feet with the second row folded flat and 48.4 behind the second row.\n\nAs for on-road driving dynamics, I did get the impression that maybe the Land Cruiser rides a little softer/cushier, and the 4Runner was a bit firmer, but neither was a sports car in the curves, both had plenty of body roll and brake dive, and neither was quick. They were adequate on-road, decent off-road, and hopefully even better in the dealership service center because that\u2019s a key reason why people pay the Toyota Tax. We\u2019ll find that out in due time.\n\nMy Verdict\n\nI think there\u2019s a temptation to criticize Toyota for offering two models that are so similar architecturally and so alike in terms of capability. I get it \u2014 the old Land Cruiser was something truly special, and this Land Cruiser feels unremarkable \u2014 but if we\u2019re being honest, that old Land Cruiser had become an overpriced luxo-yacht, and choice is a beautiful thing. We\u2019ve now got a choice between two body-on-frame off-road Toyota mid-size SUVs \u2014 that\u2019s awesome.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo, the 2.4-liter turbocharged inline-four isn\u2019t going to blow you away; it\u2019s OK just as it is in the Tacoma and just as many 4Runner/Tacoma engines were in the past \u2014 rather forgettable. The eight-speed automatic does a good job getting the most out of that mill, and hopefully real-world fuel economy and reliability will significantly exceed that of the outgoing models. The independent front suspension and solid axle are fairly typical and work well off-road and on, and the interiors are modernized but modest. This is all to say: The new Tacoma and 4Runner are worthy successors, and you can think of the Land Cruiser as a sort of 4Runner-alternative that fits right in the middle of the trim-lineup.\n\nIt\u2019s not as hard-core off-road as the 4Runner TRD Pro or Trailhunter, and it\u2019s significantly better off-road than the SR5 or the Limited/TRD Sport. It\u2019s roughly as capable as the 4Runner TRD Off-Road, but it comes standard with the hybrid powertrain (which means it has significantly less cargo volume than the non-hybrid TRD Off-Road), it looks handsomer (in my opinion) both inside and out, and maybe it rides a tiny bit softer.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t care about off-roading and you want something cheap and/with three rows, maybe a base 4Runner SR5 is the move. If you want something that can off-road reasonably well but doesn\u2019t cost over about $51,000, buy the 4Runner TRD Off-Road. If you want a harder-core off-roader and money is no object, buy a 4Runner Trailhunter or TRD Pro. If you want the most luxurious reasonably capable off-roader from Toyota, buy the Land Cruiser. (If you need more luxury, get the Lexus GX). And if you just want something that\u2019s decent off-road but you really care more about looks extremely cool, then in my opinion the answer is the base Land Cruiser.\n\nIf it were up to me between the two vehicles, my brain would choose the non-hybrid 4Runner TRD Off-Road over the Land Cruiser because I want the interior volume, I don\u2019t care about the hybrid powertrain, I\u2019m cool with the smaller screen, and I really want to save $7000. My heart, though? It might just take the non-base-model Land Cruiser to get a vehicle with decent off-road capability and a nicer-quality interior than any 4Runner. Because if you\u2019re already dropping $50 big ones on an SUV, you want to sit somewhere nice, don\u2019t you? Or maybe I\u2019ve gone soft.",

            "content": "You might have heard that the Toyota 4Runner is finally new for the first time in 15 years. It\u2019s a huge deal especially since the outgoing model was the last old-school rig left in the lineup. It was the only vehicle in America still rocking a five-speed automatic before it was phased out, and now, the 2025 Toyota 4Runner comes exclusively with a turbocharged engine and the option of a newfangled hybrid system. The question is: Do people want that?\n\nAt this point, the jury is still out. People are buying the new Tacoma, which has a lot in common with this 4Runner including the same platform and engines. Yet we as a country bought more than 90,000 of the previous-gen V6 4Runners last year\u2014far from record sales, but far from struggling, too. Part of me can\u2019t help but think that folks will want that simplicity back, especially as they hear whispers and shouts of Toyota\u2019s recent reliability problems.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nBut there\u2019s no going back. There\u2019s simply no time for Toyota to try something different with the new 4Runner if this doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s already committed to building the thing on the same platform as all of its other body-on-frame trucks and SUVs with the tech, the gear, the lux\u2014all of it. So I set out to see if that makes a better 4Runner during a day\u2019s worth of driving every version of the car I could get my hands on.\n\nThe Basics\n\nBelieve it or not, the Toyota 4Runner has been around for 40 years now. And while the previous generation was introduced in 2009, making it nearly old enough to get a driver\u2019s license in the U.S., the one you\u2019re lookin\u2019 at here is new altogether. The styling is fresh, the powertrains are new to 4Runner, and it rides on the automaker\u2019s TNGA-F platform\u2014just like the Land Cruiser. And the Tacoma. And the Tundra. And the Sequoia. Man.\n\nThere\u2019s no confusing a 2025 4Runner with its predecessor, but you might mistake it for a Tacoma if you\u2019re looking at it straight-on. The narrow, single-piece headlights are mighty similar to the pickup\u2019s, as are the front bumper and grille. But there are obvious differences out back since, y\u2019know, the 4Runner doesn\u2019t have a bed. It does have a rear-side glass panel that wraps around the roof ever so slightly, just like on the original, and its taillights are an interesting shape. For what it\u2019s worth, I think the 4Runner looks best from the rear-three-quarter view.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nThe SUV takes a big technological leap inside, especially on the top trims which get a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.0-inch infotainment display. You can\u2019t really paint with broad strokes when describing the 4Runner\u2019s interior because there are so many different versions\u2014seven in total if you can believe that\u2014but the SR5 is still pretty basic with a smaller 8.0-inch center display, cloth seats, and plenty of blank buttons. Third-row seating is available on some SR5 and non-hybrid Limited models as the battery pack takes up trunk space in electrified 4Runners. Even then, full-grown humans will struggle to fit back there, but more on that in a bit.\n\nToyota\u2019s new infotainment system has been around for a few years now and it\u2019s just as good in the 4Runner as it is in everything else. The 14-inch display is plenty big so you can read whatever info it\u2019s showing you without a problem, and the touch response is pretty quick. I wasn\u2019t crazy about the 14-speaker JBL audio setup, but calling it \u201cbad\u201d would be a step too far and it does have the handy pop-out dash speaker behind the center screen. That\u2019s one of my favorite ideas a car company has had in a while\u2014just don\u2019t lose it.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nEvery new 4Runner has a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Those without hybrid assist make 278 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque while those with it get 326 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque, which is a pretty healthy jump. In terms of 4\u00d72 or 4\u00d74, you can have it in pretty much any flavor you want as some are strictly two-wheel-drive, others are part-time four-wheel-drive with a two-speed transfer case, and others are full-time four-wheel-drive.\n\nDriving the Toyota 4Runner\n\nAnyone coming from a last-gen 4Runner will notice just how major the changes are on this new truck, whether we\u2019re talking about the interior or the way it drives. It feels like a new machine when you sit inside it, something you couldn\u2019t say about the outgoing one. I spent the first chunk of my day in a Limited hybrid, one that greeted me with power running boards as I opened the door. Fancy.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Toyota is taking the 4Runner upmarket to compete with essentially every other SUV out there that\u2019s doing the same. The car I drove from our hotel in San Diego to Vogt Ranch about an hour away had an earthy brown theme listed on the window sticker as Portobello. It didn\u2019t make me think of a mushroom initially but after reading that, I said, \u201cYeah, that tracks.\u201d The seats were heated and cooled, wireless Apple CarPlay meant I could crank whatever jams I wanted through the just-OK JBL sound system, and radar cruise was ready to help me through traffic. It was as well-equipped as any new model in that price range.\n\n\u201cWhat was the price?\u201d you might ask. It was $63,730. And it wasn\u2019t even the most expensive one there!\n\nThat\u2019s so much money, particularly for a 4Runner that\u2019s more focused on being snazzy than getting dirty. I know people buy the Limited trims\u2014I see them all the time\u2014but it doesn\u2019t quite line up with what the model is in my head. I guess Toyota can make it everything to everyone when there are so many different variants, but still.\n\nThe temperature was in the 40s at the start of the day and as we set off on the paved side streets, that 2.4-liter sounded cold. It was click-clacky pulling away from each traffic light and the insulation on the firewall couldn\u2019t keep the noise from coming inside. I wouldn\u2019t call it atrocious, but the sequence of climbing in, checking the specs and price, and hearing that noise wasn\u2019t super encouraging.\n\nIt smoothed out once we hit California State Route 94 and I was keeping pace with morning traffic. That would have been no easy feat in the old V6 4Runner, and if you think I\u2019m exaggerating, I\u2019ll assume you haven\u2019t driven one. The new turbo four is peppy enough on its own, and the hybrid makes the 4Runner a better highway cruiser than it\u2019s ever been before.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nI got more excited once we rolled into Vogt Ranch where Toyota had a whole host of four-wheelin\u2019 4Runners lined up for different off-road courses. I hopped in a Trailhunter trim first and was quickly met by a 20- or 30-foot stretch of fist-sized rocks packed together. This made for a good test of the 4Runner\u2019s 4LO and throttle modulation as slow and steady wins the race through a patch like that. You don\u2019t need a $68,350 vehicle to navigate your way across some rocks like that, but the tougher suspension test was just ahead.\n\nOn media drives like this, automakers love to show off how well their 4x4s can flex. You won\u2019t find a purposely made test trail without these big articulation dips dug into the dirt. The Trailhunter stuffed those 33-inch Toyos way up into the fender wells and I never lost traction driving through them. I did stop so I could snag a few shots, however, and I saw it was three-wheeling a little with the driver-front tire off the ground. Not a big deal, though I thought it would make contact with the ground once I disconnected the stabilizer bar the next pass through. Still no luck. Again, not a huge problem by any means, and I\u2019m not convinced a stock Land Cruiser could come anywhere close to navigating these divots. I\u2019m calling it a win for the 4Runner there.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nMaybe the more relevant test was a short jaunt away where Toyota had some 4Runner TRD Off-Road models to hop in. I drove this relatively technical course in a hybrid TRD Off-Road Premium and a gas-only non-Premium for comparison\u2019s sake.\n\nAll the fundamentals are the same, as you\u2019d imagine, and this test showed that the 4Runner is still the right-sized SUV in Toyota\u2019s lineup. It sits up high so ground clearance isn\u2019t a problem, and these mid-grade off-road trims aren\u2019t ridiculously wide either\u2014they\u2019re a full two inches narrower than the Trailhunter and TRD Pro. Sharp switchbacks weren\u2019t a problem as the truck turns fairly tight.\n\nThis interior belongs to the silver 4Runner TRD Off-Road with the gas-only powertrain. It\u2019s the one I\u2019d buy, except it needs the Multi-Terrain Monitor! Caleb Jacobs\n\nOne flaw that I consider fundamental is the length of that dang hood. You don\u2019t think much of it when you\u2019re in a fancy Premium model with the surround-view cameras that pop up on the infotainment screen, but when you\u2019re in a basic TRD Off-Road without those? Good luck seeing what\u2019s on the other side of that steep climb. I don\u2019t have any intel on whether Toyota had to stretch the 4Runner\u2019s nose to fit the inline-four versus the old V6, and I\u2019m not sure you could find out without measuring them side-by-side, but it was a legitimate problem for me on that trail. If you plan on wheeling one like I did, make sure it has the Multi-Terrain Monitor which sends camera feeds from around the truck to the infotainment and really ought to be standard on all TRD Off-Road models.\n\nFinally, I took a 4Runner TRD Pro on the more fast-paced playground course. If there\u2019s one trim that\u2019s lightyears ahead of the old one, it\u2019s this. Toyota applied the same Baja treatment to the 4Runner as it did to the Tacoma TRD Pro last year, making it so much more agile than the last-gen with adjustable 2.5-inch Fox QS3 shocks that make use of remote reservoirs. The TNGA-F platform is just better suited for action like this.\n\nAnd because the TRD Pro comes standard with the hybrid, you\u2019re never waiting for the engine to wind up like you were with the old V6. It has power whenever you want it, which is still so surprising in a Toyota off-roader. It goes to show how far Toyota has taken the TRD Pro lineup in terms of outright capability in high-speed situations.\n\nToyota 4Runner Features, Options, and Competition\n\nYou can have a new 4Runner pretty much any way you want it. That\u2019s something that sets it apart from the similarly sized, similarly priced Land Cruiser, which only comes in two trims compared to the 4Runner\u2019s seven: SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, Limited, Platinum, TRD Pro, and Trailhunter.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nIf you just want the basics, then the SR5 is the one for ya at $42,220 starting off. Just don\u2019t expect much beyond heated cloth seats because it doesn\u2019t even get dual-zone climate control. Or, you could go all the way up to Trailhunter or TRD Pro, which get you off-road suspension focused on trail driving or desert running depending on which you pick, a standard hybrid powertrain, SofTex leather interior, the 14.0-inch infotainment screen, all the speakers, all the cameras, and more for an extra $26,000.\n\nBecause the 4Runner has so many different forms, it competes with lots of different models. Someone might cross-shop a Limited trim with a Kia Telluride, for example, or even Toyota\u2019s own Grand Highlander. Meanwhile, anyone in the market for an off-road SUV might be looking at a Ford Bronco or Jeep Wrangler\u2026 or a Toyota Land Cruiser. The takeaway is that the 4Runner has so many direct rivals\u2014including several with the same badge on the grille\u2014that it\u2019s impossible to peg it to just one segment of SUV.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nThe Early Verdict\n\nI think I\u2019d be head over heels for the 2025 Toyota 4Runner if it were three years ago. Had it dropped in 2022 or whereabouts, then it would feel totally fresh and not almost exactly like every other new Toyota 4\u00d74 on the same platform. If this were three years ago, I also would be more optimistic about the vehicle\u2019s longevity because I would have never heard from Land Cruiser owners griping about potential piston slap issues on the 2.4, or Tacoma owners complaining that their eight-speed automatic transmissions are acting up.\n\nIt\u2019s probably a good thing we got to see that play out before the new 4Runner launched. Even if it came out a few years back, you could make the logical argument that it would have suffered the same problems as its platform mates. So maybe the best thing would have been for a slightly simplified model to have hit the market before the last 4Runner got to be as old as a high-school sophomore.\n\nCaleb Jacobs\n\nInstead of that being the reality, I\u2019m left feeling slightly unenthused about what should be an exciting moment. You don\u2019t get a new 4Runner every decade, you know? It\u2019s good on its own, but tragically, it doesn\u2019t exist on its own and I\u2019m not sure how to feel about it going forward. Here\u2019s hoping they hold up because if they do, I think the 4Runner is a solid machine. One of these listed for about 30% off in five years would hate to see me coming if it\u2019s still in good working shape.\n\n2025 Toyota 4Runner Specs Gas Hybrid Base Price (Trailhunter as tested) $42,220 $53,440 ($68,350) Powertrain 2.4-liter turbo-four | 8-speed automatic | 4\u00d72, part-time 4\u00d74, or full-time 4\u00d74 2.4-liter turbo-four hybrid | 8-speed automatic | part-time 4\u00d74 Horsepower 278 @ 6,000 rpm 326 @ 6,000 rpm Torque 317 lb-ft @ 1,700 rpm 465 lb-ft @ 1,700 rpm Seating Capacity 5\n\n7 (SR5 and Limited only) 5 Curb Weight 4,455-4,970 pounds 5,225-5,500 pounds Towing Capacity 6,000 pounds << Cargo Volume 48.4 cubic feet behind second row | 90.2 cubic feet behind first row 42.6 cubic feet behind second row | 82.6 cubic feet behind first row Ground Clearance SR5: 8.1 inches\n\nTRD Sport, Limited: 8.8 inches\n\nTRD Off-Road: 9.1 inches Limited, Platinum: 8.8 inches\n\nTRD Off-Road: 9.1 inches\n\nTRD Pro, Trailhunter: 10.1 inches Off-Road Angles SR5: 18\u00b0 approach | 23\u00b0 breakover | 22\u00b0 departure\n\nTRD Sport, Limited: 18\u00b0 approach | 24\u00b0 breakover | 22\u00b0 departure\n\nTRD Off-Road: 19\u00b0 approach | 24\u00b0 breakover | 24\u00b0 departure Limited, Platinum: 18\u00b0 approach | 24\u00b0 breakover | 22\u00b0 departure\n\nTRD Off-Road: 19\u00b0 approach | 24\u00b0 breakover | 24\u00b0 departure\n\nTRD Pro, Trailhunter: 33\u00b0 approach | 24\u00b0 breakover | 24\u00b0 departure EPA Fuel Economy 4\u00d72: 20 mpg city | 26 highway | 22 combined\n\n4\u00d74: 19 mpg city | 25 highway | 21 combined 23 mpg city | 24 highway | 23 combined Quick Take It\u2019s a much more capable 4Runner that feels just like every other off-roader Toyota makes.

But instead of a faffy, narrative-driven piece, let\u2019s dive straight into it.\n\nBy the end of this piece, I\u2019ll have covered the two biggest questions you probably have: \"Is this new truck better than the old one?\" and, \"Should I buy a 4Runner or a Land Cruiser?\"\n\nLet\u2019s get into it.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota 2025 Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road\n\nQuick Specs 2025 Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium I-Force Max Engine Turbocharged 2.4-Liter Inline-Four Hybrid Output 326 Horsepower / 465 Pound-Feet Efficiency 23 Combined Base Price $42,220 Trim Base / As Tested $56,420 / $59,420\n\nSo what exactly is new with this 4Runner? In short, everything. This is an entirely new generation and the first wholesale overhaul of the truck since 2009, when the fifth-generation 4Runner first debuted. That truck survived 15 model years, a staggering feat of endurance.\n\nThe end result of those fifteen years of development: Toyota built one of the most reliable and beloved body-on-frame SUVs ever. In a list of vehicles most likely to last 250,000 miles, Toyota trucks take nearly all top-ten slots with the 4Runner third on that list. Considering Toyota has built more than 3 million 4Runners since 1984, that\u2019s a terribly impressive capstone. And a tough act to follow.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Photo by: Toyota Photo by: Toyota\n\nThis sixth-generation 4Runner aims to match your expectations of ultimate reliability while addressing major complaints about the outgoing fifth-gen 4Runner. Namely, that the old 4Runner was slow, inefficient, and woefully out of date\u2014especially as its MSRP across all trims ballooned.\n\nRather than start from scratch, the 2025 4Runner is built atop the Toyota TNGA-F platform which underpins the rest of its trucks\u2014the Tundra, Tacoma, Sequoia, and Land Cruiser. That means a boxed ladder frame paired with a more rigid body structure, as well as shared engines, drivetrain, mechanicals, infotainment appointments, and yes, even design ideologies.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nPros: Seamless Transmission, Updated Tech, Low Road Noise\n\nIt\u2019ll be an issue of personal taste, but the 4Runner\u2019s looks are growing on me. Slowly. At first glance, the new body style feels like a step back from the fifth-gen\u2019s conservative body lines. Calty Design (America\u2019s in-house Toyota design studio) penned both the new 4Runner and Tacoma, which is why the 4Runner echoes the Tacoma\u2019s sharper and more overtly stylized design.\n\nThat said, the new 4Runner won\u2019t be mistaken for any other SUV. Calty Design preserved enough of the visual touchpoints of the outgoing fourth- and fifth-generation trucks, with a few throwback nods to even-earlier 4Runners, that you couldn\u2019t mistake anything else.\n\nThat\u2019s a job well done.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nUnlike its Korean counterparts in the mid-size segment, Toyota hasn\u2019t shifted toward luxury pretension. Hard-wearing materials clothe the sections of the cabin that demand them (the dash, the door panels near the floor, and the areas around the cupholders), and the rest of the interior looks clean, purposeful, and organized.\n\nTwo knobs for the dual-zone climate controls dominate the center stack, with a row of toggle switches between them to actuate your windshield blower, heated mirrors, climate mode, air recirculation, and A/C. There\u2019s even a pair of physical buttons for the heated seats. It all represents an improvement over the fifth-gen model, with better packaging for climate settings in an intelligible, condensed, compact array.\n\nThere is also a physical volume knob. Praise God.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nCons: Price, Complexity, Overdone Styling\n\nAnd you\u2019re probably wondering: Will that silly little cupholder spacer ring get stuck on my water bottle anymore? No! The cupholders actually work this time around. No rings here. I tested out a big stupid water bottle just like your Stanley. It worked fine.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, even the roll-down rear window still lives. You can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThere are two touchscreen options in the cabin: A base 8.0-inch central screen with a 7.0-inch digital cluster, or a 14.0-inch horizontal iPad with a 12.3-inch digital display for the cluster. Unless you\u2019re short on budget, I recommend you spring for the larger, fancier setup. It works quite well.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Photo by: Toyota\n\nToyota\u2019s system isn\u2019t flashy or gorgeous, and the screens themselves aren\u2019t particularly sharp-looking. But the whole multimedia system feels intuitive to use and easy to manage, bereft of dozens of submenus. Plus you get wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on either setup.\n\nThis is a huge improvement over the outgoing 4Runner.\n\nThe TRD Pro has some exceptionally comfy thrones for the driver and passenger, and the Trailhunter wraps its seats in a patterned faux leather that feels like it\u2019ll go the distance for the Overlanding set. But I\u2019ll get more into that in my TRD Pro review later this week.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nThe TRD Off-Road premium\u2019s seats, meanwhile, are far more basic. But they still offer decent support for off-roading. Even the SR5\u2019s cloth seats feel comfortable, though they are noticeably less supportive than the top-tier thrones, particularly if you like seats that keep you in place laterally.\n\nGo figure.\n\nWhatever you choose, the 4Runner has a track record for long-lasting chairs. My 236,000-mile facelifted second-gen had immaculate seats until the day it was totaled by an inattentive driver while I sat parked at a stoplight. But I digress.\n\nOn to the important stuff: The powertrains.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Photo by: Toyota\n\nThe long-serving naturally aspirated 4.0-liter V-6 is dead. Long live the turbocharged inline-four. It comes in two flavors. The first is the so-called \u201cI-Force\u201d turbocharged inline-four, which makes 278 horsepower and 317 pound-feet of torque. The second, called \u201cI-Force Max,\u201d is a hybridized version of the same engine packing 326 horses and 465-pound feet, courtesy of a 1.87-kilowatt-hour battery pack.\n\nThose are your two choices.\n\nThe base engine feels plenty zippy here, with the full punch of torque available from 1,800 rpm and an eight-speed automatic that shifts quickly and imperceptibly. Most of the time you\u2019d think it\u2019s the best CVT you\u2019ve ever driven.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nIt\u2019s a genuinely great gearbox, perhaps the smoothest and most unobtrusive transmission I\u2019ve ever experienced in a mid-size, body-on-frame SUV. Whoever worked on the calibration of this transmission for the 4Runner, take a bow.\n\nThe optional I-Force Max hybrid ups the power but suffers a weight penalty, while marginally increasing the EPA\u2019s fuel rating. Sure, there\u2019s vastly more power and torque on paper, but in the real world, the I-Force engine felt robust enough for me.\n\nFrom a slow roll, the hybrid system can work in power awkwardly during shifts, which is the only time the drivetrain makes its presence known. At anything beyond city speeds, however, both powertrains feel seamless.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nAn electric power-assist steering system (EPAS) replaces the old-school hydraulic setup across all trims. It\u2019s nice, offering less steering feedback, as you\u2019d expect, but making for a truck that\u2019s easier to maneuver on trails and during tight turns on the road. That\u2019s a huge improvement overall, especially as you throw larger, chunkier tires on this truck, which tend to increase steering effort.\n\nAs far as a transfer case goes, again, you have options. More-basic trims can be had in two-wheel drive (at the rear, obviously), and without a transfer case (obviously), while the Limited and Platinum spec a four-wheel-drive system in line with what\u2019s on the Land Cruiser. Part-time 4WD is spec\u2019d on most of the other trims. On the TRD Pro and Trailhunter models, it\u2019s the only option.\n\nThe part-time system comes with an electronically engaged two-speed HI-LO transfer case, plus a locking electronic diff at the rear.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nI\u2019ve been on quite a few product launches for off-road-centric trucks. Many of them had harder obstacles to tackle than the ones Toyota set up for us here, but none had less oversight; Toyota threw us the metaphorical keys and sent us out alone with a friendly wave.\n\nIt was a free-for-all, with plenty of room for folly, from some truly slippery uphill sections in excess of 20 degrees incline to a rally-style course where we were encouraged to whip the TRD Pro along a banked corner\u2014Indy 500 style\u2014in two-wheel drive.\n\nToyota\u2019s Multi-Terrain Monitor (MTM) worked well here, showing a top-down view of the truck on the central 14.0-inch screen, as needed, or peering over each flank of the truck and the nose simultaneously. There are even readouts showing pitch and roll, plus a silly little on-screen button that\u2019ll spray and wipe dirt away from your rear window.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Photo by: Toyota Photo by: Toyota 2025 Toyota 4Runner SR5\n\nHonestly, it was super handy to have.\n\nWe handled the rock-crawling and hill-climb portion of the course behind the wheel of a TRD Off-Road Premium set in 4 LO. I tried a lap of the course with the diff locked then unlocked it for the second lap. The TRD Off-Road handled it all, with ease.\n\nOur test truck for this portion of the drive had the optional 33-inch tires, but I was most impressed by how smoothly and progressively the hybrid powertrain delivered torque. There is a little judder when pulling away from a stop, but once you\u2019re moving, any obstacle is dispatched with a little wiggle from your big toe on the throttle or brake pedal.\n\nAlongside a well-equipped SR5, the TRD Off-Road Premium strikes probably the best balance between features and capability while keeping the price as reasonable as possible.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nOverall, Toyota improved the 4Runner in many ways. Of special note, the new eight-speed transmission shines. It\u2019s the feature I most desperately want on my fifth-gen TRD Pro. Beyond that, I pine for the upgraded screens, and the upgraded MTM, which is so insanely useful maneuvering a busy Costco parking lot\u2014as the memes go\u2014but also as a safety feature.\n\nThe new 4Runner is also much quieter than the already civilized fifth-gen truck, amplifying a feeling of comfort and solidity. And while it\u2019s more efficient on paper, our SR5 test truck showed us 17 miles per gallon and the TRD Pro I drove on the highway did better, but not by much.\n\nWith nine separate trims, Toyota aims to provide a Goldilocks solution for every type of buyer, so long as they\u2019ve got deep pockets. To that point, I think pricing has gone haywire, but Toyota must have good evidence people will pony up.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Photo by: Toyota\n\nThe SR5 trim\u2014with 2WD, cloth seats, and the lesser screens\u2014starts at $42,220 with delivery fees included. You\u2019ll very likely want part-time four-wheel drive ($2,000) and maybe running boards ($345) if your partner is short. The third-row seating adds $770.\n\nThat\u2019s $45,335 for a pretty bare-bones truck, but one that feels well-built, drives smoothly, and offers a quiet cabin. I guess that\u2019s the 4Runner for you.\n\nOur TRD Off-Road Premium cost $59,420 with the hybrid engine, the good screens included, improved seats and off-road features, plus optional pre-wired auxiliary switches, a moonroof, and the tow tech package.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nSixty grand for a mid-range 4Runner.\n\nThe TRD Pro we drove was $68,350 with destination and no options. Add in some paint protection, mud flaps, and some sliders from the factory. You\u2019ve hit a $70,000 4Runner. It\u2019s capable, sure, but that\u2019s a price to compete with luxury off-roaders.\n\nYes, the sixth-gen 4Runner is largely improved. Smoother, quieter, more efficient, more capable, and more powerful.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota\n\nBut given the pricing, I couldn\u2019t recommend you upgrade to a new truck if your fifth-gen 4Runner is still ticking. If you\u2019re otherwise in the market for an SUV, you\u2019d have to shop the similarly priced Land Cruiser, which wins out on looks and the prestige of its nameplate, while matching most 4Runner trims for outright capability. I\u2019d rather have an LC myself.\n\nUltimately, the 4Runner means nothing without ultimate reliability. It\u2019s too early to say whether the sixth-gen and its turbo hybrid powertrain will appear on the list of vehicles most likely to last 250,000 miles, but if you had to bet on one company on earth to meet those lofty expectations, it\u2019d be Toyota.\n\nCompetitors\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\n2025 Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium Engine Turbocharged 2.4-Liter Four-Cylinder Hybrid Battery 1.87 Kilowatt-Hour Nickel-Metal Hydride Output 326 Horsepower / 465 Pound-Feet Transmission Eight-Speed Automatic Drive Type Four-Wheel Drive Weight 5,225 Pounds Efficiency 23 City / 24 Highway / 23 Combined Seating Capacity 5 / 7 Towing 6,000 Pounds Cargo Volume 84.1 / 44.8 / 12.1 Cubic Feet Base Price $42,220 Trim Base Price $56,420 As-Tested Price $59,420\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

We\u2019ll go ahead and make the case that in the land of ski hills, mountains, beaches, and deserts, the actual official car is the Toyota 4Runner. Especially the go-anywhere-and-look-tough-while-doing-it TRD Pro.\n\nWhat\u2019s New?\n\nSo much. After the longest run in the model line\u2019s history (the fifth-generation N280 4Runner was around for 16 years) the sixth-generation SUV is quite literally all new. It\u2019s another vehicle spun off the brand\u2019s TNGA-F platform, the eighth such example if you count the Land Cruiser and Lexus GX as separate vehicles, which we do. The biggest news is the elimination of six-cylinder power in favor of either a turbocharged I-4 or a hybridized version of the same turbo I-4. With the TRD Pro being the top trim\u2014or at least tied for it with the new 4Runner Trailhunter, which carries the same high starting price of $68,350\u2014it is available only with the hybrid powertrain option. Forget your feelings about the electrification of the automobile for a moment\u2014the i-Force Max Turbo Hybrid powertrain here is good for 326 hp and an impressive 465 lb-ft of torque.\n\nToyota also dropped the old five-speed slushbox in favor of a much better-shifting eight-speed automatic. As a result, fuel economy is way up, from 16/19 mpg city/highway to 23/24 mpg, which is laudable. Always remember, four-banger or not, the hybrid version at least is going to be heavier than the TRD Pro it replaces. So a substantial bump in gumption\u2014horsepower rises by 53, and the torque is through the roof, increasing by nearly 40 percent\u2014is truly impressive.\n\nPerhaps most important to TRD Pro customers, however, are the Fox Racing QS3 internal-bypass shocks found both front and rear. These transform the Pro, generation to generation. Up front sit 2.5-inch dampers with three-way adjustable compression. That\u2019s what QS3 stands for, \u201cQuick Switch 3,\u201d and all you need to do is drop to one knee, reach under the 4Runner, and click through the three settings. The rear dampers are also QS3s but feature remote reservoirs. If the new but maturing sport truck segment isn\u2019t your thing, don\u2019t worry about what you just read. If it is, then you\u2019re well aware that Fox supplies similar shocks on all the Ford Raptor products, including the Ranger Raptor, which uses same-diameter dampers. Both the TRD Pro and the Trailhunter feature an increased lift and a widened track, as well as 33-inch Toyo Open Country III tires.\n\nOn the outside, the best ways to figure out you\u2019re looking at a TRD Pro are the \u201cfunctional\u201d hood scoop and the big \u201cTRD Pro\u201d stamped into the rear tailgate. Of note: The glass in said tailgate still drops down, as Toyota said abandoning it would upset 4Runner loyalists. Both the Trailhunter and the TRD Pro have larger black fender flares to cover the wider tracks.\n\nThe interior is a big improvement on the previous generation, though it's virtually identical to the Tacoma midsize pickup truck. Were you to go back and forth between the two, you\u2019d come away thinking the 4Runner had a little bit of Lexus sprayed into it. The various grades of plastic just feel 5 percent more upscale. One odd trait about the old 4Runner was that you essentially sat on the floor. In the new one, Toyota has raised the seat up higher than the previous-gen's butt-on-the-floor position, but taller drivers will wish it could go an inch or two lower.\n\nThe Results?\n\nThis ain\u2019t your father\u2019s TRD Pro. It\u2019s not even close. When we last drove a fifth-generation version, we liked it, but we hit the thing with enough backhanded compliments to set off the air bags\u2014choice pepperings such as, \u201cRide motions are nautical,\u201d \u201cThe body sashays this way and that,\u201d and, \u201cThe way it gently bobs down the road is nicely old-school and trucky, encouraging you to slow down and just roll.\u201d We even had a section titled \u201cDrunken Dynamics to Lower Your Blood Pressure.\u201d None of that applies in 2025. The new TRD Pro is basically a 4Runner-shaped Raptor. We knew a new TRD Pro would be a better-driving 4Runner, but we really were not prepared for the amount of fun we\u2019d have driving the big, fat tires off it.\n\nToyota stuck us on a dirt motorcycle track loaded with Baja-style berms, yumps, jumps, and tabletops. The TRD Pro ate it all up. The thing was in its natural environment, the happiest puppy at the park. The increased electrified torque is just what the doctor ordered, as the 4Runner easily blasts its way up everything and out of tight off-road corners. By jumps we mean jumps, and just like a Ford Raptor, the 2025 4Runner TRD Pro loves getting airborne and might like landing even more. Cards on table, we (totally accidentally) exceeded the takeoff velocity Toyota recommended and landed much harder than they had planned for us. Result? No problem. The new Fox dampers, along with the rest of the improved suspension and much stiffer frame and body, just loved it.\n\nSurely there\u2019s some bad stuff?\n\nYes, and aside from price, the big one has to be the fact that the hybrid\u2019s battery eats into the rear luggage space, raising the load floor by a good 4 inches. This not only cuts down on space but also makes life harder for shorter, weaker people. We feel this is a mistake, just like on the Sequoia, and shows a surprising lack of engineering excellence. It\u2019s not like anyone at Toyota was surprised that the 4Runner would be offered as a hybrid. Adding salt to that wound, the rear seats do not fold completely flat. Back to the official vehicle of the Southland nomination, skiing and snowboarding, surfing, camping, exploring, antiquing, road tripping to Santa Barbara wine country are all routine SoCal activities that will be compromised by the battery.\n\nThen there\u2019s the price. Even in an age of inflation, nearly $70,000 for a 4Runner strikes us as too expensive. True, the entry-level, rear-drive 4Runner SR5 starts at $42,220, and the other eight trim levels go up in chunks from there until you get to the high-falutin' Trailhunter/TRD Pro strata. Also true, starting at $68,350, the TRD Pro offers essentially no options. It's just loaded. Still, natural off-road competition like the $49,090 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 and $57,315 Ford Ranger Raptor offer similar go-anywhere ability and utility, and even the platform-mate Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro is cheaper at $65,230. (Side note: We drove the Tacoma TRD Pro on the same course and prefer the 4Runner greatly. The 4Runner\u2019s shortened wheelbase makes everything feel better.) Yes, those are all sport pickups, but there does seem to be a dearth of sporty off-road SUV competition aside from the Ranger's sibling, the Bronco Raptor.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the thing. As far as great-jumping, Baja-ready SUVs go, the 4Runner TRD Pro morphs into a relative value against the ridiculous $92,920 Bronco Raptor, which is both more hardcore and more powerful than the 4Runner. Within Toyota showrooms, there is the Land Cruiser available for as low as $58,150, but it\u2019s just a different animal, one meant for lower-speed, non-aviation-style trail cruising, essentially what the previous TRD Pro was good at. This new one, despite its two notable shortcomings, is the first 4Runner we\u2019ve ever lusted after. High price and compromised gear utility aside, Toyota has built a fantastic SUV. It's one we think even people outside of Southern California will be buying.",

But to give these four-cylinder engines some kudos, a last-generation 4Runner was estimated to return 17 mpg combined, while all versions of the new model can do at least 21 mpg combined. Not everyone loves a smaller engine, but at least they\u2019re good for efficiency.\n\nThere are nine different trim levels of the new 4Runner, so the driving experience depends not just on what\u2019s under the hood but also on how aggressive the tires are, how beefed-up the suspension is, etc. An entry-level gas-only SR5 model with street tires drives drastically different than the ultra-rugged Trailhunter, which has the hybrid powertrain and fat 33-inch tires.\n\nCustomers should know what they\u2019re getting into before they go to buy. If you plan on doing some heavy-duty off-roading, the TRD Pro or Trailhunter could be right for you. Expect them to drive like trucks, with lots of lean during cornering and some pretty over-the-top artificial engine noises that Toyota pipes into the cabin to make everything feel more intense.\n\nIf your 4Runner will spend most of its life on pavement, the SR5, Limited or Platinum are the best choices. They drive a bit more sophisticated, albeit with less intense hardware, should you ever encounter an off-road obstacle. The sweet spot is the TRD Off-Road, which comes with enough stuff to tackle some dirt but still feels livable in the real world. It also gives you the choice of both engines.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nThis morning, I stumbled upon a post in the \"2016 Thru 2023 Toyota Tacoma Owners\" group on Facebook that hit close to home for anyone who loves trucks. Michael Duffus, a fellow Tacoma enthusiast, shared his dilemma, and I couldn\u2019t help but dive deep into his story. Like many of us, Michael finds himself torn between two excellent Toyota Tacomas, each with its own strengths. His post generated a lot of insightful comments from group members, and it inspired me to explore this choice in detail.\n\nHere\u2019s what Michael posted:\n\n\"Hey guys, I\u2019m having a hard time here because I really want a manual transmission Toyota Tacoma. I love the look of the lunar rock color. It\u2019s leveled and has my manual transmission. It\u2019s a 2022 TRD Tacoma Sport with 54,000 miles, and they want a $35,000 bottom dollar, private sale. But I just found this other 2023 Tacoma closer to me at a dealership for less than a grand more, but it has an automatic transmission! This truck also comes with fewer miles and a warranty. But on the other hand, I think they still owe a lot on the lunar rock one. I\u2019m thinking of trying to get them down to maybe $33,000. What do you guys think?\"\n\nManual vs. Automatic Trucks: The Age-Old Debate\n\nMichael\u2019s post brings up a classic debate among truck enthusiasts: manual versus automatic transmission. On one side, you have the raw, connected feel of a manual transmission. For those who love the driving experience, there\u2019s nothing quite like it. The lunar rock 2022 TRD Sport that Michael is considering checks this box. On the other hand, you have the practicality, ease, and often better resale value of an automatic transmission, like the 2023 Tacoma he\u2019s eyeing at the dealership.\n\nLet\u2019s break this choice down further by addressing the key factors at play: price, mileage, warranty, and long-term ownership experience.\n\nWhat Tacoma Owners Are Saying\n\nMichael\u2019s post drew some great responses from other Tacoma owners, offering a mix of advice and insights. Here are some of the most useful ones:\n\nArmin Marinado chimed in with a practical perspective: \"How long has it been on the market? It\u2019s not easy to privately sell a $35k truck. Dealers have the advantage of in-house financing. I\u2019d wait a week, and they will go lower on price when it doesn\u2019t sell. It\u2019s a fair price at $35,000 though. It looks like it has the tech package and LED headlights; however, it\u2019s hard to see. It\u2019s amazing how much value these trucks hold.\"\n\nArmin\u2019s point about the private sale is critical. Private sellers often lack the convenience of financing options, which dealerships can use to sweeten the deal. If Michael is patient, he might be able to negotiate the lunar rock truck\u2019s price down to $33,000 or even less.\n\nCoy Holdon shared his experience with buying a manual Tacoma: \"I just bought a 2022 Tacoma SR manual 5-speed V6 4-door! It doesn\u2019t have all the bells and whistles, of course, but I didn\u2019t want that either as I already bought everything to build it. Lift, lockers, wheels, tires, and I\u2019m putting a flatbed on it as well. I had 19,000 miles on it and paid $26,000 out the door.\"\n\nCoy\u2019s experience highlights another consideration: customization. If Michael loves the lunar rock truck for its manual transmission and leveled suspension, it might be the perfect starting point for his own build. However, Coy\u2019s price also underscores the premium Michael would be paying for the TRD Sport trim and higher mileage.\n\nDon Baskette offered a cautionary note: \"If you want a manual, I hope you live in a rural area. A manual truck will exhaust you and the clutch in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Trust me, I did for my share of years. There was a time when the manual was more dependable; this is no longer true. The weak link now is the clutch. True, better clutches are made today, but they are not OEM.\"\n\nThis is an important point. For those who live in urban areas with heavy traffic, a manual transmission can quickly become more of a chore than a joy. Michael might want to think about how often he\u2019ll really enjoy shifting gears versus the convenience of an automatic.\n\nChris Manmino raised a critical question about the dealership truck: \"Did you ask the dealer their out-the-door price? Some of them add quite a bit of stuff to the list price. That could really be $38-$40k for the 2023 when you factor that in.\"\n\nThis is a great reminder to always get the full breakdown of dealership pricing. If the 2023 Tacoma\u2019s out-the-door price creeps into the $38,000 range, Michael might find the lunar rock Tacoma to be a better value, even with its higher mileage.\n\nMisael Hernandez added this: \"50,000 miles is about a $5k depreciation for TRD Off-Road and Sport Tacomas. $35,000 is a fair price, and it being manual will make it harder to find again. That being said, there\u2019s nothing stopping you from getting a great deal around $32,000. You just have to find the right seller and truck.\"\n\nMisael\u2019s comment highlights the rarity of manual Tacomas, which could make the lunar rock truck a smart buy if Michael can negotiate the price down. On the flip side, the lower mileage and warranty of the 2023 Tacoma might make it the better choice for long-term reliability.\n\nAdditional Considerations for Tacoma Buyers\n\nMichael\u2019s dilemma also touches on broader topics that many Tacoma buyers wrestle with. For example, should you buy a 2023 Tacoma now or wait for the redesigned 2024 model? If that\u2019s a question you\u2019ve been asking, check out this detailed comparison of the 2023 and 2024 Tacomas.\n\nTacoma trucks are known for their reliability and off-road capability, but like any vehicle, they have their quirks. If you\u2019re considering a used Tacoma, it\u2019s worth reading about common problems to watch out for.\n\nFor those interested in the latest features, the 2024 Tacoma introduces several exciting upgrades that might sway you toward waiting for a brand-new model.\n\nFinal Thoughts and The Real Question Here\n\nMichael\u2019s decision ultimately boils down to what matters most to him: the driving experience or long-term practicality. The Lunar Rock 2022 Tacoma offers the joy of a manual transmission and a head-turning color, but it comes with higher mileage and the uncertainties of a private sale. The 2023 Tacoma, while automatic, brings lower mileage, a warranty, and the peace of mind of buying from a dealership.\n\nBoth trucks are excellent choices, and either one could make a great addition to Michael\u2019s driveway. The real question is whether he\u2019ll prioritize his love for manual driving or the practical benefits of a newer, lower-mileage truck.\n\nWhat About You?\n\nHave you faced a similar decision when buying a truck? What factors tipped the scales for you? Share your thoughts in the comments below \u2013 we\u2019d love to hear your story.\n\nAlso, if you were in Michael\u2019s shoes, which Tacoma would you choose and why? Let us know!

The 30-second spot, from Saatchi & Saatchi, spotlighted its Tacoma truck.\n\nAlthough Toyota won\u2019t be paying the reported $7 million Fox was asking of advertisers for a 30-second commercial, it will still be activating around the event as a sponsor of its NFL Flag Football events.\n\nDuring the lead-up to Super Bowl Sunday, the brand will sponsor the first-ever NFL Flag HBCU Tournament in Orlando.\n\nAdjacent to the game, Toyota will also sponsor an event at the Super Bowl Experience pop-up theme park in New Orleans. Per MediaPost, fans can \u201cride shotgun\u201d with Team Toyota athletes such as the Patroits\u2019 Christian Gonzalez and retired Giants quarterback, Eli Manning, in an AR game.\n\nEach activation will spotlight new Toyota models on-site for participants, including the Tacoma TRD Pro Hybrid.\n\nAutomakers sit out Super Bowl 59\n\nSome of the Super Bowl\u2019s most memorable ads have come from auto brands, including Volkswagen\u2019s 2011 Star Wars-themed effort \u201cThe Force,\u201d and Audi\u2019s Jason Statham-fronted \u201cThe Chase.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, only three marques\u2014Kia, BMW, and Volkswagen\u2014ran national ads. All of these brands have confirmed they will sit out Super Bowl 59.\n\nAudi, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, Lexus, Nissan, and Volkswagen have also confirmed they will pass on Big Game ads this year.\n\nRam\u2019s Super Bowl commercial will air the two-minute break of the second quarter, according to a press release. Sister brand Jeep will also run its own ad.\n\nWhile the sector has historically been one of the larger spenders in the game, carmakers have tightened the purse strings in recent years.\n\nThe Super Bowl is just one causality of Western car brands shifting traditional spend into digital avenues as they race to keep up with EV technology, and address weakening demand as well as growing competition from China and supply chain issues.\n\nEmarketer predicts total U.S. automotive media ad spend will hit $31.77 billion in 2025, up from $29.48 billion in 2024. However, traditional media ad budgets (which include TV) are set to slide from $7.46 billion in 2024 to $7.3 billion in 2025. By 2026, these will drop to $6.86 billion.\n\nFor the latest Super Bowl 59 advertising news\u2014who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out, teasers, full ads, and more\u2014check out ADWEEK\u2019s Super Bowl Ad Tracker.",

            "content": "Here's an interesting build we bet no one on this great green planet had on their 2025 automotive prediction sheet: a Land Cruiser-inspired tiny MPV turned camper that doesn't quite camp. It's the all-new CLS-Fox \"Landcroomy\" from Japanese tuning shop ESB, and while it's woefully ill-equipped for an all-out backcountry camping trip or overlanding expedition, it definitely exudes \"road trip\" vibes like few other 12-foot vehicles on road or trail.\n\nWith a length of 370 cm (146 in) and a 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbo engine, the Daihatsu-built Japanese-market Toyota Roomy isn't quite a kei van, a category that applies to vehicles measuring no longer than 340 cm (134 in) with engines up to 660cc, among other restrictions. That said, the Roomy is still a properly tiny MPV with a 4.6-m (15-ft) turning radius. It makes for one of those delightfully unlikely camper vans with which Japan and Korea have long fascinated the Western world.\n\nInterestingly enough, the Roomy is actually something of an MPV-camper van straight off the Toyota lot, a five-seater with two front seats that fold completely flat and a rear bench that reclines by up to 70 degrees. So if you don't mind sleeping a little upright, you have yourself an effective sleeper van without any further modification.\n\nThe stock Roomy features flat-folding front seats and a partially folding rear bench that create a serious inside lounger but not quite a flat bed Toyota\n\nWe'd like to say ESB has further improved upon the Roomy's inherent in-vehicle camping capabilities, but instead it's done something a little strange. It's turned the entire rear cabin, from front seat backs to tailgate, into one big, squishy bed cushion that measures only 155 cm (61 in) long. So if you happen to be 5 feet (152 cm) tall or less, you can just barely enjoy a full lie-down; otherwise, you'll have to cram in diagonally or with your knees bent. Or simply not lie down at all.\n\nAt 125 cm (49 in) side to side, the mattress has enough width for two but certainly not enough length for two adults. ESB doesn't explain if it fancies the CLS-Fox Roomy a day-tripper or a solo adventure camper, but the single photo of a girl sitting up on the mattress suggests the former \u2013 a little day lounge on wheels for getting out of the city into nature and kicking back on a cushy 8-cm-thick (3-in) mattress with the tailgate open.\n\nThe ESB certainly makes a chill day lounge ESB\n\nESB doesn't specifically mention camping, but it does describe the CLS-Fox as a tiny MPV meant to \"run.\" Toward that end, the tuner tops the small van with an Inno rooftop cargo box and adds in a 3-cm (1.2-in) suspension lift and Toyo Open Country 165/65R15 rugged-terrain tires to help it clear obstacles and earn its tenuous comparison to the venerable Land Cruiser. ESB centers those tires around steel wheels, matched to the white body color on the debut model.\n\nESB caps off the CLS-Fox design with a new front bumper to underpin the Roomy's bold factory grille and a rear bumper to match. There's no mention of any powertrain tuning, so the stock turbo-three will be left to its own devices in developing up to 97 hp and 103 lb-ft (140 Nm) of torque.\n\nESB Toyota Roomy CLS Fox \"Landcroomy\" ESB\n\nThe Roomy itself starts at \u00a51,916,110 (approx. US$12,375) after taxes and fees, as listed by Toyota, and is offered as a 4WD starting at \u00a52,096,410 (US$13,525). ESB's CLS-Fox components can be purchased individually, which comes out to \u00a5295,000 (US$2,000) for the suspension lift, four steel wheels, front and rear bumper, and interior mattress, excluding the Inno roof box. The components also fit the related Daihatsu Thor and Subaru Justy.\n\nSource: ESB, Toyota (Japan)",

            "content": "The redesigned RAV4 has been spied testing in Michigan, sporting an evolutionary design with some cues from the Camry\n\nA prototype of the 2026 Toyota RAV4 was spied undergoing testing in Michigan.\n\nThe crossover sports an evolutionary design that incorporates cues from the Camry.\n\nToyota could offer a hybrid-only lineup that has outputs of 228 hp and 232 hp.\n\nThe RAV4 is one of Toyota\u2019s most important products as the company sold over 475,000 of them in the United States last year. It\u2019s so popular that nearly one out of every four Toyotas sold was a RAV4. Given that importance, the redesigned RAV4 is big news and it was recently spotted undergoing testing in Metro Detroit.\n\nInterestingly, it appears to echo an image allegedly taken at a dealer event in China, giving that picture more credibility.\n\nMore: 2026 Toyota RAV4 Appears To Have Been Leaked\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s take a closer look at Toyota\u2019s upcoming crossover. The front end is all-new and features C-shaped headlights that are connected by a prominent bar. They\u2019re joined by a distinctive mesh grille and many of these components mirror what we\u2019ve already seen on the Camry.\n\nFurther below, there are vertical air curtains that have a horizontal element. We can also see a rectangular intake and a subtle air dam.\n\nThings take a more evolutionary turn further back as the 2026 RAV4 appears to adopt a taller beltline. As part of this effort, there are new front doors that eschew the small dip found on the current model. The beltline also appears flatter, but there\u2019s a new upward kink in the third quarter glass.\n\nBaldauf / Carscoops\n\nElsewhere, we can see streamlined bodywork and more angular cladding. Designers also gave the crossover pronounced hips and wheel arches.\n\nThe rear end borrows heavily from the current model, but adopts new taillights and a sizable spoiler. Toyota also cleaned up the design and hid the exhaust out of the way.\n\nIn fact, spy photographers initially believed this was an electric prototype as it was spied testing alongside a Tesla Model Y. However, this was quickly ruled out as \u201cexhaust puffs\u201d were clearly visible due to freezing temperatures. While it\u2019s not entirely clear why the crossover was being benchmarked against the EV, spy photographers believe it\u2019s related to sales.\n\nBaldauf\n\nWhatever the case, they got a brief glimpse inside. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t much to see as the cabin was covered by black camouflage. However, there appears to be a freestanding infotainment system similar to the one found on the current model.\n\nLittle is known about the redesigned RAV4 at this point, but it\u2019s expected to ride on a familiar TNGA platform and be offered exclusively as a hybrid. If the Camry is any indication, the model could have a hybridized 2.5-liter four-cylinder that produces a combined output of 225 hp (168 kW / 228 PS). The all-wheel drive variant adds a rear-mounted motor and this provides all-weather traction as well as an increased output of 232 hp (173 kW / 235 PS).\n\nMore: This Is What The 2026 Toyota RAV4 Will Look Like Without Camo\n\nTo put those numbers into perspective, the conventionally powered RAV4 has a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 203 hp (151 kW / 206 PS). The RAV4 Hybrid, on the other hand, has 219 hp (163 kW / 222 PS).\n\nThe redesigned RAV4 is expected to be introduced later this year and it might incorporate an assortment of aluminum body panels to reduce weight. This could help to improve fuel efficiency, but only time will tell.",

            "content": "Two Toyota car dealerships in New York are adding microgrids to provide resilience and reduce energy costs. The microgrids will be installed at Sunrise Toyota and Sunrise Toyota North, both on Long Island.\n\n\u201cWe have experienced rising utility costs for years,\u201d Jimmy Berg, dealer principal at Sunrise Toyota, said in a statement. \u201cWe are also increasingly sensitive to power outages that shut down our operations. This investment in our facility and business creates a strong investment case by controlling these costs. The resiliency benefits are an important bonus.\u201d\n\nThe grid-connected solar and energy storage microgrids, installed by Sprocket Power Microgrids, will optimize the dealerships\u2019 energy use, managing the amount of electricity pulled from or sent to the grid based on grid conditions and lowering utility bills by up to 90%, according to a statement.\n\nDuring power outages, the microgrid will disconnect from the larger grid, powering operations with the on-site solar and energy storage system. The microgrid can also support the grid during times of peak demand by using power generated on-site and reducing the dealerships\u2019 demand for grid electricity.\n\nSprocket Power recently installed microgrids at three other New York car dealerships: Vail GMC Hummer, in Bedford Hills, Croton Auto Park, in Croton-on-Hudson, and Yonkers Honda in Yonkers.\n\nDealership microgrids will include EV chargers\n\nIn addition to on-site solar, energy storage and microgrid controls, the Sunrise Toyota and Sunrise Toyota North installations will feature EV chargers from Kempower, an EV charging solutions manufacturer. These two projects are the first in a newly announced collaboration between Sprocket Power and Kempower.\n\nThe microgrid will be the primary source of energy for Kempower\u2019s modular DC fast-charging solutions.\n\n\u201cThis partnership with Sprocket Power enables us to offer a unique combination of smart charging technology and renewable energy systems, reducing both costs and environmental impact for our customers,\u201d added Marcus Suvanto, vice president of sales at Kempower.",

            "content": "After six years, the 5th-gen RAV4 is making way for a \"new\" model, though it might not be as fresh as Toyota would like you to believe\n\nWhile extensively updated, the new RAV4 is expected to ride on the same platform.\n\nThe hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants will return with power and efficiency boosts.\n\nInterior upgrades will include higher-quality materials and a larger infotainment screen.\n\nToyota\u2019s wildly popular RAV4 continues to dominate sales charts, holding the title of America\u2019s best-selling vehicle that wasn\u2019t a truck in 2024 and, in the process, printing money for the Japanese automaker, even as new competitors line up for a piece of the action. As the fifth-generation RAV4 approaches the end of its current lifecycle, Toyota is preparing to replace it, but don\u2019t expect a complete reinvention.\n\n2026 Subaru Outback: Everything We Know From Design To Powertrains\n\nRecent spy shots and reports from Japan suggest the upcoming RAV4 is in for a significant visual update. However, it might not be as extensive as most full redesigns that we have come to know. Much like the latest Camry, the new model is expected to retain the existing platform and powertrains. While the exterior gets a sleek new polish, there are clear signs that this isn\u2019t an \u201call-new\u201d model in the traditional sense.\n\nEvolutionary Design\n\nIllustrations Josh Byrnes / Carscoops\n\nWhen the current fifth-gen RAV4 debuted in 2018 at the New York Auto Show, it stood out with its sharper and more aggressive styling, a clear departure from the softer designs of its immediate predecessors. Even today, it still looks fresh. For 2026, the design remains familiar but with subtle aerodynamic tweaks here and there.\n\nThe front fascia embraces Toyota\u2019s latest design language, as seen on the Prius and the new Camry. It sports wrap-around DRLs with hammerhead inner sections and a honeycomb grille. We expect a few differences from our preliminary illustration that\u2019s based on prototypes spied in Japan, so the final product may look squarer with more contrasting elements.\n\nFrom the side, the RAV4 maintains its recognizable silhouette, with two-tone roof options and bold contrasting lower cladding. The glasshouse and pillar layout are nearly identical to the current model. Around back, you\u2019ll likely see a full-width LED taillight cluster paired with squared-off lower cladding that features silver inlays for a modern touch.\n\nGiven Honda\u2019s recent announcement of a more rugged CR-V TrailSport trim coming later this year as part of a mid-cycle facelift, it\u2019s highly likely that Toyota won\u2019t want to be left behind in this growing segment. To stay competitive, Toyota may tap into its off-road expertise, introducing a rugged TRD Pro trim similar to what\u2019s offered in the latest 4Runner.\n\nWhat About the Leaked Photo?\n\nA leaked image of what\u2019s belived to be the 2026 Toyota Wildlander, China\u2019s version of the new RAV4.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that our rendering was created before Friday\u2019s leaked photo, which allegedly surfaced on a backscreen during a media presentation in China. The vehicle in question is believed to be the successor to the Toyota Wildlander, a China-only version of the RAV4, developed in partnership with FAW and sold by GAC domestically.\n\nCompared to the international RAV4, the current Wildlander features distinct front and rear fascias. At this point, it\u2019s unclear whether the next-generation RAV4 and Wildlander will retain their mild styling differences or converge into a single, unified design.\n\nChina\u2019s current 2025 Toyota Wildlander (above) and North America\u2019s 2025 Toyota RAV4 (below).\n\nUnder The Skin\n\nWe\u2019ve yet to catch a glimpse of the new RAV\u2019s interior. However, if the redesigned Camry is anything to go by, expect higher-quality materials and an improved tech roster compared to the current car. Internal dimensions? We don\u2019t anticipate much change here.\n\nThe tech roster will likely include an expansive infotainment display with sharper graphics and support for Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Amazon Alexa for enhanced voice recognition control of various functions. Premium touches such as a head-up display (HUD), panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, and wireless charging are also expected to carry over.\n\nAs for underpinnings, it will likely use the current model\u2019s TNGA-K architecture with improvements to crashworthiness to help it pass more stringent IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) crash test protocols.\n\nEV and Hybrid Power\n\nRumors of a newly developed 1.5-liter turbocharged engine have been circulating, but it\u2019s unlikely to appear in this sixth-generation of the RAV4. Instead, the familiar 2.5-liter engine and plug-in hybrid setup will return, albeit with slight boosts in power and efficiency.\n\nThe more significant news lies in the possibility of a fully electric variant. Details are slim, but word is revisions to the TNGA-K platform have considered full electrification. If Toyota goes down this path, we won\u2019t see silly BZ4X-like nomenclature again.\n\nRivals and Reveal\n\nThe new VW Tiguan (Photo Stephen Rivers / Carscoops)\n\nThe RAV4\u2019s next iteration will face stiff competition in a crowded segment. Rivals like Mazda\u2019s all-new CX-5 hybrid, the Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester, Kia Sportage, Hyundai Tucson, and Ford Escape are all aiming for a slice of the compact SUV pie.\n\n2026 Mazda CX-5: After 9 Years, New SUV Coming With Big Changes In Tow\n\nToyota is expected to officially unveil the updated RAV4 later this year, with sales likely beginning later this fall as a 2026 model year vehicle. Pricing is anticipated to remain in the same ballpark as the current model, starting from around $29,000 to $30,000.\n\nWhat do you think of the RAV4\u2019s heavily revised new appearance?

Powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine producing about 100 horsepower, the 4Runner prioritized durability over performance. A turbocharged version with 135 horsepower and, later, a 3.0-liter V6 with 150 horsepower were introduced.\n\nFor the first two model years, 4Runners used a solid front axle, but in 1986 that was replaced with double wishbones sprung by torsion bars. A solid rear axle and a part-time four-wheel-drive system with a two-speed transfer case came in every trim. Manual hubs were standard but automatic hubs became available later in the run. By 1989, Toyota began offering more creature comforts, reflecting the growing demand for SUVs that were as capable on-road as they were off-road.\n\nSecond generation (1990\u20131995): Fully enclosed and more refined",

With Toyota Tundra facing engine issues, it's certainly not the best time to invest in one. So, why did Alex opt for a Porsche Taycan?\n\nCheck out my report, which explains why Toyota is replacing over 100,000 Tundra engines under warranty. It's too late for Alex; he has already bought the Toyota Tundra. Why did Alex purchase a Porsche Yatcan?\n\nImagine being in Alex's shoes. He's young, single, and with enough disposable income to buy a 2024 Toyota Tundra for $71,000 and a 2021 Porsche Taycan for $58,000. While it may seem like a pipe dream, this scenario prompts a discussion on the affordability of these vehicles. This stark difference raises the question-was his decision wise, or will he regret it?\n\nIt doesn't mean it's a sound financial plan, but I remember being 21 years old and having a Chevrolet Corvette and a 57 Chevrolet Bel Air 2dr. Oh, how I wish I had those two cars now.\n\nBack to Alex's Tundra and Taycan story.\n\nAlex Sedlak is having the time of his life. He's single, has a beautiful girlfriend, owns a new Toyota Tundra pickup, and just purchased a 2021 Porsche Taycan. Life is good, for now.\n\nHowever, he paid a lot of money for the Tundra ($71,000), and it appears he got a great deal on the 2021 Porsche Taycan ($58,000).\n\nAs I said, if you look at the truck market compared to the electric sports car market, things are crazy right now. Trucks like the Toyota Tundra are overpriced, and electric sports cars like the Porsche Taycan prices are plummeting.\n\nCheck out Alex's story.\n\nAs he points to the new sports car listings online, Alex says, \"Why isn't anyone talking about this? Did you know you can get a Porsche for less than a Toyota Tundra? Look at this 2021 Porsche Taycan for less than $60,000; here is one for $56,000, and another one for $53,000, and they are good-looking cars too.\u201d\n\n\"It's not a GT3 RS, but you can still drive a Porsche for 60 grand? Okay, it's a two-year-old Porsche, but it's a Porsche. My new 2024 Toyota Tundra cost $71,000.\"\n\n\"It's an electric, too, which could be a downfall. But it's still a Porsche, and they look awesome and they are fast.\"\n\nHe looks at the car's interior and sees the touchscreen stretching across the dash. \"This whole thing is a screen, it's a beautiful interior, and I literally bought it over the phone today. I called my broker, and he said, \"Send me a link, and I will give them a call,' and he negotiated the deal. I put $5,000 down, and now the car is being delivered tomorrow.\"\n\n\"The payments are like $1,000 a month. My Toyota Tundra payment is about the same, and I put $15,000 down on the Tundra. So, you don't need a Lamborghini, bro. Don't be stupid with your money.\"\n\nAlex continues, \"I think it's a great deal. I know the car community is probably going to be like, dude, it's freaking electric. A 2022 Electric.\"\n\nWhat does he say to the electric car naysayers?\n\n\"I don't care, I really don't. It's a cool car, cheap, and it's a very nice-looking drive. It's on the way. It will be here tomorrow. Show you guys tomorrow,\" he says as he signs off the video.\n\nThe Porsche Taycan arrives.\n\nAfter his Porsche Taycan is delivered, Alex says, \"Alright, guys, we added to the fleet. We have the 2021 Porsche Taycan sitting next to the Mercedes G63. My girlfriend is driving that home.\"\n\nWhat? He also owns a Toyota Tundra truck and a Mercedes-Benz G63.\n\nAlex lives in Florida and has a beautiful home (that he probably rents), a Toyota Tundra pickup, a Mercedes-Benz G63, and now a Porsche Taycan.\n\nAlex continues, \"So we are whipping the Porsche Taycan. Can you believe that this thing was only $58,000? This thing is so mean for only $58K. This was so much less than my Toyota Tundra.\"\n\n\"There are four displays inside. Look at this beautiful interior,\" Alex says as he shows the white leather interior.\n\nOkay, Alex obviously has money from somewhere. However, $2,000 in truck and car payments, and who knows about the G63?\n\nMaybe he's a trust fund baby. Who knows? However, was the Porsche Taycan a good buy?\n\nAlex purchased a 2021 Porsche Taycan 4S sedan. The original manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) was $107,700. Alex paid $58,000 for the 2021 Taycan, close to half its original price.\n\nKelley Blue Book says the national average price is $54,643 for the 2021 Taycan. Why are the prices of the Taycan so low?\n\nCar Scoops says, \"Some blame goes to the model changeover. Porsche revealed a face-lifted Taycan in the spring that offers only small changes but vastly improved range and performance. And maybe some buyers bought or have ordered the new Macan Electric instead.\"\n\nReddit users are saying the same thing as Alex about Taycan pricing now. One user says he found a great deal and asks, \"Good deal, yes or no?\"\n\nmoozirt says, \"I'm suddenly needing a new car soon and I've been wanting a Porsche Taycan since they've come out. I am gravitating toward this specific car for the Frozen Berry Metallic color. A private seller is selling the car and says they are open to negotiations.\"\n\n\"Is the listing price of $64,900 a decent price for a 2021 car with only 6,900 miles and these specs? This is pricing before making an offer, so there's potential for pricing to be lower. The original MSRP on this car was $111,000.\"\n\nMost Reddit users agree it was a bit overpriced, but moozirt says it was a CPO vehicle, and he did buy the Taycan, and says, \"The sellers were absolutely fantastic, has a warranty until June 1, 2025, or 50,000 mi. and I got a great deal on it in the end.\"\n\nDid Alex get a great deal?\n\nI don't know the mileage of Alex's Porsche Taycan, but it's in excellent condition. The black-on-white is a striking color combo, and as Ramvet says on the Taycan Forum, \"The Taycan 4S really scoots, accelerating like a 992 GT3 effortlessly.\"\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nDid Alex get a great deal on the 2021 Porsche Taycan 4S?

Whether it\u2019s called the \u201cRampage\u201d or \u201cDakota\u201d or something else remains to be seen.\n\nShould I get the TRD Pro, or TRD Off-Road?\n\n\n\nThe first question is actually a statement about the upcoming Ram Rampage.\n\nQ: (Via:Twitter/X@NathanAdlen) The Ram Rampage is going into production?\n\nThat\u2019s what I heard and it looks like it will be midsize for sure! What do you think?\n\n\u2013 Titan_Log\n\nA: Yay!\n\nI just got word the other day that the UAW has announced that the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois is being reactivated, and will build an all-new midsize pickup truck for Stellantis. Many believe the name of the vehicle will be \u201cRampage,\u201d but others think that Ram will bring back the \u201cDakota\u201d name instead. That distinction in itself could indicate what this truck will actually be.\n\nLet me explain: Stellantis said that this new truck will have a gas, hybrid and all-electric variant. To me, it mirrors what they have instore for the new Ram 1500. Additionally, they may have other vehicles built at the BVAP. That would mean it has a platform that will either be shared with other Stellantis vehicles, or major components.\n\nHere\u2019s TFLtruck\u2019s take on Ram\u2019s upcoming midsize truck.\n\nThe Ram Rampage is already in production, and it is based on a front-wheel drive architecture. It\u2019s aimed at tiny pickups like the Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz. Building a U.S.-friendly version might mean that it shares its underpinnings with something like the next generation Jeep Cherokee. That could mean using the STLA Large platform, which could accommodate internal combustion, PHEV and fully electric powertrains. Makes sense.\n\nThe other possibility is a body-on frame setup that\u2019s smaller than the STLA Frame platform now used on the Ram 1500, and Jeep Wagoneers. For those who mentioned the Jeep Gladiator\u2019s platform: that is a modified JL frame, and I doubt it will work out on a modern small pickup. If they use a frame, the STLA is modular, and they may be able to shrink it down to size. It could be kind of what Toyota did with their TNGA-F platform, which underpins everything that needs a frame.\n\nThe best possible outcome would be both. A midsize pickup with a proper frame and rugged bones, AND a small pickup which would be a great runabout. Essentially, I\u2019m hoping the go down a similar rabbit hole that Ford did \u2013 building a truck for nearly every budget. Considering how popular pickups are \u2013 it may be worth looking into.\n\nRegardless of the speculation, we know that something real is being built, we know where it will be built, and now we know when it will be built.. .2027. That should mean that we should start hearing drips of information about this new pickup within the next few months. Like many of you: I\u2019m excited to hear more.\n\n\u2013 N\n\nImage: TFLtruck\n\nThe last question comes from a viewer who is about to buy a Toyota Tacoma. Should he get the TRD Off-Road, or the TRD PRO\n\nQ: Tacoma TRD Pro vs TRD Off-Road?\n\nWhats the haps big boy?\n\nLove to watch the off-roading videos and you guys make it easy to follow. I have never purchased a pick up truck before. I have owned a 2017 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon for six years and I want more capability. But I still want to be able to go off-roading sometimes. I am not hardcore but I know that the places I go need good ground clearance and lockers help sometimes. Time to burp when I get nervous about high pricing.\n\nI am interested in the new Toyota Tacoma. I don\u2019t know if I want the TRD Off Road or the TRD Pro. Does the hybrid matter that much or can I get what I need out of the turbo without the hybrid?\n\nJust give me your gut instinct on this one, okay?\n\n\u2014 JoBlo 1996\n\nA: There are actually three trucks you\u2019re talking about.\n\nThe Tacoma TRD Off-Road package is available in the approx $42,000 non-hybrid model, and there\u2019s a TRD Off-Road package for the iForce Max that comes in under $47,000. That means, you get the off-road underpinnings, combined with the hybrid powertrain. Then, it\u2019s a big leap to the almost $64,000 TRD Pro.\n\nUnless you are serious about aggressively bouncing over dunes and climbing rocks often, I would avoid the TRD Pro. It is truly setup for off-road hardships, and you pay for it. The FOX suspension setup, armor and even the seat are all set up for violent encounters with the dirt. It sounds to me that this isn\u2019t what you have in mind.\n\nYou still get a well thought-out Bilstein-based suspension under the TRD Off-Road, and beefy all-terrain tires. Additionally, you get a rear locker and (available) Multi Terrain Select with Crawl Control. That system works well, and can save your behind in certain situations. Also, the regular, non-hybrid Tacoma has an available six-speed manual transmission.\n\nIf you simply must have that hybrid powertrain, I would recommend sticking with the TRD Off-Road package, and save yourself a bundle. On the other hand, if you\u2019re playing down the extremes you drive in, and you need a vehicle that has the armor and chops to survive \u2013 the TRD Pro is the way to go.\n\n\u2013 N",

Campbell, an Ohio-based pro with 47 Top 10s to his credit, left the dock with a 9-pound, 13-ounce cushion over second place and a shot at the record for total weight in a three-day Toyota Series event on Big Sam. Campbell didn\u2019t eclipse the record, but he nonetheless earned his second career Toyota Series win, bagging 16 pounds even on the day to bring his three-day total to 70-5.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s shy of pro Colby Miller\u2019s all-time three-day mark of 77-7 on Sam Rayburn that he set in 2024, but still a comfortable margin over Kaden Mueck (64-14), Dakota Ebare (63-15) and Marshall Hughes (60-12). The win is Campbell\u2019s second Toyota Series victory in three years \u2013 he won at Chickamauga in 2023 \u2013 and his first Top 10 in Texas, a state he\u2019s quickly learning to love.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never even been to Texas until last year,\u201d Cambell said. \u201c(Sam Rayburn) sets up nothing like the Ohio River, where I was born and raised, and the caliber of fishermen down here is just insane. But I\u2019ve caught five fish over 10 pounds down here already, and I\u2019d never even seen a 10-pounder until I came to Texas. I like it down here.\u201d\n\n\n\nCampbell had modest expectations heading into the tournament, thinking that 14 to 15 pounds a day was a realistic goal. After a mechanical issue delayed his start for two hours on Day 1, he began fishing an offshore timber field that sat in 30 to 50 feet of water and dropped a Deps Sakamata Shad on a 3/8-ounce jighead to an 8-8 largemouth that his Garmin LiveScope revealed was holding tight to the timber 25 feet down. That first fish was a momentum-starter that propelled him to 27-1 and the Day 1 lead.\n\n\n\nCampbell backed that up with 27-3 on Day 2, fishing the same pattern in the same area in the middle of the lake, to stake a 9-13 lead over Cole Moore.\n\n\n\nWhile a near 10-pound advantage heading into the final day is almost a shoo-in on most fisheries, Campbell admits that his back-to-back 27-pound limits on Days 1 and 2 \u2013 and the cushion they afforded him when he headed out on Saturday \u2013 didn\u2019t exactly give him a can\u2019t-miss feeling with the likes of Moore, Ebare and Miller lurking in second, third and fourth. All three anglers can boast 32- to 35-pound five-fish limits on Big Sam among them.\n\n\n\nWith a modest goal of at least 15 to 16 pounds in mind when he left the ramp Saturday, Miller\u2019s wish was to return to the same general offshore area in the middle of Rayburn where he had built his lead. But that area lay right in the barrel of sustained 10 mph winds and 20 mph gusts, which turned the middle of the lake into a no-man\u2019s-land of waves that made it impossible to fish effectively.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe wind kind of ruined my spot,\u201d Campbell admitted. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really tell how rough it was out there until I got there, but I had a suspicion that it was going to be a different kind of day. Once I got out there, it was rough rough. I gave it about 90 minutes first thing, but I had to scrap everything and just go fishing. I feel like I got lucky having two 27-pound days out there to start.\u201d\n\n\n\nCampbell\u2019s Plan B came out of pure instinct (and a desire to get out of the washing machine at the middle of the lake).\n\n\n\n\u201cI just ran to the first pocket that was out of the wind,\u201d he said. \u201cI headed to the beach and got in a protected pocket that I\u2019d never even been to before. I just needed something that was out of the wind, and I found a little corner in that pocket that had a lot of threadfin shad. They weren\u2019t very big, but I was able to scrape up a bunch of fish. It was a totally random place, but I caught the most fish there I had all week.\u201d\n\n\n\nCampbell stated earlier in the week that he was fishing to cover his entry fees for the year. He\u2019s well on the way, with a $67,522 payout that includes $35,000 in Phoenix Boats contingency money.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just came here from Florida, where I won a big team tournament on the Kissimmee Chain last week; I have good momentum going,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard at this sport. I spent 300-plus days a year on the water last year, so it feels good to be fishing good and to start the season rolling with good momentum.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe top 10 pros at the Toyota Series at Sam Rayburn Reservoir finished:\n\n\n\n1st: Brody Campbell, Oxford, Ohio, 15 bass, 70-5, $67,522\n\n2nd: Kaden Mueck, Livingston, Texas, 15 bass, 64-14, $12,602\n\n3rd: Dakota Ebare, Brookeland, Texas, 15 bass, 63-15, $9,757\n\n4th: Marshall Hughes, Hemphill, Texas, 15 bass, 60-12, $8,130\n\n5th: Hayden Marbut, Birmingham, Ala., 15 bass, 57-6, $7,317\n\n6th: Cole Moore, Anacoco, La., 15 bass, 55-7, $6,754\n\n7th: Mike Hawkes, Sabinal, Texas, 14 bass, 55-2, $6,191\n\n8th: Colby Miller, Elmer, La., 15 bass, 54-10, $4,878\n\n9th: Chad Mrazek, Montgomery, Texas, 15 bass, 53-2, $4,065\n\n10th: Wesley Baxley, Cypress, Texas, 15 bass, 51-8, $3,252\n\n\n\nComplete results can be found at MajorLeagueFishing.com.\n\n\n\nPro Mike Hawkes of Sabinal, Texas, earned Thursday\u2019s $500 Berkley Big Bass Award with a bass weighing 9 pounds, 5 ounces.

But there's a bit more to it than that.\n\nArctic Trucks\u2014the same group that built Top Gear's Hilux fleet for the infamous Polar Special\u2014went after the latest Land Cruiser with a whole host of upgrades. The stock suspension is replaced with a 2-way adjustable setup featuring longer-travel coilovers in front. New springs and dampers hold up the rear, giving the tweaked Toyota a modest 1.5-inch suspension lift. 17-inch wheels from Arctic Trucks are shod with BFGoodrich T/A K03 37-inch tires (hence the AT37 name), and to make sure they fit without rubbing, a 10-piece widebody kit is installed.\n\nPhoto by: Arctic Trucks Photo by: Arctic Trucks Photo by: Arctic Trucks\n\nThose are bolt-on items, but the modifications go much further. The LC's entire frame and body are re-engineered, including relocating the rear axle further back for a stretched wheelbase and widening the track. According to Arctic Trucks, this culminates in better ground clearance and stability without sacrificing comfort. It also looks mean as hell.\n\nThere aren't any changes to the powertrain, but the speedometer is recalibrated to account for all the suspension mods. Mud flaps are bolted up, rubberized side steps are added, and the interior gets fresh carpeting to match the macho exterior vibe. There are plenty of badges to denote this rig as something special, and on the functional side, a 2-inch multifunction receiver hitch is installed should you need to tow something.\n\n\u201cDeveloping this project in the heart of [UK] Motorsport Valley has allowed us to have frequent and direct face-to-face communications with multiple suppliers,\" said Arctic Trucks International R&D Manager Freyr \u00de\u00f3rsson. \"The resulting hands-on development has generated greatly improved performance.\u201d\n\nGallery: Arctic Trucks Toyota Land Cruiser Prado 23 Arctic Trucks\n\nThere's no mention of pricing for the AT37, other than to say it can vary by region.

            "content": "Quotes:\n\nAkio Toyoda (TGR-WRT Chairman)\n\nWe were able to kick off the 2025 season with Seb's memorable 10th victory in Monte Carlo.\n\nUp until 2019, Seb had a streak of six consecutive wins in Monte Carlo with various teams. Since joining Toyota in 2020, he has alternated between 2nd and 1st place every other year. Given this pattern, I was certain that he would win this year.\n\nSeb, congratulations on your 10th win in Monte Carlo! I think it's time for you to break that pattern and win again next year!\n\n\n\nLast season was incredibly enjoyable, as we battled with Hyundai all the way to the final stage of the final round. However, that was just how I felt as a rally fan. As a team member, there were many moments that were quite tough throughout the season. This year, I want to make it a season that we can enjoy from the bottom of our hearts also as team members. And I want to experience that feeling again at Rally Japan! I believe Jari-Matti, Juha, all the drivers, all the co-drivers, and everyone in the team will make it happen! And just so you know, this year's Rally Japan is not the final event...\n\nQuotes:\n\nJari-Matti Latvala (Team Principal)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really delighted. We could not really have had a better start to the season than this: we got the maximum 60 points as a team, a one-two-four overall and the 10th victory for S\u00e9bastien Ogier on Rallye Monte-Carlo, which is a truly amazing and unique achievement. The conditions were very difficult until the end and the tyre choice was stressful this morning because the road was freezing after the route-note crews had passed through. Unfortunately Sami and Taka went off, and perhaps I should have pushed them to take a safer choice, but this rally was all about the experience for them. With our other drivers it worked out well in the end, so thank you to them. At the same time it was a very entertaining rally and I think we have an exciting season ahead.\u201d\n\nElfyn Evans (Driver car 33)\n\n\u201cThis was a typical Rallye Monte-Carlo, a bit more extreme than in recent years and it was a properly challenging weekend. I\u2019m very happy to be here at the end with a decent haul of points. Today started off with some very tricky conditions, we made a change at the last moment to take four studded tyres and I wasn\u2019t sure it was the right call. In the end it seems there wasn\u2019t a lot between the two choices and we had a pretty thrilling Power Stage to finish: we had a close moment a few corners from the end but thankfully we managed to get away with it.\u201d\n\nKalle Rovanper\u00e4 (Driver car 69)\n\n\u201cRallye Monte-Carlo is always tough and it was especially so this year. For me personally it was a pretty difficult weekend. We didn\u2019t have the result that we wanted or the pace that we wanted but we have to be happy at the end to have got some pretty good points. Today was not a bad day for us: we just tried our best, kept consistent and it paid off. A big thanks to the team, now let\u2019s see what we can do in Sweden.\u201d\n\nS\u00e9bastien Ogier (Driver car 17)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to win this rally for the 10th time: it makes me incredibly happy and proud. This rally is the one that gave me the dream to be a rally driver, so if I could pick only one to win in a season, it would always be this one. This year it\u2019s been a huge fight up until the very last stage. We had changing conditions, difficult tyre decisions and pressure right until the end so I\u2019m glad we managed to keep it under control. We definitely had some moments but to win this rally I think you always need a bit of luck too. It\u2019s a perfect start to the year for the team so we couldn\u2019t ask for anything more.\u201d\n\nTakamoto Katsuta (Driver car 18)\n\n\u201cThis morning in the first stage we knew that the conditions could be quite tricky, but we came to one right-hand corner that was frosty where we didn\u2019t have that information in our pacenotes. We were quite slow going into the corner, but the car went wide and got stuck in a small ditch which we couldn\u2019t get out of. Until then it had been quite a good rally, especially Saturday when the pace was good. It\u2019s a pity but I just need to refocus on the next rally in Sweden and try to do a good job for the team there.\u201d\n\nSami Pajari (Driver car 5)\n\n\u201cThe approach for today was the same as before and we were not planning to push particularly hard. There was just one surprisingly icy braking point which just caught us out. It was an unfortunate end to our rally, as it been going according to plan until then. On Saturday especially we saw that the times were getting better and the feeling was getting better and the confidence was rising. Everything felt under control so it\u2019s a pity to end the rally like this, but we will try to learn from what happened and look forward to Sweden.\u201d\n\nPROVISIONAL FINAL CLASSIFICATION, RALLYE MONTE-CARLO\n\n1 S\u00e9bastien Ogier/Vincent Landais (Toyota GR YARIS Rally1) 3h19m06.1s\n\n2 Elfyn Evans/Scott Martin (Toyota GR YARIS Rally1) +18.5s\n\n3 Adrien Fourmaux/Alexandre Coria (Hyundai i20 N Rally1) +26.0s\n\n4 Kalle Rovanper\u00e4/Jonne Halttunen (Toyota GR YARIS Rally1) +54.3s\n\n5 Ott T\u00e4nak/Martin J\u00e4rveoja (Hyundai i20 N Rally1) +59.0s\n\n6 Thierry Neuville/Martijn Wydaeghe (Hyundai i20 N Rally1) +5m44.2s\n\n7 Josh McErlean/Eoin Treacy (Ford Puma Rally1) +10m15.1s\n\n8 Yohan Rossel/Arnaud Dunand (Citro\u00ebn C3 Rally2) +10m26.8s\n\n9 Nikolay Gryazin/Konstantin Aleksandrov (\u0160koda Fabia RS Rally2) +11m40.7s\n\n10 Eric Camilli/Thibault de la Haye (Hyundai i20 N Rally2) +13m14.6s\n\nRetired Takamoto Katsuta/Aaron Johnston (Toyota GR YARIS Rally1)\n\nRetired Sami Pajari/Marko Salminen (Toyota GR YARIS Rally1)\n\n(Results as of 14:30 on Sunday, for the latest results please visit www.wrc.com)\n\n2025 FIA World Rally Championship for drivers after round 1:\n\n1 S\u00e9bastien Ogier 33 points\n\n2 Elfyn Evans 26\n\n3 Adrien Fourmaux 20\n\n4 Kalle Rovanper\u00e4 18\n\n5 Ott T\u00e4nak 11\n\n6 Thierry Neuville 9\n\n7 Josh McErlean 6\n\n8 Yohan Rossel 4\n\n9 Nikolay Gryazin 2\n\n10 Eric Camilli 1\n\n2025 FIA World Rally Championship for manufacturers after round 1:\n\n1 TOYOTA GAZOO Racing World Rally Team 60 points\n\n2 Hyundai Shell Mobis World Rally Team 36\n\n3 M-Sport Ford World Rally Team 11\n\n\n\nWhat's next?\n\nRally Sweden (February 13-16) is the only full winter event of the season held on snow and ice.

And that\u2019s exactly what happened to Tim Bowman on the 2016 Thru 2023 Toyota Tacoma Owners Facebook Group, when they decided to modify their 2021 Tacoma TRD.\n\nThe owner of the truck, Bowman, took to the group to explain what happened and to get some advice about what to do next,\n\nOk, I was happy about my Double cab 4WD 21 TRD Sports gas mileage and was getting 20-22 all day and super happy with the performance with the OTT tune, until I lifted it just 2\" front 1\" rear and new 265-70-17 Falken wildpeak AT4. Now I'm blessed to get 15/16 MPGS at 65/70 mph. It's consistently going from 6th to 5th and if I use cruise control it'll downshift to 4th on a slight incline. I understand wind and temperature is affecting this but it feels worse than stock now, but it looks nice\u2026 anyone dealing with this too? I mean it's not the biggest deal but it just kinda sucks on the highway now.\n\nSome users took to the comments to remind themselves why they kept their vehicles stock, \u201cThat's why I keep stock height and tires. I know what it does to fuel consumption.\u201d\n\nWhen Toyota first introduced trucks like the 1964 Stout to America, buyers dismissed them as underpowered oddities. U.S. drivers were loyal to brawny domestic pickups, viewing compact Japanese trucks as unserious for work or recreation.\n\nThe 1964 \"Chicken Tax\" slapped a 25% tariff on imported light trucks, making Toyotas pricier than homegrown rivals. This forced Toyota to get creative, eventually building U.S. factories in the \u201880s to sidestep the tax and gain a foothold.\n\nToyota\u2019s trucks have carved a legacy in brutal off-road racing, with the Tacoma and Tundra proving their worth in events like the Baja 1000.\n\nHow It Affects The Tacoma\n\nLifts and larger tires might make a Tacoma look ready to conquer Moab, but they sabotage its carefully calibrated aerodynamics and powertrain harmony. Raising the body increases wind resistance and at highway speeds, air doesn\u2019t glide smoothly over the truck; it slams into the front end, swirls chaotically underneath, and drags against the raised suspension. Combine that with heavier, knobbier tires, and the engine suddenly faces a relentless enemy, rolling resistance.\n\nThose rugged Falkens grip dirt like Velcro, but on pavement, their aggressive treads flex and squirm, forcing the engine to burn extra fuel just to keep them spinning. It\u2019s a double whammy, your Tacoma is now fighting both the air and itself.\n\nOne user even commented, \u201cYour new tires are heavier, makes gas mileage worse ofc. I had the same setup but I was on rugged terrain Goodyears and I could feel how heavy the tires were in my clutch\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the transmission\u2019s rebellion. Modern trucks like the Tacoma rely on precise gear ratios and shift patterns to balance power and efficiency. Larger tires effectively \u201cregear\u201d the truck, altering how hard the engine works to turn the wheels. The Tacoma\u2019s computer, programmed for stock tire size, doesn\u2019t recognize the change. It still thinks the truck is running smaller tires, so when cruising at 70 mph, the engine lugs at lower RPMs, prompting frantic downshifts to avoid strain.\n\nThe result? A transmission that dances between 4th, 5th, and 6th gear, guzzling fuel like a \u201970s muscle car. The owner\u2019s OTT tune, a popular performance upgrade, might have sharpened throttle response initially, but it\u2019s now working against the truck\u2019s new reality, amplifying the inefficiencies.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s a cascade of unintended consequences\u2014each modification stacking like dominoes until the whole system teeters. The lift, the tires, the tune\u2014they\u2019re all conspiring against him. That sleek, aggressive stance comes at the cost of aerodynamics, turning his Tacoma into a rolling brick wall at highway speeds. The chunkier tires claw at the pavement, sapping power and forcing the engine to chug harder, while the transmission, confused by the new tire size and altered gearing, frantically hunts for the right gear like a lost hiker.\n\nEven the OTT tune, designed to sharpen throttle response, now amplifies the chaos, demanding more fuel to compensate for the truck\u2019s newfound clumsiness. What began as a quest for style and capability has devolved into a mechanical tug-of-war, where every tweak, no matter how small, pulls the truck further from the precision of its factory engineering. The lesson? Mods might transform your ride\u2019s attitude, but everything comes at a cost.\n\nImage source and credit: By Tim Bowman from his post on the 2016 Thru 2023 Toyota Tacoma Owners Facebook Group.\n\nNoah Washington is an automotive journalist based in Atlanta, Georgia.

            "content": "The kit is available in three variations, reflecting the EU-spec, US-spec, and South African-spec versions of the classic VW van\n\nThe Vanace by AMJ reimagines the Toyota HiAce with retro styling inspired by the VW T3.\n\nThe kit includes a redesigned front end, retro seat covers, and an optional rooftop tent.\n\nThe van blends classic styling with Japanese reliability and modern, practical amenities.\n\nThe Toyota HiAce has long been the reliable workhorse of vans, but also a favorite blank canvas for aftermarket enthusiasts with body kits and custom accessories. Now, it\u2019s ditching its utilitarian vibe for some retro cool, thanks to a makeover inspired by the boxy charm of the VW Transporter T3. Yes, that T3, the last rear-engine van from Volkswagen, built between 1979 and 1992.\n\nWhile the global market welcomed a new HiAce generation in 2019, the older H200 model with its cab-over layout remains alive and well in Japan, essentially unchanged since 2004. And that\u2019s where independent tuner AMJ (Auto Motive Japan) comes in, transforming the venerable van into the \u201cVanace\u201d (a mashup of \u201cVan\u201d and \u201cAce\u201d).\n\nMore: Toyota HiAce Receives A Sporty Makeover With A Land Cruiser Face Transplant\n\nThe Vanace gets a full front-end redesign that echoes the T3\u2019s styling, minus the rear-mounted engine and VW badge for obvious reasons\u2014though we\u2019d bet anyone going this route would likely add the badge later. The makeover includes a new pronounced bumper add-on, retro halogen headlights, yellow indicators, a flat hood, and subtly reworked front fenders. Combined, these updates give the HiAce a distinctly retro identity while maintaining the practical underpinnings.\n\nThree Looks To Choose From\n\nAdditionally, the tuner offers three variations of the kit. The Vanace Type 1 features dual round headlights, similar to the EU-spec and JDM-spec VW T3. The Vanace Type 2 adds quad headlights and black rocker panels, inspired by the South African models. Finally, the Vanace Type 3 boasts dual square headlights, mirroring the North American specification of the VW.\n\nThe Vanace (above) compared to the original VW Transporter T3 (below).\n\nWhile the profile and rear end are carried over from the Toyota HiAce donor vehicle, the new face significantly alters the model\u2019s appearance. Additionally, buyers can choose from 10 paint options, including gunmetal, beige, and an optional two-tone treatment. The pictured examples also feature chrome hubcaps on steel wheels, adding even more classic charm to the build.\n\nMore: Toyota Hiace Reverse Restomod By FlexDream Makes Us Want To Move To Japan\n\nInside, the van features retro-inspired seat covers with a lattice pattern, available in blue, green, and beige. It also boasts a vintage steering wheel with a three-spoke design and a wooden rim. More demanding customers can opt for solid wood paneling on the floor and ceiling of the cargo compartment, along with LED interior lighting. This setup provides an ideal base for camper conversions, especially when paired with the optional rooftop tent from Australian company Darchi.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost?\n\nAccording to AMJ\u2019s website, the starting price for a Vanace T3 ranges from \u00a53.75 million to \u00a54.65 million (equal to $24,000\u201329,800 at current exchange rates), depending on the donor Toyota HiAce and the level of customization.\n\nThe original Volkswagen T3 was introduced in 1979 as the final generation of the Transporter with a cab-over design and a rear-mounted engine. It was replaced by the front-engine T4 in 1990 but still holds a cult following, particularly among camping enthusiasts who appreciate its unique packaging.\n\nVanace Type 1\n\nVanace Type 2\n\nVanace Type 3",

Indestructibility aside, Toyota knows what it has and maybe knows a little too much about its demographic. I mean, the automaker offered the pickup with a crane\u2014a crane!\u2014from the factory. And a ready-to-rock, gently-used model can be yours for just 22 grand.\n\nPreviously purchased on Bring A Trailer but now offered up on Facebook Marketplace is a 1995 Toyota Hilux SSR-X. Being sold out of Closer, New Jersey, the low-mileage four-door pickup looks practically perfect.\n\nEquipped with a turbodiesel 2.4-liter four-cylinder mated to a 4-speed automatic, the right-hand-drive JDM truck has about 130,000 miles on the odometer and a clean New Jersey title. Looks like an oil change was done recently along with some servicing on shocks, timing belt water pump, auxiliary belts, and batteries. The seller also had anti-rust Fluid Film applied to the frame and undercarriage to mitigate corrosion.\n\nOh, plus a factory-optioned bed-mounted crane. So, maybe this truck is perfect?!\n\nWhy the heck did Toyota add an electronic crane option, anyway? And for a non-commercial pickup at that? Well, no surprise, the option is also rare. The seller says there are only three such Hilux pickups in the U.S. Known as the \u201cActive Base\u201d trim (at least in 1997), a Toyota press release says, \u201cA crane is mounted on the rear for lifting sports gear such as off-road motorbikes.\u201d\n\nThere are other reasons to drive around with a crane, of course, but I\u2019ll leave that to your imagination. It\u2019s a do-anything survivalist Hilux, for goodness sake. Hoist whatever you want \u2014 as long as it\u2019s within the supposed lift capacity of up to 450 kilograms (992 pounds). Oh, and you\u2019ll likely need the included but detachable stabilizer bar to place under the left rear fender. Unless Hilux tipping is your way of bringing country life to the city.\n\nConcourse Underground\n\nNow, if you wake up one morning and aren\u2019t vibing with the exposed-crane look that day, you can simply tuck it away. The hook is hidden so flawlessly into the opposing roll bar-like quasi-C-pillars that you\u2019re unlikely to notice anything out of the ordinary until you look specifically into those attachments. Otherwise, it just looks like a tough Toyota truck.\n\nThe seller also claims that the Hilux is rust-free, perhaps referring strictly to the underbody. In the old BaT listing, there is rust surrounding the crane\u2019s joints, rear bar, and along the front side of the bed where it meets the cabin. The images included in the current FB listing do provide a closeup of those vehicle sections.\n\nPatrick Brian McCaffrey via Facebook Marketplace\n\nThe crane-equipped Hilux sold for $20,500 a year ago, but the seller says the total price came out to $24,000 after auction fees, titling, and maintenance. The seller is asking for $22,000, but a previous Marketplace listing from 38 weeks ago shows an initial price of $22,500 dropped to $20,000.\n\nObviously, the truck wasn\u2019t sold, and considering this is its second appearance in Marketplace (there could be for-sale listings elsewhere), maybe there\u2019s some buyer\u2019s remorse going on here. Nevertheless, I don\u2019t believe the listed price is non-negotiable, so feel free to OBO.\n\nSeen any other wild factory accessories like this? Share them with us at tips@thedrive.com!",

Toyota\u2019s 2025 campaign aims to reinforce its emotional connection with Black men by spotlighting mobility as a transformative influence in their daily lives.\n\nThe aim of \u201cYou Can\u2019t Stop My Drive\u201d is to help reshape public perceptions of Toyota among Black males.

            "content": "Even if you are only just getting really into trucks and SUVs, you\u2019re more than likely familiar with Arctic Trucks. They are the mad minds behind the arctic adventure bright red Toyota Hi-Lux trucks made famous by Top Gear and its trio of hosts. You might have at least seen the memes and GIFs while trolling the internet. Now, the brand has reached back not only into its history but also Toyota\u2019s by modifying a brand-new Land Cruiser to create the AT37.\n\nThe name gives thanks to the Land Cruiser's use of 37-inch diameter BFGoodrich tires, shod in either All-Terrain T/A KO3s or the Mud-Terrain T/A KM3s when more off-road grip is needed. These 37x12.50R17 tires are wrapped in a set of Arctic Trucks Heritage wheels, forged aluminum pieces that feature dual valve stems and are finished in satin black. You\u2019re also able to adjust the tire inflation via Arctic Trucks' central inflation system. Additionally, the speedometer, TPMS, and Toyota Safety Sense (TSS) systems are recalibrated for the larger diameter tires.\n\nTo fit these massive tires the body, chassis, and suspension needed massaging and changes from stock. First, the frame is altered to help clear the much wider than stock tires, and new suspension components that increase ground clearance by about 1.5-inches and offer increased the travel are added in, which helps with the ride while driving in the most remote places in the world. A major upgrade, however, is the R53 Suspension with a set of monotube dampers and matched springs. These coilovers and dampers also feature two-way damping adjustment for a customized ride experience for the taller springs.\n\nThe body of the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser is re-engineered for the wider stance and increased wheel travel with a widebody setup and new fender flares. These flares also help remind owners of the proper tire pressures with a guide molded into them at all four corners. They also offer a recess for the central tire inflation system connection. Also fashioned to fit these new flares are a set of mud guards that feature the \u201cArctic Trucks\u201d logo.\n\nTo make hopping into the Arctic Trucks modified Land Cruiser easier, a pair of side steps are installed. They are made of extruded aluminum and rubberized inserts help keep your grip in slick environments. Out back, the Arctic Trucks team was able to build in a discrete two-inch receiver hitch that provides more than just a towing point. Thanks to a wide variety of receiver hitch options out there, you can mount anything from a winch to a barbecue to a gear carrier. When not in use, you\u2019re not even able to tell that it\u2019s there. The interior sees some minor work with a unique shifter, dash trim, Arctic Trucks floor mats and sill plates. Finally, the exterior features many non-functional touches with the addition of emblems with the Arctic Trucks logo and \u201cAT37\u201d badging.\n\nExpect to see the 2025 Arctic Trucks Toyota Land Cruiser AT37 by the second quarter of 2025. Official Arctic Trucks dealerships will offer complete versions or offer customers conversions of their existing Land Cruisers, including here in the U.S., but pricing hasn\u2019t been announced.

The result is the AT37, which aims to combine \u201cinspiring on-road handling with superior clearance, comfort, control and mobility over all terrains.\u201d\n\nLooking discreet but rugged, the model has been equipped with a ten-piece widebody kit that includes new bumpers and extended fender flares. They\u2019re joined by aluminum side steps, mud guards, and a hidden receiver hitch.\n\nMore: Toyota Made A New Land Cruiser Pickup And A 2-Door 2025 4Runner For SEMA\n\nHowever, eyes are naturally drawn to the lifted suspension and massive tires. Starting with the former, the model sits 1.6 inches (40 mm) higher thanks to a two-way adjustable suspension that features new springs, coilovers, and dampers.\n\nThey\u2019re accompanied by 17-inch forged alloy wheels that have a satin black finish as well as a dual-valve design, which allows owners to easily monitor and modulate tire pressure. Speaking of the latter, the model rides on 37-inch BFGoodrich tires which are available in all-terrain or mud-terrain guise.\n\nIn order to accommodate the massive tires, Arctic Trucks did a complete \u201creprofiling [of] the Land Cruiser\u2019s frame, body, bodywork and drivetrain.\u201d The company didn\u2019t go into many specifics, but confirmed the model has a wider track as well as an extended wheelbase thanks to a relocated rear axle.\n\nThe upgrades continue inside with unique trim and a special gear selector. The company also added branded door sill plates and floor mats.\n\nThere\u2019s no word on how much the transformation cost, but the package will be available in the second quarter.

            "content": "In a world where many midsize SUVs tend to blend together, two that stand out as something a little different are the 2025 Subaru Outback and the 2025 Toyota Crown Signia. The scrappy Outback has been around since the \u201990s as a capable alternative to truck-based SUVs, while the Crown Signia is an all-new model offering hybrid efficiency and near-luxury accommodations.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at these midsize SUVs and see which is right for you.\n\n2025 Subaru Outback\n\nYou could say that the Subaru Outback is in a class of its own as the only midsize wagon from a non-luxury car brand. However, Subaru calls it a midsize SUV, so we\u2019ll go along with that classification. Whatever you want to call it, it\u2019s roomy and rugged and comes with all of the charm we love about the Subaru brand. Pricing starts at $30,340.\n\nSubaru Outback Highlights\n\nRugged off-roader: The X-Mode system and the Wilderness trim make the Subaru Outback the more capable off-roader of these two SUVs. The Wilderness model boasts extra ground clearance, all-terrain tires, and skid plates, allowing it to go on adventures that the Crown Signia can\u2019t.\n\nBigger interior: The Subaru Outback has a little more rear legroom and much more cargo space than the Toyota Crown Signia. Whether you\u2019re using it to haul kids or kayaks, you\u2019ll appreciate the extra room in the Outback.\n\nBudget-friendly: Although the hybrid Crown Signia has lower fuel costs, the Subaru Outback is considerably a more affordable car. In fact, even the top Touring XT trim of the Outback is priced a little below the Crown Signia\u2019s starting price. The price tag alone arguably makes the Outback more appealing.\n\nRead our Subaru Outback Expert Review or see 2025 Subaru Outback models for sale near you.\n\n2025 Toyota Crown Signia\n\nThe Toyota Crown Signia is a compelling new hybrid from Toyota. It\u2019s a midsize 2-row SUV with standard all-wheel drive (AWD) and an upscale interior that\u2019s fancier and more high-tech than you might expect from a mainstream brand. It might seem pricey for a Toyota, but it\u2019s a bargain compared to a similar luxury SUV. Pricing starts at $44,985.\n\nToyota Crown Signia Highlights\n\nHybrid efficiency: Every Toyota Crown Signia is a hybrid, while the 2025 Subaru Outback has no hybrid option. The Crown Signia achieves up to 38 mpg in mixed driving, while the most efficient Outback gets 28 mpg. According to the EPA\u2019s estimate, that translates to $400 in annual fuel savings.\n\nPremium interior: A Lexus badge on the steering wheel wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the Crown Signia\u2019s upscale cabin. Even in its base XLE trim, the Toyota Crown Signia is loaded with standard features like heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, and a 12.3-inch touchscreen display. The Limited trim is even nicer with a panoramic sunroof and JBL audio.\n\nStronger base powertrain: The standard hybrid powertrain in the Toyota Crown Signia produces 240 horsepower, which is a pretty significant boost over the Subaru Outback\u2019s 182-hp base engine. More power, better fuel economy, no compromise.\n\nRead our Toyota Crown Signia Expert Review or see 2025 Toyota Crown Signia models for sale near you.\n\nSimilarities\n\nPerhaps the biggest similarity between the Subaru Outback and Toyota Crown Signia is that each ride on standard all-wheel drive. Both are technically midsize 2-row SUVs, but the Outback has more wagonlike proportions.\n\nPricing\n\nThe Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price for any individual used vehicle can vary greatly according to mileage, condition, location, and other factors. The prices here reflect what buyers are currently paying for New 2025 Subaru Outback vehicles and New 2025 Toyota Crown Signia vehicles in typical condition when purchasing from a dealership. These prices are updated weekly. The manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP) quoted includes the destination fee, but does not include tax, license, document fees, and options.\n\nSpecifications\n\n2025 Subaru Outback 2025 Toyota Crown Signia Popular Powertrains Engine 2.5-liter 4-cylinder 2.5-liter 4-cylinder hybrid Horsepower 182 hp @ 5,800 rpm 240 hp @ 6,000 rpm Torque 176 lb-ft @ 4,400 rpm 178 lb-ft @ 4,300 rpm Transmission CVT, AWD CVT, AWD Fuel Economy 26 city/32 highway/28 combined mpg 39 city/37 highway/38 combined mpg Also Available 2.4-liter turbo 4-cylinder Specs Basic Warranty 3 years/36,000 miles 3 years/36,000 miles Powertrain Warranty 5 years/60,000 miles 5 years/60,000 miles NHTSA Overall Safety 5 stars Not rated Max Seating Capacity 5 5 Wheelbase 108.1 inches 112.2 inches Overall Length 191.9 inches 194.1 inches Width 74.2 inches 74.0 inches Height 66.1 inches 64.0 inches Turning Diameter 36.1 feet 39.5 feet Headroom, Front 40.1 inches 37.7 inches Headroom, Rear 39.1 inches 39.1 inches Legroom, Front 42.8 inches 42.1 inches Legroom, Rear 39.5 inches 37.1 inches Shoulder Room, Front 58.1 inches 57.0 inches Shoulder Room, Rear 57.4 inches 55.0 inches Cargo Volume 32.6/75.6 cubic feet 25.8/68.8 cubic feet\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough these midsize SUVs compete in the same class, their skill sets are quite different. The Subaru Outback is the more value-conscious option, with a lower price tag and more interior space. We also like that it has more variety in its model range, while the Toyota only has two trims.\n\nThe Toyota Crown Signia is the more premium option, with its fancier interior and a generous list of standard features. The satisfying and efficient hybrid powertrain is a perk that you can\u2019t get in the Subaru, but the Toyota is also quite a bit pricier.\n\nWith those strengths in mind, the right SUV for you depends on your budget and whether you\u2019re more of a mountain biker (Outback) or a golfer (Crown Signia).",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nAre you waiting for the 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander?\n\nThe Toyota Grand Highlander, which has a stop sale, was a significant disruption for Toyota dealers.\n\nAccording to a report from Automotive News, Russ Humberston Jr. is just taking over as chair of the Toyota National Dealer Advisory Council, and he's already in the thick of some of the industry's and the brand's most significant concerns.\n\nHumberston, who owns two Toyota stores \u2014 Beaverton Toyota and Albany Toyota near Portland, OR, spoke with Automotive News staff reporter Larry P. Vellequette. Here are edited excerpts when asked about the Toyota Grand Highlander stop sale.\n\nThe 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander Recall: What customers need to know.\n\nIn September 2024, Toyota issued a recall notice for the Grand Highlander, and the model was taken off dealership floors for months while a fix was developed for a defective front curtain shield airbag.\n\nThe NHTSA said the front curtain shield airbags did not remain fully inside the vehicle if they deployed when the front windows were rolled down. This led to Toyota issuing a stop sale notice to its dealerships in June 2024.\n\nSome 111,000 2024 Grand Highlander and Grand Highlander Hybrid produced between June 2023 and June 2024 were recalled. The issue was detected, and Toyota implemented a fix.\n\nA Reddit commentor dgbrown said, It's no longer on stop sale. Production resumes on October 21. Most allocations are already reserved at dealers. And you'd be looking at a 2025, I've been told.\n\nI checked the Toyota website, and the 2025 Grand Highlander and 2025 Grand Highlander Hybrid models are available nationwide.\n\nWhen asked by Automotive News, \"How did the Grand Highlander stop sale play out at your dealerships in terms of your customers?\" Here was Russ Humberston Jr.'s reply.\n\n\"We all know how recalls go in general. On the one hand, I understand why they have to be done the way that they have to be done, according to the way NHTSA requires it, but that process inherently causes customer confusion and a lot of emotions.\"\n\nAccording to Humberston, \"It's never a good customer experience when there's a stop-sale. The dealers, the manufacturers, they've all gotten better. But there are times that the whole world knows about the recalls before the dealers even know.\"\n\n\"Toyota had approached the dealer council to give us a heads-up that this might be coming, so kudos to Toyota for doing that.\"\n\n\"In general, it was done as well as it could be, but it was still really frustrating for our customers. Grand Highlander is one of our most popular vehicles \u2014 it was a Toyota in that large SUV segment.\"\n\n\"We never had a lot of availability of them, but if we could have gotten them, they could have been our number two selling vehicle, behind RAV4. It was extremely popular, so it was tough on our customers and tough on our salespeople. We did have some customers move on to other vehicles, and we had some that waited it out.\"\n\n\"It's one of the great benefits of being a Toyota dealer, the depth and breadth of the product, so even when we didn't have Grand Highlander, we still had other products for customers to consider purchasing,\" he concluded.\n\nWhat about the Grand Highlander's IIHS crash test rating?\n\nA recent Reddit user said this about the Grand Highlander's IIHS crash scores. This customer was ready to buy the Grand Highlander until they saw the IIHS scores.\n\n\"My wife and I recently test-drove the Grand Highlander Hybrid Limited and were more than impressed. We test-drove multiple other mid-size SUVs, including the Grand Cherokee L, Hyundai Palisade, and Kia Telluride, and the Grand Highlander is in a league of its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exterior design, interior features (heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, wireless phone charging), ride quality, noise-reducing glass, 34 MPG, and 600+ mile range all exceeded our expectations. And the fact that Toyota's hybrid powertrain is considered the most reliable and long-lasting was huge \u2013 whether we drive it for 200K+ miles or sell it in 3 years, it'll retain its value compared to other mid-sized SUVs. We were genuinely excited to hand over $55-60K for the privilege of driving this vehicle every day.\"\n\n\"However, after seeing the Grand Highlander's IIHS crash test rating, our enthusiasm vanished. While we understand that IIHS is regularly updating their test criteria (moving the goal post), and this vehicle is undoubtedly safer than anything from a decade ago, failing to achieve a \"Good\" rating in a small overlap crash test was a deal-breaker.\"\n\n\"Mid-size SUVs are marketed as family vehicles, and anything short of a perfect score (in the crash tests) should give you pause. I really hope Toyota can address these issues with the 2025 model and achieve an IIHS Top Safety Pick. This vehicle is damn near perfect and has the potential to become one of the most popular mid-size SUVs on the road.\"\n\nHas the 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander improved its IIHS safety rating?\n\nThe 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander has the same score as the 2024 model year and did not achieve an IIHS Top Safety Pick.\n\nConclusion.\n\nFor those considering the Toyota Grand Highlander, it's back in production, the defective airbag has been fixed, and Toyota dealers have models in inventory. However, the SUV underperforms in the latest IIHS crash scores. Will it keep buyers away?\n\nIt's Your Turn.\n\nAre you looking to purchase a 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander, and will its safety rating affect your decision?

            "content": "Toyota killed the Yaris hatchback and sedan in the United States following the 2020 model year. However, the subcompact model received a fourth generation in other markets, complete with a high-performance version from Gazoo Racing. In addition, a Yaris Cross joined the lineup, and Mazda slapped its badge again for a new Mazda2 hybrid. You can't have any of these cars in the US, but dealers are asking Toyota for the Yaris nameplate to return.\n\nThe new boss of the Toyota National Dealer Advisory Council, Russ Humberston Jr., told Automotive News he knows a \"lot of dealers\" interested in selling the Yaris in America again. However, it's not easy to make it happen. The entry-level model was discontinued because the new-generation car would've been too expensive after spending money to engineer the diminutive hatchback to comply with safety and emissions regulations. A new Yaris would've been priced similarly to the car from a segment above, the Corolla, which starts at $23,460 for the 2025 model year.\n\nWhen the old Yaris died in the US a few years ago, Toyota thought it could sell more Corollas to compensate for the smaller car's demise. However, Humberston said that didn't happen. In 2024, demand was almost flat, with shipments increasing by only 0.2 percent to 232,908 units. This was enough for the Corolla to be the 11th best-selling car in America, right behind the segment-rivaling Honda Civic.\n\nHumberston said he \"would definitely consider\" the Yaris' return, adding that a cheaper car to slot underneath the Corolla \"could work again\" since Toyota is aware there's untapped demand in this segment in America. With the Mitsubishi Mirage now dead in the US, the Yaris could indirectly replace it. The Nissan Versa is the only new car that starts at under $20,000.\n\nConsidering this Yaris has already been around for about five years, with a facelift launched in 2024, it's likely too late for the current model to receive a US visa. We're all for having cheaper cars in the US, especially a small hatchback. However, if Toyota does decide to bring back the Yaris, we won't be too surprised if it prefers to sell something along the lines of the Yaris Cross to fight the Chevy Trax, Nissan Kicks, VW Taos, and the other subcompact crossovers.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nSource: Automotive News\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Toyota still makes a lot of models that are relatively affordable. Out of all the vehicles in its lineup, eight of them have starting prices (excluding destination charges) under $30,000. Much like nearly every automaker these days, Toyota doesn't have any truly small cars to sell anymore, but that may change in the near future if Toyota's dealers get their way.\n\nRuss Humberston Jr., the new chair of Toyota's dealer council, recently sat down for an interview with Automotive News in which he discussed problems like the struggle Toyota dealers will face in the coming years as more stringent emissions requirements come into effect in some states. Auto News asked Humberston what he thinks will happen with automotive affordability this year as interest rates and average vehicle prices keep rising, and Humberston said he has a concern about Toyota's ability to meet the affordability challenge. That's when Auto News asked him if he'd bring the Yaris back. Said Humberston:\n\nThat's interesting. I would definitely consider it. The challenge with that vehicle was making it compliant for safety and emissions in the United States that it made it so expensive it was bumping up against Corolla, and it's obviously not even close to a Corolla. Toyota's answer was that it would just make more Corollas, but that changed as well. We aren't seeing more Corollas, so maybe something like Yaris could work again. I know a lot of dealers would like to see a subcompact hatchback again to address affordability as well as to have a product in a segment that we know has demand.\n\nToyota axed the Yaris from its U.S. lineup after the 2020 model year. The company's reasoning? Homologation regulations and declining sales. It was one of the cheapest cars on the market at the time, with a starting price of just over $15,000, but Toyota sold just under 27,000 Yaris' in 2018, and by 2019 sales had fallen by another 5,000 units. Toyota abandoned the segment, effectively pushing the brand's price of entry to nearly $20,000, which was the starting price of the Corolla at the time. Since then, the Yaris got a new generation in other markets and its lineup expanded to include variants like the Yaris Cross small crossover and the GR Yaris hot hatch. Meanwhile, Toyota offers nothing smaller than the Corolla here in the U.S.\n\nWhile Humberston's comments about a possible return of the Yaris might give hope to some who want something from Toyota that's cheaper than a Corolla, I wouldn't get too excited. The return of the Yaris would be complicated. Those homologation concerns are legit; if the Yaris did come back, at least in its current form, it likely wouldn't be as cheap as it was before, probably costing basically as much as a Corolla. The current generation Yaris costs as much as Prius in the U.K., for instance. If the Yaris does come back, hopefully Toyota gets it right.",

            "content": "A new Toyota Wildlander is rumored to debut at the Shanghai Auto Show in April.\n\nA twin model to the RAV4, the Wildlander is manufactured in China by GAC-Toyota.\n\nThe new generation is expected to mirror the upgrades in the upcoming RAV4.\n\nLast month, spy shots surfaced showing what\u2019s believed to be a prototype of the much-anticipated 2026 Toyota RAV4. And now, a new report has added fuel to the fire, suggesting that its Chinese counterpart, the Wildlander, will make its debut at the Shanghai Auto Show this April. If this timeline holds, it could signal the debut of the original RAV4 isn\u2019t far behind.\n\nThe Toyota Wildlander was introduced in late 2019 and went on sale in China in early 2020. The SUV shares its underpinnings, interior, and most of the exterior body panels with the RAV4, albeit with a redesigned front end and unique taillights. The Wildander is produced by GAC-Toyota, while the RAV4 is made from FAW-Toyota.\n\nMore: Toyota RAV4 Goes AWD-Only In Japan With Minor Tweaks For 2025\n\nWhile 2025 could be the right time for a facelift, the Shanghai Auto Show is rumored to host the debut of a next-generation model. This is expected to mirror the changes on the upcoming RAV4, which will reportedly ride on a further developed version of the TNGA-K platform.\n\nThe RAV4 and the Wildlander will likely gain a more efficient self-charging hybrid powertrain, alongside ICE and PHEV options. Furthermore, it has been reported that Chinese buyers might get access to a second and more affordable hybrid setup, using the smaller 2.0-liter engine as a base, instead of the 2.5-liter mill.\n\nToyota Wildlander\n\nGAC-Toyota\n\nThe bodywork of the Wildlander will be fully redesigned compared to the outgoing model, although it is not clear how different it will look from the next-gen RAV4. As for the interior, the Wildlander will gain the latest tech features, likely including a new digital cockpit with dual 12.3-inch displays, and a more modern design for the dashboard.\n\nWhat is not clear is whether the 2026 Toyota RAV4 will be introduced prior to the debut of the next-gen Wildlander, or follow a bit later. In any case, both SUVs will be renewed in 2025, sharing a great deal of components. This means that whichever comes first will give us plenty of information about its twin.\n\nReview: Suzuki Across PHEV Is The Neglected RAV4 Twin Blessed With All The Virtues Of The Original\n\nInterestingly, the Wildlander and the RAV4 have another sister model, the Suzuki Across which is available in Europe. The rebadged SUV shares the headlight design with the Chinese model, but sports a unique front bumper and borrows the rear-end design from the RAV4, albeit with Suzuki badges. While we don\u2019t have information about the future of the Suzuki Across, there is a chance it won\u2019t follow the Toyota siblings into the new generation.\n\nToyota RAV4 Spy Shots",

That's not tremendous growth, but the continued evolution of the automotive market ensures that there will be plenty of fireworks as leading companies fight for market share.\n\n\n\nThe following seven stocks are market leaders in various ways, and all have something different to offer. Some are ambitiously pursuing electric vehicles, and others are relying on legacy vehicles like high-end pickups and SUVs to drive rich margins.\n\nIf you're looking for top car stocks to buy in 2025, this list is a who's who of the global automotive market:\n\n\n\nToyota Motor Corp . (TM)\n\nMarket value: $244 billion\n\nWhen it comes to global scale, Japanese automaker Toyota is at the top of the list with more than 10 million vehicles sold last year under its namesake brand along with subsidiaries such as Lexus. That includes more than 2.3 million vehicles in North America, up about 4% over the prior year.\n\nToyota's decision to lean more heavily on its hybrid models instead of electric-only vehicles has let it capitalize on the growing demand for plug-in hybrids in light of the range anxiety some customers have with pure EVs. With more than $300 billion in annual revenue and a dominant position worldwide, Toyota is the natural choice for any investors looking for the best car stocks to buy now.\n\nVolkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY)\n\nMarket value: $51 billion\n\nVolkswagen is another leading car stock that has a wide footprint and an attractive product mix, including its Audi luxury line. It delivered roughly 9 million total vehicles last year, and it also tops $300 billion in annual sales across all markets. It has a strong market presence in China, delivering more than 2.9 million vehicles there in 2024 to make it the second-largest market for this automaker.\n\nVW is charging ahead with plans to fully electrify its fleet by 2030 in an ambitious bid to cash in on the next generation of vehicles, and it continues to provide stiff competition in the EV market. In 2024, it delivered about 745,000 electric vehicles \u2013 putting it well ahead of upstarts that are only producing a small run of vehicles in limited markets.\n\nStellantis NV (STLA)\n\nMarket value: $38 billion\n\nMultinational auto manufacturing conglomerate Stellantis was formed via the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and French brand PSA Group, bringing together a wide array of nameplates, including North American leaders Dodge, Ram, Chrysler and Jeep and European icons Maserati, Citroen, Peugeot and Fiat. The combined company is now large enough to go toe-to-toe with other massive automakers to stay relevant in an evolving marketplace.\n\nA series of management missteps resulted in the departure of former CEO Carlos Tavares last year and a series of changes to jump-start sales, including reinvigorating well-known brands by getting back to basics and offering models at more affordable price points. With projections of a return to growth in 2025 and analyst price targets that are about 40% higher than current values, STLA may be a turnaround stock to watch.\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors Co. (GM)\n\nMarket value: $59 billion\n\nSpeaking of an automotive turnaround stock, General Motors has been winning over investors lately with a significant run of about 50% over the last 12 months. That's in large part because GM has been making slow but steady improvements, which resulted in a final tally of 2.7 million vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2024 \u2013 a 4% bump over 2023 and its best year-over-year sales increase since 2019.\n\nWhether it's high-margin best-sellers like its Silverado pickup or Cadillac Escalade SUV or its affordable Trax crossover vehicle and up-and-coming Bolt EV line, the company has been shrewd about changes to its fleet that have allowed it to continue to connect with customers. Vehicle deliveries in China are growing and hit about 1.8 million last year. The company remains a dominant brand in the lucrative North American market and looks like it will stay relevant for some time based on its comparatively strong growth versus its peers in 2024.\n\n\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

(F)\n\nMarket value: $40 billion\n\nSpeaking of competitors GM has shouldered out of the way, Ford stock took a tumble of more than 15% across just a few days last summer after missing earnings targets amid quality issues and stiff competition, particularly in its electric vehicle business. Of course, Ford's F-Series pickup line has long been America's best-selling vehicle \u2013 so this is definitely not a company circling the drain, particularly given the big margins on high-end trucks.\n\nWhat's more, it offers a 6% dividend yield and trades for just under 25% of next year's revenue while many EV upstarts trade for multiples of their forward sales predictions. This automaker isn't a slam dunk by any stretch, but with more than a century of operating history and an iconic brand, Ford could be a bargain car stock worth a look.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nMarket value: $1.3 trillion\n\nMany investors find it hard to look past the behavior of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, but if you put aside Musk's antics, it's undeniable that Tesla remains the dominant EV manufacturer in the world. It delivered just shy of 1.8 million vehicles in 2024, thanks to its first-mover power in the electric vehicle marketplace, and remains the leading brand in most markets.\n\nWhat's more, after strong momentum after Election Day, there are hopes that Tesla will continue to benefit both at home and abroad. Shares just hit a new 52-week high recently, and are up about 1,000% in the last five years to prove there is still plenty of growth potential ahead for this leading auto stock.\n\nLi Auto Inc. (LI)\n\nMarket value: $25 billion\n\nGiven the talk of global trade wars, it may be difficult to bet on any of these multinational players without fully understanding how a shifting policy environment could impact their supply chains or profitability. Li Auto, on the other hand, is a company that's laser focused on premium electric vehicles in China. This one-two punch of EV opportunity and Chinese market expansion is what all global automakers are after, so why not just go with a home-grown company tapping into that marketplace?",

Dahl and Ruth Johnson Dahl. He graduated from Highland High School in 1966. He served an LDS mission in Scotland in 1967-1969. He started his Toyota journey at Wagstaff Toyota while he was a sophomore in High School and then again when he was 25 years old. He attended BYU and the University of Utah. He married JoAnn Morley, his sweetheart in 1977 where they moved to Logan Utah, and he started working for Dahle's Toyota. They raised three beautiful daughters in a home they built together in Smithfield, Utah. Dad then continued working for Watson Toyota and then Ensign Toyota where he retired in 2013. He may have been a car guy, but he was the best girl dad ever. He taught us the value of hard work and how important family is. He was always present cheering us on. He was one of a kind and everyone around him enjoyed his presence and his sense of humor. Dad enjoyed golfing and keeping an immaculate yard and garden. He also enjoyed cooking and grilling along with skiing and writing short stories and poems (which we will treasure forever.) He enjoyed being outdoors and small family vacations up to \"Jellystone.\" Dad was such a great bedtime storyteller whether it was in the house or camping out in the backyard around the firepit. He said he is always so proud of his girls and grandkids and some of his greatest joys came from their accomplishments and successes. Dad was an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He served many callings, but favorite was teaching the young men and young women in Sunday School.\n\nHe is survived by his wife JoAnn and his three children, Mindi (Justin) of Hyrum, Utah; Jenny (Porter) of Cub River, Idaho; Cindy (Garrett) of Spokane, Washington, and nine grandchildren he is survived by his Sister Carolyn and Brother Brian. He was preceded in death by his parents, sister Laurie and grandparents.\n\nWe miss you so much dad and you will live in our hearts until we meet again. Dad's wishes were to be cremated which are being done by Allen-Hall Mortuary. A celebration of life will be held on Saturday, March 8 at 12:00 pm at the Logan River Golf Course. Our family would like to thank CNS Hospice especially his nurse Robert, CNA Mike, also Sammie and Dan for their loving care.",

But it did so without sacrificing its off-road chops, making for a fantastic blend of trucky utility and the luxed-up amenities you'd expect from a Lexus. Yes, it shares its bones with the Toyota Land Cruiser, but undoubtedly, the GX has its own identity. There's also a big upgrade under the hood, and the 3.4-liter turbocharged V6 paired with a new 10-speed transmission is leaps and bounds more lively and powerful than the old V8 without being nearly as thirsty.\n\nWhat stood out?\n\nIf you feel like automakers are bringing boxy back, you're not alone. The Lexus GX's distinctive design evokes what we've long loved about other off-road-oriented SUVs like the Land Rover Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz G-wagen and Jeep Wrangler. The GX is plenty capable off-road and now brings the style, inside and out, to match its capability.",

            "content": "Folks, this might be the first time in history that a brand-new car has been discounted 70 percent, and it's still not worth it. Of course, it takes a very special vehicle to achieve something like this. Enter the 2024 Toyota Mirai. On the face of it, this seems like a great deal. I mean, hydrogen is cool, the Mirai is a really pretty car and it's not like there are a ton of options for brand-new $15,000 cars out there to begin with. The real issue with this car is that while hydrogen-fueled vehicles are neat, the infrastructure is dogshit to a degree unheard of in modern society. Because of that, you might just be paying $15,000 for a headache.\n\nAnyway, let's take a look at the deals you can get if you're brave enough to live a hydrogen lifestyle. Earlier this month, 2024 Mirai discounts in Southern California (the only place you could really conceivably own one) spiked as high as $43,000 off MSRP on Mirai Limiteds. That also comes with 0 percent APR financing for six years and $15,000 in free fuel, according to Cars Direct. XLEs also come with about $35,000 in Finance Subversion Cash, the site reports. Both these discounts represent $10,000 jumps.\n\nFinance Subvention Cash is a rebate that's only available with promotional financing. As has been the case for quite some time, that's 0% APR for 72 months. Odds are that most car buyers have never seen 0% APR plus a $43,000 discount on a car. In extreme cases, we think this could bring Mirai prices below $16,000.\n\nFor those of you keeping track at home, that makes the Mirai the cheapest theoretical car in America. Right now, that honor goes to the Nissan Versa, which starts at $18,330, including destination. Here's more from Cars Direct:\n\nThe Mirai XLE has an MSRP of $50,190. At $35,000 off, that's 70% off MSRP. In the case of the higher-end Mirai Limited version and its $67,115 retail price, it represents a 64% discount. This would bring the XLE to $15,190 and the Limited to a mere $24,115. Toyota's 0% financing deal also offers significant savings. On a $50,000 car, a 6-year loan at zero-percent APR would save nearly $11,400 before any rebates when compared to an interest rate of 7%. However, since the Mirai FCEV is only sold in California, only a small fraction of buyers will be able to take advantage of the deals.\n\nOf course, there are some massive issues to deal with when buying a Mirai: the most obvious is refueling the goddamn thing. As of 2024, there are a mere 54 retail hydrogen stations in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy, and who knows how long those will stay open now that Donald Trump is back for round II. Of those 54 stations, 53 are in California and just one is in Hawaii. It's no surprise then that Toyota sold just 499 Mirais in 2024.\n\nI suppose to own such an oddity like the Mirai for just $15,000 is a solid deal, but you've really got to ask yourself how much of a headache you're willing to deal with. You'll also have to look outside and see whether or not you're in California. That's a big part of this.",

            "content": "What? You don\u2019t recognize the Toyota 'Swagger Wagon' Sienna? That\u2019s fair, considering it\u2019s not particularly wagon-like, apart from the fact that it can feasibly haul a family and a hearty amount of supplies, nor does it appear to have a perceivable amount of swagger to justify the nickname. No, it\u2019s just Toyota\u2019s long-running minivan, now with a handful of updates to make it slightly better than last year\u2019s version. What\u2019s different about it? First, let\u2019s quickly start with what\u2019s the same, particularly with the hybrid powertrain. The Sienna continues to rock a 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired with a few electric motors to produce a total of 245hp, run through a CVT gearbox and sent to either the front or all the wheels. All trims offer AWD and those so equipped score an extra motor for the rear axle but the power output remains the same.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nTo answer the question then: not much. The biggest change Toyota can tout is the radar-based rear seat reminder is standard equipment. That plus the higher trims can now be equipped with a mini-fridge and vacuum. All new Siennas have also been upgraded with the latest version of Toyota\u2019s multimedia setup, which thankfully includes Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. Other changes include USB-C chargers making their appearance, and new touchscreens for various trims. Sounds like a party. There is little inherent excitement but we reckon there are worse places to idle away a few road hours. Though it\u2019s fairly drab to drive, the ride is at least unobtrusive regardless of where you\u2019re sitting. Easy to clean seats and the optional vacuum also makes it a bit easier to tidy up after shuttling around sloppy monsters of all ages. Whatever choices led you to start shopping for Toyota\u2019s sole minivan (on Top Gear, no less), know this: There are better alternatives that\u2019ll meet your needs. If we\u2019re staying in minivan territory, the Chrysler Pacifica remains a very strong choice from a zombie brand. It\u2019s loaded with more tech, most of which you\u2019ll actually use, its fit and finish is more upscale than the Toyota\u2019s and it drives surprisingly better than expected. Where the Toyota might have it beat is the availability of AWD along with the hybrid system. Also, though you get what you pay for, the Pacifica\u2019s not as wallet-friendly as the Sienna. Honda\u2019s Odyssey is another well-rounded choice for anyone dead set on a minivan.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nThen of course there\u2019s everything else that\u2019s out there that gets the same job done, if not more. Toyota\u2019s prodigious product line has an embarrassment of utility vehicles that overlap with its sole minivan, minus the sliding doors.\n\nSo what are the upsides, if any? Toyota\u2019s build quality, for sure. For the asking price, you\u2019re getting a minivan that will likely last beyond the childhoods of any kids being raised in it well into their formative years. The standard safety and convenience tech is a plus, and 35mpg isn\u2019t bad, especially if you do have it on the road putting in the miles year after year.\n\nWhat's the verdict? \u201c Hits its marks but doesn\u2019t do much else besides \u201d\n\nToyota\u2019s Sienna minivan upholds the conventional perception of its segment, both good and the bad. 'Bad' only in that it plays it safe, sticking to nailing the fundamentals asked from such a vehicle - successfully, we\u2019ll add - but not doing much in terms of excelling in any particular way. To that end, Toyota\u2019s on track with maintaining what makes the Sienna worth retaining in its lineup: providing cargo space and family-friendly utility while keeping it up to date in terms of tech amenities and safety features, all available for a fair price. You can also say the Sienna\u2019s got the competition beat in terms of exterior styling, though this segment\u2019s very much a pageant focused on talent far more than outward appearance. Whatever you think of the looks, don\u2019t let them fool you into thinking it\u2019s at all secretly sporty or engaging. The driver\u2019s seat is not the best seat in this house by far. All told, the Sienna meets its standards but doesn\u2019t do much else to laud it as a recommendation. Whatever 'swagger' this minivan has is wholly dependent on the owner\u2019s desire to airbrush a mural on the side in tribute of their favorite heavy metal band. Now *that* we\u2019d pay money for, Toyota.",

            "content": "Toyota, that paragon of virtue who advertises its hybrid vehicles as \u201cself charging electric cars,\u201d has gotten caught with its hand in the diesel cheating cookie jar and slapped with the second largest civil and criminal fines in EPA history \u2014 $1.6 billion in total. Here\u2019s what the EPA had to say this week about the whole sordid mess:\n\n\u201cHino Motors, Ltd,, Hino Motors Manufacturing U.S.A., Inc, and Hino Motors Sales U.S.A., (collectively, Hino) [have agreed to record criminal and civil fines] for violations related to the submission of false and fraudulent engine emission testing and fuel consumption data to regulators and the illicit smuggling of engines into the United States. These resolutions are subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. This unlawful conduct allowed Hino, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, to improperly secure approvals to import and sell, and cause to be imported and sold, more than 110,000 diesel engines in the United States from 2010 to 2022. These engines were primarily installed in heavy-duty trucks manufactured and sold by Hino nationwide.\u201d\n\nActing EPA Administrator Jane Nishida said: \u201cEPA and the American consumer rely on true and accurate data from engine manufacturers to protect our nation\u2019s air quality. Hino\u2019s actions directly undermined EPA\u2019s program to protect the public from air pollution. [\u2026] Today\u2019s criminal charges and civil settlement demonstrates EPA\u2019s commitment to hold companies like Hino Motors, Ltd. accountable for knowingly violating environmental laws and regulations that protect public health and the environment.\u201d\n\nFor more than a decade, Hino Motors, a Toyota subsidiary, submitted false testing data to meet pollution requirements and win approval to install diesel engines in heavy trucks, the New York Times reports. Data submitted by Hino also exaggerated the vehicles\u2019 fuel economy, the agency said. The criminal portion of the fine, $522 million, is the largest in an emissions case since Volkswagen agreed in 2016 to pay civil and criminal penalties totaling $15 billion to settle accusations it hid excess emissions from diesel cars it sold in the United States. The size of the penalties in the Hino case reflects \u201cthe egregiousness of the conduct and the flagrant disregard for the EPA.\u2019s certification program,\u201d the agency said. California, which has stricter emissions requirements than the federal government, will receive $237 million as its part of the settlement.\n\nHino Division Of Toyota Admits Diesel Cheating\n\nThe EPA does not have the resources to test every vehicle sold in the United States and relies on manufacturers to provide emissions data for its products. Hino\u2019s violations were discovered after the agency conducted its own checks, the agency said. In a statement, the company noted: \u201cHino voluntarily disclosed these issues to U.S. authorities in 2019 and has provided what the U.S. Department of Justice has called \u2018exemplary\u2019 cooperation with the D.O.J.\u2019s investigation. The agreements resolve all of the company\u2019s outstanding legal issues in the United States related to its legacy emissions issues.\u201d\n\nDiesel engines produce large amounts of nitrogen oxides, which are linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems, and other serious ailments, and contribute to climate change. Automakers use technology to control the pollution, but adding it to engines makes vehicles more expensive and can affect their performance. Hino\u2019s misconduct involved 110,000 motors that were imported and installed in trucks that the company sold in the United States from 2010 to 2022. As part of the settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge, Hino will be barred from importing diesel engines to the United States for five years.\n\nIt will also recall motors in trucks from the 2017 to 2019 model years and make modifications to bring them into compliance with emissions regulations. Hino also agreed to improve its internal controls to prevent future misconduct and finance programs designed to compensate for the excess pollution from its engines. For example, it will replace older diesel engines in 35 ships and train locomotives with cleaner motors. The resulting reduction in pollution will be the equivalent of taking 110,000 trucks off the road, the EPA said.\n\nAs part of the agreement with the EPA and the state of California, Hino has agreed to plead guilty to engaging in a multi-year criminal conspiracy. The plea agreement, which is subject to approval by the court, requires it to pay a criminal fine of $521.76 million, serve a five-year term of probation \u2014 during which it will be prohibited from importing any diesel engines it has manufactured into the United States \u2014 and implement a comprehensive compliance and ethics program and reporting structure. Hino has also agreed to the entry of a forfeiture money judgment against it in the amount of $1.087 billion. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Hino\u2019s future payments towards its civil settlement obligations, as well future payments as part of a civil class action settlement brought by private plaintiffs, will be credited towards its criminal forfeiture money judgment obligation.\n\nIn separate civil resolutions of environmental, customs and fuel economy claims by the federal government and the state of California, Hino will pay a civil penalty of $525 million based on its demonstrated financial condition. The global resolution includes the second largest criminal fine and fourth largest civil penalty in the history of EPA\u2019s mobile source program.\n\nOther provisions of the civil agreement include:\n\nA mitigation program, valued at $155 million, to offset excess air emissions from the violations by replacing marine and locomotive engines throughout 49 states (excluding California), including the reduction of over 41,000 tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions.\n\nA recall program, valued at $144.2 million, to modify violative engines in 2017-2019 heavy-duty trucks so they comply with U.S. and California emissions laws.\n\n$123.6 million to fund mitigation projects and enforcement costs in California.\n\n$30.3 million to resolve California False Claims Act claims.\n\nThe EPA discovered Hino\u2019s noncompliance as a result of conducting confirmatory testing of Hino\u2019s engines. On Jan. 10, EPA voided engine approvals, called \u201ccertificates of conformity,\u201d for Hino\u2019s 2010\u20132019 diesel engines for heavy-duty trucks and nonroad equipment. This is the largest voiding action ever taken by the EPA, reflecting the egregiousness of the conduct and the flagrant disregard for the EPA\u2019s certification program. That program is designed to provide a level playing field for vehicle and engine manufacturers seeking to do business in the United States.\n\nHino is not the only company to get caught lying about its diesel emissions. The biggest case so far involved Volkswagen, which paid almost $20 billion to resolve all the claims against it, but plenty of others are on the diesel cheating wall of shame as well, including Suzuki and Stellantis as well as Hyundai and Kia in Europe. Fortunately in America, corporations will have a free hand to lie, cheat, and steal once Emperor Donald The First gets done eviscerating the EPA. Go to sleep, everyone. Nothing to see here; move along.",

They offer almost minivan levels of family-friendly practicality, impressive convenience and safety technology without the bulk or fuel costs of a full-size SUV.\n\nPicking one over the other is no easy task so let\u2019s take a closer look at the Kia Telluride and Toyota Grand Highlander.\n\n2025 Kia Telluride\n\nThe Kia Telluride debuted in 2020 to plenty of acclaim. With a stylish and masculine exterior and a V6 engine putting out 291 horsepower, it gives buyers looking for room and capability an excellent starting point.\n\nPerhaps even more impressive is that you can dress this ute up, pushing it from handsome to dashing. There are 10 different trim combinations available to interested buyers, from the base model LX to the SX Prestige X-Pro. The LX comes with front-wheel drive (FWD), but for $2K, you can add all-wheel drive (AWD). Once you move into the EX X-Line, all-wheel drive is standard equipment.\n\nThe Telluride is a great place to be if you need your technology. It features five USB-C ports throughout the SUV, and new for 2025 is its Highway Driving Assist 1.5, which is standard across the portfolio. Pricing for the Telluride starts at $37,585.\n\nKia Telluride Highlights\n\nBig power: The Kia Telluride features a 291-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. That kind of power helps when tooling around town or trying to get out of town. It\u2019s also more than you can get in the Grand Highlander.\n\nMoney well spent: The Telluride won the KBB Best Resale Value award for its class in 2022. It finished just behind its sibling, the Hyundai Palisade, in 2023. A trend you can expect to continue in the years ahead.\n\nSafe space: The Telluride can carry up to eight people, so it\u2019s important to know it\u2019s a safe vehicle. It features a 5-star overall rating from NHTSA and the Top Safety Pick+ award from IIHS.\n\nRead our Kia Telluride Expert Review or see 2025 Kia Telluride models for sale near you.\n\n2025 Toyota Grand Highlander\n\nThe Toyota Grand Highlander takes everything we love about the regular Highlander and makes it more Grand. The main difference is that the Grand Highlander is bigger, yielding quite a bit more interior space while retaining the safety, reliability, and resale value Toyota is famous for.\n\nNew for 2025 is the entry-level LE trim. It replaces the two second-row Captain\u2019s chairs with a bench seat. It\u2019s less impressive, but does allow seating for eight instead of just seven. The company offers a Nightshade Edition with a blacked-out grille and complementary exterior trim pieces. Pricing starts at $42,310.\n\nToyota Grand Highlander Highlights\n\nBigger interior: Three more inches of third-row legroom and 10 more cubic feet of maximum cargo space make the Toyota Grand Highlander considerably roomier than the Kia Telluride. Choose the Toyota, and your passengers will thank you.\n\nMore efficient: The Toyota Grand Highlander has two optional hybrid powertrains, and the most efficient version gets up to 36 mpg combined. But even the non-hybrid Grand Highlander is more efficient than the V6-powered Kia Telluride. More interior space and better fuel economy is a one-two punch for the Toyota.\n\nMany standard features: Just a few of the many standard features in the Toyota Grand Highlander include a 12.3-inch infotainment display, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, SofTex seats (heated in front), an adjustable power liftgate, and the Toyota Safety Sense\n\nRead our Toyota Grand Highlander Expert Review or see 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander models for sale near you.\n\nSimilarities\n\nThey\u2019re midsize SUVs with attractive exterior styling, top safety ratings, and robust engines \u2014 a fantastic combination.\n\nPricing\n\nThe Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price for any individual used vehicle can vary greatly according to mileage, condition, location, and other factors. The prices here reflect what buyers are currently paying for New 2025 Kia Telluride vehicles and New 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander vehicles in typical condition when purchasing from a dealership.

            "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang used CES 2025 as an opportunity to highlight autonomous-vehicle tech.\n\nNvidia said its Orin chips would power Toyota's driver-assist features in a new partnership.\n\nAn analyst said the chip designer offered a \"shot in the arm\" for a floundering industry.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang says true self-driving cars require three advanced computers.\n\nThere's a computer to train the models to understand the world, a computer running simulations that allow these models to practice encountering important but unlikely scenarios, and a computer inside the car itself.\n\nNvidia has strategically embedded itself in all three key steps that could make every car a self-driving car.\n\nWhile segment leaders like Waymo and Tesla launch robotaxi fleets and allow people to scroll on X while their cars drive them to work, Nvidia approaches the market as an enabler \u2014 not a consumer brand.\n\nThe chip-design company is building upon a suite of functionalities that power a car's advanced driver-assist systems, such as automatic lane keeping and adaptive cruise control.\n\nWith its long list of heavy-hitting automotive clients, including Toyota, Uber, and Hyundai, Nvidia is positioning itself to be the self-driving-tech supplier to the automotive industry. To Huang, all these players are headed in the same direction.\n\n\"Every single car company will have to be autonomous, or you're not going to be a car company,\" Huang said at a fireside chat for financial analysts at this year's Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nHuang made autonomous-vehicle technology a centerpiece of his CES keynote speech, announcing confidently that self-driving cars aren't coming \u2014 they're already here.\n\n\"With Waymo's success and Tesla's success,\" Huang said,\" it is very, very clear autonomous vehicles have finally arrived.\"\n\nSelf-driving stops and starts\n\nDespite the recent preponderance of driverless Waymo rides, self-driving technology has been in limbo as carmakers cut costs and focus investments on more near-term technology like electric vehicles.\n\nMany traditional carmakers are rethinking expensive autonomous-tech development after decades of piecemeal progress and no clear path to profitability \u2014 ceding ground to tech-first players.\n\nWho will win the war for chips that live inside the dashboards of most cars remains an open question. But after CES, analysts are much closer to calling the race.\n\nToday's cars are chock-full of chips; most are far less complicated than the kind needed to offload driving tasks to a computer. Nvidia's competition includes other automotive-chip giants like Qualcomm and Israel's Mobileye, which develops microchips and other technologies for the automotive industry.\n\nMartin French, a managing director at the automotive consultancy Berylls, said that as AI converged with increased adoption of self-driving technology, Nvidia appeared to be taking the lead.\n\nHuang announced that Toyota, the world's largest automaker, would use Nvidia's Orin chips and automotive operating system to power its next generation of driver-assist features.\n\nOrin is Nvidia's solution for putting the computing power and intelligence of AI inside a car. The system debuted in 2019 and has since developed into a more all-encompassing solution.\n\nMercedes-Benz, China's BYD, and many luxury EV makers have also adopted Orin.\n\nMost of these aren't fully self-driving, but the long road between having cruise control and sleeping in the back seat while a car drives itself will have many stops along the way.\n\nWinning Toyota's business is a big deal. McKinsey has estimated that the assisted- and autonomous-driving market could be worth $400 billion by 2035. Nvidia forecasts a $5 billion run rate for its automotive business in fiscal 2025, a fivefold increase from 2023.\n\nNvidia said it was also joining forces with the trucking startup Aurora Innovation and the automotive supplier Continental to deploy self-driving trucks \u2014 an announcement that sent Aurora's stock soaring.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBeyond the data center\n\nTesla's self-driving technology, which Huang frequently lauds, is trained on Nvidia GPUs. But the chips that make Tesla's Full Self-Driving run are designed in-house and manufactured by Samsung.\n\nAs far back as 2019, Tesla and Nvidia shared an understanding of the importance of accelerated computing. But they've been on-and-off partners. Today the partnership is very much on, with Huang and Tesla CEO Elon Musk regularly trading praise.\n\nCementing relationships with Toyota, Tesla, and Aurora puts Nvidia in a good position to be the primary supplier of self-driving technology to the automotive industry.\n\nFew companies can provide chips for cars and the chips to train the AI needed for self-driving capabilities.\n\nThough Huang's two-hour CES keynote presentation spanned humanoid robots to AI laptops, PhillipCapital analysts said Nvidia's automotive offering was the \"most significant\" revelation. Averaging less than 2% of total revenue in the first three quarters of 2024, Nvidia's automotive business still pales in comparison to its data-center business.\n\nOn the company's earnings call last February, its chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said $1 billion of the firm's data-center revenue, which is reported separately from the automotive-chip business, was attributable to automotive customers.\n\n\"They are absolutely positioning themselves as the leader for autonomous technologies, period,\" French said.\n\nA 'shot in the arm' for self-driving\n\nIn recent years, major car companies have abandoned expensive self-driving-car projects to focus on electric vehicles.\n\nFord and Volkswagen pulled funding from the now defunct self-driving startup Argo AI in 2022, while GM said at the end of 2024 that it would end its Cruise division's robotaxi development.\n\n\"We've had a lot of bad news around self-driving tech in the past few years \u2014 it's been quite downbeat,\" French said. \"Nvidia has reversed that and just gave autonomous driving an absolute shot in the arm.\"\n\nFrench said investors were growing impatient with the drag on car companies' profits and lacked faith in legacy automakers' ability to develop software. What it took to get investors back on board with self-driving tech was hearing it from a tech company.\n\n\"For Jensen \u2014 one of the leading people in tech \u2014 to get up onstage and tell everyone autonomous driving is here and robotics are just around the corner holds a lot of weight with investors,\" French said.\n\nHuang is known to have an appetite for market-making \u2014 frequently saying he looks for \"zero-billion-dollar markets\" to simultaneously create and conquer. French said the AV market could still yet be won by one company.\n\nIn a complex regulatory environment, the automotive industry often strives to find a single standard to follow on new tech. That usually creates a period of stiff competition as companies vie to develop the winning technology.\n\nTake electric-vehicle charging, for example. For years the industry couldn't agree on a single charger type, leading to mismatched plugs and ports for EV drivers searching for juice. But in 2023 it coalesced around the North American Charging Standard chargers that Tesla used.\n\nSince AI has closed the technological space between self-driving cars and robotics, the auto industry is about to find out what it's like to be part of Nvidia's next zero-billion-dollar market.",

            "content": "NEW ORLEANS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kerrigan Advisors, the premier sell-side advisor and thought partner to auto dealers nationwide, represented New Orleans-based Bohn Brothers Automotive Group in the sale of its Toyota of Slidell dealership to Tennessee-based Carlock Automotive. This represents the sale of the final of four dealerships in the Bohn Brothers Automotive Group, including Audi of New Orleans, Audi Lafayette, Hyundai Genesis of Metairie and Toyota of Slidell.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to announce the successful completion of the final of four transactions we have advised on for the dealership group owned by the Bohn Brothers,\u201d said Gabe Robleto, Senior Vice President of Sell-Side Advisory at Kerrigan Advisors. \u201cIt has been a privilege to work with the Bohn family throughout this process, and we deeply appreciate the trust they placed in us to help guide such an important transition. We are confident that the dealership will thrive under the leadership of Carlock Automotive. This acquisition marks an exciting new chapter for Carlock as they expand into Louisiana with their first dealership in the state. The legacy of the Bohn Brothers is in excellent hands, and we look forward to seeing the continued success of Toyota of Slidell under its new ownership.\u201d\n\nFounded by George W. Bohn in 1924, the Bohn Brothers Automotive Group opened its first store as a Ford dealership on South Broad Street in New Orleans. The third generation of the family expanded adding Toyota, Audi, Buick, Pontiac Hyundai Genesis and GMC truck dealerships. They sold those dealerships in 2000 except Toyota of Slidell, and in 2009 Donny, Scott and Van Bohn added Audi New Orleans, Audi Lafayette and Hyundai Genesis of Metairie.\n\n\u201cIt is a bittersweet moment for our family as we step away from the business after more than 100 years of serving the New Orleans community,\u201d said Donny Bohn, Co-Owner of Bohn Brothers Automotive Group. \u201cOur partnership with Gulf States Toyota since 1987 has been a cornerstone of our journey, and we are profoundly grateful for the opportunity to be part of such a storied legacy. We also want to extend our heartfelt thanks to Gabe Robleto and the entire team at Kerrigan for their extraordinary effort and commitment throughout this sales process. From identifying the ideal buyer for Toyota of Slidell to ensuring the best outcomes from every transaction, Kerrigan Advisors\u2019 professionalism, expertise, and dedication were second to none. They made a complex process feel seamless and ultimately successful.\u201d\n\nOver the course of a few months the Bohn brothers have now fully exited the dealership business with the final sale of Toyota of Slidell. Toyota of Slidell is Slidell\u2019s second highest volume dealership and is strategically located on the desirable Slidell auto row off I-10, a major East-West Interstate connecting Florida to California.\n\n\u201cWe also want to take a moment to express our deepest gratitude to our exceptional employees, whose hard work and loyalty have been the backbone of our success for generations. To the community that has supported us so steadfastly over the years, thank you for placing your trust in us and allowing us the privilege to serve you. It has been an honor to be a part of your lives, and we take immense pride in the legacy we leave behind,\u201d concluded Bohn.\n\nNew Orleans is the economic powerhouse of Louisiana, bolstered by strong economic growth projections for the next five years. This growth is driven by the presence of major corporations, renowned higher education institutions, a robust healthcare sector, and a business-friendly environment characterized by low operational costs. The city's thriving economy is complemented by a growing and diverse workforce, supported by a metropolitan population of approximately 1.2 million residents. The city is also home to several professional sports teams, providing year-round excitement for sports enthusiasts.\n\nRecognized as the most trusted brand in the 2024 Kerrigan Dealer Survey, Toyota is also a top selling brand in New Orleans with a market share exceeding US averages by 18%. Nationally, Toyota\u2019s light vehicle sales increased 4.2% in 2023, accounting for 12.3% of market share. In December 2023, the franchise had days\u2019 supply of 34, well below the US average of 70 days.\n\n\u201cToyota continues to be the most requested brand by auto dealership buyers. The OEMs measured approach to EVs, robust dealership profitability, strong product lineup and high throughput per franchise, measured by sales and units in operation, makes it very attractive to dealership buyers nationwide and particularly in the South, where Toyota commands strong market share,\u201d said Erin Kerrigan, Founder & Managing Director of Kerrigan Advisors. \u201cWe are deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with the Bohn family on this final and important transaction in the sale of their dealership and are thrilled to have found the right buyers, secured optimal values, and completed all four of the transactions seamlessly on the family\u2019s behalf.

            "content": "Pros Luxury features unavailable in any other small truck\n\nFull array of knobs and buttons\n\nFull-time 4WD excels on-road and off Cons Expensive hybrid has limited payoff\n\nFull-size pickups offer more truck for same money\n\nSteerage-class rear seats\n\nToyota could open a food truck with the variety of Tacos it sells. The fourth-generation Tacoma comes in eight flavors ranging from the basic SR to the spicy TRD Pro, with the menu largely catering to utility buyers and off-roaders. The Tacoma Limited, though, offers something different for those with expensive tastes. The top road-focused Tacoma starts at $54,020 and features standard luxuries that are unique among midsize trucks. Power running boards, a head-up display, a digital rearview mirror, and a full-time four-wheel-drive transfer case make this the Taco for buyers with sophisticated palates.\n\nYou Want That With or Without Electricity?\n\nThe Limited is offered with either a 278-hp turbocharged four-cylinder or the i-Force Max hybridized version of that engine that kicks out 326 horses. At a $3,700 premium, the hybrid powertrain isn\u2019t cheap, but it would seem to be the obvious choice for this truck. Smoother, more powerful, and 3 mpg more efficient than the pure gasser, it should make the most civilized Tacoma even more so.\n\nWhat sounds good on paper, though, is incongruently gruff from the driver\u2019s seat. There\u2019s a grittiness to the hybrid\u2019s soundtrack and a noticeable shake as the auto stop/start system refires\u2014traits that will challenge your understanding of what the words \u201cToyota hybrid\u201d mean. With the electric motor contributing up to 48 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque, the power at least pours out quickly and fluidly from a stop, creating the illusion the Tacoma is quicker than it is.\n\nThe Limited rambled to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds in Motortrend testing, which makes it one of the quickest fourth-gen Tacomas in our database, but only by a slim margin. The 5,254-pound Limited weighed some 600 pounds more than a nonhybrid TRD Sport that trailed it to 60 by just two-tenths, and from 60 to 80 mph, the less powerful gas truck actually outran the luxe hybrid. Aside from the 405-hp Ford Ranger Raptor, Toyota\u2019s gas-electric Taco is the most powerful truck in the midsize class, yet comparable versions of the Ford and the Chevrolet Colorado consistently beat it to 60 by a half a second or more. In other words, the electrified Tacoma\u2019s added power barely offsets the added weight, and there\u2019s only a clear benefit to the driving experience at low speeds.\n\nFive Driving Modes Served One Way\n\nThat\u2019s more than we can say for the electronically controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) dampers. The five on-road driving modes feel so similar, you\u2019d need an accelerometer to detect the stiffness changes. While the ride is comfortable across the board, Toyota makes no attempts to hide that you\u2019re driving a truck. There\u2019s a persistent secondary shake when the bed is unloaded, the steering is a sluggish 3.2 turns lock to lock, and the handling is inert. The Tacoma is a perfectly competent daily driver, but it never feels as settled or as tossable as a Ranger or Colorado.\n\nGiven the old-school dynamics, we were surprised the ride quality took a step backward when we hitched our test truck to a Big Tex utility trailer loaded with a Polaris RZR Pro R 4 at a combined weight of 4,680 pounds. The extra weight on the rear end calmed the secondary nervousness, but every road impact excited large, underdamped bouncing motions. It also overburdened the powertrain and confused the eight-speed transmission. Adding 600 pounds to the bed\u2014pushing the Limited to within a couple of hundred pounds of its 1,526-pound max payload\u2014did nothing to improve the truck\u2019s composure.\n\nThe Limited\u2019s full-time four-wheel drive is well suited to finding traction both on road and in the dirt. Shared with the new Toyota Land Cruiser, this is the Taco\u2019s answer to the 4Auto modes available in the Ranger, the Colorado, and the Jeep Gladiator. Those systems engage the front axle on demand based on speed, driver inputs, and wheelslip. The Tacoma Limited instead uses a lockable Torsen-style center differential that splits torque front and rear by default and jockeys it fore and aft based on the available grip at each end.\n\nThe mode selector\u2014cryptically labeled L4L, H4L, and H4F for Low 4 Locked, High 4 Locked, High 4 Free\u2014will stump a lot of buyers, but we take consolation knowing that leaving the knob alone is often the best move. On dry pavement or a snow-dusted mountain pass or a sandy two-track, the system will send torque to where the grip is without driver input. It\u2019s just a shame Toyota doesn\u2019t offer the full-time transfer case on lower trims, as well.\n\nThe High-Dollar Value Menu\n\nAs expensive as the Limited is, it still manages to be a value of sorts in the pickup market. To get the same features in another truck would require stepping up to a full-size in a trim like Platinum, Tungsten, or Denali for another $20K or $30K over our Limited\u2019s $57,720 asking price. That said, some of this equipment is gratuitous in a truck this small. The Tacoma isn\u2019t tall enough to warrant running boards, and the rearward visibility isn\u2019t bad enough to demand a digital rearview mirror. It\u2019s easier to justify the price based on the ventilated seats, adaptive cruise control, surround-view camera system, front and rear parking sensors, and the 2,400-watt AC outlet that comes with the hybrid engine, but better-driving competitors offer many of the same luxuries.\n\nThe high-zoot Taco\u2019s cabin looks expensive compared to the rest of the class, even if the faux leather and wood won\u2019t fool anybody. And yet buyers are more likely to appreciate that, as nice as it is, the Limited prioritizes practicality over luxury and fashion. The interior stands out thanks to a full complement of logically placed knobs and buttons that let you pilot this truck without taking your eyes off the road. When you do resort to using the huge, high-mounted 14.0-inch touchscreen, it\u2019s a short reach and quick glance away at the oversized icons that are impossible to miss. Of course, that\u2019s true of every Taco with the big screen. In a similar vein, our chief criticism of the cabin is the same one we\u2019ve levied at every new Tacoma: The rear seat is sized exclusively for kids within the narrow window between graduating out of a car seat and graduating middle school.\n\nThat\u2019s One Fancy Street Taco\n\nThe Tacoma Limited\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and unique offerings winnow the buyer pool to a very specific demographic. This is the pickup for someone who wants a luxurious truck but not a large truck. Someone who\u2019s not afraid to spend big bucks on a midsize pickup and who measures luxury based on a list of features rather than the grain of the dashboard trim. The fact that no other automaker builds a midsize truck quite like the Toyota Tacoma Limited is both the best reason to buy it and the explanation why few people do. This fancy street taco is for buyers with niche needs and tastes.",

CarsDirect reports that Toyota is offering discounts of up to 70% off the base XLE grade, which is normally priced at $51,285 (including destination). That brings the price down to $17,005 with destination, or within a few hundred dollars of the cheapest car on the market, the gasoline-powered Nissan Versa sedan. The Mirai Limited, which normally retails for $68,210 after destination, now costs just $25,210 with this discount.\n\nLike other fuel-cell cars, the Mirai is only available in California because other states lack sufficient fueling infrastructure. But these deals only apply to residents in the southern portion of the state. Discounts in Northern California are lower, but still significant\u2014at $25,000 off the XLE and $33,000 off the Limited. Toyota is also, for now, offering lease incentives of up to $7,500.\n\n2024 Toyota Mirai\n\nMirai customers also get $15,000 of free fuel over up to six years, a perk Toyota was already offering. In XLE trim, the Mirai returns 72 miles per kilogram of hydrogen, according to the automaker, so this credit still amounts to more than 30,000 free miles even at the peak price of $34.55/kg California experienced last October.\n\nThat was only the latest in a line of supply disruptions affecting consumer-level fuel-cell vehicles in recent years\u2014as an infrastructure for commercial trucks and industry builds out. An unreliable hydrogen supply has likely contributed to sluggish sales of the Mirai. Toyota reports that in the U.S. it delivered just 499 of the fuel-cell sedans in 2024, down from 2,737 in 2023.\n\n2024 Toyota Mirai\n\nThe Mirai isn't a bad car. While the first generation felt akin to a Prius, the current generation feels like a luxury car, with ride quality, handling, and noise, vibration, and harshness levels comparable to the gasoline and hydrid sedans from Toyota's upmarket Lexus brand.\n\nWhile Toyota claims the current-generation Mirai effectively cleans the air as you drive\u2014what the automaker calls \"minus emissions\"\u2014hydrogen needs to be cleanly produced and readily available for that to happen. Studies earlier this decade suggested that hydrogen would become greener and even cost-competitive with gasoline by the end of the decade. But the price of hydrogen has instead soared.",

            "content": "One of the biggest beasts in the off-road jungle. The new Land Cruiser, like the Jeep Wrangler and Land Rover Defender, traces its roots back over 70 years. This is the all new Land Cruiser 250 \u2013 much has changed, but much has remained the same. It\u2019s still a \u2018traditional\u2019 4x4, using a ladder frame chassis with the body mounted on top. It\u2019s powered by diesel, still has lockable diffs and a low range gearbox. But like a Mercedes G-Class it uses double wishbone front suspension, like a Ford Bronco the front anti-roll bar can be disconnected to improve axle articulation. No Land Cruiser has been this refined or well insulated.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nThe Land Cruiser line-up confuses me. What\u2019s going on? That\u2019s because there are three prongs: Heavy Duty, Light Duty and Station Wagon. Having arrived in 1951 as the Toyota Jeep BJ (and adopted the Land Cruiser name in 1955), by 1967 Toyota had realised it could be more than a hardcore workhorse and created the Station Wagon line of more civilised machines. In 1985 they then separated the workhorse range into Light and Heavy Duty. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been ever since. The Heavy Duty range are the cars you see on the news in global hotspots, they\u2019re the 70-Series cars, tough as teak, but unable to be sold in Europe due to emissions regs. The Light Duty and Station Wagon (most memorable in the UK as the Land Cruiser Colorado and Amazon respectively) have been gradually converging, to the extent that this new 250 (ostensibly a Light Duty car) shares its GA-F chassis with the 300 Station Wagon launched a couple of years ago (but not sold in the UK or Europe). But this looks so much cooler. Amazing what a bit of design can do, isn\u2019t it? Oddly, the car it reminds us of is the Suzuki Jimny, another car that was given a retro makeover that captured everyone\u2019s attention, yet retained its amazing capabilities. We suspect similar sales success for this. Depending on spec level you can have it with either round or rectangular lights, but everywhere you look there\u2019s evidence of its toughness. Scuff the front end? Relax, you don\u2019t have to replace the whole bumper, just one of the separate panels. There\u2019s copious scratch-proof plastic outside, and those angled arches hark straight back to the iconic 40-series from 1960.\n\nAdvertisement - Page continues below\n\nIs it hybrid? You\u2019re kidding, right? Actually that\u2019s not such a daft question, because next year Toyota will add 48v mild hybrid functions \u2013 and in some markets the 250 will be available from launch with a 2.4-litre turbo petrol mated to a full hybrid system.\n\nBut not for Europe? Nope, we get an uprated 2.8-litre four cylinder turbo diesel from the Hilux developing 201bhp and 369lb ft from 1,600rpm. It\u2019s mated to a new eight-speed automatic that\u2019s far more responsive, prompt and obedient than the previous six-speeder. Just don\u2019t go expecting any astonishing feats of economy. The WLTP economy figure is 26.6mpg, and CO2 stands at 279g/km. It\u2019s got an 80-litre fuel tank, which at the 28mpg we were getting on a cruise should be good for well over 500 miles. But it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be getting anywhere particularly fast. Top speed is just 102 miles an hour, and almost a year on from first driving it, Toyota still hasn\u2019t homologated the 0-62mph acceleration. We\u2019d be surprised if it\u2019s under 10 seconds. What gadgets and tech does it have? Like just about every modern car there\u2019s a central touchscreen (8.0 or 12.3 inches depending on spec level), plus voice assistant and driver assist systems. Ignore them or turn them off, they jar with the Land Cruiser experience. Unlike most modern cars though, there are buttons, loads of them, scattered all around the driving environment, labelled with baffling three-letter acronyms. Find the one labelled SDM. That\u2019s Stabiliser Disconnect Mechanism, and allows you to detach the front anti-roll bar, freeing up another 10 per cent more wheel travel. Off-road you genuinely feel it, not so much for the extra travel as there being more elasticity in the front suspension.\n\nREAD MORE Video: take a closer look at the cool new Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nThere are also modes, accessible via a rotary control knob low on the centre console. There\u2019s a pointless Sport mode \u2013 no Land Cruiser needs that \u2013 but pressing MTS (Multi-Terrain Select) and twisting the knob gives you access to a wide variety of terrain choices. If you\u2019re in low range that choice opens even further. If you select DAC (Downhill Assist Control) the knob controls the speed at which you descend steep slopes. What\u2019s it like to drive? You can read more about this in the Driving tab, but in brief it\u2019s ponderous and lollopy on-road, with a bit of shudder and shimmy from the back axle. Drive it offroad and that vagueness comes into sharp focus \u2013 now you get a sense of exactly what each wheel is up to and how it\u2019s behaving. How does it compare to rivals? Funny you should ask that as we\u2019ve now driven it back to back off-road against the Ineos Grenadier, Land Rover Defender and Mercedes G-Class, and the Toyota came out on top.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a few to talk about here, but let\u2019s start with the biggie for British buyers, Land Rover\u2019s Defender. The Land Cruiser is not as sophisticated and composed as the Defender, but it\u2019s more dextrous and communicative in the rough with better axle articulation and has a formidable reputation for toughness and reliability. The Defender is now more school run truck than wilderness explorer, which makes it good business for JLR now, potentially bad for future reputation. The Mercedes G-Class is superbly engineered, very luxurious, but at nearly \u00a3130k for the G400d, unlikely to ever be seen working for a living. Then there\u2019s the Ineos Grenadier: a good update of an old Defender, but more agricultural than the Land Cruiser, overpriced and, well, the Toyota has the reputation for durability that Ineos will take years to achieve. Is it a family hauler? In the mould of an XC90 or Q7? No, absolutely not. It\u2019s about the same size outside, but the packaging is compromised by the clanking underpinnings, so there\u2019s less room for passengers. Still, there is the option of seven seats and plenty of wipe clean plastics.\n\nOur choice from the range Toyota 2.8 D-4D Active 3dr Auto 5 Seats \u00a338,370 See prices and specs\n\nWhat's the verdict? \u201c There\u2019s an honesty and integrity to the Land Cruiser 250 that is deeply appealing \u201d\n\nWant a genuinely rugged off-roader that\u2019s phenomenally capable, quietly desirable, will never let you down, is well kitted out yet manages to look cool? Here you go. The Land Cruiser 250 may have had the retro makeover, but it\u2019s not flattering to deceive. As much as capability, there\u2019s an honesty and integrity to it that is deeply appealing. It may not be the last word in sophistication, but the criticisms of its ride and refinement are churlish when they actually feel integral to its ability, plus there\u2019s huge satisfaction to be had in driving a car that is so clear about what it\u2019s for and how it should be used. It is however going to be more expensive than we first expected. Where a bog basic Defender 110 is \u00a363,500 (but in practice quickly specced to north of \u00a380k), the Land Cruiser First Edition - of which all 3,000 coming to Europe are already spoken for - is \u00a379,995. That\u2019s a lot for a car with a gruff 2.8-litre diesel. The only other version so far announced is the \u00a374,995 Invincible. This is big money for a trad off-roader, no matter how cool and capable. If you\u2019re tempted by one (and you really should be) make us a promise: discover what it\u2019s capable of. The Land Cruiser has the reputation it does because it\u2019s always been used properly. Don\u2019t let the side down.",

            "content": "In this week\u2019s Ask Nathan:\n\nWill the 2026 Toyota MR2 be a hybrid?\n\nHonda design is taking a turn?\n\n\n\nThe first question comes from a reader who wants to know if the rumored return of the Toyota MR2 will have the heart of a hybrid.\n\nQ: (Via:Twitter/X@NathanAdlen) RE: Toyota MR2 Hybrid?\n\nDo you think the GR Toyota MR2 will be a hybrid?\n\n\u2013 Heavy Duk\n\nA: interesting question.\n\n\u201cIF\u201d they build the Toyota MR2, there is a chance that they may use some of their hybrid tech. The image above is the Toyota FT-Se concept, and there\u2019s a lot of speculation that this is what the vehicle might look like. Below it, (just above this paragraph) is a Toyota rendering of what the original idea for this concept was \u2013 and it has air intakes leading to the rear of the vehicle \u2013 interesting. It may a bit of a leap to go from a purpose-built EV sports car to something like the original MR2s. All the same, I find it fascinating that the initial sketch looks like this.\n\nThe first generation was actually built from many parts from the Corolla, back in mid 1980s. It wasn\u2019t a rocket, but it handled amazingly well, and it was affordable. As time passed, the MR2 grew and became far more powerful in its second generation. It also became more expensive. The third gen wasn\u2019t as great as the first two \u2013 in my book, but it was still a hoot to drive.\n\nThe thing is: MR2 were the sports car that regular consumers could afford. Now (I fear) if they build it, it\u2019s going to cost. Still, that might not be as much of an issue if the Celica holds some sort of middle ground between the MR2, and the GR Corolla. Speaking of the GR Corolla: they may use that fire-breathing inline-3 turbo, and place that engine right behind the driver \u2013 like the original.\n\nHybrid power?\n\nAs for hybrid power\u2026 Toyota did say that they wanted to electrify their fleet. Nearly every vehicle has a hybrid variant, or simply comes as a hybrid. They are betting heavy on that. With that being said, the aforementioned GR Corolla and the Supra \u2013 along with the GR86 have no electric motors helping them.\n\nThere is a way Toyota could sort of reverse engineer their all-wheel drive (AWD) hybrid system for a vehicle like this. Kind of like a poor-man\u2019s Acura NSX, they could supply electrical power to the front wheels, while the rear gas engine powers the wheels its connected to. I have no idea if that has any relevance, nor have I heard anyone mention a hybrid with AWD. It just seems logical to me.\n\nI hope they do build a new MR2, and it would be cool to have some sort of hybrid/AWD option in the offering. Additionally, I have to say that these renderings are tasty. They remind me of Lotus, and/or Ferrari. Very cool.\n\nLets hope Toyota builds it!\n\n\u2013 N\n\nThe last comment comes from a cross-section of comments from our coverage of the Honda 0 Saloon and SUV.\n\nQ: (Paraphrased into a few comments from YouTube \u2013 because there\u2019s a lot) What\u2019s up with Honda\u2019s design?\n\n\u201cThese cars will never make it to production\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is there no trunk (boot) in tje Honda 0 Saloon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe design of the electric doors is terrible\u201d\n\n\u201cThe designs are too radical.\u201d\n\n\u201cClean your optics!\u201d\n\n\u2014 YouTube viewers\n\nA: I will answer each, but I want to be clear: I\u2019m a fan of sci-fi styling, and of people who are brave with design risks.\n\nHere are my answers:\n\n\u201cThese cars will never make it to production\u201d\n\nHonda said that they are in the process of building an EV Hub in Ohio. It is already under construction, to be finished by the end of 2025. PRODUCTION of the Honda 0 SUV, and then the Honda 0 Saloon will begin in 2026. Additionally, this facility will allow ICE, EV and hybrid vehicles to all be built on the same line. That\u2019s directly from Honda.\n\nDimensions, final design and performance/power numbers will be announced in the near future.\n\n\u201cWhy is there no trunk (boot) in the Honda 0 Saloon?\u201d\n\nYes, the prototype on stage didn\u2019t have a cargo area, or an opening, but there will be in the production model. Once again; from Honda. Additionally, I would expect things like side-view mirrors, more glass and cargo spaces in the production models.\n\n\u201cThe design of the electric doors is terrible\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think that will be part of the future production for either vehicle. It\u2019s more for the effect of both concepts on stage. They have a remote control that can open and close the doors. I think it\u2019s mostly for effect, and they didn\u2019t seem too excited about making all their doors electric. With that being said, electrically assisted doors already exist on many premium vehicles. Perhaps they will adopt something like that?\n\n\u201cThe designs are too radical\u201d\n\nI can see how some of the lines may look too fantastic. Yes, I am a fan of Blade Runner, Anime, Manga and sci-fi design in general. That\u2019s why I like both. Still, the rear section of the SUV provides a massive blind spot. The Saloon is very long, and (I think) it would need all-wheel steering to make parking reasonable.\n\n\u201cClean your optics!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m ashamed, and sorry about the dust particles on my phone. After visiting Pasadena and Altadena early that morning, I was oblivious to how much ash and dust I was coated in. Even though I changed my cloths, I didn\u2019t bother to double check my phone \u2013 totally screwed up. I\u2019ll will do my best to avoid that in the future.\n\n\u2013 N\n\np.s. Shout out to Jake at Pasadena Station 34!",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nToyota Tacoma fans are among the most loyal in the truck world, and the reasons are easy to understand when you hear stories like Kirk Johnson\u2019s. Kirk, a longtime Toyota Tacoma owner, recently shared his detailed ownership experience, explaining why he remains a lifelong fan of this midsize truck. His story highlights Tacoma's impressive durability, advanced features, and unmatched quality. Below, we'll share Kirk's comment in full, discuss some of Tacoma\u2019s standout qualities, and explore what makes it one of the most beloved trucks on the market.\n\nKirk\u2019s Full Testimonial\n\n\"I am on my 2nd New 2024 Toyota Tacoma this year. I must say that I'm impressed with this truck. Let me explain. I have had a 1997 Tacoma years ago and I sold it with 150,000 miles on it. Even though it drove like new, I figured it was due to break down very soon. As I've only had to buy tires and a battery in 5 years.\n\nThen, years later I bought a used 2007 Tacoma. I put a 2\" body lift, 3\" suspension lift, Tiger striped 33\" tires, and custom rims. My fuel mileage on that Toyota Tacoma went from 20 mpg to 12 or 13 mpg. Then the gas price shot up to $3.25 a gallon.\n\nI put a lot of miles on it and decided to sell it within a month or two of getting it exactly like I wanted it. This was another unwise idea just like the first sale.\n\nNow 15+ years later, I got a new 2024 Tacoma. When I bought it, I had 1,500 miles on it and let a friend drive it. She ran in through a stop sign at 35/40 miles per hour. She didn't hit the brake. We slid up the wire and didn't get a scratch or bruise on either of us. Amazing! God had to have been with us, no doubt. However, it did bend the frame when it came slamming back to the ground.\n\nSo I got another 2024 TRD Sport 4 WD. This was probably the best decision I have made about my car purchases. I put 17,000 in 3 or 4 months. And I am just amazed at the quality of this vehicle. It drives great, the turbo makes this 4-door truck very quick. In the last 600-mile road trip, I got an impressive 21 mpg. It's pretty much a self-driving truck. You put it in cruise control trac mode or whatever it's called and bam. This truck is self-driving around corners, and it auto brakes and accelerates by itself. You will need to touch the steering wheel every 15 seconds or less, but you should anyway.\n\nMy bottom line is that I will always own a Tacoma for the rest of my life. The Tacoma is a high-quality truck, and I haven't had any issues at all. So far so good. If you are in the market for one, test drive one for yourself. The new Toyota Tacoma is one of, if not the best, mid-sized trucks money can buy! Toyota Tacoma, owner for life...\"\n\nWhat Makes the 2024 Toyota Tacoma Stand Out?\n\nKirk\u2019s story is one of many that highlight why the Toyota Tacoma remains a top choice for midsize truck buyers. Here are a few of the Tacoma\u2019s most compelling qualities:\n\nUnparalleled Reliability\n\nTacoma\u2019s reputation for longevity is legendary. Kirk\u2019s earlier Tacomas, one of which he sold at 150,000 miles while it was still running perfectly, are a testament to this. Toyota consistently engineers the Tacoma to last, often delivering well beyond the 200,000-mile mark with proper maintenance. Advanced Safety Features\n\nKirk\u2019s 2024 Tacoma TRD Sport showcases Toyota\u2019s impressive safety technologies. After surviving a serious accident unharmed, Kirk credits the truck\u2019s design and safety systems. The truck is equipped with Toyota Safety Sense 3.0, which includes features like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and lane-tracing assist, creating a semi-autonomous driving experience. Turbocharged Performance\n\nThe new turbocharged engine in the 2024 Tacoma offers increased power and efficiency, making it a joy to drive both on and off the road. As Kirk noted, the turbocharged engine makes his truck \u201cvery quick,\u201d while still achieving a respectable 21 mpg on longer trips. Diverse Trim Levels\n\nTacoma\u2019s wide range of trims ensures there\u2019s a configuration for every type of driver. From the off-road-ready TRD Off-Road to the overlanding-focused Trailhunter Trim, Toyota has covered all bases for outdoor adventurers. (Check out this detailed breakdown of the TRD Off-Road trim\u2019s features here or dive into the Trailhunter's bold overlanding capabilities here.) Customization Options\n\nKirk\u2019s journey with the Tacoma shows how owners can personalize their trucks to fit their lifestyle. Whether it\u2019s a lift kit, upgraded tires, or accessories like bed racks, Tacoma enthusiasts love to make their trucks their own.\n\nAdditional Resources for Tacoma Enthusiasts\n\nIf you\u2019re considering buying a Tacoma or upgrading your current truck, make sure to check out these related articles:\n\nQuestions for Readers\n\nIf you own or have owned a Toyota Tacoma, what\u2019s your favorite feature or experience with the truck? For those considering a midsize truck, what features are most important to you when making your decision?\n\nShare your thoughts in the comments below, and let us know why you think the Toyota Tacoma deserves or doesn\u2019t deserve its legendary status!\n\nArmen Hareyan is the founder and the Editor in Chief of Torque News.

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nWhat do you think of what you\u2019re presented with an image of the Toyota Prius hybrid? Like most people, your associations are probably connected with protecting nature and reducing resource depletion. You\u2019re also somebody who recognizes that our climate has been altered by humans through fossil fuel use and their resulting emissions. You\u2019ve always seen Toyota as a partner dedicated to lessening global warming. It\u2019s been a mirage, subterfuge, an out-and-out lie. Actually, Toyota has a significant track record of funding climate deniers.\n\nClimate deniers? Sorry, but it\u2019s true. Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) is opposed to the electric vehicle (EV) revolution. It has become the largest funder of US lawmakers who deny the existence of the climate crisis. The world\u2019s largest automaker has been behind the scenes influencing US politics in a sustained attempt to hold EVs from mainstream adoption and to maintain its market share.\n\nWatchdog group Public Citizen says that Toyota \u2014 after the 2024 election, with Toyota\u2019s climate-denying allies entering power \u2014 \u201cis poised to marshal an assault on climate policy. However, it is a risky strategy. Its failure to build EVs has left it vulnerable to an influx of competitors who have embraced the next generation of vehicles.\u201d\n\nToyota holds great sway in Japan as the nation\u2019s largest company, having revenue and a market cap about twice that of the closest runner-up. Public Citizen states that Toyota \u201cholds the kind of cultural cache that can only be compared to General Motors in its heyday, which has given Toyota an immense amount of political power.\u201d\n\nA report from Public Citizen has disclosed how Toyota has donated substantially during the last three election cycles to climate denier candidates. \u201cDriving Denial\u201d outlines how Toyota has contributed to 207 climate deniers running for office. US House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA.) received $10,000, Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO) got $7,000, and others, including Rep. James Comer (R-KY), David Schweikert (R-AZ), and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), received a total of $808,500 \u2014 all of whom deny or question the existence of climate change.\n\nIn a town hall, Johnson said, \u201cThe climate is changing, but the question is, is it being caused by natural cycles in the atmosphere over the span of the Earth\u2019s history? Or is it changing because we drive SUVs? I don\u2019t believe in the latter. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the primary driver.\u201d He has also led the effort to try to strip funding for green energy from the IRA.\n\nWhat is Toyota\u2019s rationale for quietly building a powerful US influence operation to weaken climate policy by supporting climate deniers?\n\nThe company has lagged behind its competitors in making the needed transition to EVs.\n\nToyota is also the only major automaker that has failed to set a target for 100% EVs.\n\nIt is stagnant in its internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered hybrid technology.\n\nIt bet on hydrogen-powered vehicles, which have failed in the marketplace.\n\nToyota is vulnerable to its competitors, who have surpassed the major automaker in the buildout to next generation vehicles.\n\nThe company has had difficulty reducing its carbon footprint, failing even to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 15% from 2018 to 2026.\n\nInstead of innovating, Toyota has funded the campaigns of climate-hostile lawmakers and paid lobbyists to squash inevitable EVs.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, Toyota spent over $31 million just on US federal lobbying. Toyota has deceptively marketed its gas-powered hybrids as EVs instead of investing in EVs.\n\nLast year at this time, Toyota agreed with Panasonic Holdings Corporation to make Primearth EV Energy Co., Ltd. a wholly owned subsidiary in order to strengthen its capabilities in mass-producing automotive batteries, with the acquisition scheduled to take place in late March. More competitive batteries would enhance the appeal of Toyota\u2019s current hybrid offerings and contribute to achieving carbon neutrality through a multi-pathway approach.\n\nWhile ramping up its lobbying efforts for climate deniers, Toyota has invested in carbon-intensive hydrogen-powered vehicles such as the Mirai, a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (HFCV) introduced in 2014. The Mirai has sold fewer than 25,000 units and has failed to provide consumers with the infrastructure needed for HFCVs, with just 60 hydrogen refueling stations in the US and Canada \u2014 leading to a class action lawsuit against the automaker.\n\nAhead of the Paris Olympics, which Toyota sponsored, 120 scientists, engineers, and academics wrote an open letter to organizers calling on them to drop the Mirai as the official vehicle of the games. That is because over 99% of hydrogen is made with fossil fuels and hydrogen production emits about as much annually as all global aviation, making hydrogen vehicles far dirtier than EVs. Like Toyota\u2019s broader greenwashing strategy, the Mirai presents a veneer of green energy but is actually just a mirage.\n\nIn a counterattack on November 8, 2024, during a virtual press conference, Jack Hollis, the chief operating officer for Toyota Motor North America, told reporters the EV mandates that are set to start next year in California and other states are \u201cimpossible\u201d to meet. If they\u2019re not changed, he said, they will lead to less customer choice in several states.\n\nJust five days after that, the Japanese news outlet Nikkei published a story detailing Japanese automakers\u2019 plans to ramp up lobbying in the second Trump administration. In late November, Hollis wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled \u201cTrump Can Get EVs Back on Track,\u201d calling on the new administration to dismantle the Biden-era policies that encourage automakers to reduce emissions. It complained that \u201cunrealistic regulations favor one carbon-reducing option over, and at the expense of, all others.\u201d On Christmas Eve, Toyota announced it was donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration and his coterie of climate deniers.\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of automakers sent a letter to once-and-future President Donald J. Trump with the request to continue the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s EV policies. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, composed of 42 automakers including Ford and General Motors, said they are in favor of existing EV tax incentives and emissions regulations. They argue that the auto industry can only be successful if it is allowed stability and predictability in auto-related emissions standards. Automakers already are on a path to transportation electrification, with investments of billions of dollars dedicated to EV research and development.\n\nInvestors appear to expect the EV market to continue its rapid growth. The S-curve is a well-established phenomenon where a successful new technology reaches a certain catalytic tipping point (typically 5\u201310% market share) and then rapidly reaches a high market share (i.e., 50%+) within just a couple more years once past this tipping point.\n\nThere is a self-reinforcing cycle where the technology becomes more cost-effective as it becomes more prevalent. That is certainly the case for EV batteries, which fell by 20% in cost in 2024 alone. Sorry, Toyota. You bet on the wrong horseless carriage.\n\nFeatured image: \u201cSteel Wool Prius\u201d by wgreenephoto is licensed under CC BY 2.0.",

Fast forward to a little over 15 years, and Toyota has finally given its rugged SUV a full redesign, and we\u2019re about to drive it. To see how it stacks up in the real world, Toyota has invited us to test it all over sunny San Diego, California, during their press drive event.\n\nAs we explore everything this long-awaited refresh has to offer, we want to hear from you.. Got burning questions about the 2025 Toyota 4Runner? Drop them in the comments, and we\u2019ll provide answers once the embargo lifts on January 28. Let\u2019s dig into what\u2019s new with this long-awaited refresh.\n\nA Long Time Coming\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve laid eyes on the new 4Runner. Toyota actually unveiled it back in April of last year at a kitschy beach party. At the time, though, all we could do was check out the exterior and poke around the interior. Toyota shared a few details during the event and has trickled out more information since then.\n\nMore: Toyota Dealers Adding $5,000 Markups Onto New 4Runner\n\nFirst and foremost, this time around, there\u2019s no V6, unfortunately. Instead, the base engine is a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 278 horsepower (207 kW) and 317 lb-ft (429 Nm) of torque. An eight-speed automatic gearbox sends power to the wheels. Speaking of wheels, the 4Runner is available in either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive configurations. As expected, some trims come standard with 4WD, while for others, it\u2019s a $2,000 add-on.\n\nRWD 4Runners now deliver up to 20 mpg in the city, 26 on the highway, and 22 combined\u2014a huge leap forward compared to the previous generation\u2019s underwhelming 16 mpg city, 19 highway, and 17 combined, regardless of drivetrain. Even better, the new 4WD model sacrifices just a single mpg compared to the RWD version, making it a far more efficient option than its predecessor.\n\nIn addition to those bits of good news, Toyota is also offering a hybrid four-cylinder that makes 326 hp (243 kW) and 465 lb-ft (630 Nm) of torque. Four-wheel drive comes standard with all hybrid 4Runners. In addition, they manage to return 23 mpg in the city, 24 on the highway, and 23 combined. Basically, it offers more power than the old 4Runner and more fuel economy at the same time.\n\nPricing for the new 4Runner starts at $40,770 before adding a $1,450 destination fee (bringing the total to $42,220). At the top end, the flagship TRD Pro and Trailhunter trims climb to $66,900 before destination charges.\n\nToyota hasn\u2019t told us what trims of the 4Runner we\u2019ll get to drive, but feel free to ask about any of them. Drop your questions, and we\u2019ll track down the answers and report back in the coming week!\n\nPhotos Toyota, Stephen Rivers",

From the aerodynamic 1930s Chrysler Airflow to the 1950s Chevrolet Nomad two-door wagon and more recent Chevrolet Avalanche; Honda Civic del Sol and Element; Nissan Cube; Pontiac Aztek and G8; most fall into two categories:\n\nQuirky but lovable.\n\nAhead of their time.\n\nI\u2019m a sucker for both quirks and innovation, so I admire these noble experiments. Most people were barely aware of them even when they were new, but many of those who noticed, were hooked.\n\nThe right size for the job\n\nMy favorite at the moment is the Toyota Crown Signia. The Signia is a four-door hatchback, 0.6-inch shorter bumper to bumper than a Camry sedan, with two rows of seats and a big tailgate for cargo.\n\nI see it as attractive and useful: roomy, comfortable and loaded with technology, including a fuel-efficient hybrid system.\n\nSometimes, driving a big or midsize SUV is like taking a half-empty suitcase on a weekend trip. A smaller bag that fits in the overhead compartment will do.\n\nDespite that, a lot of buyers apparently look at the Crown Signia and see a station wagon, think \u201cGriswolds!\u201d and run.\n\nA pair of readers from Ann Arbor recently chose a Signia because of some very specific cargo needs: They needed to carry a 73.5-inch tall pedal harp and mountain bike.\n\nIndividually, not at the same time. That\u2019d take a moving van.\n\nMore: Toyota tries to split difference between sedan and SUV in 2023 Crown hybrid\n\nMore: Is the 2025 Toyota Crown Signia the car SUV-haters have been waiting for?\n\nLa Fontaine Toyota in Dearborn allowed them to take a Crown Signia home for a fitting. It passed with flying colors. The readers requested anonymity because of the value of their cargo.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the deciding factors,\u201d the harpist told me. \u201cThe Crown Signia had more space than a Subaru Outback.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very particular about my cars. I keep them a long time,\u201d she added, keeping them for years. She also worried about the perceptions that can come with pulling up to the trailhead in station wagon from Volvo or another premium brand.\n\n\u201cThe Signia will be great for road trips,\u201d she added. \u201dIt\u2019s smooth, quiet and has great visibility.\u201d\n\nToyota\u2019s crowning glory\n\nThe Signia is 4 inches shorter and has 1.3-inch less ground clearance than a Highlander midsize SUV, Toyota\u2019s next-smallest harp-friendly vehicle. That makes everything from parking to entry and exit easier.\n\nIt gets better fuel economy than hybrid versions of the Highlander and bigger Grand Highlander, reducing emissions and cost.\n\nThe dash includes buttons for climate control, in addition to its big clear 12.3-inch touch screen.\n\nIt's Toyota's oldest nameplate in Japan, where the Crown sedan and Signia are flagships of the model line. The vehicles sold here offer everything from handsome leather upholstery to a wide array of convenience and driver assist features.\n\nDespite all that, Toyota sold just 10,263 Crown Signias in the U.S. in 2024. That trails every pickup and SUV in Toyota\u2019s lineup, and every car except the hydrogen-powered Mirai sedan and BMW-built Supra sports car.\n\nDespite my affection and the coveted harpist\u2019s seal of approval, the Signia may be a short timer \u2014 and future collectible.

Sold in a slew of vehicles in the Nineties and Aughts\u2014including the legendary Mk. 4 Supra\u2014it's gained a reputation of being the most robust internal combustion engine ever built. The venerable straight-six is capable of holding huge power numbers with the right mods, and, as this teardown video shows, can go for hundreds of thousands of worry-free miles with just basic maintenance.\n\nThe I Do Cars YouTube channel got its hands on a running 2JZ engine out of a Lexus GS300 with an incredible 415,000 miles on the odometer. Curious to see what this engine might look like after so many miles, the channel's host, Eric, decided to take it apart.\n\nSurprising no one, the inside of this 2JZ is in shockingly good shape, all things considered. While no motor can be perfect after 400,000 miles, the head and camshafts show only minor wear and limited varnish staining. Most engines look like this after just 100,000 miles, even with good maintenance records.\n\nGoing deeper into the engine reveals more of the same. The cylinders still show most of their original cross-hashing, with only minor scoring in a couple of sections. Not perfect, but after 400,000 miles, we'd say that's a win. And aside from some sludge in the oil pan and normal bearing wear, the bottom end is otherwise healthy.\n\nIf you, for some reason, had any doubt about the 2JZ's reputation for bulletproof reliability, we hope this teardown convinces you otherwise.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 is still in its fifth generation with the next model being pushed to 2026. The current RAV4 has enjoyed great success, despite some common issues. In 2024, the current Toyota RAV4 saw its most successful year in terms of sales numbers - 475,193 sold in the US, according to GCBC statistics. It seems, 2025 will be the last year for the current generation as fresh reports from Japan suggest the sixth-generation Toyota RAV4 will arrive for the 2026 model year, at least in Japan.\n\nThe next generation of the Japanese SUV was supposed to drop in 2024 as a 2025 model, but was delayed. The sixth-generation Toyota RAV4 is definitely arriving for 2026, but Japan might be the first to get it as we have seen with other Japanese models. A case in point is the Nissan R35 GT-R, which was available to order in Japan, in 2007 \u2013 a year earlier than the rest of the world.\n\nJapanese publication, Best Car Web has been a reliable source of information so far. They have not only reported their findings on the upcoming Toyota RAV4, but they have, reportedly, seen it too. The renderings by Best Car Web (which I have attached to the article) should be fairly accurate. While I think the design (assuming it's accurate) looks great. Things are not as revolutionary under the \u201cskin\u201d, but that's not a bad thing. Here's what I mean.\n\nAn interesting \u201cchange\u201d in the powertrain options shows Toyota is playing it safe\n\nLast year, I reported on another revelation regarding the future Toyota RAV4, which confirmed it was going to be all-hybrid. That means no more gasoline-only-powered variants of the compact Japanese SUV. Toyota recently unveiled two new engines, which will power the vast majority of Toyota and Lexus models in the coming years. This includes the Lexus ES and IS models, which will adopt the larger of the two engines \u2013 a 2.0-liter turbo-four \u2013 where the V-6 previously worked.\n\nThe other new Toyota engine \u2013 a 1.5-liter turbo-four \u2013 is developed for the company's more compact models, including the RAV4. However, the sixth-generation Toyota RAV4 will not feature that engine. A mid-cycle refresh could change that. For now, the upcoming RAV4 will continue to be motivated by the 2.5-liter Dynamic Force engine.\n\nThe inline-four engine features an Atkinson cycle and works with one or two electric motors, depending on the application. Toyota promised that the next generation of this powertrain would feature more powerful electric motors, and we already saw that in the 2025 Toyota Camry. This also includes the Toyota RAV4 Prime, which even now, can sprint to 60 mph, from a standstill, in 5.7 seconds. The 2.5-liter engines that Toyota uses in almost all of its hybrid models have proven to be reliable units, so no point in retiring it so soon.\n\nEventually, we are going to see the 1.5-liter turbo-four engine in the RAV4, as part of a hybrid system. I personally think that a larger-displacement, normally-aspirated engine like Toyota's 2.5-liter unit would deliver a more effortless power delivery than a downsized 1.5-liter engine. Meanwhile, the most powerful variant of the large 2.0-liter turbo-four engine \u2013 the G20E \u2013 will make 400 horsepower in the next-generation Toyota Celica, and up to 600 in race trim.\n\nToyota says it is the new 2JZ. We'll see about that, but judging by what we are seeing from the GR Corolla's G16E turbocharged three-cylinder engine, the G20E sounds like the next big thing in the tuner scene. What o you think about Toyota's new engines? Should the RAV4 get a 1.5-liter or is it a bit too small? Let us know what you think in the comment section below.\n\nDimitar Angelov's automotive interests made him an expert in a wide variety of vehicles.

Millermotorcars only list one price for the wheels, and it\u2019s \u00a313,327 ($16,300) including VAT in the UK, which would make the total \u00a353,308 ($65,000) if all four corners really do cost the same.\n\nRead: $70,000 Used Rolls-Royce Phantom Had A $79,000 Bill From A Single Service\n\nBut it\u2019s probably not the total, because if you\u2019re replacing your wheels after an accident or if they\u2019ve been stolen, you\u2019re going to be needing a set of tires too, meaning the final bill \u2013 even based on Scuderia Parts\u2019 lower price \u2013 would far exceed the $45,895 MSRP of a brand new Honda Civic Type R with forged wheels. The Type doesn\u2019t come with forged rims, but you can buy an entire set of 20-inch, 10-spoke wheels through Honda for $3,164. In fact, that\u2019s more than the base price of a new 2025 Toyota GR Supra that starts from $56,250.\n\nPhoto Scuderiaparts\n\nLet\u2019s say you do need all those accessories that go with your new Ferrari rims\u2014things like hub logos, TPMS sensors, and weight balancers. A plain hub logo will set you back $22, while carbon fiber versions go for $213. Each TPMS sensor costs $183, and the weight balancers will cost you $12 each. All in all, you\u2019re looking at an additional $868 in accessories alone. And that\u2019s not including shipping and taxes, of course.\n\nThe Bill, Please\n\nNext, you\u2019ll need tires. If you want to get Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires for your Purosangue, you\u2019re in for a treat. With taxes, a full set will cost you only around $3,100 from TireRack. Add installation fees, and you\u2019re looking at about $3,650. All told, when you add up the wheels, tires, and accessories, the total bill will hover around $61,700.\n\nCredit: Miller Motor Cars\n\nThe More Affordable Option: Cast Alloy Wheels\u2014Sort Of\n\nLike the Civic, the Purosangue comes standard with simple cast rims. And replacing them costs a fraction of buying new forged versions: Scuderiaparts will sell you a glossy silver front wheel (the cheapest option, as prices increase for other finishes) for a more palatable $1,678 and a rear for $1,944, bringing the total cost for four to $7,244, or $8,361 with shipping and taxes for MA included.\n\nMore: Tuner Gives Toyota Crown Sport The Ferrari Purosangue Overhaul It Deserves\n\nSure, anyone who can afford $400,000 for a new Ferrari SUV isn\u2019t going to choke on the idea of a $57k set of wheels or $61k with tires and accessories as badly as normal drivers who make regular money, but it\u2019s still a lot of cash, and something anyone who buys one of these cars used down the line when they become more affordable might want to bear in mind.\n\nBut in other respects, buying a used Purosangue might not be as risky as buying another expensive crossover or SUV if the first owner paid for the Power15 & Maintenance service and warranty package. It provides cover for an incredible 15 years from the point of delivery \u2013 though it won\u2019t pay to fix your curb rash\u2026\n\nImages: scuderiaparts.com, miller motorcars.com, Ferrari",

It's the first stop this year for the Toyota Series tour, which features 15 events and culminates with a championship in November.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAnglers in the tournament will compete for a grand prize of up to $100,000 in the pro division and a new Phoenix 518 Pro boat. The co-angler division features a $5,000 prize.\n\nThere's reason to believe that the tournament will produce big catches. Angler Wyatt Frankens dropped 29 pounds, 1 ounce on the scales earlier this month at a Phoenix Bass Fishing League event on San Rayburn, and the lake has kicked out some impressive numbers in seasons past.\n\nMarshall Hughes is seemingly always in the hunt for big prizes on Sam Rayburn.

Which, really don\u2019t see any 40-degree water temps normally. In the low 50s, those bigger fish, they just want to eat for some reason.\u201d\n\nMajor League Fishing is one of the world's premiere tournament-fishing organizations, producing more than 250 events annually and broadcasting to a national audience.

Members of the Kings Ice Crew, along with other members of the Kings organization, filled push carts with the items and packed three large box trucks before lunch on the first day alone, filled to capacity with donations from people who wanted to help.\n\nThe items were then transported to local YMCA\u2019s, who are distributing directly to those in need and delivering the resources to locations in the greatest need for help.\n\nOne member of the Ice Crew, Sierra Chavez, chose to help this weekend, despite having to evacuate her home earlier this week.\n\n\u201cI think when I woke up I just immediately was like okay, who needs help and how can we help them\u2026it feels like the only right thing to do at a time like this,\u201d Chavez said.\n\nKings fans and those all over Los Angeles have been arriving to donate their own items and also making wholesale club runs to buy necessities in bulk. Many parents are choosing to involve their children in the experience, hoping to teach the importance of showing up for one another.\n\nLeah Johnson, who works at a toy company down the street made multiple trips on Saturday to deliver baby formula, diapers, toys, and more.\n\n\u201cI was in the 1994 earthquake and we lost our home, so I am trying to teach my daughter about the true gift of giving and supporting the community,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThank you for doing this, and having a hub, it\u2019s been very moving to be able to participate.\u201d\n\nKings fans who came out received items like bobbleheads, ticket vouchers, and more, as a thank you for their donation, with Bailey making appearances throughout the week.\n\nCurrently the YMCA\u2019s are overwhelmed with clothing and bedding donations but are still in need of pet supplies, baby products, and other household items. Please check LaKings.com/FireRelief for the latest update on what is still needed.\n\nThe LA Kings Fire Relief Donation Drive will operate from 10 AM through 6 PM this week, with hours potentially extending into next week depending on demand.\n\nThank you to our firefighters, first responders, and all of your support.",

It's going to be your top 40 guys in the world against your top 40 bulls in the world,\" he said. \"When I say world, that's Australia, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, here in the United States.\"\n\nKasel's bull riding story started when he was just 13 years old. He admits he didn't know much about the sport back then, just that he had a dream.\n\n\"My parents did what they had to, to put the right people in front of me to be able to do this, and it's worked out, and I am thankful for that,\" he said.\n\nNow, Kasel has his sights set on one thing: a world title. But for him, it's about more than grit. It's about faith.\n\n\"If the Lord has that plan for me, that's going to be the case,\" he said.\n\nYou can still get tickets to the event for Saturday.\n\nFor news updates, follow Mayra Moreno on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

It's part of an umbrella settlement that also resolves civil claims brought by federal regulators and the state of California.\n\nThe company is paying a total of $1.6 billion in fines and penalties, including the second-largest criminal fine the Environmental Protection Agency has ever leveled for vehicle-based Clean Air Act violations.\n\nAccording to complaints filed by regulators, the fraud involved more than 100,000 heavy-duty diesel trucks and off-road diesel engines. The vehicles did not pass state and federal emissions standards \u2014 but Hino submitted false data claiming they did.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThose vehicles are still safe to use, but Hino will offer free voluntary repairs for some vehicles, which California regulators say will not affect fuel economy or vehicle operation. There will not be any vehicle buy-backs.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Hino will also pay criminal fines and civil fees, pay more than $150 million to replace engines on ships and trains with cleaner versions, and fund hybrid and zero-emission buses and trucks in California. Those remedies are meant to balance out the excess pollution caused by the company's evasion of emissions standards. The company is also on probation for 5 years, during which it can't import any diesel engines to the U.S.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of crackdowns on companies that evade emissions tests, including a settlement with engine-maker Cummins and the infamous Volkswagen Dieselgate scandal .\n\nThere are several ways that companies can cheat on tests. In this case, Hino was supposed to submit their products to a battery of tests and then send the results to regulators for approval. But instead of sending the real test results, regulators discovered, the company repeatedly submitted false data \u2014 including altered data, data done through improperly conducted tests or data that was entirely fabricated without any testing at all.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRegulators at the California Air Resources Board say they \"found inconsistencies\" in Hino's data, and then worked with the EPA to uncover even more violations.\n\n\"EPA and the American consumer rely on true and accurate data from engine manufacturers to protect our nation's air quality,\" acting EPA administrator Jane Nishida said in a statement . \"Hino's actions directly undermined EPA's program to protect the public from air pollution.\"\n\nCalifornia was reviewing Hino's data because it \u2014 uniquely among U.S. states \u2014 can adopt and enforce emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government's. The state is a large auto market, and its regulations have a profound effect on the auto industry.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said he intends to roll back at least some of California's regulatory authorities. California is bracing to defend its rule-making powers, in a repeat of a legal fight that stretched through the first Trump administration.\n\nSatoshi Ogiso, the president and CEO of Hino Motors, called the agreement with regulators a \"significant milestone.\" \"We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and stakeholders,\" he wrote in a statement . \"In order to prevent a recurrence of this kind of issue, we have implemented company-wide reforms, including meaningful improvements to our internal culture, oversight, and compliance practices.\"",

The plea agreement, which is subject to court approval, requires the company to pay a criminal fine of $521.76 million, serve a five-year term of probation \u2014 during which it will be prohibited from importing any diesel engines it has made into the U.S. \u2014 and implement a comprehensive compliance and ethics program and reporting structure.\n\nHino has also agreed to a forfeiture money judgment against it in the amount of approximately $1.1 billion. As part of the plea deal, Hino\u2019s future payments towards its civil settlement obligations, as well future payments as part of a civil class action settlement brought by private plaintiffs, will be credited towards its criminal forfeiture money judgment obligation.\n\nThe Justice Department, Environmental Protection Agency, FBI, Customs and Border Protection, Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of Inspector General, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and State of California reached criminal and multiple civil resolutions with Japanese Hino, which are subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.\n\nIn separate civil resolutions of environmental, customs and fuel economy claims by the federal government and the State of California, Hino will pay a civil penalty of $525 million.\n\nHino, as part of its plea agreement, admitted to submitting and causing to be submitted false applications for engine certification approvals between 2010 and 2019. The company also admitted that it submitted fraudulent carbon dioxide emissions test data.\n\nHino said in a statement on Thursday that its agreements resolve all of the company\u2019s outstanding legal issues in the U.S. related to its legacy emissions issues.\n\n\u201cWe deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and stakeholders.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

The fines and penalties include a $525 million civil penalty from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the largest settlement in which NHTSA has been involved.\n\n\"This unlawful conduct allowed Hino, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp., to improperly secure approvals to import and sell, and cause to be imported and sold, more than 110,000 diesel engines in the United States from 2010 to 2022,\" the Justice Department said in a news release. \"These engines were primarily installed in heavy-duty trucks manufactured and sold by Hino nationwide.\"\n\nAdded FBI Director Christopher Wray, \"Hino Motors engaged in a years-long scheme to alter and fabricate emissions data in order to get a leg up over its competitors and boost their bottom line.\u201d\n\nIndustry site CBT News said the fines and penalties include $521.76 million in criminal penalties, $442.5 million in civil fines to U.S. authorities and $236.5 million to the state of California. Other costs involve recall and engine replacement programs. CBT said the California Air Resources Board initiated an investigation in 2019 of Hino\u2019s emissions data.\n\nA company-commissioned panel said in a report in 2022 Hino had falsified emissions data on some engines going back to at least 2003. The Justice Department said Hino had sold engines that did not comply beginning in 2010 through 2022.\n\n\u201cThis resolution is a significant milestone toward resolving legacy issues that we have worked hard to ensure are no longer a part of Hino\u2019s operations or culture,\" said Hino President and CEO Satoshi Ogiso. \"We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and stakeholders. In order to prevent a recurrence of this kind of issue, we have implemented companywide reforms, including meaningful improvements to our internal culture, oversight and compliance practices.\n\n\u201cWe take this resolution seriously and will ensure that the field fix, the Environmental Mitigation Program and further strengthening of our compliance system, which have been agreed as part of the resolutions, are implemented. We commit to moving forward as a company that can be of service to society,\" he added.\n\nMore: Interest rates down, car transaction prices down; monthly payments aren't. Here's why.\n\nMore: Honda\u2019s merger with Nissan looks like a disaster, but not all is lost\n\nToyota's truckmaking unit had agreed to a merger with Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus in 2023 but had to indefinitely postpone the deal while it dealt with the legal issue, Nikkei Asia reported. With the settlement, Hino Motors will move forward with the merger plan.\n\nThe scandal, which had to do with gasoline engine emission and fuel efficiency testing, came to light in 2022, Nikkei said. In Japan, Hino temporarily halted shipments of almost all of its trucks and buses.\n\nThe merger with Mitsubishi Fuso, part of Germany's Daimler Truck, will create the world's largest alliance for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, Nikkei said.\n\nThis story includes information from Reuters.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\n\"This right here is why I will never own a new Toyota Tacoma again, ever.\"\n\nThat's what Kyle Carter (@bigkrcarter) says in his TikTok video. He says, I have had this 2000 Toyota Tacoma for 3 years, never had a single issue (knock on wood). It's the second-best vehicle I've ever owned. (He doesn't say which was the first).\n\nFirst, Imagine driving your 2000 Toyota pickup and seeing lights flashing in your rearview mirror. You know you weren't speeding, so you aren't sure why you are getting pulled over by the police.\n\nHe walks up to your window and asks for your license and registration. He says do you know why I pulled you over? You say no, I don't. He says, \"You have a taillight out.\"\n\nYou breathe out a sigh of relief as he pulls away. Now fast forward to Saturday morning. You say to your six-year-old daughter, hey, jump in the truck with me; we are going to the parts store. She isn't all that excited, but you know your wife needs some alone time.\n\nSo, you jump in the truck for quality time with your daughter.\n\nKyle's interesting story begins here.\n\n\"So, my taillight is out. I was pulled over last night by a policeman, and he said, 'Your taillight is out.'\n\n\"Are you ready for this?\" he says as he taps his taillight with a screwdriver. He counts one-two-three-four as he shows the four screws on the taillight lens.\n\nHe takes out the four screws, takes the lens off, and can see the burned-out bulb. \"Four screws, and I can see the whole thing, and it pops right off.\"\n\nPush, turn, and he takes out the badly burned bulb. \"How about that? Look at how easy it was.\" He pulls out a package of new bulbs he purchased at O'Reilly Auto Parts. He puts the new bulb in and puts the lens on.\n\nKyle's daughter makes a cameo appearance; she is in the back seat and not impressed. However, her attitude improves when her dad lets her help him tighten the last screw.\n\nIt takes Kyle and his daughter about 3 minutes to replace the burned-out taillight bulb.\n\nHe turns on the Tacoma lights and shows that the new bulb works. \"See, the bulb is working even though it's bright outside.\"\n\n\"Look, there are some things on the new Tacomas that might be easy to fix, but this 2000 Tacoma I bought this thing because 90% of the stuff on this thing that it takes to maintain this truck I can do myself and save myself a lot of money.\"\n\nHow much did Kyle pay for his 2000 Tacoma?\n\nHe says, \"I paid $7,000 in early 2022 when it had 180,000 on the odometer. It was one owner with every maintenance record in the glove box for me to sift through. I knew exactly what I had found.\"\n\nHow much did the taillight bulb cost Kyle at O'Reilly Auto Parts?\n\nThe Sylvania 1157 Long Life Incandescent 2 bulb pack costs $6.49. It took him 20 minutes to run to the parts store, 3 minutes to install it, and he's done. He even installed it in the O'Reilly Auto Parts parking lot.\n\nHow much does a taillight bulb cost for a 2024 Toyota Tacoma?\n\nThe new Tacoma taillight bulbs start at $25.99, so it's around $20.00 more. Replacing the bulb yourself is not difficult and may take a few more minutes. So, overall, the new Tacoma is not that different.\n\nHow about routine maintenance on a 2024 Toyota Tacoma?\n\nA 2024 Toyota Tacoma pickup is relatively easy to maintain, with most basic maintenance tasks like oil changes and filter replacements being straightforward and accessible for DIY enthusiasts like Kyle.\n\nToyota recommends a 5,000, 10,000, and 30,000-mile scheduled service.\n\nOwners can easily do the 5,000-mile check, including checking all fluid levels and wiper blades. Toyota recommends tire rotation, which some customers can do themselves.\n\nThe 10,000-mile service is relatively easy.\n\nAn oil change is a highlight of the 2024 Toyota Tacoma's 10,000-mile service. Toyota recommends an oil change and oil filter every 10,000 miles. If you drive on dirt or dusty roads, it's every 5,000 miles.\n\nMany owners can change the oil and filter. Toyota also recommends changing the cabin air filter, an often overlooked service item.\n\nToyota also recommends a detailed inspection of the truck's brake rotors and pads. Another easy inspection the owner can do.\n\nThe 30,000-mile service is more involved.\n\nA 30,000-mile service on the Tacoma pickup requires the propeller shaft bolt to be retorqued. Toyota says to change the engine air filter and inspect the rear differential oil, exhaust pipes and mountings, steering gear, engine coolant, fuel tank cap gasket, brake lines and hoses, and automatic transmission fluid.\n\nConsumer Reports gives the 2000 Toyota a 38/100 reliability rating, so Kyle could face expensive repair bills.\n\nHowever, there is a significant reason Kyle does not want to buy a new 2024 Toyota Tacoma. The 2024 Toyota Tacoma's reliability is worse.\n\nConsumer Reports says the 2024-2025 Toyota Tacoma will be less reliable than the average new car, with a reliability score of only 27/100. CR says this prediction is based on data from the 2024 model.\n\nWhat are the most common trouble spots with the new Tacoma?\n\nThe 2024-2025 Tacoma gets a 1/5 score for its fit, finish, or build quality. This includes noises, rattles, and leaks. I know that the sunroof is a major issue reported by many owners. It has a severe leaking problem. Read my report here for more information.\n\nAnother trouble spot is the 8-speed automatic transmission. Consumer Reports gives the new Tacoma a 3/5 score because it could have major transmission issues.\n\nI reported on the Tacoma transmission problems and Toyota reliability in my report here titled, Toyota is Desperately Trying to Stop Their Brand Image From Taking a Straight Dumpster Dive, Now The Tacoma Transmissions Are Failing.\n\nConclusion.\n\nShould you buy a 2024-2025 Toyota Tacoma or keep your older Tacoma pickup?\n\nKyle says he loves his 2000 Tacoma and wouldn't ever trade it in for a new truck. Owning a new Tacoma is even more expensive when you consider that insurance, license plates, taxes, and financing are significant expenses when purchasing a new truck.\n\nKyle finishes by saying, \"It's truly maddening. Every time I see a Tesla Cybertruck, I'm like - nah, I'm good; I need to go back and get a computer engineering degree to work on that thing.\"\n\nCheck out this Tesla Cybertruck story. Rebecca just bought a 2024 Cybertruck and says the cost to insure the electric truck is half her mortgage payment.

            "content": "Generally speaking, nobody mistakes a Toyota for a Ferrari. But at this year's Tokyo Auto Salon, an SUV with yellow shields, a bold face, and quad exhaust tips sticking out of a slick lower fascia appeared on the show floor. And it wasn't a Purosangue.\n\nThe faux Ferrari was created by Aero Over, a Japanese-based tuner offering a range of aesthetic and mechanical upgrades for a wide variety of vehicles. The car you see here is actually a Toyota Crown Sport, shod in a number of cosmetic changes. You might surprised to learn just how little it takes to turn the JDM crossover into an Italian stallion\u2014in appearance, anyway.\n\nAccording to the company's website, A new front spoiler gives the Crown a rounded Purosangue-esque face. It simply bolts onto the existing grille, adding a bit more depth to the front without making extensive changes. The Crown's upper grille and headlights are untouched, reminding us that even without this add-on, there's a striking resemblance between the two vehicles.\n\nThe only other item listed on the company's website is a sticker set that mimics the yellow Ferrari shield. One attaches to the upper fascia between the headlights, with the other two taking up positions on the fenders. For obvious reasons, they don't use Ferrari branding. But at a glance, they sure look the part. We wouldn't be the least bit surprised if Ferrari is already drafting up a cease-and-desist order over this.\n\nWhat about the upgraded rear fascia and exhasut? There's no listing for those on Aero Over's website, but the video above from Instagram clearly shows a mildly updated backside with the quad tips. Whether they'll be offered in the future is anyone's guess.\n\nAs it stands, you can buy the front spoiler and stickers for 83,600 yen, which converts to a whopping $534. That's a shockingly small price to make your Crown Sport look remarkably similar to a Purosangue. But alas, Toyota doesn't sell this version of the Crown in America. We'll have to stick with the real-deal Ferrari, then.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nSource: Aero Over via The Drive\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Toyota Europe\u2019s marketing director, Andrea Carlucci, told Autocar that he expected the bZ4X to \u201cremain a bit isolated\u201d in its lineup.\n\n2025 Toyota bZ4X Limited AWD (Source: Toyota)\n\nCarlucci explained that using words for names, rather than a number system, was \u201ca clear request from Europe that was very much heard and followed by Japan\u201d for its EVs.\n\nThe news comes after Toyota unveiled its new Urban Cruiser electric SUV last month, an unofficial successor to the gas-powered model retired in 2014. Toyota\u2019s new electric SUV will also be the first of its partnership with Suzuki to be made in India. It will be based on the same platform as the Suzuki e-Vitara.\n\nToyota Urban Cruiser electric SUV (Source: Toyota)\n\nToyota\u2019s European marketing boss said the company\u2019s expertise in batteries and energy management has already \u201ccreated a lot of trust from customers\u201d with hybrids.\n\n\u201cToyota knows better than anyone about how to manage a battery, how to make it stable and so on,\u201d Carlucci added.\n\n2025 Toyota bZ4X Nightshade edition (Source: Toyota)\n\nMeanwhile, Public Citizen found that Toyota donated the most funds to climate deniers in the US Congress of any automaker.\n\nIn the US, Toyota cut prices by up to $6,000 on the 2025 bZ4X to boost demand. The 2025 model now starts at just over $37,000 with up to 252 miles range.\n\nWhat names do you think Toyota should revive for future EVs? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",

            "content": "Toyota showed off a lot of interesting stuff at the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, but the displays and information from the Gazoo Racing division were clearly the most exciting. For one, a software upgrade for the GR86 was revealed that improves accelerator response (and, Toyota says, thus improves downshifts in manual cars), an aero package prototype for the awesome but forbidden-to-U.S. GR Yaris, and a bunch of motorsports parts for both cars that can be purchased separately. But the highlight, for us, is the GR Yaris concept seen above. Look closely\u2014that\u2019s an engine in the back! And it\u2019s not the GR Yaris\u2019 typical I-3, either; it\u2019s a brand new motor, and this is its first known application.\n\nToyota first discussed the new 2.0-liter I-4 back in May, revealing it to be a more compact, efficient, and powerful alternative to the familiar 2.4-liter turbo engine family that is found in all sorts of current Toyotas and Lexus products, such as the Toyota Tacoma, Land Cruiser, Grand Highlander, RX, and others. That sounds great, but it turns out this isn\u2019t just a consumer-grade engine for trucks and SUVs. Toyota will plop it into a GR Yaris, the M Concept, and send it out in the Super Taikyu racing series to prove itself in competition.\n\nNor will it be mounted up front, like the current GR Yaris\u2019 turbo I-3 (and our American-market, delightfully unhinged GR Corolla with the Yaris' same engine). Instead, in the tradition of batpoop-mad rally cars of yore, the old I-3 is scooped out of the engine compartment, and the new I-4 and its attendant transaxle are plopped in the back. Instead of an engine, that nose compartment now houses the \u201crear\u201d differential. Basically, it\u2019s like Toyota dropped the GR Yaris\u2019 drivetrain out the bottom, turned the car around, and bolted it back together.\n\nNot to minimize the engineering challenges at all. In addition to making the powertrain fit and send power to the opposite wheels as originally intended, you also have to make the thing handle. But given how hilariously great the GR Corolla is, we think that a smaller, more powerful, mid-engined, all-wheel-drive hatchback assembled from similar bits would have to be that much better.\n\nJapanese media outlets have reported even further details that, if confirmed, could make this humble Yaris hatchback into a real giant-slayer. Car Watch reports that the rear chassis is derived from Toyota\u2019s GA-C platform, like the Prius, to use its double-wishbone suspension. And while 400 hp is apparently the target output for production engines in the highest state of tune, the pumped-up racing version, according to Car Watch and other outlets, should be capable of 600 hp\u2014or more.\n\nWe\u2019re a long way away from an understanding of what this mid-engine concept super-hatch and its newly developed 2.0-liter turbo-four can tell us about any future American-market products, but Toyota and Gazoo Racing certainly have our attention. And a new, high-performance turbo gas engine\u2014particularly one that Toyota is revealing first in a midship configuration\u2014won't do anything to quiet the rumors of the return of the Celica or MR2. Not that we'd want it to!",

But you don't need to be some engineer or strategy lead or highly-paid consultant to know where the roadblocks are: high battery costs make the cars too expensive, the charging infrastructure isn't everywhere yet and modern battery chemistries put limits on how far people can drive.\n\nThat's the obvious stuff. The other, less-known part of the equation is how cars are built, including to mitigate some of those roadblocks. And that's where the company that once hit reset on modern car manufacturing is struggling as much as anyone.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nWelcome back to Critical Materials, our morning roundup of auto industry and technology news. Also on deck today: the unclear future of Volvo and Polestar under this supposed U.S. ban on Chinese car technology, and how Porsche's electrified vehicle sales netted out in 2024. Let's dig in.\n\n30%: Toyota's 'Dilemma': How To Make EVs\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs Toyota bZ4X Cutaway\n\nYou may recall some stories from as far back as 2023 about how Toyota engineers were stunned when they performed teardowns (literally taking a competitor's car apart to see how they're made) of popular models from Tesla and China's electric automakers. Automakers do that all of the time, but when Toyota's engineers saw how differently these cars were made, it was the kind of wake-up call that no business wants to get.\n\nBut this excellent Bloomberg Businessweek story goes much deeper into detail about how Toyota is trying to catch up to new construction methods in the EV era\u2014and whether it even can. In fact, it's probably the best story I've read on this subject yet. A subscription may be required, but it is worth a read in full.\n\nHere's one excerpt, highlighting a seemingly anodyne part of any car: the 20-pound steel cross-bar at the front of the vehicle.\n\nToday\u2019s standard cross-car beam is the product of incremental improvements made across decades, and most versions of it have wound up under the hoods of internal combustion cars. This is a testament to the Toyota Production System, which continuously refines even the tiniest details of individual auto parts. Over untold iterations, the beam has been designed to keep the vibrations of an internal combustion engine from making their way to the passengers. But electric motors don\u2019t vibrate, and steel is heavy. These are among the reasons why Tesla Inc. and BYD Co., the top makers of battery-electric vehicles, manufacture similar beams out of plastic. Theirs weigh only about 14 pounds, according to Caresoft, and they\u2019re cheaper and easier to install, too. It\u2019s a change that sounds so simple once you hear it, and intuitive, perhaps, if you\u2019ve never dealt with a gas engine. If you\u2019ve spent a lifetime thinking in terms of micro-improvements\u2014the core of kaizen, the philosophy that underpins the Toyota Production System, or TPS\u2014it\u2019s an insight that might well prove elusive. \u201cYou cannot kaizen yourself from an ICE vehicle to a BEV,\u201d says Caresoft President Terry Woychowski, a former General Motors Co. executive. \u201cThat is the dilemma for Toyota.\u201d\n\nNow apply that lesson to the entire car. You see the problem here?\n\nWhat Tesla pioneered, and what Chinese automakers have run with, is a clean-sheet, top-to-bottom reset of how a car is built from the ground up\u2014not with decades of carmaking tradition behind it but starting with the idea of a profitable battery-powered vehicle and going from there.\n\nThat's essential because batteries are expensive and they will be for some time. So in order to actually make money on EVs, automakers have to streamline, cut costs and reinvent in other ways. This is part of why so many new EVs in particular just have screens and very few buttons. And so much is now made in-house, which runs counter to decades of outsourcing to countless third-party supplier companies.\n\nAs that story notes, a clean-sheet reinvention of everything isn't how Toyota's \"kaizen,\" or continuous improvement of existing systems, is supposed to work. Nor is it how Toyota has trained generations of engineers, product planners and businesspeople around the world. And that's a system copied by nearly every other automaker out there; it is why Toyota's being singled out here. It's the company that taught the world how to make modern cars, and now modern cars are increasingly built in a different way. (This is also why Ford is doing its \"skunkworks\" EV project, although the status of that is anyone's guess lately.)\n\nToyota clearly isn't taking this lying down. Chairman Akio Toyoda balked at the idea that the Toyota Production System and \"kaizen\" cannot figure out the future:\n\nWhen a reporter asked whether the debacle meant Toyota\u2019s production philosophy was butting up against its limits, Toyoda fixed him with a cold stare and replied, \u201cThat\u2019s completely wrong.\u201d His team was hard at work, he said, using kaizen principles to resolve whatever problems might be at issue, just as it always had. [...] \u201cJapan\u2019s automobile industry has been able to become a global leader, but now it\u2019s on the defensive,\u201d says former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa. \u201cIt\u2019s not very good at fundamentally rethinking things and learning from that. But no other country has such a deep bench of engineers of such quality. With an open mind to learning, they will still be able to do very well.\u201d\n\nNow, I took issue with some of that story, including an unfair dredging up of Toyota's recall crisis in the 2010s or saying Toyoda has an \"aversion to a fundamental rethink of the family business\"; the dude was just out there at CES showing off a city of the future and investing in space travel. Everything I've seen indicates Toyota is serious about the future of mobility. It even reports that Toyota engineers are already using \"some very un-kaizen workarounds\" to make the bZ4X better.\n\nBut the point is this: it's no longer about just competing with Tesla. It's now about the Chinese auto industry that's far bigger than any on earth and has a dozen Teslas waiting in the wings to steal Toyota's market share globally. And the machine that changed the world can't figure that out, everyone else is cooked too.\n\n60%: What Now, Volvo And Polestar?\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs 2024 Volvo EX30\n\nMeanwhile, here in the U.S., the Biden administration may have just effectively banned all Chinese cars from our roads. But here's the fun part: nobody seems to know what the hell is going on. You can get up to speed (such as it is) with the story I just linked to, but we reached out to the two major players probably impacted here\u2014Volvo and Polestar\u2014to ask what's up.\n\nAnd they don't seem to know either. Here's what a Volvo Cars USA spokesperson told InsideEVs: \"We are reviewing the rule from the U.S. Commerce Department. It is too early to speculate about potential consequences.\" As for Polestar, it has not returned our requests for comment. (Update: Polestar did respond, but has declined to comment.)\n\nVery few Chinese-made cars are even sold in the U.S. One is the Polestar 2, which is kind of being de-prioritized for the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 due to tariff issues (among other things), and the Volvo EX30, which barely just went on sale after being delayed due to the same thing. That car just can't catch a break.\n\nAs The Verge noted, it's basically up to the incoming Trump administration to enforce this. Polestar has an update on its business coming tomorrow morning. We may know more then.\n\n90%: Porsche's Overall Electrified Sales Up In 2024\n\nPorsche Taycan Efficiency\n\nMeanwhile, we know that Porsche had a not-great year on the EV front in 2024, on the heels of getting the updated Taycan out to customers and declining demand in China. But here's a silver lining: the sales of electrified cars (EVs, hybrids and plug-in hybrids) still saw a respectable sales increase in 2024. From a Porsche spokesperson: \"On a global basis (the numbers for which are released) the share of electrified cars sold increased from 22% to 27%. Almost half of these were purely electric vehicles.\"\n\nI'm excited for the new hybrid 911 and I hope the Taycan finds its footing. It's still one of the best EVs you can buy, full-stop.\n\n100%: The Case For Toyota\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs Toyota EV Platform\n\nWhat doesn't get a ton of play in that Bloomberg Businessweek story is how Toyota is actively working on its own ground-up EV platform. It mentions solid-state batteries, which will be a game-changing breakthrough if anyone can nail it down, but Toyota does have more Chinese-style EVs in the works. I've seen elements of these prototypes myself in Japan.\n\nThe question is, can Toyota get this stuff to market, profitably and in volume, in time to counter the likes of BYD? What do you think about that?

The Japanese auto giant has spent the past several years quietly building a powerful U.S. influence operation to weaken climate policy. Among automakers, Toyota has become the largest funder of climate deniers in Congress[1] and the most ardent opponent of climate protections.[2] After the 2024 election, with Toyota\u2019s climate-denying allies in power, the company is poised to dismantle climate policy.\n\nWhile Toyota bills itself as a climate leader, it has long failed to make the needed transition to electric vehicles, instead investing in decades-old gas-powered hybrid technology, as well as hydrogen-powered vehicles that have failed in the marketplace. It is a risky strategy that has left Toyota vulnerable to an influx of competitors who have leapfrogged the auto giant to build the next generation of vehicles. Instead of innovating, Toyota has bankrolled lobbyists and climate-hostile lawmakers to help it defeat EVs[3]. Our analysis found:\n\nOver the last three electoral cycles, Toyota has become the top auto industry financier of climate deniers[4]. It has helped to finance campaigns of 207 climate-denying congressional candidates, more than twice as many as Ford and nearly 50% more than General Motors, the only other automakers with federal political action committees (PACs). [5]\n\nIn the most recent electoral cycle, Toyota widened the gap, donating to more than four times as many climate deniers as Ford and nearly twice as many as GM. It contributed $271,000\u2014nine times as much in funds as Ford\u2019s $29,500 and over twice as much as GM\u2019s $128,500. [6]\n\nIn recent years, Toyota has emerged as the automaker most aggressively opposed to EVs. With its allies entering power in the White House and Congress, Toyota is poised to help dismantle climate policy that threatens its business model.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u201cIf our PAC [political action committee] was a brand, what would that brand be? What would it stand for?\u2026 We never focus on making our PAC bigger. We focus on making our PAC better\u2026A better PAC in terms of the image that we have.\u201d\n\nThis is Stephen Ciccone, the longtime Vice President of Public Affairs for Toyota Motors North America. With an angular jaw and a tightly drawn ponytail, he looks like Terry Silver, the villain from Karate Kid III. Ciccone spoke in spring of 2015 where the Public Affairs Council had just granted Toyota its inaugural award for \u201cOutstanding Corporate PAC.\u201d Ciccone was advising other Public Affairs Council members on how to responsibly grow their PACs.\n\nIn hindsight, his warning sounds prescient: \u201cOver time a PAC evolves. And that\u2019s normally a good thing, but over time it can also evolve in strange directions and lose its way.\u201d As this report will reveal, Toyota did not just lose its way under Ciccone\u2019s leadership; it changed directions and is now taking a route that is dangerous for communities and the planet.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest automaker has quietly spent the past decade building a powerful U.S. influence operation to try to delay the EV transition. It is bankrolling an army of climate denying lawmakers and lobbying aggressively against emissions and fuel economy standards. After the 2024 election, with Toyota\u2019s allies entering power, the company is better positioned than ever to weaken auto climate policy. However, it is a risky strategy. Toyota\u2019s failure to build EVs has left it vulnerable to competitors who have embraced the next generation of vehicles.\n\nFunding Climate Deniers\n\nBy The Numbers\n\nOver the last three electoral cycles, Toyota has become the top auto industry financier of climate deniers, with its political action committee spending $808,500 to support climate deniers, ahead of General Motors at $670,000 and more than double Ford\u2019s expenditure of $387,500. (Chart 1) Among those elections, dating back to the 2019-2020 cycle, Toyota was the leading supporter of climate deniers among the three automakers with federal political action committees (PACs). (Chart 2) Toyota backed 207 climate-denying political campaigns over the past three election cycles, compared with 137 campaigns for General Motors and 103 campaigns for Ford (these calculations include re-election campaigns by the same candidate backed in a prior cycle).\n\nChart 1: Total Amount Donated to Climate Deniers by Automaker PAC, Cycle, and Congress\n\nChart 2: Number of Climate Denier Recipients by Automaker PAC, Cycle, and Congress\n\n\n\nToyota also ramped up its funding to Republicans and cut funding to Democrats, helping to cement a Republican trifecta. While in the previous two cycles Toyota donated relatively evenly to both parties, this cycle it contributed over 60% to Republicans. In contrast, this cycle GM gave nearly 43% and Ford gave nearly 46% of its individual PAC contributions to Republicans. Toyota contributed nearly twice as much as GM and nearly nine times as much as Ford to GOP congressional candidates.[7]\n\nA Few of Toyota\u2019s Climate Deniers\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA)\n\n2024 cycle donations from Toyota: $10,000 (maximum amount allowed)\n\nIn a town hall, Johnson said \u201cThe climate is changing, but the question is, is it being caused by natural cycles in the atmosphere over the span of the Earth\u2019s history? Or is it changing because we drive SUVs? I don\u2019t believe in the latter. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the primary driver.\u201d He has also led the effort to try to strip funding for green energy from the IRA.\n\nRep. Jason Smith (R-MO)\n\n2024 cycle donations from Toyota: $10,000 (maximum amount allowed).\n\nSmith has called for eliminating the EPA and introduced legislation to end EV tax credits. Smith has laughed at the science behind climate change, tweeting \u201cSaw these Missouri cows this morning. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell them their gases are the cause of climate change\u2026\u201d\n\nRep. David Schweikert (R-AZ)\n\n2024 cycle donations from Toyota: $7,000.\n\nIn 2020, Rep. Schweikert was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine for misusing official funds . That did not stop Toyota from donating to Rep. Schweikert, an avowed climate denier who had served as chairman of the subcommittee of the environment. \u201cI don\u2019t see the data,\u201d Rep. Schweikert said in an interview. \u201c\u2026I think it\u2019s incredibly arrogant, you know, for the Al Gores of the world to stand up and say the world\u2019s coming to an end.\u201d\n\nTop 20 Climate Deniers Receiving PAC Contributions from Toyota, 2019-2024\n\nCandidate Body State Toyota 20-24 James Comer (R) House Kentucky $24,000 David Schweikert (R) House Arizona $23,500 Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R) House Washington $22,000 Tom McClintock (R) House California $21,000 Ann Wagner (R) House Missouri $20,000 Mike Kelly (R) House Pennsylvania $19,000 Larry Bucshon (R) House Indiana $18,500 John Moolenaar (R) House Michigan $17,500 Pete Sessions (R) House Texas $17,000 Beth Van Duyne (R) House Texas $17,000 Darrell E Issa (R) House California $17,000 Alex Mooney (R) House West Virginia $16,500 Jodey Arrington (R) House Texas $16,000 Darin LaHood (R) House Illinois $15,000 Jason Smith (R) House Missouri $15,000 Rodney Davis (R) House Illinois $15,000 Richard Hudson (R) House North Carolina $14,500 Bill Huizenga (R) House Michigan $14,000 Mitch McConnell (R) Senate Kentucky $14,000 Dan Crenshaw (R) House Texas $14,000\n\nSource: Public Citizen analysis of OpenSecrets campaign finance data.\n\nToyota\u2019s Ace in the Hole\n\nToyota\u2019s anti-climate influence is even larger than the numbers suggest. Not included in Public Citizen\u2019s tally is Toyota\u2019s support of candidates like car dealer mogul and Senator-elect Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), who have not publicly denied climate change, but have committed themselves to undermining and reversing climate action.\n\nAuto dealers played an important role in Moreno\u2019s campaign, serving as major donors and validators who defended Moreno against attacks from his opponent, Senator Sherrod Brown. After his victory in one of the most high-profile senate races in the nation, The Detroit Free Press wrote that Moreno\u2019s \u201cclosest relationships now are with leaders at Toyota Motor North America, which he said helped organize the coalition of car dealers that supported his Senate run.\u201d\n\nNoting that Toyota has been an outlier in its refusal to build electric vehicles, Moreno said that \u201cthe winner in this whole thing [eliminating the $7,500 federal rebate for EVs] will probably be Toyota because they were the one company that said, \u2018We\u2019re just not going to do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nLobbying Against the Future\n\nOn the Offensive\n\nToyota took aim at climate policy just days after the election and has signaled that it will ramp up its lobbying even further. With a favorable incoming Congress and administration, Toyota has wasted no time cozying up to the Trump transition team and working to water down the Biden administration\u2019s fuel economy and emission standards.\n\nJust three days after the November election, Toyota Motor North America Chief Operating Officer Jack Hollis railed against California and the EPA\u2019s tailpipe emissions standards on a call with reporters. Falsely referring to them as \u201cEV mandates,\u201d he said, \u201cThese EV mandates were an attempt to change the entire landscape of the industry, to remove customer choice.\u201d Just five days after that, the Japanese news outlet Nikkei published a story detailing Japanese automakers\u2019 plans to ramp up lobbying in the second Trump administration. In late November, Hollis wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled \u201cTrump Can Get EVs Back on Track,\u201d calling on the new administration to dismantle the Biden-era policies that encourage automakers to reduce emissions, complaining that \u201cunrealistic regulations favor one carbon-reducing option over, and at the expense of, all others.\u201d On Christmas Eve, Toyota announced it was donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nShortly after the election, Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the main auto industry lobby in the U.S., called on the incoming Trump administration to preserve the $7,500 EV tax credits enshrined in the Inflation Reduction Act. The credit has been key to growing EV adoption in the U.S. In 2023, the first full year of the credit, EV sales shot up by 46%. The latest data from Kelley Blue Book shows EV sales reached record highs in Q3 of 2024, attributing much of this growth to \u201cincentives and discounts.\u201d The National Bureau of Economic Research has estimated that if the Trump administration and Congress eliminate the credit, EV sales would drop by 27%.\n\nShortly after AAI called on Trump to preserve the credit, Toyota publicly broke with the group, calling on the Trump team to water down the credit so that its hybrids can qualify. As auto analyst Alan Baum noted, \u201cObviously that\u2019s somewhat self-serving.\u201d Serving its own short-term gains at the cost of the climate has been at the core of Toyota\u2019s strategy for the past decade.\n\nGlobal Influence\n\nInstead of embracing a green energy future, Toyota has aggressively lobbied to delay and weaken climate action. In 2022, InfluenceMap named Toyota the third worst company in the world\u2013after Chevron and Exxon\u2013for its anti-climate lobbying. It has routinely ranked as the worst automaker for its anti-climate lobbying. As InfluenceMap notes in its May 2024 scorecard, Toyota had a busy year[8]. The company once again received a D, the lowest score amongst all automakers, and was fueling opposition to climate regulations around the world. The scorecard highlights Toyota\u2019s lobbying efforts against emissions standards in the U.S. and Australia and against EV mandates in Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as Toyota\u2019s success in weakening emissions stands in the U.S. and fuel efficiency standards in Australia.\n\nAll-powerful in Japan\n\nToyota is especially powerful in Japan. It is by far the nation\u2019s largest company, with revenue more than twice and market cap nearly twice that of the closest runner-up. It holds the kind of cultural cache that can only be compared to General Motors in its heyday, which has given Toyota an immense amount of political power.\n\nNo corporation gives more than Toyota to the LDP, the pro-business party that has ruled Japan for most of the past 70 years. The only group to donate more in 2023 was JAMA, the Japanese auto industry trade group that Akio Toyoda chaired from 2012 to 2014 and from 2018 to 2023. Collectively, the Toyoda family has chaired the powerful trade group for over twenty years.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Japan was set to phase out the sale of polluting combustion engine vehicles by 2035\u2014a few months before California made that historic commitment. But at the last minute, Akio Toyoda, then Toyota\u2019s CEO, met Akira Amari, a key official from Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and intervened to ensure that the government did not fully ban fossil-fueled cars.\n\nIn an LDP policy meeting the next day, Amari shared Toyoda\u2019s message with his colleagues: \u201cI spoke with Chairman Toyoda yesterday and he said that JAMA cannot endorse a government that rejects hybrids\u2026If we don\u2019t make that clear, JAMA will push back with all its might,\u201d Amari said, according to notes and audio of the meeting. After Toyoda\u2019s message, officials changed the document to eliminate its zero-emission goal.\n\nAn Aggressive Outlier\n\nToyota is attempting to exert the same kind of overpowering political influence in the U.S. as it has at home. Between 2019 and 2023 it spent over $31 million just on federal lobbying. That was second only to GM and is significantly more than every other automaker. Much of that lobbying focused on weakening fuel economy and pollution standards and tailpipe emissions rules, according to lobbying records.\n\nToyota is also the only major automaker that has failed to set a target for 100% EVs. That is likely because the company has made bad business decisions on EVs for a decade or more and is simply far behind its competitors.\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, in 2023 Toyota spent $6.3 million on lobbying \u201crelated to greenhouse gas emissions standards\u201d and \u201csupply chain issues impacting the auto industry, including critical minerals for EVs.\u201d\n\nIn the leaked memo, Toyota\u2019s chief lobbyist Stephen Ciccone emphasized how uncommonly aggressive Toyota has been in fighting climate policy: \u201cFor more than two years, Toyota and our dealer partners have stood alone in the fight against unrealistic BEV [Battery Electric Vehicle] mandates\u2026We have taken a lot of hits from environmental activists, the media, and some politicians. But we have not\u2014and we will not\u2014back down.\u201d Falsely referring to emissions standards as an \u201cunrealistic government mandate,\u201d Ciccone said that the regulations create an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d for the auto industry.\n\nOut on a Limb\n\nAs Ciccone notes, Toyota has been an outlier in opposing climate action, even among automakers. In 2020 Toyota declined to join the compromise agreement that other automakers reached with California on emissions standards that were \u201cexpected to be a model for new standards from the Biden administration.\u201d Even the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI), a powerful industry group that regularly lobbies against climate action, publicly supported the deal. However, AAI \u201cargued in closed-door meetings in Washington that the California compromise\u2026 [was] in fact not feasible for all of its members.\u201d When AAI made that argument, its chairman was none other than Chris Reynolds, a longtime Toyota North America executive who oversees Toyota\u2019s lobbying efforts.\n\nFederal lobbying disclosures are opaque and do not reveal which side of an issue a company takes. However, the formal written comments that Toyota\u2019s lobbyists submit to government agencies give insight into the company\u2019s attempts to influence policy and regulation. One illustrative example is this 94-page comment on the EPA\u2019s proposed light-duty and medium-duty vehicle emissions standards. Tom Stricker, Toyota\u2019s VP for Sustainability and Regulatory Affairs, advocates for looser emissions standards and argues that including electric vehicles in the calculation of achievable emissions is illegal.\n\nThat advocacy has borne results. During the Biden administration, lobbying from Toyota and others forced the EPA to weaken an ambitious EPA plan to limit vehicle emissions. The changes slow the adoption of more stringent vehicle pollution limits, making it easier for EV laggards like Toyota to meet regulations without building electric vehicles.\n\nToyota has also fought to undermine states\u2019 climate standards. Under the Clean Air Act, since the 1970s states have been allowed to set their own emissions standards. However, in 2019 then-President Trump sought to revoke that right as part of an effort to roll back Obama-era rules. While Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, and BMW all sided with California, Toyota sued the state. Unlike GM, which initially sided with the Trump administration before quickly reversing itself after pledging to sell only electric vehicles by 2035, Toyota spent three years fighting California before finally acknowledging the state\u2019s long-held right to regulate its own emissions.\n\nNow another fight is brewing. On December 13, 2024 the Supreme Court announced that it would decide whether a challenge to EPA\u2019s approval of California\u2019s emission standards could proceed, and five days later the EPA granted California a new waiver allowing it to enforce another state policy\u2013Clean Cars II\u2013which required EPA approval. That rule would require all new light duty vehicles to have zero emissions by 2035. With Toyota champing at the bit, it is primed to play a key role in the fight to weaken emissions and fuel economy standards.\n\nAn EV Laggard\n\nStalled out on EVs\n\nHow did we get here? Why did Toyota go from the green darling that made the Prius to aligning itself with climate deniers? In short, it adopted a deeply misguided business model, then created an aggressive influence operation to defend itself from suffering the consequences of its mistakes.\n\nWhile Toyota bills itself as a climate leader, it has long failed to make the needed transition to electric vehicles, instead doubling down on decades-old gas-powered hybrid technology. Toyota was an innovator when it introduced the Prius in 1997, but in recent decades, it has fallen to the back of the pack. In this era of rapid energy transition, Toyota has \u201csubstantially miscalculated\u201d its approach to electric vehicles. Toyota\u2019s longtime CEO Akio Toyoda, who led his grandfather\u2019s company for almost 14 years before stepping down in April 2023, is well-known for his deep dislike of EVs. Even as Chairman of the Board, he is continuing to rail against electric vehicles.\n\nUnder Toyoda\u2019s guidance, the automaker has fallen far behind its rivals on electric vehicles. In 2023, fewer than 1% of the 11.2 million vehicles that Toyota sold were fully electric, far behind the global average of 11.1%. That is also far behind the U.S. average, where in Q3 of 2024 EVs accounted for a record high of 8.9% of all new car sales.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that has made it difficult to reduce its carbon footprint. In late November, Toyota Motor North America admitted that it is failing its embarrassingly modest goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 15% from 2018 to 2026. In fact, it is emitting more than it was two years before.\n\nBut Toyota doubtless has a greater concern: EV adoption is proceeding so rapidly that it may be impossible for an automaker that makes so few EVs to remain a market-leader in sales. Hence Toyota\u2019s need to slow EV adoption by any means necessary \u2014 including by supporting aggressive climate deniers.\n\nThe Mirage of Mirai\n\nInstead of building EVs, Toyota has invested in carbon-intensive hydrogen-powered vehicles that have failed miserably in the marketplace. Toyota started developing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) in 1992 and introduced the Mirai, its HFCV, in 2014. Since then it has sold fewer than 25,000 units. It has been so hard to sell the $66,000 vehicle that Toyota has cut the sticker price by $40,000, adding in $15,000 in free hydrogen, and offering a 0% loan. All in all, Toyota is offering the Mirai, which ironically means \u201cfuture\u201d in Japanese, for $11,000. Even with that sweetheart deal, Toyota can\u2019t seem to give away the Mirai, with sales dropping by 74% in Q1 of 2024. Even Toyota has admitted that its HFCV sales have \u201cnot been successful.\u201d\n\nThere are just 60 hydrogen refueling stations in all of the U.S. and Canada. Mirai drivers claim that prior to buying their vehicles, Toyota assured them that fueling with hydrogen was \u201cseamless,\u201d but Toyota\u2019s infrastructure is so sparse and fault-ridden that they filed a class-action lawsuit against the automaker.\n\nToyota drivers are not the only ones up in arms. Ahead of the Paris Olympics, which Toyota sponsored, 120 scientists, engineers, and academics wrote an open letter to organizers calling on them to drop the Mirai as the official vehicle of the games. That is because over 99% of hydrogen is made with fossil fuels and hydrogen production emits about as much annually as all global aviation, making hydrogen vehicles far dirtier than EVs. Like Toyota\u2019s broader greenwashing strategy, the Mirai presents a veneer of green energy but is actually just a mirage.\n\nMisleading Consumers\n\nAs Public Citizen noted in our December complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, Toyota has deceptively marketed its gas-powered hybrids as EVs instead of investing in electric vehicles. In the decade between 2013 and 2022\u2013the most recent available year\u2013Toyota spent $17.2 billion on marketing. Much of its advertising budget has gone toward sleek campaigns that use terms like \u201celectrified\u201d and \u201cbeyond zero\u201d to deceive consumers into believing that its gasoline-powered hybrids are electric. Toyota uses lightning bolts and plugs and words like \u201crange\u201d to describe vehicles with internal combustion engines that do not plug in.\n\nMisleading the public appears to be Toyota\u2019s modus operandi. In 2022 Toyota subsidiary Hino Motors admitted to cheating on up to 20 years of emissions tests. In 2023 Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu shut all four of its factories in Japan amidst a government probe that forced the automaker to admit that it cheated on thirty years of crash tests. Last January Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda was forced to apologize for cheating on engine testing that led the Japanese government to raid one of its plants. Less than six months later, he was forced to apologize again, this time for \u201cmassive cheating on certification tests for seven vehicle models\u201d that led to Toyota suspending production on three models. Investors have not been impressed, leading Mr. Toyoda to admit that \u201cthere has never been a director at Toyota with such a low approval rate before\u201d and \u201cif we continue at this pace, I will no longer be able to serve as a director next year.\u201d\n\nThe Next Kodak?\n\nIn 1975, 24-year-old Kodak engineer Steven Sasson created the first digital camera. However, Kodak saw digital as a threat to its core film and film camera business and buried the invention. According to Sasson, \u201cEvery digital camera that was sold took away from a film camera and we knew how much money we made on film.\u201d Before joining Toyota Motors North America in 2011, TMNA chief lobbyist Stephen Ciccone spent 23 years leading Kodak\u2019s policy work. During his tenure, Kodak reached an 80% market share in the U.S. and about 50% market share globally. However, eschewing innovation eventually caught up with Kodak. That fatal error ultimately helped lead to the company\u2019s bankruptcy in 2012, the year after Ciccone moved to Toyota. When Kodak finally embraced the digital future, it was too late.\n\nJust two years before Sasson\u2019s invention, Toyota introduced the EV2 at the 1973 Tokyo Motor show. The EV2 was a concept electric car, but the company never produced it. It would take nearly fifty years for Toyota to release its first battery-electric vehicle. By the time it produced the Lexus UX300e in 2020 and the Toyota BZ4X in 2021, the automaker\u2019s peers had lapped it in the EV market. And by then, its tech was behind. Lexus did not introduce an EV to the U.S. market until 2023. Consumer Reports called that debut \u201ca disappointing first EV effort\u201d and noted that its \u201cmeager range and EV tech are already behind the times.\u201d The popular auto site Top Speed published the article \u201cThe 2023 Toyota bZ4X is What Happens When a Carmaker Doesn\u2019t Want to Sell EVs.\u201d Editor-at-Large William Clavey called it \u201ca terrible EV\u201d that \u201clacks an inspiring design, energy efficiency, and charging performance.\u201d He deftly notes that \u201cwhile Toyota is the carmaker that makes the wildest claims about EVs, it can\u2019t seem to deliver a truly competitive electric model.\u201d\n\nToyota sells more vehicles than any automaker on the planet and of course will not go bankrupt overnight. However, when Kodak had 80% U.S. market share, no one would have predicted its precipitous decline. Wall Street clearly thinks that electric vehicles are the future. As of mid-December 2024, Tesla\u2019s market cap was $1.375 trillion, 5.9 times the value of Toyota.\n\nInvestors appear to expect the EV market to continue its rapid growth. The S-curve is \u201ca well-established phenomenon where a successful new technology reaches a certain catalytic tipping point (typically 5-10% market share), and then rapidly reaches a high market share (i.e. 50%+) within just a couple more years once past this tipping point.\u201d There is a self-reinforcing cycle where the technology becomes more cost-effective as it becomes more prevalent. That is certainly the case for EV batteries, which fell by 20% in cost in 2024 alone.\n\nToyota is trailing its competitors on EVs and is at risk of falling behind even further as Chinese competitors make low-priced EVs to sell around the globe. Even Toyota\u2019s Japanese competitor, Honda, has recognized the threat. In announcing plans in December 2024 to merge with Nissan, Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe cited technological trends of electrification and autonomous driving, saying, \u201cThe rise of Chinese automakers and new players has changed the car industry quite a lot\u2026We have to build up capabilities to fight with them by 2030, otherwise we\u2019ll be beaten.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi launched its first EV at the end of March and is already selling more EVs than Toyota. The world\u2019s largest automaker losing to a smartphone company shows that Toyota\u2019s failure is not a matter of resources or even expertise, but a matter of effort. If it truly wanted to, Toyota could marshal its massive resources to thrive in the electric future. However, instead of competing in the EV marketplace, Toyota is fighting tooth and nail to delay the inevitable electric future.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Japanese auto giant has quietly spent the past several years building a powerful U.S. influence operation to try to delay the transition to EVs. It is funding an army of climate denying lawmakers and lobbying aggressively against emissions and fuel economy standards. After the 2024 election, with Toyota\u2019s climate-denying allies entering power, the company is poised to marshal an assault on climate policy. However, it is a risky strategy. Its failure to build EVs has left it vulnerable to an influx of competitors who have embraced the next generation of vehicles.\n\nIn twenty years, how will the world think of Toyota? Will it become the next Kodak or Blockbuster? Will it become a relic of the past, a cautionary tale for industry giants that refuse to adapt? Will Toyota continue to make dirty, polluting vehicles and align itself with climate deniers in a futile effort to hold onto the past for a bit longer? Or will it instead embrace the urgent, imminent future of electric vehicles? We shall know soon.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo analyze automakers\u2019 political contributions, we examined OpenSecrets\u2019 campaign finance data for the three automakers with political action committees: Toyota, General Motors, and Ford. We cross-referenced those with the Center for American Progress\u2019 lists of climate deniers from the 118th, 117th, and 116th sessions of Congress. We also examined statements from candidates in the 2023-2024 cycle who did not serve in any of the previous three congresses.\n\nFor its report on the 118th Congress, CAP used a slightly more expansive definition of \u201cclimate denier\u201d than it had in its previous reports. It included members who used other rhetorical tactics like climate doomism (saying there is nothing that can be done), portraying climate activism as alarmism, and who downplayed the need to act to address climate change.\n\nAppendix: Toyota, GM, Ford PAC Contributions to Climate Deniers 2022-2024\n\nCandidate Body State Toyota 20-24 GM 20-24 Ford 20-24 All PACs Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R) House

            "content": "Nearly three decades after its introduction, the hybrid Toyota Prius is still associated with environmental action and the scientific consensus that fossil fuel emissions, including those from vehicles, must be reduced to avoid the worst effects of planetary heating.\n\nBut a Tuesday report from watchdog group Public Citizen reveals how Toyota has spent recent years becoming the largest funder of U.S. lawmakers who deny the existence of the climate emergency, and a major opponent to the expansion of electric vehicles.\n\nIn the report, titled Driving Denial, senior clean vehicles campaigner Adam Zuckerman explains how Toyota has emerged over the last three election cycles as the auto industry's top financial backer of climate deniers in Congress\u2014donating to 207 of their campaigners.\n\nTop climate-denying beneficiaries of Toyota include U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who received $10,000 from Toyota in during the 2024 cycle\u2014the maximum amount allowed\u2014and Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), who received $7,000 after he called for the end of EV tax credits and demanded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) be eliminated.\n\nBetween 2020-24, Toyota's political action committee (PAC) has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to right-wing lawmakers including Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.)\u2014giving a total of \"$808,500 to the campaigns of congressional candidates that deny or question the existence of climate change,\" according to Public Citizen.\n\nDespite Toyota's reputation as a hybrid car innovator, said Zuckerman, \"the world's largest automaker has quietly spent the past several years building a powerful U.S. influence operation in an effort to delay the transition to electric vehicles.\"\n\n\"Funding a small army of climate-denying lawmakers, while lobbying aggressively against stronger emissions and fuel economy standards, is a volatile combination intended to roll back policies that protect our communities and planet,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to financing the campaigns of lawmakers who deny that fossil fuel emissions are heating the planet and contributing to more extreme wildfires, hurricanes, and other disasters, Toyota has also directly pushed back against climate regulations.\n\nThree days after President-elect Donald Trump won the November election, Toyota Motor North America executive Jack Hollis falsely called tailpipe emissions standards introduced by California and the EPA \"EV mandates\" and claimed they will \"remove consumer choice.\"\n\n\"Funding a small army of climate-denying lawmakers, while lobbying aggressively against stronger emissions and fuel economy standards, is a volatile combination intended to roll back policies that protect our communities and planet.\"\n\nHollis also wrote a Wall Street Journalop-ed called on the incoming Trump administration to dismantle Biden-era policies that push automakers to reduce emissions, and in December, Toyota announced it was donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration\n\n\n\n\"Instead of embracing a green energy future, Toyota has aggressively lobbied to delay and weaken climate action,\" Public Citizen's report reads.\n\nToyota's advocacy \"has borne results,\" notes the report. \"During the Biden administration, lobbying from Toyota and others forced the EPA to weaken an ambitious EPA plan to limit vehicle emissions. The changes slow the adoption of more stringent vehicle pollution limits, making it easier for EV laggards like Toyota to meet regulations without building electric vehicles.\"\n\nWhile billing itself as a global climate leader in recent decades, Toyota was named by InfluenceMap as the third-worst company in the world for anti-climate lobbying, after only fossil fuel giants Chevron and ExxonMobil.\n\nInfluenceMap's 2024 scorecard \"highlights Toyota's lobbying efforts against emissions standards in the U.S. and Australia and against EV mandates in Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as Toyota's success in weakening emissions stands in the U.S. and fuel efficiency standards in Australia,\" reads the Public Citizen report.\n\nWhile ramping up its lobbying efforts Toyota has invested in carbon-intensive hydrogen-powered vehicles such as the Mirai, a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (HFCV) introduced in 2014. The Mirai has sold fewer than 25,000 units and has failed to provide consumers with the infrastructure needed for HFCVs, with just 60 hydrogen refueling stations in the U.S. and Canada\u2014leading to a class action lawsuit against the automaker.\n\nThe company has pursued \"a risky strategy that has left Toyota vulnerable to an influx of competitors who have leapfrogged the auto giant to build the next generation of vehicles,\" reads the report. \"Instead of innovating, Toyota has bankrolled lobbyists and climate-hostile lawmakers to help it defeat EVs.\"\n\nAccording to the report, the automaker's abandonment of EV innovation and embrace of climate denial begs the question: \"In 20 years, how will the world think of Toyota?\"\n\nEVs, said Zuckerman, \"are the future of the automotive industry, and if it fails to evolve, Toyota risks becoming the next Kodak or Blockbuster, corporate giants that fought innovation and paid the price for it.\"",

            "content": "Toyota has been revealed as the largest auto industry funder of climate deniers in US Congress, according to a report released today by Public Citizen.\n\nToyota is the largest automaker in the world, having occasionally competed for that title with Volkswagen. It sells more gas-powered, polluting vehicles than any other company on Earth, and thus, it has a vested interest in continuing to sell those polluting vehicles.\n\nBut the problem is that gas-powered, polluting vehicles are not good for the health of humans or other living beings on this planet.\n\nThe pollution created by gas-powered vehicles damages every organ in the body, kills millions of people per year, and is a primary driver of climate change which is already causing an uptick in natural disasters (as we see currently, with climate change-fueled fires destroying 12,000 structures in the last week in the US\u2019 second-largest metro area) and threatens to displace over a billion people.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nBut that truth is inconvenient to Toyota, whose global revenue from selling polluting vehicles exceeds $300 billion/year. That means that, as one of the richest companies in the world and thus one of the most well-positioned to fund a transition to cleaner vehicles, it has a choice: it can either better itself, or it can do nothing to improve and instead pay people to lie about the problems that its vehicles are causing.\n\nAs you might expect, it has chosen the latter.\n\nToyota ranked as a top pollution advocate, once again\n\nToyota has repeatedly ranked as one of the strongest funders of pro-pollution, anti-EV, and climate denying propaganda in the world, and a new report out today reveals its growing interest in seeding anti-science attitudes in US Congress, through political bribes to climate deniers.\n\nPublic Citizen\u2019s report, \u201cDriving Denial: How Toyota\u2019s Unholy Alliance with Climate Deniers Threatens Climate Progress,\u201d analyzes political donations from US auto industry PACs over the last three election cycles, and shows that not only is Toyota the largest funder of climate denial, but that Toyota\u2019s funding of climate denial is increasing, while others are decreasing.\n\n(Notably, the report only covered company-linked automaker PACs, specifically Toyota, Ford and GM, and donations to Congressional candiates. Tesla CEO Elon Musk did set up his own PAC, and his bribes to anti-EV and climate denying candidates vastly outpaced all of the aforementioned PACs combined).\n\nPublic Citizen analyzed public records of political donations and past statements by US Congressmembers. It expanded its definition of \u201cclimate denier\u201d from previous reports, this time including members who \u201cused other rhetorical tactics like climate doomism (saying there is nothing that can be done), portraying climate activism as alarmism, and who downplayed the need to act to address climate change.\u201d\n\nIt found 169 candidates \u2013 unsurprisingly, all are republican \u2013 who had worked to deny scientific truths about climate change over the course of the last three election cycles. Out of those 169 candidates, Toyota donated some amount of money to 143 of them, totaling $810k.\n\nIn just the most recent cycle, it found that Toyota gave $271,000 combined to 62 candidates, nine times as much as Ford and more than twice as much as GM gave. Both Ford and GM\u2019s climate denial donations reduced over the last three cycles, while Toyota\u2019s dipped in 2022 and rose in 2024.\n\nThese bribes are relatively small dollar numbers compared to Toyota\u2019s >$300 billion in global annual revenue, and it\u2019s money that has gotten results.\n\nHow this lobbying affects your lungs and pocketbook\n\nIn March of 2024, President Biden\u2019s EPA finalized a new exhaust rule that will save thousands of lives and save Americans over $100 billion in fuel and health costs per year, and reduce climate pollution by 7 billion tons \u2013 but lobbying from the auto industry, including Toyota, got those rules softened before they were implemented.\n\nThe rest of the auto industry also asked for that softening of the rules, but there is now an opportunity for them to go further. Unfortunately for America, the next occupant of the White House is convicted felon Donald Trump, who finally received more votes than his opponent on his third attempt (despite committing treason in 2021, for which there is a clear legal remedy).\n\nMr. Trump has stated quite forcefully that he wants to reverse President Biden\u2019s money-saving clean air policies, thus saddling Americans with dirtier air, higher costs and poorer health. This turnaround would also send American jobs to China and attempt to quash the new boom in American manufacturing driven by Biden\u2019s EV rules.\n\nIn the past, the auto industry has taken advantage of changes in government, trying to get money-saving clean air rules torpedoed even after implementation.\n\nThis time, though, the auto industry is begging that the rules remain in place (after realizing they screwed everything up last time) in order to provide regulatory certainty to an industry with long planning timelines.\n\nBut Toyota has broken with the rest of the industry, instead asking the new Congress \u2013 that it bought \u2013 to give tax credits to its polluting gas-powered vehicles, which harm your health and exacerbate natural disasters.\n\nToyota\u2019s \u201cgreen image\u201d is long overdue for a change\n\nToyota has long rested on the laurels of its previous success with hybrid vehicles, hoping that customers would be fooled into thinking that it is an environmentally responsible company because it sold some vehicles that make slightly less pollution than others for a while.\n\nBut conventional hybrid vehicles like the Prius (non-plug-in version) are still gas-powered, and still get 100% of their energy from gasoline. The vehicle\u2019s hybrid drive only works to recover kinetic energy that\u2019s already in the system and redeploy it, increasing efficiency, but still relying entirely on a resource that absolutely, without question, must stay in the ground.\n\nAnd while Toyota has sold a significant amount of hybrids, the brand still ranks below average in efficiency, according to the EPA automotive trends report. It ranked below all other Asian brands, and below BMW, a brand famous for its large-engine and high-performing sportscars (though ahead of the US Big Three, which sell a lot of disgustingly huge vehicles and need to do better).\n\nThis is incongruous with Toyota\u2019s perception among the public, which still consider the company as a green leader despite its long-time advocacy, as covered above, against EVs, against clean air regulations, and in favor of climate denial.\n\nToyota also portrays itself as a green leader through numerous greenwashing campaigns and anti-science disinformation. Public Citizen recently filed an FTC complaint over Toyota\u2019s false electrification claims.\n\nBut is all of this effort to be hostile to life on Earth helping Toyota? Probably not \u2013 and it might even know it.\n\nToyota\u2019s EV intransigence is harming it \u2013 and all of Japan\n\nWhile Toyota\u2019s advocacy could be interpreted as an attempt to protect its profits, this is a short-sighted view.\n\nAll industries change, and companies that do not change along with their industry are doomed to failure.\n\nToyota, itself, was the harbinger of this change in the 1970s, when the auto industry went through a big shakeup due to disruption in the oil and steel industries. Consumers needed smaller and more efficient vehicles that were not being provided by US automakers, and Toyota and other Japanese automakers \u2013 which also had superior manufacturing techniques and access to better and cheaper steel \u2013 swooped in to provide them.\n\nDespite US attempts at protectionism (which didn\u2019t work then and won\u2019t work now), this catapulted Japan to becoming the world\u2019s top auto exporter, and Toyota remains a global powerhouse.\n\nHowever, now Toyota and Japan are on the opposite side of this lesson. Worldwide, consumers are demanding electric vehicles at increasing rates, and Toyota not only refuses to provide them, but tries to channel customers to its polluting vehicles instead.\n\nThe situation got so bad that the company\u2019s longtime CEO, Akio Toyoda, stepped down in 2023 due to his failure on EVs, but the new CEO Koji Sato didn\u2019t change much.\n\nBut someone else is providing the EVs consumers want \u2013 namely, China. As a result, China overtook Japan as the world\u2019s largest auto exporter in the last year or so. And Toyota\u2019s business is cratering in the world\u2019s largest auto market because Chinese consumers just don\u2019t want their crappy gas cars. Toyota is even losing ground in its home country, as domestic brand EV sales drop, and foreign brands grow.\n\nSo the roles are reversed now \u2013 China is the new Japan, and Japan, led by Toyota (the largest company in the country, with high political and cultural influence) is responding in just the way that will ensure the same outcome as the last time this happened.\n\nAs EV sales grow globally, any company that does not keep pace will find its position diminished. Toyota has shown no interest in keeping pace, and instead is trying to lobby to stop a transition that will happen whether it likes it or not.\n\nAnd it won\u2019t just harm Toyota, but the entire country of Japan, for which automotive products make up around a fifth of its exports. Japan is reliant on the auto industry, and its intransigence could lead to a huge drop in GDP if it doesn\u2019t shape up.\n\nBut instead of looking at all this blatant evidence that its intransigence will harm it, Toyota is doubling down on climate denial instead of trying to catch up with an industry that has clearly left it in the dust. nd Toyota seems determined to drag the US down with it, through these political bribes.\n\nWhile Toyota\u2019s short-term lobbying victories may feel good in the moment, they will help neither the company, the health of the humans who work for it who have to deal with the increased pollution its leadership lobbies for, nor the health of the planet it exists on which will be harmed by the science denial it lobbies for.\n\nIf you\u2019re an electric vehicle owner, charge your car at home with rooftop solar panels.

Set to make its racing debut this summer, the car is powered by Toyota\u2019s new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, codenamed G20E, in race-tuned configuration. While the prototype\u2019s primary focus is motorsport, the mid-engined AWD layout has sparked speculation about a future production model, widely rumored to be the long-awaited MR2 successor.\n\nMore: Toyota\u2019s New 2.0-Liter Turbo Rumored To Pack Nearly 600HP In Motorsport Spec\n\nDuring a press conference at the Tokyo event, Toyota shared some interesting details about the prototype\u2019s development and its potential future. The presentation, led by Yuta Tomikawa, featured Toyota Gazoo Racing president Tomoya Takahashi and a trio of Rookie Racing drivers, who collectively dove into the nitty-gritty of the GR Yaris M Concept and its newly developed engine.\n\nA Tease For The MR2\u2014And Maybe A Celica?\n\nToyota\u2019s new high-performance 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, codenamed G20E\n\nAt one point during the discussion, Rookie Racing driver Hiroaki Ishiura made a telling comment: \u201cWell, this is mid-ship, so I think it\u2019s going to be an MR-something.\u201d That remark led the presenter to ask, \u201cSo this is a GR Yaris, but maybe in the future, we\u2019re going to call this a different car?\u201d In the background, someone mentioned the Celica name, adding to the speculation.\n\nAll eyes then turned to Daisuke Toyoda, son of Akio Toyoda (aka Morizo) and a Rookie Racing driver who responded: \u201cI don\u2019t really know but whatever we say, it\u2019s not related to the decision-making of the company and we\u2019re just talking about it here\u201d.\n\nThis comment prompted the presenter to press further, asking, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible this could become an actual production model to be launched?\u201d Daisuke Toyoda replied, That\u2019s our hope and we can all imagine various things at this moment \u2013 there is no official announcement yet.\u201d\n\nWhy Did Toyota Move The Engine Towards The Back?\n\nIn a separate presentation titled \u201cBuilding Better Cars Starting from Motorsports,\u201d a different group of Toyota Gazoo Racing engineers and racing drivers provided deeper insight into the reasoning behind the layout. They also shared key details about the development of the mid-engined model, highlighting its connection to motorsport innovation.\n\nNaohiko Saito, one of the Chief Engineers at Toyota Gazoo Racing responsible for developing the GR Yaris, admitted to being the one who came up with the idea of moving the engine towards the back.\n\nData from racing with a front-engined AWD setup revealed moments where the car became unresponsive to driver inputs until the wheels regained traction. This prompted Saito to approach Akio Toyoda and propose the transition to a more balanced mid-engined AWD layout that would move the center of gravity towards the rear axle.\n\nToyota GR Yaris M Concept\n\nAccording to the chief engineer and professional drivers, the new layout eliminated the previously mentioned gap, significantly improving the model\u2019s maneuverability and handling sharpness. Additionally, the team experimented with various torque distribution settings between the axles to achieve the ideal balance.\n\nEarly mid-engined prototypes were equipped with the 1.6-liter three-cylinder engine, which eventually led to the GR Yaris M Concept featuring the new 2.0-liter four-cylinder unit. This engine, codenamed G20E, was first announced in May 2024, but this marks its debut in a development prototype. It is believed that it will come in two configurations, producing 296 hp (221 kW) and 395 hp (294 kW), alongside an unrestricted racing variant delivering 592 hp (441 kW).\n\nMore: Toyota Drops GR Corolla\u2019s 300 HP AWD Powertrain In A GR86 Concept\n\nRacing driver Hiroaki Ishiura, who was part of the GR Corolla development team, remarked that the mid-engined prototype exhibited no understeer and delivered a surprisingly comfortable ride. He also noted the distinct experience of feeling the engine\u2019s sound and vibration from the rear\u2014something increasingly rare in modern sports cars due to stricter noise regulations. The other racing drivers on the panel echoed his sentiments, describing the prototype as an absolute thrill, adding that they cannot wait for the production model to arrive.\n\nYasuo Hirata, a mechanic from Toyota\u2019s technical department, stated that the mid-engined production model is \u201cstill in the early stages of planning and development.\u201d He added that significant work remains to be done, particularly on cooling and heat management for the powertrain.\n\nToyota Toyota engineers will have an opportunity to refine the formula in motorsports, as the GR Yaris M Concept is set to compete in the Super Taikyu series later in 2025. Specifically, the new race car is expected to make its debut at the Autopolis event during the fifth round on July 26-27.\n\nMR2, Celica, and More\n\nThe Toyota FT-Se cooncept car\n\nAll these remarks align with earlier reports about the anticipated return of the Toyota MR2 as an ICE-powered, mid-engined, AWD sports car. The production model, possibly drawing inspiration from the fully electric FT-Se concept, is rumored to debut sometime in 2026.\n\nAs for the Celica, its much-anticipated return has been officially confirmed by Toyota\u2019s executive vice president, Yuki Nakajima. While Nakajima didn\u2019t provide a timeline for the coupe\u2019s debut, it\u2019s expected to appear within the next few years. Unlike the MR2, the Celica is likely to stay true to its roots with a front-engined AWD layout, powered by the same turbocharged 2.0-liter engine.\n\nInterestingly, the MR2 and Celica won\u2019t be the only sporty additions to Toyota\u2019s future lineup. A subtle teaser hidden in Toyota\u2019s anime series hints at the reborn models being joined by new generations of the GR Supra and GR 86 sports cars. Additionally, the production version of the GR GT3 concept is expected to debut, potentially serving as Toyota\u2019s flagship supercar, though it\u2019s more likely this will be offered under the Lexus brand.",

            "content": "According to Toyota's Chief Technology Officer Hiroki Nakajima, its new four-cylinder engine lineup is a \"game changer.\" The upcoming powertrains have 1.5- and 2.0-liter displacements, and while they're being optimized primarily for electrification, the fun element isn't being ignored. At least, that's the case for the 2.0-liter turbo engine the engineers mounted last year in a stripped-out Lexus IS for testing purposes.\n\nFor the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, the four-pot was installed in a mid-engine test mule based on a GR Yaris. In the press release, Toyota didn't disclose the 2.0-liter turbo engine's output but hinted in an interview with Japanese journalists during TAS that it could make over 400 horsepower. During the Multipathway Workshop held last May, Car Watch learned from Nakajima that the target is 400 PS, which technically works out to 394 hp. However, there seems to be room for more.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Toyota GR Yaris M Concept\n\nAt 2025 TAS, Nakajima suggested it could pack an even greater punch. In response to a reporter's question, he said, \"Is it a 400-PS engine?\" Of course, that could mean less than Toyota's initial estimate. However, the original version shown last year already had 400 PS, so we should expect more rather than less. A peak torque of 369 pound-feet (500 Newton meters) was estimated in 2024.\n\nA 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo engine with more than 400 hp is not a novelty, considering AMG's \"M139\" makes 416 hp in the \"45\"-badged cars. When longitudinally mounted in the hugely controversial C63, the \"M139l\" produces a massive 469 hp. Heck, even the rare Mitsubishi Evo X FQ-440 MR had 440 hp a decade ago, albeit that car was chock-full of engine mods.\n\nNakajima told Car Watch that a lesser version of the 2.0-liter turbo engine is planned with a projected output of 300 PS (296 hp) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm). The unrestricted four-cylinder mill will make more than 600 hp in race cars. This engine can be installed both transversely and longitudinally. Toyota already uses a 2.0-liter turbo four-banger in a sports car via BMW and its B48 engine, although not for long. The current Supra is facing imminent retirement, but the nameplate will continue. It remains to be seen whether the next-gen Supra will feature the \"G20E.\"\n\nToyota G20E engine Toyota G20E engine\n\nLest we forget, Toyota has consistently dropped hints about dusting off other sports car nameplates. Now and then, we keep getting signals about the Celica and/or MR2 returning. Logic tells us the \"G20E\" will be at the core of the company's sports car lineup. The new engine will be positioned above the three-cylinder 1.6-liter unit found in the GR Yaris and GR Corolla. The \"G16E-GTS\" also powers a Lexus model, so here's hoping Toyota's luxury brand will also use the larger 2.0-liter.\n\nSince we mentioned Lexus, it\u2019s cooking up a fun car of its own, but with a much bigger engine. The \"LFR\" (name not confirmed) is widely believed to rock a twin-turbo V-8 and serve as a street-legal sibling of Toyota's new GT3 race car. There's also an electric indirect successor to the LFA, previewed by the Electrified Sport concept.\n\nAgainst all odds, Toyota still wants to cater to enthusiasts, even in an SUV-obsessed world and an automotive industry significantly impacted by stricter emissions regulations. Sports cars are a niche segment, but it looks like the Gazoo Racing arm wants to properly rival Mercedes-AMG, Audi Sport, and BMW M. Ideally, it will do so at a lower price, leaving Lexus to fight the higher-ends models from the German trio.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Jagr\u2019s post, titled \"Eaton fire couldn't kill my Toyota Tacoma,\" chronicles his experience with the recent Eaton Fire, which devastated his home and belongings but left his trusty 2013 Tacoma remarkably unscathed.\n\nJagr wrote, \u201cOn Thursday we confirmed that we lost our house and everything in it to the Eaton Fire. But our Toyota Tacoma was only scorched. The keys burned in the fire but Envision Toyota of West Covina made me a new key from the VIN (at no charge). Yesterday I tried to start it and it fired right up. Everything works, even the headlights and blinkers! I have owned Tacomas for over 20 years and have always been happy with their versatility, reliability, and serviceability.\u201d\n\nJones also share a video of his 2013 Tacoma on Youtube.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament not only to the durability of the Toyota Tacoma but also to the strong sense of community and care that some dealerships bring to the table. Envision Toyota of West Covina stepping up to provide Jagr a replacement key free of charge speaks volumes about the kind of support that matters most during difficult times.\n\nThe story quickly sparked a lively discussion among Reddit users. One commenter, Macarius, drew parallels to another remarkable tale of Toyota\u2019s resilience: \u201cI remember the story of a nurse who used his Tundra for evacuating patients in a different California wildfire summer of 2018. The thing kept on running but got scorched up pretty badly too. The story ended up in the local news, and when it eventually made it back to Toyota corporate, they gave him a brand-new TRD Pro for free.\u201d\n\nStories like these continue to solidify the Toyota Tacoma\u2019s and Tundra\u2019s reputations as go-to vehicles for reliability and durability, even in the most extreme conditions. If you\u2019re considering owning a Tacoma yourself, you might find the story \u201cNever Owning a Truck, I\u2019ve Placed an Order for a 2024 Toyota Tacoma - My Excitement Turned to Nervousness After,\u201d offering a unique perspective on what it\u2019s like to dive into the Tacoma world for the first time.\n\nWhether it's surviving wildfires or conquering harsh winter weather, as proven in this winter snowstorm test of the 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road, these trucks are built to thrive when the going gets tough.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to apply this update!\n\nWhile I\u2019m relieved that Jagr and his family are safe, I\u2019m deeply sorry about the loss of their home.\n\nOn a more practical note, I\u2019ve never had a vehicle burn in a fire, but I\u2019d urge caution before driving it extensively. Checking the wiring and overall integrity of his Tacoma truck is critical. The last thing anyone wants is for it to catch fire again, especially on the highway or, worse, at a gas station.\n\nThankfully, Jagr has already planned to have professionals inspect the truck. He noted, \u201cThe radiator and everything after it looks solid, all lights work, including headlights, blinkers, etc. I am going to have the tires replaced too... don\u2019t trust them after the heat.\u201d That\u2019s an excellent call, as heat-damaged tires can be unpredictable and unsafe.\n\nJagr also posted additional images on Imgur. Here is one of them.\n\nThis story is a powerful reminder of the impressive engineering and reliability that Toyota Tacoma trucks, especially older models, are known for. As Toyota continues to innovate with the next-generation Tacoma, debates like V6 vs. turbo engines spark passionate discussions among fans, and you can read more about it here.\n\nToyota Tacoma's ability to withstand harsh conditions and still perform is nothing short of remarkable. To Jagr and others facing similar challenges, our hearts go out to you, and we\u2019re glad you\u2019re safe.\n\nWhat about you, readers?

It ranks No. 12 on the TT Top 100 private carriers list.\n\nWall Street banks have said that remote workers aren\u2019t likely to get promoted as they miss out on in-person mentoring and learning opportunities. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has told its employees to return to the office five days a week.\n\nAutomakers have tightened up return-to-work policies as well. Stellantis NV, owner of the Jeep and Ram brands, reversed a 70% remote-work policy for workers in October following a shakeup in management and now wants staff in the office three days a week, on average.\n\nFord Motor Co. has shifted to a three-day-a-week hybrid model last year. General Motors Co., in a similar vein, has scrapped a flexible \u201cWork Appropriately\u201d policy last year in favor of requiring workers to report Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nNissan Motor Co. said it plans to shift to a minimum of three days a week in the office for most salaried staff in the U.S. as of April 1. A representative for Honda Motor Co.\u2019s U.S. subsidiary had no immediate comment on its work-from-home policy other than to say it hasn\u2019t changed recently.\n\nDespite the high-profile mandates, offices in major U.S. cities were only about half full for much of last year compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to security firm Kastle Systems. The share of companies that are in the office five days a week declined slightly to 32% in the fourth quarter, according to the Flex Index, which tracks attendance policies covering 100 million workers across more than 13,000 companies.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nBut the moves by blue chips like Amazon, AT&T and JPMorgan Chase this year might give other employers an impetus to shift to more stringent policies in the coming months, workplace experts have said.\n\nToyota consulted with its suppliers, dealers and other partners to determine that the Monday-through-Thursday requirement was the best option and ensured people would be in the office at standard times, it said in the memo. The rules will also apply to temporary and contingent staff, and go into effect as of Sept. 2.\n\nThe requirements also will apply to workers who have moved away from company locations, the letter explained. Toyota\u2019s factory workers have already been working on-site five days or more a week.",

            "content": "Toyota is backing Japan\u2019s rocket ambitions with a \u00a57 billion ($44.3 million) investment in Interstellar Technologies as part of its Series F funding round. Interstellar, a company aiming to make rockets as scalable and efficient as cars, plans to use the funding to expand its rocket manufacturing capabilities.\n\nThe investment is led by Toyota subsidiary Woven by Toyota, which just days ago unveiled its futuristic Woven City project at CES 2025. Now, Interstellar, which already uses 3D printing to manufacture critical rocket components, plans to combine this approach with Toyota\u2019s renowned car manufacturing techniques to build rockets faster, cheaper, and larger.\n\nA Partnership Years in the Making\n\nSince 2020, Interstellar and Toyota have collaborated through personnel exchanges, with 11 Toyota employees joining Interstellar to share expertise in production and operations. This collaboration laid the groundwork for a strategic business alliance focusing on reducing costs, cutting lead times, and establishing a mass production system for rockets.\n\n\u201cSince the start of our business in 2013, Interstellar Technologies has valued a hands-on approach to manufacturing and a spirit of trial and error. Woven by Toyota, a leader in driving mobility transformation within the Toyota Group, is the ideal partner to help us evolve our rocket production from one-of-a-kind manufacturing to a scalable supply chain, bringing our vision of a future where everyone can access space\u2019 to life. I am truly delighted that, after years of talent exchange since 2020, we can now strengthen our collaboration to the next level,\u201d explained Interstellar CEO Takahiro Inagawa.\n\nInterstellar pioneered using 3D printing for rocket manufacturing, producing complex and critical components like fuel injectors, avionics hardware, and gimbal mechanisms. These parts are essential for controlling engine thrust and overall rocket performance and are created with fewer materials, less weight, and higher precision, lowering production costs and shortening manufacturing timelines.\n\nBy integrating Toyota\u2019s production techniques, including cost-effective manufacturing and supply chain optimization, Interstellar hopes to scale these processes even further to meet the rising demand for satellite launches worldwide and help Japan increase its launch capabilities.\n\nThe space industry is booming, with small satellite launches skyrocketing from 141 in 2016 to nearly 3,000 in 2023. While the U.S. and China dominate, Japan is working to catch up. The Japanese government has set a goal to increase domestic launch capacity to 30 launches annually and double the value of its space industry from roughly \u00a54 trillion ($26 billion) to \u00a58 trillion ($52 billion) by the early 2030s. Achieving this will need changes in how rockets are built, shifting from custom-built designs to a scalable production model. The partnership between Interstellar and Toyota aims to use advanced manufacturing to meet the growing demand for satellite launches and help Japan compete in the space industry.\n\nMore Than Rockets\n\nInterstellar isn\u2019t just about rockets; it\u2019s also developing satellite communications technology similar to SpaceX\u2019s Starlink. This technology aims to connect satellites directly to ground devices like smartphones, providing high-speed internet. By combining rocket launches with satellite services, Interstellar wants to vertically integrate space infrastructure, a model proven successful in the U.S.\n\nFor Toyota, this isn\u2019t the brand\u2019s first venture into space. The company is already working with Japan\u2019s space agency, JAXA, on the Lunar Cruiser, a vehicle designed for NASA\u2019s Artemis program. Set to launch in 2029, the Lunar Cruiser will play a key role in lunar exploration. Toyota\u2019s Chairman, Akio Toyoda, has pointed to the company\u2019s growing focus on space, saying, \u201cThe future of mobility should not be limited to just Earth\u2026or just one car company for that matter!\u201d\n\nWith this new investment, Toyota and Interstellar aim to make space more accessible for everyone. Additional funding is expected in the second close of Interstellar\u2019s Series F round, alongside further steps to strengthen the company\u2019s governance. Woven by Toyota will appoint a director to Interstellar\u2019s board to help guide its growth and solidify the alliance.\n\nWith this new investment, Toyota and Interstellar aim to make space more accessible for everyone. The first tranche of Interstellar\u2019s Series F funding round closed on January 7, 2025, with Woven by Toyota\u2019s \u00a57 billion investment. Additional funding will also be expected in the second close of the Series F round. Furthermore, Woven by Toyota will appoint a director to Interstellar\u2019s board, strengthening its corporate governance as the company scales its operations.\n\nThe Japanese spaceflight company has secured roughly \u00a522.7 billion ($144 million) in funding across multiple rounds, including loans. Notable Japanese investors include SBI Group, NTT DOCOMO, and Resona Bank. For example, SBI Group contributed \u00a53.1 billion ($21 million) during the Series E round in August 2024, which also saw participation from NTT DOCOMO to support Interstellar\u2019s development of the ZERO orbital-class launch vehicle and satellite communication technologies.\n\nInterstellar\u2019s use of 3D printing and Toyota\u2019s manufacturing skills will help Japan grow its space industry and launch more satellites. This partnership is a big step toward making rockets cheaper and easier to produce, helping Japan compete in the global space market.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

Starting at around $30,000, this SUV competes with popular domestic cars like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. It also rivals other EVs on the market, like the Toyota bZ4X and Nissan Ariya.\n\nIn its first full sales year, BYD has already outsold Toyota in EV sales in Japan. This accomplishment is even more impressive since Toyota has historically dominated sales in its home market.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nAccording to the Japan Automobile Dealer Association (via CarNewsChina), BYD sold 2,223 EVs in 2024. In comparison, Toyota sold just 2,038 electric cars in its home market last year.\n\nBYD Dolphin (left) and Atto 3 (right) at the 2024 Tokyo Spring Festival (Source BYD Japan)\n\nBYD\u2019s EV sales were up 54% compared to 2023, while Toyota\u2019s slipped 30% year over year (YOY). Since launching in 2023, BYD has introduced several top-selling models, including the Dolphin hatchback and Seal sedan.\n\nStarting at just 2.99 million yen ($19,000), the Dolphin competes with top-selling domestic cars like the Toyota Prius and Nissan LEAF.\n\nBYD seal in Japan (Source: BYD)\n\nAfter launching the Seal last June, widely viewed as its answer to the Tesla Model 3, BYD\u2019s electric sedan was already the top-selling imported EV in Japan by August. BYD\u2019s Seal starts at 5.28 million yen, or around $33,500.\n\nBYD is turning up the pressure in 2025 with plans to launch the Sealion 07 in Japan, its new smart mid-size electric SUV.\n\nBYD Sealion 07 electric SUV launched in Norway (Source: BYD)\n\nJapan\u2019s total EV sales fell 33% to just below 60,000 in 2024, its first YOY decline in four years. Nissan led the market with a roughly 50% share despite LEAF sales slipping nearly 50% (30,749) from 2023. Although Toyota bZ4X sales were up 10%, only 1,012 models were sold in 2024. Toyota\u2019s electric SUV starts at 5.5 million yen ($35,000).\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nAfter losing significant market share in China, a critical market for Japanese automakers, BYD is now taking their home market by storm.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s still a small number, BYD\u2019s growing presence in Japan is impressive. Japan has been a challenging market for foreign brands to compete in. Outside of luxury automakers like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and BWM, domestic brands have historically dominated auto sales in Japan.\n\nToyota accounted for over a third of the market alone last year. After topping Nissan and Honda for the first time in global vehicle sales last year, BYD is laying the groundwork for more growth in 2025.\n\nThe Chinese EV leader is expanding with new models launching in Europe, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and more. Will BYD eventually top Toyota in global sales? As the industry shifts to EVs, BYD is quickly gaining momentum while Toyota lags in key markets.\n\nSource: CarNewsChina, JAMA",

While a variety of factors go into this, Toyota dealers have gone crazy with markups.\n\nThey\u2019ve added an $11,000 markup to a Tacoma Trailhunter and a $4,995 adjustment for the 2025 Camry. There were also sizable markups on the Land Cruiser and GR Corolla.\n\nMore: 2025 Toyota 4Runner Is The Tacoma Of SUVs And It\u2019s Coming For The Bronco\n\nGiven this trend, it\u2019s not surprising to see greedy dealers adding thousands onto the price of the 2025 4Runner. One of the worst offenders is Stevens Creek Toyota of San Jose, California. Their 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium has a sticker price of $60,083 but they\u2019ve slapped a $4,995 \u201cdealer price adjustment\u201d on top of that. This increases the price to $65,078 which means it costs thousands more than a Land Cruiser.\n\nThings get even worse when you consider the 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium starts at $54,970 before a $1,450 destination fee. That\u2019s a sizable difference, but this particular variant has been loaded up with accessories such as all-weather floor liners, a cargo mat, mudguards, and black badges.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t the only example as Continental Toyota of Hodgkins, Illinois has their 4Runner TRD Sport listed for $55,782 despite carrying a $52,284 sticker.

This equates to more than a 10% markup considering the MSRP is $48,247. The model has also been loaded up with accessories ranging from floor mats to side steps and a roof rack.\n\nOn the bright side, most dealers appear to be offering their 4Runners at sticker price.

            "content": "As a rule, I don't count Toyota out in the electric vehicle race\u2014or the race for any future transportation technology. But my rule has its limits. While Toyota had a fantastic year in the U.S. in 2024 on the strengths of its hybrid cars, the cracks are beginning to show in other parts of the world. And now its \"multi-pathway\" approach to making lots of different powertrains is about to be tested as never before in a few key countries. One in particular says a lot about where Toyota's EVs are going next.\n\nThat kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of auto industry and technology news. We're in a bit of a post-CES 2025 news drought today, which is fine by me, but expect more coverage from InsideEVs about the rest of last week's trade show soon.\n\nAlso on deck today: Tesla outsells Audi globally for the first time, and Hyundai courts President-elect Donald Trump, who steps into the White House again in one week. Let's dig in.\n\n30%: Building A Better bZ4X\n\nPhoto by: Toyota 2025 Toyota Urban Cruiser\n\nToyota is one of the few remaining automakers that truly operates at a global level with the scale to provide different cars to different parts of the world. Japan gets fuel-sipping city cars, America gets trucks like the Tacoma and Tundra, the Middle East and Africa get old-school diesel Land Cruisers\u2014you get the idea. It has internal combustion cars, hybrids and hydrogen vehicles, though the latter isn't really working out.\n\nOne area where Toyota knows it's deficient is purely electric vehicles. Company executives seem to be acknowledging this white space more and more, as they did to InsideEVs at CES just last week. Toyota may have the R&D, capital and infrastructure to make many different kinds of cars without committing to one single solution, but it doesn't want to lose sales. And it is in China right now.\n\nBut there are other places where the EV revolution is also in force. One of them is Norway, where the new car market is basically 90% electric. Granted, that's only a few hundred thousand cars\u2014Americans bought probably 15 million last year, for context\u2014but no car company wants to lose anywhere. So this interview of Toyota Norway CEO Piotr Pawlak with the country's Motor publication is very telling. Some excerpts, with help from Google Translate:\n\nThere are several elements to this. The Norwegian department will both educate the other markets and at the same time push out as many electric cars as possible in Norway. With an electric car share expected to exceed 90 percent by 2025, the Norwegian market is significant for the European electric car share. And growth in Norway will have more legs to stand on than bZ4X. There is a 100 percent electric focus in Norway. We no longer care how many hybrids we sell here. They can be sold elsewhere, where it is possible to make money from them. This simply means that Pawlak would prefer to avoid selling anything other than electric cars. At least 80 percent of Toyotas delivered in Norway in 2025 should be electric. [...] We have learned from the bZ4X crisis, he says, guaranteeing that the upcoming models will have battery preheating, a good route planner and generally electric car technology that is expected in today's market. The new cars will be suitable for Norwegian use when it comes to charging, and they will be available with four-wheel drive.\n\nThe \"bZ4X crisis\" refers to the same criticisms U.S. and European EV shoppers have of Toyota's primary electric offering: its range, price, charging and software specs are already uncompetitive and getting outclassed by new entries all of the time. In the case of chilly Norway, a good EV needs proper four- or all-wheel-drive, cold weather resilience, battery preconditioning and route-planning. The bZ4X doesn't measure up on most of that.\n\nBut I bring this up Pawlak's comments do matter to the rest of the world: if what the CEO says is true, then Toyota's clearly working on this stuff. It has high hopes for the new Urban Crusier compact electric (pictured above) and has several new EV models planned globally for 2026 and beyond. Some of those EVs will assuredly be Europe-specific and it will likely continue leaning on local partners in China, but more and more, the message is clear: Even if Toyota doesn't envision an all-electric future as other carmakers do, it can't let EVs be some afterthought anymore. And in the U.S., people certainly want good electric options from this trusted brand.\n\n60%: Tesla Beats Audi Globally For The First Time\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs\n\nSpeaking of things that aren't working, the Volkswagen Group is keenly aware that Audi is pretty far from the power-hitter that it was in the 2000s and 2010s. Global Audi sales were down a whole 14% in 2024 and the declines hit the entire lineup. It's an older lineup, too, and perhaps speaking subjectively, the new crop of Audis just don't look as cool as the white-hot Audis did 20 years ago. And amid all of the VW Group's wider technology challenges, their software and automated driving features lag behind many competitors.\n\nSo who pulled ahead of Audi last year? None other than Tesla, Bloomberg reports:\n\nTesla overtook Audi, one of Germany\u2019s most prized premium car brands, last year despite selling fewer vehicles than expected. Audi sold 1.67 million vehicles in 2024, down 12 percent from a year earlier. Audi\u2019s struggle with intensifying competition in Europe and China and weak demand for its electric models dropped the brand behind Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, which delivered 1.79 million vehicles last year. But Tesla\u2019s rapid expansion in the preceding few years positioned the company to take advantage of any slip-ups by incumbents. Its Model Y SUV ranks among the world\u2019s best-selling cars and is getting a facelift this year. Germany\u2019s automakers, meanwhile, are contending with tepid demand for luxury cars in China, where a recovery remains uncertain and local automakers are pushing further upmarket.\n\nI'd also argue that Tesla has an \"aging lineup\" problem of its own, with the Cybertruck not really moving the needle much last year. But the new Model Y is on its way. I'd be shocked if that doesn't sell well on its own.\n\nSo can Audi catch up? It's about to launch its biggest new product offensive ever, ranging from the new Q6 E-Tron to the A6 E-Tron sedan and gas-powered A7 and Q3. (Remember, at Audi, even numbers are electric and odd ones are gas and hybrid cars.) But the fact that Audi offers many different kinds of powertrains and still got smoked by an all-electric automaker shows it has work to do.\n\n90%: Hyundai Courts Trump, Too\n\nPhoto by: InsideEVs 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT\n\nLots of folks who aren't fans of Trump have complained at how many companies\u2014Ford, General Motors and Toyota among them\u2014are cozying up to the incoming president with big donations to his inaugural fund. They'd say they're trying to open up business relationships with a president who puts real emphasis on transactional relationships; if you don't love Trump, you probably don't love the idea of the dollars from a product you purchased headed in his direction.\n\nRegardless of how you feel, you can add Hyundai to that list, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's making a $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural fund. And part of that goal seems to be a sit-down with the president to try and talk him out of his anti-Mexico tariffs, which would be extremely disruptive to the automotive supply chain:\n\nHyundai in particular has launched an aggressive campaign to build relationships with Trump advisers. The company has told the president-elect\u2019s aides that it is working to be a U.S. job creator and a supporter of the American auto industry. If the company lands a sit-down with Trump, either at his Florida estate Mar\u2013a-Lago or at the White House once he takes office, they have discussed sending Hyundai CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz and Hyundai Motor Group executive chair, Euisun Chung, to participate, the people briefed on the matter said. Hyundai executives, including Mu\u00f1oz and Hyundai Motor Group Vice Chair Jaehoon Chang, may attend inauguration events, the people said. A $1 million donation provides six tickets to a private candlelight dinner with Trump and his wife Melania Trump on Jan. 19, one day before Trump is sworn in as president, according to a benefits package reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The contribution also allows for six tickets to a private reception on Jan. 18. with Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, as well as other exclusive events. Trade experts said Hyundai would be hard hit by tariffs since many of the parts used in its vehicles are manufactured abroad. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get hit with direct sales to the United States and even the domestic produced vehicles will take a hit because of all of their imported parts,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of the Cato Institute, whose research includes international trade.\n\nThe U.S. is by far Hyundai's biggest and most important market, and it remains heavily dependent on Mexico for production and the overall supply chain. (Nobody at Hyundai will talk about this openly, but this is probably why the Kia EV3 is taking so long to get to the U.S.; they may not be sure yet where and how they can build it, and what impact tariffs would have on those plans.)\n\nMeanwhile, Mercedes-Benz said it congratulates the incoming president, but does not have plans to donate to his inaugural fund. Do with that information as you will.\n\n100%: How Does Audi Get Back In The Game?\n\nDesign would be a great start. More like the car on the right and less like the car on the left, please, Audi. In fact, that ultra-streamlined design language that put Audi on the map would work extremely well in the electric era.\n\nWhat would you recommend to Audi?

            "content": "Old-timers might remember the surprise and innovation sparked by American Motors in 1980 with the introduction of the Eagle, a tall station wagon equipped with all-wheel drive.\n\nIt was a new idea that, ultimately, reshaped the automotive world into the crossover and SUV era.\n\nCould Toyota\u2019s Crown do something similar\u2014but in reverse\u2014for sedans?\n\nThe Crown replaced the Avalon sedan in Toyota\u2019s lineup about a year ago and has stirred the market, even as sedans have lost popularity in recent years. Yet, the Crown is a full-size car with all-wheel drive. Much like the Eagle experiment, the Crown targets an endangered part of the market while adding a feature nearly every buyer demands: AWD. Clever, right?\n\n1 of 6 \u2014 crown left side.jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade left side Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 2 of 6 \u2014 crown left front.jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade left front Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 3 of 6 \u2014 crown profile (1).jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade profile Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 4 of 6 \u2014 crown nose.jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade nose Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 5 of 6 \u2014 crown right rear (1).jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade right rear Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 6 of 6 \u2014 crown tail (1).jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade crown tail Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels\n\nToyota has styled the Crown to be a sharp looker, featuring a pointy, beak-like nose, a smoothly rounded rear end, and a fastback profile. Add Toyota\u2019s renowned hybrid system for enhanced fuel economy, and there\u2019s little to turn a buyer away\u2014perhaps the price, but more on that later.\n\nThe Crown rides higher, striking a balance between the easy entry of a sedan and the taller seating position that provides better all-around visibility. Its all-wheel drive (AWD) keeps the Crown steady on slippery winter roads, and with four drive modes, including Sport, it can add a little excitement to dry-weather driving.\n\nThe ride quality resembles a large luxury sedan, and the Crown handles easily, particularly when compared with most SUVs. However, many midsize to compact crossovers handle similarly well. For the record, the Crown has a fairly large turning radius, so quick U-turns on narrow neighborhood streets aren\u2019t its forte. Still, settling into a highway cruise is a delight, aided by smart cruise control and lane departure assist.\n\nAn additional feature, Active Cornering Assist, smartly brakes the appropriate wheel to improve cornering at speed, helping the Crown hug corners more confidently and enhancing stability.\n\nPower is somewhat underwhelming for such a sizeable sedan. The model tested was the Nightshade trim, the third of four levels, powered by a 2.5-liter I4 hybrid engine paired with a couple of electric motors to deliver 236 horsepower. While sufficient to bring the Crown up to highway speeds under heavy acceleration, it struggles a bit when pulling away from a stop, with noticeable hesitation and a fair amount of engine noise. The CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) seems to lack low-end torque\u2014a turbocharger could likely smooth out the performance and increase power.\n\nNaturally, the hybrid system shines in fuel efficiency. This I4 hybrid is rated at 42 mpg city and 41 highway on regular fuel. During testing, it achieved 36.1 mpg, which is impressive for a large sedan with AWD. By comparison, last year\u2019s higher-horsepower 2.4-liter turbo hybrid Crown, which produces 340 horsepower and uses a smoother 6-speed automatic, managed 30 mpg. That was the top-end Platinum trim. Your choice, but the turbo trim offers noticeably better power.\n\nInside, the Crown feels near luxury level (extremely quiet) although styling is pretty bland, black dash and gray leather seats with just a tiny touch of brown piping at the seatbacks top. Lighter gray stitching helps give the seats some visual highlights and there\u2019s a subtle bronze satin chrome trim around air vents, on slim dash trim, and on a bit of the shifter knob. The console top is black gloss too.\n\n1 of 3 \u2014 crown dash (1).jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade dashboard Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 2 of 3 \u2014 crown interior2.jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade interior Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 3 of 3 \u2014 crown interior1 (1).jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade interior Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels\n\nPerhaps this interior should be called the Dark Knight instead of Nightshade.\n\nA twin-panel panoramic sunroof overhead lets in much-needed daylight, especially during dreary winter days. The panoramic roof is standard on the Limited, Nightshade, and Platinum trims.\n\nSeating is comfortable, with well-formed seats that provide excellent lateral support. The front seats are powered, heated, and cooled, while the steering wheel is also heated\u2014a standard feature on all Crown trims. Heated rear seats are included as standard in the Nightshade trim as well.\n\nToyota\u2019s 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen is user-friendly and easy to adjust. Below the screen, you\u2019ll find all the climate controls, including automatic settings for the heated seats and steering wheel. There\u2019s no need to hunt through screen menus for adjustments, unlike in many modern vehicles.\n\nThe deep-pocket wireless charger for cell phones is a standout feature, conveniently located in front of the cupholders, allowing for easy visibility and access.\n\nIn terms of safety, Toyota includes a full suite of advanced features. There\u2019s even an advanced parking system\u2014essentially a self-parking feature\u2014that makes parallel parking or backing into a space a breeze.\n\nRear seat space is generous, though the swooping rear roofline could limit headroom for taller-than-average adults. NBA hopefuls might be better off in the front seats.\n\n1 of 2 \u2014 crown rear seat.jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade rear seat Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels 2 of 2 \u2014 crown door panel.jpg 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade door panel Mark Savage / Savage On Wheels\n\nIf you\u2019re planning a lengthy trip with four or five adults, the Crown offers plenty of cargo space for luggage. Its trunk boasts 15.2 cubic feet of storage\u2014comparable to the old Ford Taurus, which was known for having one of the largest sedan trunks for many years.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, pricing for the Nightshade trim is on the higher side. It starts at $49,860, including delivery. The test vehicle included several minor add-ons, such as illuminated door sills ($345), side puddle lamps ($165), and a dash cam ($375)\u2014though the need for a dash cam is debatable\u2014bringing the total to $51,158. That\u2019s about $6,000 more than the average car price.\n\nOpting for the base XLE trim brings the starting price down to a more accessible $42,535, with AWD included as standard. However, many buyers will likely gravitate toward the better-equipped Limited trim at $47,045. At the top of the range, the Platinum trim starts at $56,085.\n\nFor those who still prefer an SUV or crossover, Toyota offers the Crown Signia, built on the same platform but styled more like an SUV. It starts in the mid-$40,000 range. Something for everyone!\n\nIf that\u2019s not rugged enough, Toyota also has the Highlander, Grand Highlander, 4Runner, Land Cruiser, and the massive Sequoia in its lineup.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that a few other manufacturers produce AWD sedans, though they tend to be smaller models. The Crown stands out as a king-size option in this category.\n\n\n\nFAST STATS : 2025 Toyota Crown Nightshade\n\nHits: Handsome sedan, good ride quality, responsive handling, and standard AWD.

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nMichelle describes her experience as the 'oil change from hell.'\n\nWhile these may seem like strong words, if you've ever taken your vehicle to a car dealer for routine service, you'll likely relate. The frustration of waiting for your car to be ready, often past the promised time, is a common experience.\n\nIt's a common issue in many dealership service departments, employees overpromise and underdeliver, leaving customers like Michelle feeling frustrated and undervalued at a Toyota dealer.\n\nMichelle's experience serves as a cautionary tale. Taking her 2015 Toyota Camry in for service, especially on a Friday afternoon, was a disaster waiting to happen. Michelle's story, shared in her TikTok video, is a stark reminder to be cautious when considering dealership service departments on their busiest day.\n\nI will omit the Toyota dealer's name because this scenario happens dozens of times at many car dealer service departments.\n\nImagine taking your Toyota Camry in for a great deal on an oil change. It's only $19.95, including synthetic oil and a complimentary multi-point safety inspection of your car. It's a great deal, so who wouldn't jump on it?\n\nHowever, they tell you it will be an hour to an hour and a half, and you are okay because you have some work you can do while you wait. However, the service department employee who checked you in is nowhere to be found.\n\nHe likely went to lunch but unfortunately forgot about you and didn't tell you your car was ready. You are still waiting.\n\nWhen you finally inquire about your car after two and a half hours, everyone is busy, and no one is eager to help you. After nearly three hours, you can finally get the service manager to help you.\n\nHere is Michelle's unbelievable story.\n\nMichelle says, \"If you have a Toyota and need an oil change, do not get your oil changed at Toyota.\u2026 I got an oil change for free, which normally I would be excited about, but I would rather have paid $100.\"\n\nShe says I got a text message from Toyota of \u2026.about a promo: they're having an oil change special for $19.95. I was like, heck yeah.\n\nThe text to Michelle read: \"Michelle, a $19.95 oil change is available for your 2015 Toyota Camry with VIN ending\u2026..only at Toyota of \u2026.! This price includes all the synthetic oil needed for your vehicle, a free multi-point inspection with pictures and video, a better test, and a free wheel alignment check. Offer ends 1/31/25. You can't beat that deal! Appointments are still available tomorrow, but we are filling up fast. Call us at\u2026., or respond with your desired date and time. Jessica :)\n\nMichelle continues, \"An oil change for my car normally would cost $100, but if I can save money and get one for $20, why not?\"\n\nSo, I booked an appointment to get my oil changed today at 1:30, and I showed up right at 1:30. The check-in went well, and I gave them my keys, and they said it would take an hour to an hour and a half max.\n\nIt wasn't a big deal because I had work to do, and I brought it all with me, so I waited in the waiting area and started doing my work. The guy who helped me came by and asked for my email because they didn't have it on file. I didn't see him for the rest of my appointment. I thought that he might be helping other people.\n\nAn hour goes by, and maybe they're not done yet. I won't ask anyone because they seem busy, so I'll wait another 30 minutes. It's now 3:00, and I started asking around me, Hey, do you know if my car is ready? Who can I talk to?\n\nThey say no, your car isn't ready yet. If it is, they will come and get you. So now 4:00 rolls around, and I'm getting antsy at this point. Because I've been here for two and a half hours.\n\nSo, I went to the counter where you check out and get your car, and I asked them, hey, can I get an update on my car? I was told it would take an hour and a half, but now it's been two and a half hours.\n\nThe lady was so nonchalant and standoffish that she didn't even give me the time of day. She looks through a bunch of files like she's doing something, but I know she's not doing anything for me.\n\nThen one of her coworkers interrupts our conversation and asks her a question, and then she completely ignores me. They start talking about a new employee who is working tomorrow. I'm like, hello? Can anyone help me?\n\nI must have been standing near the manager because he had overheard our conversation and asked me what I needed help with. I told him I'd been here for almost three hours now, and I was told I would be out in an hour and a half.\n\nHe asked who had helped me, and I described who he was, and then he went over and asked about my car. It turns out that he forgot about me and my car, and he starts scrambling through his paperwork, and he's like. Oh yeah, she's done.\n\nMy car had been done for over an hour, and no one came to tell me. The manager apologized and told me someone would bring my car out, and I could get it from the front. The manager was so nice, by the way, and he felt so bad that no one had helped me.\n\nSo, he ended up comping my $20.00 oil change. But I was so frustrated that I just wanted to get my keys and go home. The manager said I could wait inside because it was really cold out.\n\nHe said someone would come in and hand me the keys; they need to update the oil change sticker on your windshield. So, I stand by the cashier because I am afraid that if I sit down, they will forget about me again!\n\nSo I waited inside until I saw my car being pulled up, stepped outside to the curb, and waited for the guy to give me my keys. I see him wiping the windows and getting some paperwork, and then he leaves the car with the door open.\n\nI thought he had to get something. I see no one attending to my car; the door is wide open, and cars behind me are getting backed up because the other workers are pulling the cars up the driveway.\n\nWe made eye contact before the guy left my car, and I was like that's my car. The moral of the story is if a deal is too good to be true, it probably is. And I will never get my oil changed at Toyota again.\n\nConclusion.\n\nThis scenario has been played out dozens of times in Toyota and other car brand dealers' service departments. However, the service Michelle received was significantly inferior.\n\nWhat should Michelle have done differently?\n\nMichelle wasn't the only customer who received a text from Jessica at the Toyota dealer offering the $19.95 oil change special. Dozens of customers likely took them up on the good deal.\n\nOn a Friday afternoon, they were extra busy with customers wanting to get their cars serviced before the weekend. It's the perfect storm.\n\nAfter waiting an hour and a half, Michelle should have gone to the service desk and inquired about her car and been persistent until someone could tell her when her car would be finished.\n\nIn this case, the Toyota service advisor dropped the ball and let her slip through the cracks.\n\nWhen are the best and worst times to get your car serviced at a dealer?\n\nAccording to Kelly Auto Group, the worst times are Friday and Saturday. \"Usually, Friday and Saturdays are the busiest for dealers. They get a ton of inquiries and will have cars for service all over their place. People tend to get their vehicles checked on Fridays and Saturdays to make sure their weekend road trips are smooth and safe.\"\n\nThey say mid-week is the best time.\n\nKelly says, \"Tuesdays through Thursdays, are ideal and the best time to get your car serviced. Many dealers also offer mid-week deals and discounts to attract customers. You can check the dealer website to learn about mid-week specials and offers.\u201d\n\nCheck out another one of my Toyota dealer stories titled: Toyota Serviced My Corolla Transmission and Used the Wrong Fluid, They Said It May Cause Issues In the Long Run, But Don\u2019t Worry, We\u2019re Getting It Fixed Up Right Now\n\nHave you had a similar experience at a car dealer's service department?

            "content": "Toyota\u2019s trucks have a legendary reputation for ruggedness and reliability. Years ago, Top Gear taught us that a Toyota will keep on running after the most harrowing treatment, whether drowned in the ocean or dropped from an exploding tower block. Or in the case of one truck in Los Angeles\u2014melted in an all-consuming wildfire.\n\nThe news coming out of Los Angeles has been harrowing in the past week. Fires have raged across the county, with emergency services fighting around the clock to save lives and limit the damage. Unfavorable conditions have sadly seen entire neighborhoods destroyed, with many losing their homes, their cars, and all their worldly possessions to boot.\n\nLocal resident Brandon Sanders knows that pain better than most. \u201cOn Thursday we confirmed that we lost our house and everything in it to the Eaton Fire,\u201d he shared after returning to the scorched earth that was formerly his home. Amidst the rubble and ash, though, there was a survivor standing tall\u2014Brandon\u2019s 2013 Toyota Tacoma.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to see that the truck was standing at all and not a burned-out wreck,\u201d Brandon told me on Sunday night. \u201cIt was parked right up against some bushes in the front so I thought that it would be a total loss for sure.\u201d Despite the Eaton Fire torching over 14,000 acres, including Brandon\u2019s entire home, somehow, the Toyota was able to hold fast.\n\n\u201cWhen we went back in the day after the fire we were surprised to find it still standing, but we didn\u2019t have the keys\u2014they were burned in the fire,\u201d Brandon explains. \u201cThe exterior plastic was clearly badly melted, but we were able to pop the hood and see that the radiator and everything behind it looked okay, so we figured we\u2019d have a key made and give it a shot.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThankfully, a helpful dealer was able to sort this out.\n\n\u201cEnvision Toyota of West Covina made me a key free of charge from the VIN,\u201d says Brandon. \u201cI got back to the truck yesterday, put the key in the cylinder, and it fired right up.\u201d\n\nPost-fire, the truck is looking a little worse for wear. The whole front bumper is missing, with only melted fragments remaining. The headlight lenses are scorched and deformed, and the original grill was clearly liquified at some point, with the Toyota badge having sagged down to the bottom of the opening. While the front of the truck saw the worst of it, the rest of the body was filthy and deformed from the heat, too. Fender flares have bubbled up, and the taillights show some damage from the intense heat.\n\nAmazingly, despite the high heat that liquified much of the front end, the truck is pretty much fully functional. \u201cRight now, it is 100% driveable,\u201d Brandon explains. \u201cEverything works, even the headlights and blinkers\u201d Obviously, it\u2019s no longer in showroom condition, but he\u2019s not necessarily in a rush to change that. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going to have it repaired right away,\u201d says Brandon. \u201cWe lost our home in the fire so having an additional working vehicle is a great asset so I may just leave it as is at least for a while.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn any case, the post-apocalyptic aesthetic proved popular when he shared photos of the truck online. \u201cFolks on Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram seem to be in favor of leaving it as is indefinitely as it looks very \u2018badass,'\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s no question as to the devastation that tore through Altadena as the Eaton Fire raged. Crews are still working to contain the blaze, along with several others still burning throughout Los Angeles County. The sheer impact of the fire is readily visible in Brandon\u2019s own video below, which clearly shows the bare rubble left behind after the flames tore through the neighborhood. It also shows his Tacoma firing up at the first turn of the key.\n\nIt\u2019s wild to think that the Tacoma was able to suffer such heat and survive. Conditions were hot enough to melt the front bumper into a puddle, and yet the engine bay remained largely unscathed. Similarly, the taillights started to melt, but the tires survived intact. The upshot of this is that Brandon has a reliable truck to get around in as he and the neighborhood work through the aftermath of the harrowing fire.\n\nWhat was once a simple Toyota Tacoma is now an eye-catching relic of one of Los Angeles\u2019 most harrowing weeks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNote: If you\u2019d like to help, here are a few places you can donate:",

In a continued effort to make its vehicles more capable in the toughest of terrains, the company has implemented a feature called Crawl Control. This mode is designed for taking on tough terrains at slower speeds, so only its rough-and-tumble cars have it. These off-road vehicles include the Toyota Land Cruiser, Toyota Tacoma, Toyota Tundra, and Toyota 4Runner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToyota has a handful of vehicles equipped with both Multi-Terrain Select and Crawl Control. Only one at a time can be selected, so you'll need to pick the system that works best for each situation.\n\nMulti-Terrain has settings for mud and sand, loose rock, rock and dirt, mogul, and rock. Crawl Control is meant to assist the driver by controlling acceleration and braking for you, keeping you focused on steering. It does this by automatically modulating the throttle and brakes while on low speed settings. There are five settings within Crawl Control, too, including ones for steep hill climbs and ones for dramatic descents. Another setting lets you get up to speeds of 15 miles per hour, changing the throttle and brake for you (sometimes loudly).\n\nAdvertisement",

That\u2019s the attitude on display from Japan\u2019s Aero Over, which is working on an Italian tune-up of a very different sort for the five-door version of Toyota\u2019s hybridized executive car. This mockup may challenge the \u201cPuro\u201d in \u201cPurosangue,\u201d but I must admit, it looks pretty slick.\n\nDespite attempting to imitate a fairly lofty target, this Aero Over body and decal kit scores with subtlety. Let\u2019s face it; even some of the most expensive custom kits out there tend to err on the side of extra. Take Brabus, for example. Or perhaps for something a bit more on-the-nose, how about Mansory? You say many things about either tuner, but in no case could you accuse either of not trying hard enough.\n\nBut this? Well, I hesitate to use the word \u201celegant\u201d to describe anything with that many LED lights stacked one atop the other out front, but it\u2019s clean. The new front splitter makes the faux grille even larger, making it look like it can ingest more air. Out back, there are now four exhaust outlets and a new bumper to accommodate them. More air in, more air out, right? It\u2019s a look.\n\nAccompanying the exhaust is a set of custom wheels that certainly won\u2019t be mistaken for those found on Ferrari\u2019s SUV, but were obviously inspired by them. The yellow on the calipers matches nicely with the Ferrari-inspired yellow on the \u201cAero Over\u201d decals found on the exterior.\n\nSetting aside the Ferrari angle entirely, this thing just looks good. I could maybe do without the larger front grille, but without getting too hair-splitty, I\u2019m inclined to say this is a healthy improvement over the original. And dare I say it, maybe even better looking than the car that inspired it?",

            "content": "Toyota is well-known for building some of the most reliable engines on the planet. Perhaps its most stout powertrain is the automaker's VZ line of V-6s, first introduced in the late 1980s and used all the way up into the mid aughts. Over the years it's developed a reputation not only for reliability, but for being easy to service and cheap to run. But sometimes even the best can fail.\n\nThat's what happened to this engine. Acquired by the I Do Cars YouTube channel for a teardown, this 5VZ-FE is a rare example of a failed Toyota V-6. Host Eric claims he got it as a core trade, so it's not clear if the engine came from a 1996-2002 4Runner, a 1995-2004 Tacoma, or a 2000-2004 Tundra. Overseas, Toyota also used these engines in the Land Cruiser Prado, the Grand HiAce, and the Hilux.\n\nFirst impressions are good. A peek under the valve covers reveals healthy camshafts, with only minor wear on the cam caps. There aren't any metal flakes or milky oil, just a bit of tarnishing on the aluminum. Removing the heads doesn't reveal any surprises either, with intact head gaskets.\n\nIt's only when Eric goes to check the position of the last piston do things go awry. Instead of staying in place, it moves within the cylinder, indicating it's no longer attached to the crankshaft. Not good. Further digging reveals pieces of connecting rod strewn about the oil pan, separated from the piston. The loose pieces caused even more damage as they were flung around the crankcase, eventually punching a hole through the block.\n\nEric suspects a flooded cylinder is the culprit here. Seeing as how the head gasket was in good shape, he thinks a stuck injector dumped fuel into the cylinder, stopping the piston from being able to compress, leading to the carnage. With working replacements costing around $1,000, it's unlikely this engine will ever be rebuilt.

Navigating the final 100km stretch with ease, de Mevius picked up his second career stage win in Dakar with a margin of 1m34s over team-mate Joao Ferreira.\n\nPortuguese driver Ferreira was as much as five minutes down on the frontrunners in the opening phases of the stage, but made rapid gains as the day progressed, overhauling Overdrive Toyota\u2019s Yazeed Al-Rajhi in the last 28km to secure the runner-up spot.\n\n#240 X-Raid Mini JCW Team Mini: Joao Ferreira, Filipe Palmeiro Photo by: X-raid\n\nDacia\u2019s star driver Nasser Al-Attiyah also trailed Al-Rajhi at the penultimate checkpoint, but a rapid final dash propelled him to third place at the end of the stage, just 2m01s down on winner de Mevius.\n\nAl-Rajhi, who had borrowed a spare wheel from Saood Variawa during the transfer section, eventually slipped to fifth place in the final order, behind the factory Toyota of long-time stage leader Botterill.\n\nThey were followed by two more drivers from the Toyota contingent, Overdrive\u2019s Rokas Bociuska and factory racer Lategan.\n\nFord was unable to put up a fight to the faster Toyota and Mini entries on Saturday, as Mattias Ekstrom ended up 8m9s off the pace in eighth and team-mate Nani Roma finished further back in 10th.

But one Hilux owner in Malaysia decided they couldn\u2019t wait around for the big reveal and took matters into their own hands, ordering a custom conversion that swaps the old truck\u2019s face for something decidedly more modern.\n\nSpecifically, the truck in question has been retrofitted with the front end of the Toyota Fortuner. For context, the Fortuner is a three-row SUV that shares its ladder-frame underpinnings with the Hilux. That structural overlap means the two models are fairly close in dimensions, aside from the longer wheelbase of the Hilux, making this Frankenstein-style swap surprisingly feasible.\n\nMore: 2026 Toyota Hilux Spied Looking Like An Extensive Facelift\n\nAs evident from the profile, the conversion is based on the seventh-generation Hilux, a model that first hit the road in 2004 and remained in production until 2015. The work was carried out by One Auto Concept Garage in Malaysia, which outfitted the truck with an entirely new front fascia. The transformation includes a new bumper, headlights, grille, hood, and front fenders, all borrowed from the Fortuner.\n\nThe sharper LED headlights and aggressive bumper intakes from the Fortuner integrate cleanly with the Hilux\u2019s body, although some elements lean a bit more \u201caftermarket.\u201d The same applies to the carbon-style hood with vents and the wheels of this particular example, which appears to have been lowered for a sportier stance.\n\nPhotos: Azwan Ali / Facebook\n\nThe upgrades don\u2019t stop at the front, though. The rear section of this one-off Hilux comes courtesy of the eighth-gen model, with its more sculpted rear fenders, LED taillights, and a more modern tailgate and bumper design. The black paint and matching accents complete the transformation, giving the Hilux a more sinister look.\n\nMore: Toyota Hilux Champ Turns Into A Seven-Seater SUV\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the revamped Hilux received any performance upgrades to match its fresh new look. For now, it\u2019s possible the stock powertrain remains untouched.\n\nInterestingly, this custom job isn\u2019t as rare as you might think. A quick online search reveals similar conversion kits available on platforms like AliExpress (where else?) for around $2,000. That relatively low cost likely explains why other Hilux owners in Malaysia and across Southeast Asia have been drawn to Fortuner-inspired facelifts. Social media is littered with examples of similar builds, proving this trend has been gaining traction in the region.",

The partners, who have been working together since 2020, believe the collaboration could speed mass production of Interstellar\u2019s Zero and Momo rockets.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to what's possible, when we work together\u2026the sky's the limit,\u201d said Akio Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, during a presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 in Las Vegas. \u201cAnd speaking of sky, we're exploring rockets too\u2026because the future of mobility shouldn't be limited to just earth\u2026or just one car company for that matter.\u201d\n\nToyoda\u2019s CES address focused largely on the automaker\u2019s Woven City\u2014a human-made company town at the base of Mount Fuji, which the Toyota chairman described as a \u201cliving laboratory\u201d for mobility technology. When the city opens its doors in the fall, about 100 Toyota staffers and their families will move in. The population is eventually expected to swell to 2,000.\n\nThe approximately 175-acre site will serve as a campus for employees to live and work on projects such as autonomous vehicles, flying cars, in-home robots\u2014and rockets.\n\n\u201cThis business alliance will leverage the Toyota Group\u2019s extensive manufacturing capabilities and combine our expertise to advance rocket production and further drive mobility transformation,\u201d said Hajime Kumabe, CEO of Woven by Toyota, in a statement Tuesday.\n\nAt the core of Interstellar\u2019s space launch ambitions is Zero\u2014a reusable, two-stage orbital rocket for on-demand launches of small satellites. Its debut orbital launch is expected later this year. The company has completed seven flights of the smaller, suborbital Momo, which in 2019 became the first private, liquid-fueled rocket built by an Asian company to reach the edge of space.\n\nBut the firm is dreaming bigger. It is also developing the heavy-lift Deca rocket, designed to launch satellite constellations for Interstellar\u2019s satellite communications subsidiary, Our Stars. The idea is to offer both launch and satellite services akin to SpaceX\u2019s Starlink.\n\n\u201cThe satellite communications sector, which requires a high volume of launches, can reach its full potential when paired with a rocket company, as demonstrated by SpaceX in the U.S.\u201d Interstellar said in a Tuesday news release. \u201cWe are accelerating our efforts to become a comprehensive space infrastructure company.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese government is aiming to reach about 30 domestic rocket launches per year by the 2030s, which according to Interstellar will require the development of cheap, reusable rockets like SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9. State officials have already signalled their support by awarding the firm a $32.5 million grant to get its rockets off the ground.\n\nWith Zero, Momo, and Deca moving into Woven City, Interstellar will leverage Toyota\u2019s manufacturing prowess in hopes of driving down production costs and time to launch. The 2017 inaugural launch of Momo, which is designed mainly for small science payloads, cost about $440,000. For comparison, a Falcon 9 launch is estimated to cost about $62 million. But the SpaceX model can carry about 50,000 pounds of payload compared to an estimated 1,750 pounds for Zero, per Interstellar's website.",

In addition, we could see the four-pot engine in other Gazoo Racing-branded fun cars, maybe the reborn Celica we keep hearing about. Moreover, Toyota has pledged to keep the Supra in the lineup after the current generation retires.\n\nIn the meantime, Toyota will test the GR Yaris M by entering the pocket rocket in the Super Taikyu Series.

            "content": "Toyota is making big moves in the rapidly developing EV market. Is the Japanese giant changing with the times, or leading the charge? Here' s what you need to know.\n\nYou probably don't think of Toyota Motor (TM 2.02%) as a maker of electric vehicles (EVs). The Japanese automaker has been a dominant force in traditional gas cars for nearly a century. Toyota was a pioneer in hybrid vehicles, and the Prius is still a big seller after 27 years on the global market.\n\nToyota's electrifying EV sales\n\nBut the times, they are a-changin'. Electrified vehicles accounted for 45% of Toyota's total sales volume in 2024. Its car sales rose 4.2% last year but EV sales soared 56% higher. Long story short, Toyota remains a dominant leader in the automobile market, but its products are going electric at a tremendous speed.\n\nAnd it's not all about hybrids with or without plug-in charging ports, either. One of Toyota's fastest-growing luxury models in 2024 was the Lexus RZ, an all-electric SUV starting at $44,000. Full-year sales of this model rose from 5,386 in 2023 to 9,697 in 2024 -- a 79% jump. And on the mass-market side, the $37,000 Toyota bZ4X nearly doubled its sales from 9,329 to 18,570.\n\nThese numbers are still far behind ultra-popular names like the Toyota RAV4 8.5% growth to 475,193 units) and Camry (5.9% increase to 309,876), but the all-electric vehicles are catching up fast.\n\nRAV4 and Camry, watch out: All-electric Toyotas are catching up\n\nThe car market is going electric, and Toyota is embracing the new market with great success. Smaller rival Honda Motor (HMC 2.05%) is planning to merge with Nissan Motor (OTC: NSAN.Y), perhaps including Mitsubishi in a three-part combination of Japanese car marques, largely because they want to catch up with Toyota's hybrid-based leadership.\n\nAt the same time, the whole EV market relies on rapid expansion of charging networks. I recently found out first-hand that there's work to do on that front. A recently updated Fool research report shows that my home state of Florida has 3,605 public charging stations and 11,098 ports -- the third-largest port count in the country.\n\nYet, a short stint with an all-electric rental car taught me that the nearest charging point was nearly a half-hour drive away. Nearby gas stations had a few chargers with Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) supercharging ports, but the Hyundai in my driveway was only equipped with plugs for the ChargePoint (CHPT 6.65%) network.\n\nThat's bad news for potential Toyota buyers in my neck of the Floridian swamps (and other areas in similar situations). The Lexus RZ and Toyota bZ4X are incompatible with Tesla's chargers, though the company has struck a deal to offer ChargePoint home chargers when you buy these cars. The larger sales numbers of standard and plug-in hybrid models makes sense in this environment. If your Prius or hybrid Camry runs low on battery charge, a quick stop at the nearest gas station can keep you going in a less fuel-efficient manner.\n\nThe balance between consumer convenience and electric efficiency will develop over the next decade or so. 3,600 Florida charging stations is a big jump from 2,400 locations and 6,00 charging ports in 2022, and I expect the growth of widely compatible charging systems to accelerate.\n\nToyota is plugging into an electric future\n\nThere are deadlines involved in the evolution from fossil fuels to all-electric vehicles. For example, the U.S. government will not be allowed to add fossil-fuel light duty vehicles to its fleet in 2027 and should phase out all gas and diesel units by the year 2040. As a leading seller of cars and trucks to governments around the world, Toyota can't afford losing that large market to other car makers -- so the Japanese giant is building its own battery factories and planning an all-in approach to EVs in the long run. The future is electric, and Toyota plans to remain a global giant in a very different automotive market.\n\nIn the meantime, the company will keep pushing the hybrid solution until charging networks are ready to take the convenience mantle from today's gas stations. Toyota's stock has outperformed all other traditional car makers over the last four years, and for good reason; its reputation for engineering quality is a good match with a careful entry into the EV world.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nWhen I purchased a Toyota last March, I knew it would be a hybrid-electric vehicle. I just didn\u2019t know what model. It turned out that the Venza fit my needs best, and after 10,000 miles, I love the Venza Hybrid more and more as time passes. This update to my long-term review will focus on a problem with the infotainment system and how the dealer resolved it for me. I have also changed the tires, and I can give my impressions of the Goodyear WeatherReady2 tires now that I\u2019ve driven on them for a while.\n\nSee the Initial Review Here:\n\nSee the 5K Update Here:\n\nVenza Infotainment System Problem and Resolution\n\nOne of the Venza Limited's best features is its outstanding infotainment setup. I use Apple CarPlay on every trip. It\u2019s wireless and seamless. I\u2019m team Apple through and through and would not even consider a vehicle without wireless CarPlay. However, during my last few months, a problem came up.\n\nThe infotainment screen began showing me numerous error-type messages. I\u2019d have to hit a small x to remove the messages from the screen. It was a hazard and an annoyance. At the suggestion of a fellow car tester, I called the dealer from which I purchased the Venza, Acton Toyota of Littleton, MA. I started with the service department, but they turned me over to the sales department when they heard I had an infotainment screen issue. That seemed odd, but I played along. The sales associate who took my call was not my salesperson (he was out of the office). Despite never having met me, this person took all the time I needed on the phone to listen closely to what I was struggling with. After which, he said he understood the issue and had a possible fix.\n\nThe problem turned out to be that my Toyota phone app had a security code, and I simply needed to refresh the app and input the code. Once I did so, all of the many problems instantly went away and I have driven issue-free now for many weeks. I\u2019m as high-tech as the next woman and understand that once in a blue moon, there are such minor issues to deal with. What impressed me most was that the team at Acton Toyota was ready, willing, and able to resolve this for me with one quick phone call. No service visit was needed. If you read my prior reviews, you will note that Acton Toyota impressed me with pick-up and delivery when it was time for my first scheduled service visit. I\u2019ve never experienced this level of great service, though I will say Mazda took very good care of me and even offered free service to me and my fellow healthcare workers during COVID.\n\nNew All-Weather Tires For Venza\n\nIn my household, we conduct tire testing involving many different testers. I am a part of this, though I will not pretend to have a passion for it. When Goodyear brought out the new WeatherReady2 all-weather tire, we opted to be among the first to test and review it. The big plusses are a smooth, quiet ride with excellent wet weather and snow/ice grip. The downside is my mileage dropped from around 40 MPG to around 35 MPG. We\u2019ve been doing a bit of snooping in the social media clubs, asking fellow owners of this tire if they have seen a similar drop, and it is proving to be universal. I\u2019m not thrilled with the lower MPG mainly because I drive a lot and want the most range between stops I can get. We will have to think about whether these tires will be our 4-season Venza tires or if we will swap them out in spring and then put them back on next winter.\n\nToyota Venza Hybrid 10K Conclusion\n\nOpting for a Venza was a move I\u2019m happy to have made. The vehicle is outstanding in many ways. The unexpected bonus has been the hassle-free dealer support. Watch for more updates in late winter.\n\nHande Tuncer, MD, is a contributing writer to Torque News and publications related to medical topics.

            "content": "Toyota has been sending trucks and SUVs overseas for just as long it has cars, and some might argue that it\u2019s these task-focused machines that gave the brand its first toehold in North America. With nameplates like the Land Cruiser and the 4Runner leading the charge, there are a handful of intriguing, available, and occasionally even affordable old Toyota trucks out there that have made a big impression on collectors.\n\nHere\u2019s our take on which Toyota trucks are the hottest commodity among those who want to drive a classic that\u2019s different from the Ford, Chevy, or Dodge parked in their neighbor\u2019s garage.\n\n1960-1983 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40\n\nThat\u2019s not a typo: The prototypical Toyota SUV enjoyed one of the longest production runs in automotive history. The FJ40 generation of the Toyota Land Cruiser was the brand\u2019s global coming-out party; a vehicle that took the lessons learned from building similar-sized truck-based sport-utility vehicles after the Second World War and combined them with incredible durability to produce a two-door off-road machine that could ditch its top and mimic America\u2019s open-air Jeep in markets starving for a go-anywhere 4x4 option.\n\nOver the course of its long life, the FJ40 was accorded a long list of drivetrains and upgrades, but most models vacillated between the poles of an inline six-cylinder engine and a four-cylinder diesel. Low-powered but stout, the Land Cruiser acquired disc brakes, air conditioning, and power steering by the time it played out the string in the early 1980s. The FJ40 left the United States in 1983 (with only 300 trucks imported), but stayed on another year in Canada, with continuation trucks built in Brazil until 2001.\n\nToday, the FJ40 is a highly sought-after classic Toyota truck whose values hover just above the $90,000 mark for mint-condition early models. Although hundreds of thousands were built worldwide, it\u2019s difficult to find clean examples, as most pulled tough duty for decades in some of the roughest conditions imaginable. This makes it likely that values for well-presenting Toyota FJ40s will remain strong.\n\n1973-1978 Toyota Pickup\n\nAlthough it was sold as the Hilux nearly everywhere else, Toyota\u2019s second effort at snagging the attention of American truck buyers was known simply as the Pickup in U.S. showrooms.\n\nShipped across the ocean with their cargo beds to be installed at the port as a runaround the Chicken Tax that effectively barred small trucks assembled outside of the country, the Pickup was remarkably effective at siphoning open-minded buyers away from traditional full-size offerings. Easy to maneuver, comfortable to drive, and with enough power from its four-cylinder engine to make good on its hauling potential, the Pickup provided a real alternative to the status quo. In fact, it was so successful that by the end of the decade, Ford, Dodge, and Chevrolet were importing and rebadging tiny trucks of their own.\n\nAlthough not quite as adventure-oriented as the FJ40\u2014remember, the Pickup was initially two-wheel drive\u2014these models have historically not been treated with kid gloves by their original owners. Japanese vehicles from the 1970s also had to deal with an extreme tendency towards rust in damper climates or when exposed to salt. Attrition keeps the price of survivors in the $13,500 to $20,000 range, and that number could climb as more collectors are priced out of the full-size classic truck market.\n\n1980-1992 Toyota FJ60/FJ62\n\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser FJ60 expanded the nameplate\u2019s recognition among American SUV buyers in the 1980s due to its four-door practicality and plus-size dimensions. Here was a four-wheel-drive people-mover that was much more comfortable to drive on a daily basis than its predecessors had been but also sacrificed almost nothing when it came to off-road acumen.\n\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that the FJ60 Land Cruiser had mass appeal in the United States, which was still finding its way towards the SUV dominance that applies today. Still, an inline-six provided decent motivation for the long-wheelbase truck, and it featured three rows of seating for up to seven passengers\u2014as long as two of those riders were OK with the fold-down, side-mounted benches in the cargo bay.\n\nWhen the FJ62 arrived for the 1988 model year, it swapped square headlights for round ones but largely kept the same shape and styling of the earlier SUV. More important upgrades included fuel injection, an automatic transmission, and power accessories to help further coddle drivers.\n\nThe FJ60 and FJ62 are prized by collectors who use their trucks for long-distance adventure, as their interior space and mechanical simplicity make them good on-road and off-road companions that are easy to repair should something snap on the trail. They\u2019re also cheaper to buy and easier to find than the FJ40, although driver-quality editions are now past the $25,000 mark.\n\n1981-1983 Toyota Trekker\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the rarest of the rare Toyota trucks, then the Trekker is your holy grail. In the early 1980s, a small batch of Pickups (about 1,500 or so), were modified by Winnebago, under contract to Toyota, to carpet and cover the cargo bed with a fiberglass top and add a second set of seats at the back.\n\nIf the concept sounds familiar, that\u2019s because the Trekker is essentially the Toyota 4Runner\u2019s direct ancestor, albeit one that had its genesis in the imagination of a Wisconsin Toyota dealer who figured he could sell the hybrid truck/wagon to campers and other outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nThe Trekker is extremely hard to find, and prices range from $10,000 all the way up to $50,000, depending on mileage, condition, and how optimistic the seller is feeling. It\u2019s a significant piece of Toyota history that inspired one of the automaker\u2019s most popular models just a few short years after it proved the SUV concept was a viable one for Toyota outside of the Land Cruiser family.\n\nPhotos: Mecum Auctions\n\n1984-1988 Toyota Pickup\n\nIf you say \u201c1985 Toyota SR5 Xtra Cab\u201d to a certain type of movie geek, chances are they\u2019ll reply with Back to the Future. Decked out with a roll bar, lift kit, and off-road lights, this blacked-out Toyota Pickup made a star out of the company\u2019s humble truck and gave it the kind of publicity blitz that money simply can\u2019t buy outside of the silver screen.\n\nAlthough the Hollywood shout-out helped, this era of Pickup made Toyota hit the trucking mainstream on its own merits, too. Competing against recent compact entries from Detroit like the Ford Ranger and the Chevrolet S-10, the Pickup enjoyed an excellent reputation for toughness and reliability, with its basic four-cylinder motor (which added fuel injection to the mix in 1985) almost impossible to kill. Later editions also graduated to V-6 power.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that outside the 4x4 scene, these Toyota Pickups were also popular with mini-truck fans, who used them to create the neon underglow street machines that took over Southern California in the following decade.\n\nPricing for Marty McFly specials is predictably over the top, but you can find the average ask clustered around the $20,000 mark.\n\n1984-1988 Toyota 4Runner\n\nWhen Toyota officially got into the small SUV game, it made a big splash with the 4Runner. As with the Trekker, the 4Runner borrowed its mechanicals and platform from the Pickup. In fact, the vast majority of first-generation 4Runners (known as the Hilux Surf in other markets) were little more than Pickups with a removable fiberglass bed cover and body-on-frame sheet metal when they rolled off the boat and onto the dock.\n\nAnother victim of the Chicken Tax, Toyota relied primarily on dealers to make seats and seatbelt work inside the cargo area of the 4Runner. Power came from a four-cylinder, a turbocharged four-cylinder, and, towards the end of the run, a V-6 engine, largely matching what the Pickup had to offer. An independent front suspension also arrived on later models.\n\nThe second-generation 4Runner might be the one with greater appeal (which is certainly reflected by its sales numbers), as it added an extra set of doors and a fully finished passenger compartment. That\u2019s what makes the original 4Runner one of the most collectible Toyota trucks, however, as it\u2019s less commonly found and more unusual in character than what we\u2019re used to in a modern SUV. Look to pay in the $30,000 range for a good-condition example.\n\n1990-1997 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ80\n\nThe last of the classic Toyota Land Cruisers is a bit of a twofer. Not only did this full-size, four-door arrive in America under the Toyota banner, it also donated its platform and much of its sheet metal to the Lexus LX450, the first off-road SUV built by the automaker\u2019s nascent luxury brand.\n\nToyota pushed aspects of the FJ80 into the modern era, adding coil springs in place of leaf designs front and rear, but it also celebrated its heritage with a robust, if unsophisticated, six-cylinder engine for its first few years of production (with a twin-cam unit arriving in the middle of the decade).\n\nThe FJ80 is a vehicle caught between its rugged past and a future that tilted far more towards the Lexus side of the spectrum. It has also somehow exploded in popularity with collectors over the past few years, with prime examples commanding six figures and ones in less-than-pristine condition roughly half that amount. There\u2019s no doubt that its status as the last analog Land Cruiser has played a role in its surging values.\n\nOld Toyota Trucks and SUVs Collectors Love",

            "content": "Getty/NurPhoto\n\nAt CES 2025's opening keynote, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang unveiled what it calls \"Cosmos,\" a set of AI technologies that forms a new software platform. Cosmos includes \"state-of-the-art generative world foundation models,\" as Huang called them.\n\nCosmos taps generative AI to fill the biggest gap that's keeping robots from becoming more useful: training data. As Huang says, \"In order to train a robot, you need a lot of data.\" This technology has the potential to enable robotics and autonomous vehicle makers to make important leaps forward in the years ahead.\n\nFor that reason, ZDNET and the rest of the CNET Group awarded Nvidia Cosmos two official Best of CES awards for 2025. You can see all 12 of the Best of CES winners selected by the CNET Group (ZDNET, CNET, PCMag, Mashable, and Lifehacker) in partnership with the organization that runs CES.\n\nAlso: CES 2025: The most impressive products we've seen\n\nCosmos works in conjunction with Nvidia's physics simulation tool, Omniverse. Omniverse generates simulations, and Cosmos then turns them into photo-realistic video imagery to train robots and automobiles. \"Take thousands of drives and turn them into billions of miles\" is how Huang characterized the interplay between Omniverse and Cosmos.\n\nHuang was surrounded onstage by a number of existing models of general-purpose humanoid robots.\n\nHuang called Cosmos \"the world's first world foundation model,\" noting it is trained on 20 million hours of video. \"It's really about teaching the AI to understand the physical world.\"\n\nAlso: Nvidia's Omniverse: The metaverse is a network, not a destination\n\nHuang compared the Cosmos project to Meta Platforms's wildly popular Llama large language model, saying, \"We really hope it will do for the world of robotics and AI what Llama has done for enterprise AI.\"\n\nCosmos with Omniverse can be used for applications such as training a robot for a warehouse by having the robot perform hours of training in a simulation of the warehouse environment. \"The ChatGPT moment for robotics is just around the corner,\" said Huang.\n\nThe Cosmos code is available under an open-source license on GitHub, said Huang.\n\nHuang Emphasized Nvidia's automotive partners in his CES 2025 keynote.\n\nNvidia has inked a deal for Toyota, the world's largest car manufacturer, to use the company's autonomous driving chips and software in multiple different models of car, Huang also announced during the opening keynote.\n\n\"The AV revolution has arrived,\" said Huang, meaning autonomous vehicles.\n\nAlso: Nvidia Project Digits: A Linux-powered desktop for AI developers\n\n\"Today, Toyota and Nvidia are going to partner together to create their next-generation AVs.\" Self-driving cars will be the \"first trillion-dollar robotics market,\" Huang predicted.\n\nNvidia has had a relationship with Toyota for several years now. The company's DGX computers have been used by Toyota for training artificial intelligence models for self-driving vehicles. Monday's announcement is an expansion of that relationship, said Nvidia's head of automotive products, Ali Kani, in a briefing with reporters, where the carmaker will also use the company's \"AGX\" onboard AI computer. The latest version of that chip, Huang announced, is called the \"Thor AGX.\" It is twenty times more powerful than its predecessor Orin model.\n\nHuang was surrounded onstage by a number of existing models of general-purpose humanoid robots.\n\nHuang also unveiled additions to its suite of AI software. The updates include a group of AI models based on Meta Platforms's Llama model, called Llama Nemotron. Huang told the audience that Llama is \"the reason every organization has been activated to work on AI.\" The Nvidia versions are meant to \"fine-tune\" Llama for enterprise use.\n\nHuang also talked at length about the rising prominence of \"agentic AI,\" where large language models, or multi-modal AI models, can call upon outside programs to carry out tasks.\n\nAlso: AI data centers are becoming 'mind-blowingly large'\n\n\"There's this whole world of agentic AI, all these amazing new startups building frameworks like LangGraph, Llama Index, and Crew AI,\" said Justin Boitano, president of enterprise AI software products at Nvidia, in a briefing we had.\n\nThose startups are \"changing the programming model of how do you write applications: you write an AI, you give it a role, which is like a persona, you give it a goal, you can create it with just a prompt.\" Nvidia works extensively with the startups, said Boitano.\n\nHuang said that agentic AI, combined with self-driving cars and robots, are \"three types of robots we are working on.\"\n\nA new version of the Grace-Blackwell combined CPU and GPU chip, called GB10, is the brains of the new DIGITS desktop computer.\n\nOther announcements in the keynote included GEFORCE \"Blackwell,\" the latest version of the company's gaming GPU, which is slashed in price from its predecessor 4090 to $549 from $1,599, available starting this month, with laptop versions coming in March; and Project DIGITS, a compact personal computer optimized for AI development, running a new version of the Grace-Blackwell combined CPU and GPU chip, called GB10.",

            "content": "SHANNON CURTIS, Senior Manager, Technology Solutions & Marketing, The Raymond Corporation\n\nLOREN SWAKOW, Managing Director, Noblelift North America\n\nQ: HOW DO YOU VIEW THE CURRENT LIFT TRUCK MARKET?\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: Consumers are clamoring for innovation in the food supply chain sphere in 2025. From a greater emphasis on convenience to a renewed desire for operational efficiency and security, new preferences call for a shift from tried-and-true procedures to innovative business models that champion modernization\u2014the adoption of which can help organizations stand out as technological and cultural leaders in the new year and beyond.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: I think it is still a strong and viable market\u2014[there are] always new opportunities. When the new additional tariffs come in, we shall see how that affects the total market. I think the demand for used equipment will go up. Users will have X amount of dollars to invest in equipment, and if the Chinese, Canadian, and/or Mexican product [costs] gets pushed higher, the user does not necessarily have more money available. I am not sure sales of American-made lift trucks will increase.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: It\u2019s safe to say the industrial lift truck market has been somewhat volatile the last five years, with the market reaching all-time highs during the pandemic years, [then experiencing] massive swings downward these past two. While most lift truck OEMs enjoyed the spike in sales, the enormous demand put a significant strain on the supply chain, pushing leadtimes out to unprecedented levels while simultaneously driving up costs. The significant market decline is something no CEO in this industry would boast about. The fall we are experiencing today is better viewed as a normalization or correction to a market that was way overinflated.\n\nWith all the pent-up demand from the excessive orders due to the elongated pandemic leadtimes, we are now experiencing an abundance of stock on hand at both the OEM and distribution levels. On the surface, a market that\u2019s quickly becoming half of what it was two years ago looks catastrophic. However, when you compare it to what\u2019s happened over the past 15 years, today\u2019s market still looks relatively healthy.\n\nQ: WILL 2025 AND THE HOPES OF LOWER INTEREST RATES SPUR INVESTMENTS IN NEW INDUSTRIAL TRUCKS?\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: It will not hurt, but I do not think interest rates hinder sales. One point [in the interest rate] in either direction has a small impact on the payment. A rate reduction can be used as a marketing tool, though. If rates decline, dealers can go back over their outstanding quotes, refigure the payments, and present a new monthly cost to the user.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: There are many factors, including interest rates, that play a role in the level of investment in industrial truck fleets. Most significant of those factors is consumer confidence. Logically, when consumers are confident, they buy more, which means manufacturers will have to make more and lift trucks will have to move more.\n\nWhile inflation and high interest rates have surely stifled consumer confidence these past four years, there are signs that a new, more business-friendly administration will work in conjunction with lower interest rates to help drive up consumer confidence. Lower interest rates will work hand in hand with that resurgence in consumer confidence to help drive more investment in industrial equipment.\n\nQ: WILL THE NEW ADMINISTRATION\u2019S PROPOSED TARIFFS HURT OR HELP YOUR BRANDS?\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: The industrial lift truck market is one that is very global in nature, with a complex supply chain and operations scattered throughout the world. The tariffs that are being proposed on countries like Canada, Mexico, and China will undoubtedly have an impact on the industrial market, depending on the manufacturer. All lift truck manufacturers will experience varying levels of impact due to the tariffs, but tariffs are designed to incentivize companies to re-evaluate their supply chains and bring more manufacturing capacity back to the United States, which is a good thing.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: As we represent a Chinese manufacturer, the tariff increase will have an effect. We are currently paying 25%. An additional 10% (as of the last reports) is manageable. It is a world economy. Adding the tariff just adds cost to the product here in the U.S. China does not pay it; the dealers do. We have no choice but to pass on this added cost. To reduce the costs of tariffs, manufacturers will move production to a country that does not have a tariff. Even though labor costs will be higher, it will not add more than the proposed tariff to the cost of the machine.\n\nThe factory will look for new countries to manufacture in as well. If tariffs had come in at 60% per campaign promises, it would have been disastrous. We probably would have moved manufacturing to Vietnam or another Asian country immediately.\n\nQ: THE MARKET HAS BEEN MOVING TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN RECENT YEARS. DO YOU THINK THIS WILL CONTINUE, OR WILL THE ADVENT OF A MORE FOSSIL FUEL-FRIENDLY ADMINISTRATION DRIVE MORE DEMAND FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION (IC) TRUCKS?\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: The states have a bigger say in this than the federal government. Look at California as an example. With the advent of lithium as a safe and effective power solution, and with the price of lithium batteries coming down, I think [the use of] electric vehicles will continue to expand. Total cost of ownership is already much lower on electric when compared to IC product.\n\nWe continue to see electric product increasing every year. It is more sustainable, and it has now reached a point where cost is not a barrier to entry. Power and force have been overcome; we produce an electric rough-terrain lift truck that has a 50-degree gradeability.\n\nUsers will look at their own requirements, costs, etc., before deciding on IC or electric. I do not think the new administration will be able to justify the additional cost needed to use IC products. Electric is the future of material handling.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: As anyone involved with the industrial lift truck market knows, California has been the driving force behind the electrification of the market, forcing organizations that operate in that state away from lift trucks that run on fossil fuels. While there have been no changes in the stringent regulations being imposed by the California Zero Emission Forklift Initiative, which essentially prohibits the sale of most spark-ignited internal combustion forklifts starting in 2026, there are many that expect an easing of such regulations.\n\nYet, aside from the legislative pressures, there continues to be a strong value proposition for making the switch to electric. Technological advancements in lift truck systems, battery technology, and charging platforms have all combined to make moving to electric more feasible than ever before; we are one of the only westernized nations who still use combustion engine equipment indoors. This is a welcome change for both warehouse employees and the environment.\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: The industry is embracing alternative fuel and energy sources. One viable option is lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with certification from Underwriters Laboratories. While lithium-ion technology is already a proven solution in the industry, offering superior performance and longer life spans than traditional lead-acid batteries, The Raymond Corporation sees UL-compliant LIBs playing a pivotal role in meeting new regulatory standards. These batteries not only help reduce emissions but also improve the operational efficiency of the material handling, manufacturing, and warehousing industries.\n\nQ: LIFT TRUCKS ARE USED FOR MANY TASKS, BUT ARE THERE ANY APPLICATIONS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO CUSTOMERS?\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: Today, organizations are aiming innovations in lift truck technologies to increase uptime, improve speed and mobility, streamline diagnostic procedures, and lower operating and energy costs\u2014dramatically cutting consumption without reducing productivity. And it\u2019s not just the forklift technologies that are evolving. The systems that warehouse managers rely on to manage and maintain their trucks\u2014including operator-assist and data collection technologies\u2014are also growing increasingly advanced.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: E-commerce has fueled growth in the last few years. I believe it is here to stay. If anything, it will expand. All these products come from warehouses that need material handling machines. Every product we touch, including food, is probably moved at one point by a lift truck. We need to move products from one location to another, and trucks must be loaded and then unloaded at their destination. Lift trucks perform this function.\n\nWe are seeing continued expansion of Class III product [electric hand trucks and hand/rider trucks]. Walkie products move material but cannot stack it. Companies are realizing most of their need is for movement. For example, [a company may] have always used three lift trucks [that can both move and stack product] in its warehouse, when it only needs to have one truck [that\u2019s capable of both moving and stacking product] along with two trucks [that just] move material, which includes loading and unloading at the dock.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: Labor constraints today have been a significant challenge for operations that require the use of lift trucks. With the massive movement to e-commerce, there is a much higher need for lift truck operators in warehousing and distribution environments. The lack of skilled labor has really pressured companies to invest in technologies that help operations accomplish more with less. As a result, more and more operations are looking to [incorporate] various levels of automation into their industrial lift truck fleets.\n\nQ: DO YOU SEE ROBOTICS SOLUTIONS AS COMPETITIVE WITH FORKLIFTS OR COMPLEMENTARY TO THEM?\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: For many years, the industrial lift truck manufacturers viewed automation and AGV [automatic guided vehicle] companies as competitors, but we\u2019ve experienced a significant change in thinking over the past decade. What was a threat has now become a strength for the lift truck manufacturers. Almost all lift truck manufacturers today have expanded their technology capabilities to such a level that they are now able to offer automated versions of their standard equipment with improved ROI [return on investment] calculations.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: They are complementary. Most AGV solutions are based on a forklift of some type. We will just be building different types of forklifts. The goal of robotics is to take out the labor cost of the driver. The operator is by far the most expensive component of material handling.\n\nSupport of your AGV will determine the success of the project. Dealer networks will be the key here. There are more and more companies getting into the AGV market, but can they support it after the sale?\n\nRepetitive moves or long distances are the easiest [places] to remove the driver from the equation. If the unit goes down because of programming or mechanics, you must be able to get it back up operating as soon as possible. Dealer network and aftersales support should be a major component of the decision to take advantage of the benefits of AGV material handling.\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: Robots have been used in warehouses for decades, but in recent years, \u201ccobots\u201d have become even more complementary in the warehouse and instrumental in providing great levels of efficiency. From improved security and increased productivity to increased accuracy and lower costs, cobots are becoming an increasingly important part of warehouse operations.\n\nQ: TODAY\u2019S INDUSTRIAL TRUCKS OFFER MORE SAFETY FEATURES THAN EVER BEFORE. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SAFETY DEVELOPMENTS OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS?\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: One of the most significant advancements in warehouse operations involves the implementation of virtual reality (VR) simulators. The technology can help new forklift operators develop the skills they need to succeed on the warehouse floor without impacting day-to-day operations, while also serving as a reinforcement tool for experienced operators. VR simulators serve as flexible, scalable teaching tools that rely on advanced technology to help workforces become more efficient and expand operator skills, creating optimized conditions for all employees.\n\nIn addition, training reinforcement offerings\u2014like integrated equipment detection and notification systems and operator tether systems\u2014can similarly help warehouse operators improve their work environment. Systems like these use intelligent speed limitations, real-time object detection, operator notifications, and more to improve employee awareness of their environment even in high-traffic areas.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: With advancements in technology, all lift truck manufacturers are playing their part in developing new technologies that allow for the safe operation of their equipment. While there are various means in which manufacturers have applied these technologies, there is no substitute for a sound operator safety training program. [Ensuring that your operators receive the proper training] will always be the number-one way to reduce the likelihood of workplace incidents involving lift trucks. In addition to having fully trained operators, many manufacturers offer optional operator-assistance systems that may improve workplace safety for both the operator and those working around lift trucks.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: When I started in this business, we were selling used trucks without overhead guards. They were produced without them. The load backrest was not a given. Seat belts were nonexistent.\n\nThere have been so many great advancements in safety, it is hard to pick just one. We are incorporating AI [artificial intelligence] into our equipment now. This will recognize a person in the area and warn the driver. Besides changing the physical attributes of the lift truck to make it safer for the operator, we will see more and more technology and AI in the pursuit of making it safer for the pedestrian.\n\nQ: WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF LEASING VERSUS BUYING FOR COMPANIES LOOKING TO ACQUIRE NEW TRUCKS?\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: This is an age-old question. It really depends on the user. It is a function of cash flow and cash balances in each company. Leases can be expensed, while purchases need to be capitalized. Not only are we looking at the cash position, but we also now need to review our profit position. The user needs a lift truck, but does he need to capitalize it because profit is low, or does he need to expense it to decrease his profit and reduce the taxes on the company?\n\nEvery company is different, [but either way,] you will have outflow of cash and a new lift truck on the floor producing for you. The question is which method benefits the organization the most.\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: Today\u2019s electric forklifts offer performance that meets the needs of the most common lift truck applications, but with dramatically reduced maintenance requirements and with data collection capabilities that are quickly becoming essential to facility and resource optimization. Although the total cost of ownership of electric products is typically lower than for internal combustion products, the higher upfront initial purchase cost of switching to electric-powered equipment may have been a barrier in the past. Currently available governmental incentives and supplier programs, like leasing, make battery power\u2014specifically, the traditionally more expensive lithium-ion power\u2014even easier to justify.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: When it comes to the lease vs. buy decision, each organization needs to evaluate several factors when considering what\u2019s right for their application and company.\n\nIn leasing, you enjoy a lower cost per month and can be flexible on the terms of the lease. If you have a high-use environment, where you may need to renew equipment more often, leasing clearly has its advantages. In addition, a lease is often treated as an operating expense on the income statement, while a financed forklift is considered an asset on the balance sheet with depreciation expense recorded each period.",

Bill Finerty, currently Toyota Material Handling\u2019s president and CEO, will retire at the end of March.\n\nA spokesperson for Toyota noted that TMHNA is committed to maintaining unique brand identities for both Raymond and Toyota in the marketplace, so the Raymond brand will continue.\n\nExplaining the move, Wood said in a statement, \u201cOur customers\u2019 needs are evolving rapidly, and we must prepare and adapt to an ever-changing market.\u201d In particular, he pointed to the opportunity to leverage people, processes and into one unified organization. He also noted that there will not be any layoffs, adding that TMHNA plans to invest even more in its workforce to accelerate growth.\n\n\u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to reduce our workforce, but rather to bring together the strengths, resources and talent from throughout our organizations,\u201d said Wood. In 2024, Toyota Material Handling and Raymond Toyota announced the formation of an Energy Solutions Manufacturing Center of Excellence in Greene, N.Y., that is expected to open this year and add 45 jobs. Also, Toyota recently broke ground on a new 295,000 square foot facility in Columbus, Ind., which will produce electric vehicles and is scheduled to open in 2026.",

            "content": "Toyota is conducting pre-production trials at its Randolph County factory in the completed building that\u2019s scheduled to start churning out batteries for its hybrid-electric vehicles by the early spring.\n\nThat\u2019s the word officials at the N.C. Department of Transportation have received. They are in a position to know because the agency coordinated site-preparation work on the massive facility in Randolph County.\n\n\u201cCurrently they are up to 1,400 jobs they have hired and [have] in place,\u201d said Reuben Blakley, the chief engineer for DOT\u2019s Division 8.\n\nBlakley is NCDOT\u2019s point man in dealing not just with the Toyota factory, but two additional state-incentivized industrial projects in Chatham County, Wolfspeed and VinFast.\n\nSo he was the person the State Board of Transportation\u2019s economic development committee wanted to hear from on Tuesday for a progress report.\n\nThe $13.9 billion Toyota battery factory is the largest of three in terms of the state\u2019s involvement and its expected economic impact. In return for state incentives, the Japanese carmaker pledged to create at least 5,100 jobs.\n\nDOT\u2019s involvement in the site work for Toyota is unique to that project, as on Chatham megasites it\u2019s sticking to its more usual road-building role.\n\nBut state help with leveling and prepping 1,200 acres of site was integral to the original incentive package that got embedded into the budget bill legislators and former Gov. Roy Cooper agreed to in late 2021.\n\nToyota\u2019s stance was \u201cwe\u2019re not dirt movers, we\u2019re car builders,\u201d Blakley said of the leverage the company exerted to get the state to lend a hand.\n\nHe added that the work has cost \u201cclose to $1 billion for what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nLegislators and the Golden LEAF Foundation have channeled $225 million to the agency for road work to support the project. The General Assembly also allotted $100 million for site work.\n\nToyota\u2019s supplied another $510 million, though it\u2019s in line to get a state reimbursement for some of that. The 2021 budget bill allowed the company to claim as much as $185 million in repayments for \u201csite work, roadwork and wetlands mitigation.\u201d\n\nBlakley said Toyota was wiring DOT \u201c25, 50, 75, 100 million dollars at a time as we needed it.\u201d\n\nLegislators allowed DOT to use its construction manager/general contractor procurement process to run the project, a move that Blakley said \u201csaved us money because it reduced a lot of risk.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t eliminate risk entirely.\n\nFor example, the agency made sure it got new airborne photogrammetric surveys of the site every month or two, and has worked with Terracon to make sure the site\u2019s new topography is stable and conforms to plan.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges and fears of mine was just the liability of the state being involved with a project like this,\u201d Blakley said. \u201cIf you build a road and it settles a half inch in an embankment in 10 years, maybe it\u2019s OK. But if a building slab settles a half inch in 10 years, it\u2019s not OK, especially if you got precise equipment [sitting on it].\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s nerve-wracking enough that at least one Board of Transportation member isn\u2019t keen on seeing the state do this again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t do the earthwork for the other two sites,\u201d said Stephen Rosenburgh. \u201cIt\u2019s better if the legislature just puts up a fixed amount and says, \u2018Here, boys, you go to it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether or not it\u2019s a good investment \u2014 I think it is \u2014 [it\u2019s] scary if you look at all the costs,\u201d added board member Leo Daughtry, a former House majority leader.",

            "content": "Much like Toyota used a V-12 only for the Century, its premium division Lexus reserved the V-10 for the LFA. Some 12 years after production ended, the supercar is back in an unusually long official video focusing on the engine soundtrack and exhaust note. It's not the first video of this type we've seen recently. Last August, there was similar three-hour footage just with Subaru boxer engine sounds.\n\nThe video comes to us via Toyota Times, an official magazine that covers interesting subjects from time to time. Assistant Manager Sano reveals Lexus \"built and tested countless prototypes\" with Yamaha. Codenamed \"1LR-GUE,\" the musically tuned ten-cylinder mill revs to 9,500 rpm. Here's why the even-firing naturally aspirated 4.8-liter engine sounds this good:\n\n\"The engineer overseeing sound design at the time stressed the need to deliver solid first-, second-, and third-order sounds. They worked to create an exhaust sound with clear octave harmonies, adding half-orders on the intake side at high RPMs to produce a dense, complex sound. They also incorporated analytical methods used in phonetics to develop the ideal exhaust sound, powerful at low RPMs and with a sharper tone at higher revs.\"\n\nSpeaking for Toyota Times, Sensitivity Performance Development Department Assistant Manager Yusuke Nakayama said the bank angle of 72 degrees was explicitly chosen to improve the soundtrack. He says the V-10 has the \"roar of an angel.\" Toyota uncovered old documents written during the LFA's development and found out why the engineering team ultimately opted for this configuration:\n\n\"Simulations that added two cylinders to a V-8 engine with a 90-degree bank angle could not produce the ideal sound due to uneven firing intervals. We've decided to develop an engine with a bank angle of 72 degrees.\"\n\nWhile these neat images show a naked LFA and its sweet-sounding V-10, the lengthy video focuses on the N\u00fcrburgring Edition. Of the 500-car production run, only 50 were made in the hotter specification. The retractable rear spoiler was replaced by a fixed wing, which was part of an aerodynamic package that also included a beefier front spoiler lip and canards.\n\nPhoto by: Yoshifumi Ogawa\n\nThese rare LFAs sat 0.4 inches (10 millimeters) lower to the ground on lighter mesh-like BBS wheels wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza RE070 tires. The track-focused version also had an extra 11 hp and slightly quicker gear shifts from the six-speed automated manual Aisin transmission.\n\nDespite being worshipped these days, the LFA was a commercial flop. Even though the short production run ended in 2012, Lexus sold three \u201cnew\u201d cars in 2019 and another two the year before. In 2023, there was still a never-titled LFA in Australia. The owner of a Toyota dealer had to buy it due to a regulation change that would\u2019ve made the supercar unregistrable.\n\nAlthough a follow-up has been ruled out, Lexus is developing an electric supercar with the \"LFA\u2019s secret sauce.\" It\u2019ll be a production version of the Electrified Sport concept and may get a simulated manual gearbox. Meanwhile, a more affordable LFR (name not confirmed) is being developed as possibly one of the last all-new V-8 cars ever. It\u2019s bound to be a road-going version of a new Toyota GT3 race car. The track machine will go racing in 2026, so the street-legal equivalent should come soon.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "I\u2019ve always loved the fourth-generation Toyota 4Runner. Maybe it\u2019s because that was the 4Runner of my teenage years but its simple, handsome design just hits home with me. Still, even I can admit that it\u2019s beginning to show its age. Thankfully, off-roader and 4Runner enthusiast Dylan Bue has a solution: graft a third-gen Toyota Tacoma face onto the 4Runner. And wouldn\u2019t you know, it looks stellar.\n\nThe Tacoma face-swap is one of many upgrades on Bue\u2019s 4Runner. It has coilovers and custom J-arm long-travel suspension he fabricated himself, a crazy-wide track, massive BF Goodrich tires, and a roll cage, among other mods. However, the Tacoma face is the most noticeable now as it makes the old 4Runner look new again.\n\nDylan Bue\n\nIt all flows surprisingly well, especially since these designs were penned years apart and were never meant to be mashed up. The lack of a front bumper surely helps that as there simply isn\u2019t as much to fit together. The bumperless front end also sports a winch right underneath the Toyota emblem, which looks kickass.\n\nWhy go through all the trouble of face-swapping a 4Runner? Bue tells us he loves the fourth-gen platform but never really liked the look of its front end. In his eyes, the third-gen Tacoma is Toyota\u2019s best modern design, so he combined them. Additionally, he wanted something different. He wanted his 4Runner to be unique in the sea of \u201ccookie-cutter\u201d off-road builds. Having a TacomaRunner is certainly unique, I\u2019d say.\n\nBue documented the face-swap process along with pretty much everything else on his Instagram (@bue_built). What started as a mostly stock 4Runner with right around 100,000 miles has turned into a wheeler that stuffs rubber way up into the fender wells. Impressively, he did all the work himself and as he\u2019ll tell you, he doesn\u2019t have any formal fab training.\n\nWith the massive differences in width, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want this mod on anything other than a dedicated off-roader. I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to drive it every day but maybe that\u2019s because I live in New Jersey. For a fun project that\u2019s dedicated to life off the pavement, it\u2019s an awesome look that makes his truck stand out on the trails. And since it\u2019s not a plug-and-play swap, it might be the only one you ever see.\n\nGot tips? Send \u2019em to tips@thedrive.com",

It\u2019s a future where our movement, home life and work life is expected to be more interconnected than ever before.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nPhase one of Toyota Woven City is complete in East Japan\n\nToyota-supported community will act as an incubator and experimentation center for new ideas\n\nFocused on mobility of people, products, information and energy\n\nExpected to grow to 2,000 residents\n\nA key component of that strategy is constructing a prototype community that will act as a living lab, developing mobility solutions for people, goods, information and energy. Located on the former Higashi-Fuji manufacturing site in the Shizuoka Prefecture of East Japan, the Toyota Woven City\u2019s first phase of construction has been completed. The former factory\u2019s production was moved to an area of Japan affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami as a way to support the damaged economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompanies and residents are expected to move in by fall 2025.\n\n\u201cThe unwavering themes of the Woven City are \u2018human-centered,\u2019 \u2018a living laboratory\u2019 and \u2018ever-evolving.\u2019 Together with the support of our project partners, we will take on the challenge of creating a future where people of diverse backgrounds are able to live happily,\u201d said Toyota President Akio Toyoda at the community\u2019s groundbreaking.\n\n\n\nJohn M. Vincent | U.S. News & World Report Toyota President Akio Toyoda presenting at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nThe Toyota Woven City was announced at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show, with construction starting in early 2021. But Woven by Toyota (WbyT, a Toyota subsidiary) isn\u2019t the first company to envision such a city. Walt Disney imagined such a place, which later evolved into today\u2019s EPCOT (Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow) theme park in Florida. The big difference, though, is that Toyota\u2019s prototype city will be a real community, with residents and companies looking to develop new technologies.\n\nDesigned as a place for Toyota Group companies and independent firms to create and test new ideas, the first phase includes \u201cco-creation\u201d and manufacturing spaces in environmentally advanced LEED for Communities-certified structures and a revamped Toyota plant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first group will include companies Toyota affiliates and outside companies as varied as Daikin Industries, Ltd., testing pollen-free spaces, and UCC Japan Co., Ltd. \u201cexploring the potential value of coffee through futuristic cafe experiences.\u201d The community will allow \u201cinventors\u201d to rapidly develop and test their products in a way that they can evaluate their use in day-to-day life. By creating a continuous loop of feedback and improvement, the development of products and technologies will be incubated and accelerated.\n\n\n\nToyota projects that will benefit from the community include the company\u2019s new Arene operating system, which will be used in future vehicles. The WbyT affiliate also announced an investment in Interstellar Technologies, which will see Toyota leveraging its manufacturing prowess to produce rockets. Toyoda said that there soon will be more than one automaker doing so, slyly referring to Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla and Space X.\n\nThose inventors will have access to the Woven Inventor\u2019s Garage, a co-creation service developed by Toyota to guide products through the product\u2019s journey through exploration, experimentation and evaluation. A component of the system is a \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the community that can be used for virtual testing in a life-like environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially, there will be about 100 residents \u2014 a mix of Toyota and WbyT employees \u2014 growing to 360 by the completion of phase one. Future phases will see the community grow to 175 acres and 2,000 residents, called Inventors or Weavers in the language of Woven City.\n\n\n\nJohn M. Vincent | U.S. News & World Report Toyota President Akio Toyoda presenting at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nThe structure of the community will include three types of streets, one for autonomous vehicles, one for pedestrians and one for people using personal mobility devices. Roadways for traditional delivery and service vehicles will run under the community, out of sight. It will act as a \u201ctest track\u201d for higher levels of autonomous vehicles, perhaps even including Joby electric aerial ridesharing, a flying car project Toyota has invested in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaming the community Woven by Toyota serves a couple of purposes. One is a homage to the roots of Toyota. Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota, first developed textile machines to replace the manual looms his mother toiled at. Building cars came later. The second is a visual representation of how various pathways are incorporated across the community.\n\nAdvertisement",

Throw on a few of the right mods, and you can turn one into a pretty quirky and interesting ride.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what Todd Shaw did. The build began with a junkyard 1991 Toyota Previa with the naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine. It\u2019s not the most interesting spec\u2014that title goes to the supercharged version\u2014but nonetheless, it put down a healthy 132 horsepower and could haul seven in style.\n\nTodd didn\u2019t just want a reliable Toyota minivan, though. He wanted a fun adventure vehicle for family road trips, so he set about building something just a little more interesting.\n\nThe first thing you spot on Todd\u2019s build is the dually rear end. I wondered if he\u2019d had dreams of towing or was aiming for lower ground pressure, but his answer was altogether simpler. \u201cMore tires, more cool!\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe crafted the conversion himself using 6-inch gas pipe to extend a set of steelies outwards. Not one to do half a job, he then balanced the rims on his lathe to ensure smooth running. The stock rims are bolted onto the steelies, which in turn mount to the vehicle\u2019s standard rear hubs\u2014wheel bearings be damned. He also added his own rear fender flares to cover the now-wider track.\n\nSo, are the dual rear wheels a big boost to road-holding or load-bearing? \u201cThey\u2019re mostly cosmetic,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cThe van is mid-engined with full-time four-wheel-drive [though], so the duals add traction in Iowa\u2019s snow and on Texas\u2019s beaches.\u201d\n\nTo those same ends, he gave the Previa a light safari treatment. It\u2019s rocking a two inch lift, along with the mandatory roof racks, winch, and massive light bar up front. The latter was another custom fab job, as was the ladder at the rear for roof access. Just in case he needs to warn off livestock or wake up a small town, he\u2019s also installed a nine-trumpet train horn that looks legit enough to deafen you.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs for the paint job, that\u2019s not stock either. This build started as a junker with faded maroon paint. Todd set about a DIY paint job at home with a stack of \u201crattle cans from Monkeynards.\u201d That\u2019s how it\u2019s done.\n\nThe final treat, though? It\u2019s the rear door. Rather than stick with the sliding door, he gave it a vertically-opening door instead. It\u2019s not something you could easily open in a tight parking space, but it is very cool. It relies on hinges at the top of the door frame and a pair of incredibly long gas struts.\n\nTodd\u2019s been using the vehicle for family roadtrips, taking it down to Texas for a recent Starship launch. The family camp in it regularly, so he\u2019s set it up with five seats out of the total seven for now. He notes that it runs great and that it\u2019s currently his daily driver.\n\nTodd credits the Previa\u2019s smooth running to his efforts on the lathe when building the dually rear wheels. \u201cWhen spinning on lathe you could see wobbles in the factory steel wheel and no wobble in the gas pipe welded to the rim,\u201d he says. \u201cIt must be spot on cause there\u2019s no way to balance it when mounting the tire.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, at the same time, Todd\u2019s ready to move on. He\u2019s advertised the vehicle on Facebook Marketplace in Iowa, where it\u2019s currently listed for $22,000. That\u2019s a lot of money for a 1991 Toyota Previa, with most examples currently selling in the four-figure range according to Classic.com.\n\nHowever, if you want a dope, lifted Previa with crazy doors and a dually rear-end setup, you\u2019re not going to find another one. Is it worth it? That\u2019s a call you\u2019re just going to have to make on your own.\n\nImage credits: Facebook Marketplace\n\nThanks to Chris Watnem for the tip!",

Photo by Yoshikazu Tsuno | Gamma-rapho | Getty Images\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Toyota Motor is exploring the development and production of orbital rockets, Chairman Akio Toyoda said Monday. The automaker, through its \"Woven by Toyota\" mobility company, is investing 7 billion yen ($44.4 million) into Interstellar Technologies Inc., a Japanese private spaceflight company developing launch vehicles for satellites. Toyoda, former CEO and scion of the automaker, said there shouldn't only be \"one car company\" \u2014 referring to Tesla , whose CEO Elon Musk also leads SpaceX \u2014 working on the development of such technologies. \"We are exploring rockets too, because the future of mobility shouldn't be limited to just earth or just one car company, for that matter,\" Toyoda said during a news conference for CES in Las Vegas.\n\nFounded in 2013, Interstellar Technologies has performed seven launches of its small suborbital MOMO rockets, which reached space for the first time in 2019. The startup has yet to deploy a satellite in orbit, with plans to develop the larger ZERO and DECA line of rockets for delivering spacecraft. Toyota said the company expects to leverage its experience with the mass production of vehicles for the production of rockets with Interstellar Technologies. In the Japanese launch market, Toyota is taking on Mitsubishi, whose subsidiary Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has developed and launched the H3 series of rockets for JAXA, the country's space agency. Mitsubishi's H3 rocket, which debuted several years behind schedule, was intended to be priced competitively with SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, which dominate the current global launch market.\n\nWoven City",

            "content": "Toyota, one of the world\u2019s largest car manufacturers, has embarked on a project to transform its digital employee experience (DEX).\n\nIn the US, Toyota has ambitions to eliminate its traditional IT service desk this year, and if it\u2019s unable to hit that target, it aims to at least reduce IT helpdesk calls by 80%. Part of the strategy to get there is the use of automation, predictive analytics and virtual assistants. \u201cThe traditional service desk is always reactive,\u201d says Zakir Mohammed, manager of artificial intelligence and automation at Toyota.\n\nLooking at the experience employees can go through on a traditional IT helpdesk, he says it can take days, or even weeks, for support personnel to respond and fix an IT problem. For instance, if someone needed a new piece of software, they would need to raise a helpdesk ticket. In Mohammed\u2019s experience, IT support would contact the individual who raised the ticket two to three days later, then block out a slot of 30 minutes or an hour to install the application.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of reactiveness happening,\u201d he says. \u201cAt some point, our employees gave up opening tickets and started suffering in silence. We decided the traditional way of running a helpdesk was not sustainable. We needed to have a proactive approach.\u201d\n\nThe company is a Gartner client, and Gartner\u2019s digital employee experience market research recommends tools that conform to industry standards. Gartner defines DEX management tools as software that measures and continuously improves the performance of employee sentiment towards company-provided technology.\n\nThe tools tend to offer near-real-time processing of aggregated data from endpoints, applications, employee sentiment and actionable insights, which, according to Gartner, can power self-healing automation and enhance employee interactions with self-service portals and chatbots. Gartner says DEX tools also help IT support, asset management, procurement and other teams whose work depends on reliable information.\n\n\u201cSome of the tools and technology we evaluated looked very promising,\u201d says Mohammed. \u201cBut the tool we currently use is Nexthink, which aligns with our requirements.\u201d\n\nInstead of waiting for IT issues to be manually triaged, Toyota\u2019s 100,000 staff members now benefit from the IT department using Nexthink\u2019s DEX technology to proactively detect, diagnose and remedy IT issues across endpoints.",

She traded in her Toyota Camry and purchased the Tesla on the advice of other Tesla owners and from the Toyota dealer.\n\nImagine the thrill of anticipating a Tesla Model 3, fueled by the glowing reviews of its owners. The promise of significant fuel savings and the allure of the 'best car they've ever owned' echo in your mind.\n\nYou find a Tesla Model 3, which you think is beautiful, at the Toyota dealer where you purchased your Camry. You like your Camry, but buying a Tesla is the only thing you can think about.\n\nThe Toyota dealer, sensing the slow sales of electric vehicles, is eager to offload the Tesla Model 3. They see an opportunity to profit from your desirable Toyota Camry, and the deal seems too good to pass up.\n\nYou make what appears to be a great deal, and the dealer takes your Camry, which is in good shape, in on trade. You drive away in your new shiny Tesla Model 3, and life couldn't be better. And then you realize you made a big mistake.\n\nHere is Mariah's sad story.\n\nMariah says,\" So, yeah. I just posted a video,\" she says as she begins to cry, \"oh, my gosh, I can't even speak right now,\" she says, crying. \"Anyway, I know I just told everyone how good this car is. I said, I love, I love the Tesla.\"\n\n\"But I hate this Tesla. I want my Camry back. I miss my Camry. I don't even have anywhere to put my freaking car phone in this car.\"\n\n\"This car sucks. If you are talking about how great your Tesla is, I love my Tesla, you are a liar. This car sucks, it sucks.\"\n\nThe Toyota dealer likely wanted to get the slow-selling Tesla Model 3 off its lot and told Mariah how much she would save on gas and what a great deal she was getting.\n\nMariah says, \"But honestly, I think Toyota screwed me over. Because I don't drive 40 miles to my job, I drive 20 miles. Tell me how I wasted 40 freaking miles. How often I have to charge it is the same as putting gas in my Camry.\"\n\nMariah's plea for someone to buy her Tesla is laced with desperation. She's in a situation she never expected, and the urgency in her voice is noticable.\n\n\"So, does anyone want to buy a Tesla? Please, please buy this car from me.\"\n\nMariah was likely experiencing what's known as 'range anxiety.' This is when an EV owner becomes worried about running out of battery power before reaching their destination. She looked at the EV's gauge and saw the miles dropping fast as she drove to and from work.\n\n\"Who convinced me that buying a Tesla is better than a Camry? Oh, because you are wrong. I was gaslighting myself and making myself believe it was the best car ever because I really wanted it. Because it's so pretty.\"\n\n\"But it's so bad. Like, literally, I hate this car. But yeah, who really genuinely likes their Tesla? Does anyone want to buy a Tesla? Please, please buy this car from me,\" she pleads.\n\nTwo days later, Mariah still doesn't like her new Tesla.\n\nShe says, \"Like please, anyone, does anyone want to buy my freaking Tesla? I've had this car for two days and I hate this car. I'm going back to where I got it today because I don't know, I don't know about my battery.\"\n\n\"My miles (battery life) go so fast. I live 20 miles from work, so how do I use 40 miles from my battery? How did it take 40 miles from my battery? I don't understand what's going on.\"\n\n\"If you are posting that you like Teslas, are you lying? Because what is going on?\"\n\nMariah dislikes the Tesla Model 3 so much that she returns to the dealer to get her Toyota Camry back.\n\n\"I'm going back to where I got it today. I went to see what I could do about it. Because I want my old car back, I want my freaking Camry back. I don't know if there is anything I can do about it.\"\n\n\"I went to talk to the used car manager because I bought it used. But the used car manager is off today. Hopefully, I can get my old car back.\"\n\nUpdate after four days.\n\nMariah is back at the Toyota dealer for the fourth day in a row.\n\nShe says, \"I'm back at the Toyota dealer, and I'm trying to get my old car back, and I'm losing so much, so much money, on what I just did, but I'm willing to do it because I feel they lied to me about the Tesla.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to get my old Camry back, but they said they need to do an inspection on it, and I'm not waiting for that. I'll probably have to get a new car now.\"\n\nThe Toyota dealer doesn't want to sell Mariah her old Camry because they likely gave her very little for her car to make the deal for the Tesla. So they tell her it's already in the shop for an \"inspection.\" They can make thousands selling it to someone else after reconditioning the Camry.\n\nThey also see that she'll likely buy a new 2025 Camry with a little persuasion and they can make even more on the deal.\n\nMariah signs the paperwork for a new Camry and gets the deal done.\n\nMariah says, \"Ok, this is my new car, a 2025 Toyota Camry SE. This car is so much better than the Tesla. Don't ever buy a Tesla in your life.\"\n\nBack home, she says, \"Obviously, I was a little screwed up with money because it just happens. It happened. It's a life lesson we live and learn. Now I have a Camry again. It's not the same Camry I had before. It doesn't have a sunroof like my old Camry, but I love it.\"\n\n\"I needed to get out of the Tesla immediately, and I'm so happy about my new Camry. That Tesla was nothing but stress and anxiety.\"\n\nConclusion.\n\nThe comments to Mariah were brutal, and it's easy to say that she made a bad decision by trading in her Camry and buying the Tesla Model 3. What can buyers learn from Mariah's experience?\n\nIt reveals that range anxiety is real. A new owner can be left with questions unless someone explains how an electric vehicle operates. She wasn't told that charging a Tesla's battery at a public station can be expensive.\n\nAlso, we don't know how many miles were on the Tesla Model 3, but it could have had high mileage, and the battery was close to being replaced. That's why the battery drained so quickly.\n\nThe Toyota dealer saw Mariah coming and the opportunity to unload the high-mileage Tesla and, at the same time, get a Toyota Camry they could make a lot of money on\u2014a \"double score,\" as it's called in the car selling business.\n\nThey then sold Mariah a new Camry and made even more from her mistake. She was taken to the cleaners.\n\nWhat should Mariah done differently?\n\nShe should have taken an experienced person like a friend, family member, or an auto broker who can give her sound advice about buying a used Tesla. They could have informed her to walk away because it was not a good deal.\n\nEdmunds give this advice:\n\n\"The vast majority of car dealers have no written policies that allow you to rescind the purchase agreement you've signed. This means your only recourse is to plead your case. You can say that you have discovered you don't like the car or that it will stretch your budget and put you in dire financial straits.\"\n\n\"If you have buyer's remorse, you can call the salesperson first as a courtesy, but be prepared to contact someone higher up in dealership management, such as the sales manager, general manager or owner. It's solely at the dealer's discretion whether to undo the purchase. Make your call on a business day as opposed to a weekend.\"\n\nWhat do you think Mariah should have done?

The adoption of a new-generation platform has undoubtedly given the legendary Japanese SUV a new lease of life.\n\nThe dimensions of this Toyota are impressive: 4.92 metres long, 1.92 metres wide and 1.86 metres high, with a wheelbase of 2.85 metres. As you might have guessed, the cabin has room for seven occupants and much more advanced equipment.\n\nMechanically, it is powered by a 2.8-litre diesel engine with 204 PS and 500 Nm of maximum torque. It is paired with an eight-speed automatic gearbox and all-wheel drive system. Light hybridisation is coming soon, a system already offered in several markets.\n\nToyota Land Cruiser - its safety on test\n\nWith such an ambitious approach, the level of safety must be up to standard. But don't wait for Euro NCAP as its Australian counterpart (ANCAP) has carried out a very thorough test.\n\nIn the asymmetric frontal impact, the cabin proves stable, scoring marginal for the driver's torso and adequate for the legs. When confronted with the full-width test, chest protection in both rows is marginal and adequate for the neck.\n\nAll other critical areas of the body achieve the best rating, just as in the case of a side impact. The oblique test against a pole reflects adequate torso safety, and the presence of a central airbag prevents impact between the front occupants.\n\nANCAP scores 85% for adult protection, 89% for children, 84% for pedestrians and 82% for driving assistants. With these results, the new Toyota Land Cruiser 2025 (with the name Prado in some countries) earns an overall score of 5 out of 5 stars.\n\nFinally, if you are interested in buying this model, you should keep in mind the prices for the UK market have yet to be announced. However, as a reference, the Toyota Land Cruiser 2.8D 250 in Spain starts at \u20ac85,450 (approx. \u00a371,000) in base VX trim, and rises to \u20ac95,000 (\u00a379,000) for the VX-L trim.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

From there, they will resume racing tomorrow morning, returning to the main bivouac at Bisha. The remaining distance varies based on their progress today, but the leading crews should have roughly 350km to the finish.\n\nThe pick of the TOYOTA GAZOO Racing bunch was Henk Lategan and co-driver Brett Cummings (#211). The South Africans brought their GR Hilux EVO to Bivouac E, together with teammates Guy Botterill, Giniel de Villiers, Lucas Moraes, Seth Quintero and Saood Variawa. While the stage will only finish when the crews reach Bisha tomorrow, the current standings show Lategan/Cummings in 4th place on the stage, just 11min 13sec adrift of the lead. Looking at the virtual overall standings, the current South African Rally-Raid Champions are in 3rd place, just 2min 12sec behind the lead.\n\nGuy Botterill and Dennis Murphy (#205), both from South Africa, went 6th-fastest by the time the stage was halted for the day. The man from Durban was 14min 04sec behind the leaders at the end of the day, and finds himself in 5th place in the virtual general ranking at this point.\n\nGiniel de Villiers and Dirk von Zitzewitz (#206), who won the Dakar Rally together in 2009, started Stage 2 as the 17th car on the road, following a disappointing opening stage, where an electronic glitch caused them to lose power in their car. Despite this, the experienced duo bounced back during the first part of Stage 2, setting the 9th-best time, just 20min 32sec behind the lead. This puts them in 9th place in the virtual general rankings, just over 17min adrift of the lead.\n\nBrazil's Lucas Moraes and Spanish co-driver, Armand Monleon, driving the #203 GR Hilux EVO, started the day as the 7th car into the stage. This initially put them on a solid footing, and they set about the tricky stage at a highly competitive pace. Unfortunately, the crew got stuck during a dune crossing, and lost significant time recovering their stricken car. As a result, they dropped from 7th place overall to 16th on the stage, and are in 11th place in the virtual overall standings.\n\nTGR's Seth Quintero won Stage 1 of the event, which meant the young Californian driver and his German co-driver, Dennis Zenz, had to open the stage. This was a daunting task, given that the motorbikes and cars had separate routes on Stage 2, leaving the #204 GR Hilux EVO crew with no tracks to follow. Quintero steadily lost ground to his fellow competitors, but as with Moraes, his situation was exacerbated when he beached the car mid-stage, losing more time while extricating the Hilux. Quintero/Zenz posted the 24th-fastest time by 5pm today, 47min 40sec adrift of the lead. Their virtual overall position is 19th, and they trail the leaders by 34min 27sec.\n\nTGR's second crew on the road this morning was Saood Variawa and Francois Cazalet, who finished the previous stage in third place. The pair started the morning at a brisk pace, but a broken right-rear damper early on cost them the best part of thirty minutes. The crew was able to repair the car using a spare damper, but the total damage by the end of the day came to 1hr 15min 37sec, putting them in 26th place on the first part of the stage. They are in 25th place in the virtual overall rankings, 1hr 4min 12sec from the leading car.\n\nAs things stood by 5pm today, it was the privately-entered Toyota Hilux of Saudi Arabia's Yazeed Al Rajhi, who is partnered with German co-driver Timo Gottschalk, who topped both the stage and virtual overall standings. The current virtual overall standings show six Toyota Hilux in the Top 10, including three TGR works crews.\n\nThe 48h Chrono resumes tomorrow at sunrise, at which point the competitors will start the trek back towards Bisha for much-needed rest and repairs to their cars. Stage 3 will be another tough one, featuring 495km of special stage and 352km of liaisons, taking the rally from Bisha to Al Henakiyah in Western Saudi Arabia. This will be followed by the Marathon Stage to Alula, before the competitors take on Stage 5, between Alula and the Rest Day at Hail.\n\nDakar Rally 2025 - Stage 2A Results as at Bivouac 'E'\n\nTimings were correct at the time of publication; full stage results can be found at www.dakar.com\n\n1 #201 Y.

            "content": "A lot is going in the midsize pickup truck segment in 2024. The segment leading Toyota Tacoma had a difficult generation changeover. As Toyota\u2019s factories were switching to building the 4th-generation Tacomas, the sales slumped in a big way. The Toyota Tacoma rebounded in Q4 2024, but Tacoma is still down -17.9% for the year. GM\u2019s Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon grew sales in a huge way compared to 2023. GM had a similar issues with the generational switchover in 2023. GM sold over 136,000 midsize pickup trucks in 2024, but it is still far away from 192,000 Tacomas in 2024.\n\nNissan Frontier and Ford Ranger also had a successful year. Both can grow their sales in 2025 if they can actually build more pickups. Honda Ridgeline and Jeep Gladiator both declined. The Jeep pickup truck took the greatest hit in sales. We will have to wait and see if the Gladiator 4xe plug-in hybrid will ever reach the market.\n\nU.S. Midsize Pickup Truck Sales Report (Q4 2024 & 2024)\n\nModel Q4 2024 Q4 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Toyota Tacoma 66,008 55,087 19.8% 192,813 234,768 -17.9% \u2013 GM (COMBINED)* 38,561* 15,503* 48.7% 136,227 93,539 45.6% ->Chevy Colorado ->27,302 ->12,396 120.2% ->98,012 71,081 37.9% Nissan Frontier 13,898 12,240 13.5% 68,155 58,135 17.2% Ford Ranger 15,526 831 1,768.4% 46,205 32,334 42.9% Honda Ridgeline 12,387 12,433 -0.4% 45,421 52,001 -12.7% Jeep Gladiator 9,453 13,660 -31% 42,123 55,188 -24% -> GMC Canyon ->11,259 ->3,107 262.4% ->38,215 22,458 70.2% \u2014\u2014\u2013 \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014 Totals: 155,833 97,321 60.1% 530,944 525,965 0.95%\n\nOverall, the midsize pickup segment is up a mind-boggling 60.1%. This is a great sign that shows huge interest in these smaller more affordable garage-able pickup trucks. If this continues, it could cut into the full-size pickup truck sales in 2025.\n\nCompact Pickup Trucks\n\nThe Q4 2024 compact pickup sales results are mixed. The 2025 Maverick and the 2025 Santa Cruz are both refreshed with new exterior style, interior, new tech, and some powertrain changes. The new Santa Cruz powertrain remains unchanged, but the new 2025 Ford Maverick hybrid has a new upgraded CVT that allows for AWD and a higher tow rating of up to 4,000 lbs. This 2025 change may have something to do with a sales decline for the Maverick in Q4 of 2024.\n\nI initially predicted Ford could sell around 145,000 Maverick compact pickups in 2024, but the Q4 sales decline caused it to come in short. Still, Ford sold over 131,000 Mavericks, which almost three time more than they sold Ranger pickup trucks.\n\nQ4 2024 Q4 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Ford Maverick 22,146 27,628 -19.8% 131,142 94,058 39.4% Hyundai Santa Cruz 6,862 7,592 -10% 32,033 36,675 -13%\n\nTFLtruck purchased a 2025 Ford Maverick hybrid AWD for our long term test.

            "content": "If nothing else, the Toyota-powered \"Ferrari\" will be far cheaper to run and significantly more reliable than its inspiration\n\nA Ferrari replica built on Toyota underpinnings has appeared for sale in Thailand.\n\nThe car is based on a sixth-gen Toyota Celica powered by a 2.2-liter engine.\n\nThe custom bodywork draws inspiration from the Ferrari F12 and the Lykan HyperSport.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever dreamed of owning a Ferrari V12 grand tourer but found your wallet cruelly reminding you that you shop in the \u201cinstant noodles and off-brand cereal\u201d aisle, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s hope yet. For roughly the cost of a semester of college, you can snag this wildly modified Toyota Celica from Thailand, a car that tries really hard (perhaps too hard) to live out its Ferrari fantasy.\n\nMore: Vietnamese Builders Create Incredible La Ferrari Replica With Toyota Parts From Scratch\n\nAs some of you might be able to tell from the greenhouse, the pictured build started life as a sixth-gen Toyota Celica, sold between 1993 and 1999. While a transformation to a Ferrari 550 Maranello would make for a period-correct replica, the local body shop went for a more recent model.\n\nFerrari F12 Berlinetta\u2026 Sort Of\n\nThe muse for this transformation was the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta, a grand tourer that debuted back in 2012. The front end is easily the most convincing part of the replica, featuring custom headlights, bulging fenders, and a vented hood that attempt to capture some of the F12\u2019s essence. However, the bumper intakes could use a bit more refinement to better mimic the original\u2019s signature \u201cevil grin.\u201d And if we had a say, we\u2019d definitely move the Ferrari emblem much lower on the nose, as it\u2019s currently sitting way too high to look natural.\n\nThe side profile is where things start to unravel. The gracefully sculpted lines of the F12 Berlinetta proved a tall order to replicate, even with the help of strategically placed black stickers. Unfortunately, the stickers only serve to highlight what\u2019s missing. The aftermarket wheels, wrapped in stretched tires, are practically begging for spacers, while the BMW M-style mirrors are laughably undersized for the job looking more out of place than crocs at a black-tie event.\n\nThe rear end abandons the Ferrari script altogether, opting instead for what can only be described as a low-budget homage to the Lykan HyperSport. Oversized taillights framed by thick black trim look awkward, the fixed rear wing feels tacked on, and the fake center tailpipes with a poorly executed diffuser only add to the confusion.\n\nRed, Red Everywhere\n\nStep inside, and you\u2019re hit with an overwhelming flood of red. Leather-wrapped seats, red plastic accents on the dashboard, matching door cards, and a three-spoke steering wheel that sacrifices the airbag for \u201csportiness\u201d create a monochromatic sea that feels like a Fast and Furious fan meet.\n\nDespite the wild visual modifications, the listing makes no mention of any performance upgrades. A single photo of the engine bay suggests that this Celica features the naturally-aspirated 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine, which was rated at 135 hp (101 kW / 137 PS) back in the \u201990s. It\u2019s paired with a five-speed manual gearbox, sending power to the front wheels.\n\nThis Celica-turned-Faux-rari i was listed on a Facebook group called Toyota Celica Club Thailand. The car has an asking price of 235,000 baht ($6,800), making it significantly cheaper than any used Ferrari that comes in one piece. Still, it doesn\u2019t take a trained eye to spot that this car isn\u2019t fooling anyone. And frankly, we\u2019ve come across far more convincing replicas built on a budget.",

Finally, it seems to be churning out Zs at a decent clip, and for the first time in its history, Nissan's new sports car outsold its closest rival, the Toyota Supra. Nissan managed 3,164 U.S. Z sales in 2024, compared to 2,615 Supra sales.\n\nIt's just 549 more cars, but that's something considering that in 2023, the Supra outsold the Z by almost 1,000 cars. And that in the new Z's first two years on sale, Nissan didn't even manage to sell 300 in the US.\n\nYear Toyota Supra Nissan Z 2021 6,830 36 2022 4,952 263 2023 2,652 1,771 2024 2,615 3,164\n\nDespite the fact that the Z isn't quite new, it is a newer model than the Supra, which debuted back in 2019 and went on sale later that year. That's reflected in the fact that Supra sales have decreased significantly since 2021. The Z also has a much lower base price, $44,110 to the Supra's $57,385. Though, Toyota did cancel the four-cylinder base Supra for 2025, effectively bumping up the cost. Even still, the Supra 2.0 base model started at $47,545 when it was on sale, making the Z something of a bargain.\n\nNissan also made a big enhancement to the Z lineup in late 2023, too, with the introduction of the 420-horsepower Nismo model. Meanwhile, Toyota added a manual transmission to the Supra around the same time, and did a 45th Anniversary special-edition model last year, but has offered no other significant mechanical upgrades.\n\nThings look good for the Z, but not if you compare it to the other major sports coupe on the market. Ford sold 44,003 examples of the Mustang here last year, but with a $34,210 base, the pony car is a lot cheaper. Rounding out the broadly affordable rear-drive sports car segment, the Toyota GR86 managed 11,426 sales and its platform-mate Subaru BRZ added 3,345 to the total. At the time of writing, we're still waiting on Mazda Miata sales for 2024.\n\nAnecdotally, none of the Motor1 staff have seen many Zs in public, but perhaps that will change as sales tick up.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Now, the automaker wants to renew its lineup, and one report says an all-new Previa that you can plug in is in the cards for launch in the next couple of years.\n\nForbes, citing local sources from Japan, says Toyota is gearing up to launch the all-new Previa in 2026 with both plug-in hybrid and pure electric powertrains. It reportedly won\u2019t be underpinned by the e-TNGA EV-specific platform used in the bZ4X and Lexus RZ, with Toyota opting for the TNGA-K platform shared with models like the Crown and the Sienna, which is Toyota\u2019s only minivan on sale in the United States.\n\nThe Sienna is also the Previa\u2019s more conventional replacement, and it will probably live on alongside the new Previa, as a non-plug-in hybrid alternative with a more traditional design.\n\nAccording to Forbes\u2019 unnamed insider source, Toyota has chosen the TNGA-K platform to allow for both plug-in hybrid and pure electric powertrains. Had it used e-TNGA to create the new Previa, it would have been limited to offering only a BEV variant in a market where plug-in hybrids are steadily growing in popularity.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nThe plug-in hybrid Previa could borrow the Prius Prime\u2019s powertrain, which combines two electric motors with a 2-liter engine for a total of 220 horsepower. The Prius Prime has a 13.6-kilowatt-hour battery pack, giving it a claimed WLTP range of 33 miles. The larger and heavier Previa PHEV will go less on one charge, so Toyota may choose to equip it with a larger pack to boost its electric range.\n\nThe 18.1 kWh pack that powers the RAV4 Prime seems a much better fit for a seven-seater minivan. It gives the RAV4 PHEV an EPA range of 42 miles, so it should take the more aerodynamic Previa even further.\n\nToyota doesn\u2019t currently make any EVs on TNGA-K. For the pure electric variant of the Previa, Toyota could adapt the powertrain out of its bZ4X, which has a 201 horsepower single-motor front-wheel-drive configuration in base form and adds a second motor in the rear to for 215 hp, all-wheel drive and a lot more torque.\n\nThe bZ4X has a 71.4 kWh battery with a usable capacity of around 64 kWh, giving it an EPA range of 252 miles in single-motor guise. The larger and heavier Previa would probably struggle to get anything over 200 miles on one charge, so the BEV variant will likely feature a bigger battery pack than the bZ4X.\n\nThe source also notes that Toyota considered a fuel-cell version too, but that was shelved since this type of powertrain is proving even less popular than before when it still struggled to find buyers. Toyota\u2019s FCV sales took a nosedive in 2024, falling by nearly 70% in the first eleven months of last year compared to 2023.\n\nToyota\u2019s EVs haven\u2019t been among the best on the market, but a practical, battery-powered people carrier might change that, especially if it has a bold design. It will likely be designed to remind of the 1990s original, whose unusual rounded design may have polarized opinions when it was new, but today it might serve as the basis for a cool retro-futuristic design, something like the transformation of the classic LeCar into today\u2019s sharp Renault 5 electric hatch.\n\nToyota created the original Previa as a global vehicle, which will likely remain the case with the new model. Even though it was discontinued in the U.S. in 1997, the Previa continued to be sold in other markets. It received a second generation in 2000, which lost some of the original\u2019s roundness and its mid-engined layout, but it remained a boldly-styled minivan. The third-generation model arrived in 2006 and it remained in production until 2019.\n\nWhat they all had in common was their very slanted nose and aerodynamic profile, with the most significant difference to the second and third generations being their more upright rear. Toyota will likely integrate this same desire for aerodynamic efficiency into the new model\u2019s design, making a lot of sense in an age when streamliners seem to be returning.\n\nWe tried to picture what a 2026 Toyota Previa might look like by using Midjourney AI, and you can see the resulting image at the top of this article.\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "TOYOTA GAZOO Racing started Dakar 2025 with a solid performance on the opening stage of the race. Despite offering a stern test over 413 km of sand and rocks, all six GR Hilux EVOs reached the finish in the town of Bisha without any serious issues. Seth Quintero (USA) and co-driver Dennis Zenz (DEU) were the pick of the bunch, setting the benchmark time of 4hr 35min 08sec, 45sec ahead of the second-placed crew.\n\nThe Californian driver clearly decided not to take part in any strategies for the upcoming 48h Chrono stage, opting instead for pure pace. The TGR crew initially lost time when they stopped to assist a fellow competitor who had crashed mid-stage, but the organisers adjusted their stage time accordingly, and Quintero/Zenz were crowned as Stage 1 winners.\n\nQuintero/Zenz (#204) reported a clean stage, as did their young teammates, Saood Variawa and Francois Cazalet. The 19 year-old driver is taking part in his second Dakar Rally, and recorded a solid third place on the opening stage. Variawa/Cazalet trailed the leaders by just 1min 48sec, putting two TGR cars on the stage podium in the process.\n\nLucas Moreas and Armand Monleon, in the #203 GR Hilux EVO, finished in 8th place, after managing their pace towards the end of the stage in a strategic move, aimed at securing a good road position for the upcoming stage. The Brazilian driver showed excellent pace throughout the stage, but opted for a more cautious approach given the 48h Chrono which features as Stage 2 of this year's Dakar Rally.\n\nSouth Africa's Henk Lategan and Brett Cummings (#211) ran into the dust of slower competitors ahead of them, hampering their progress in the stage. This cost them significant time, and the situation was exacerbated by the failure of their navigation equipment, some 120km before the end of the stage. Even so, the TGR crew posted the 10th-fastest time, 4min 12sec behind Quintero, putting four TGR cars in the Stage Top 10.\n\nA similar fate befell teammates Guy Botterill and Dennis Murphy (#205). The South African crew started lower down the order than their teammates, and quickly caught up with the cars ahead of them. The thick dust held them back, and cost the pair significant time. They finished 7min 16sec behind the leaders, in 15th place. Despite this, they are well-positioned for Stage 2, and remain upbeat about their prospects.\n\nThe final TGR crew of Giniel de Villiers and Dirk von Zitzewitz (#206) lost time when the Engine Control Unit (ECU) on their car suffered a glitch that put the car into 'limp mode'. In this self-protection mode, they lost nearly half the engine power, and lost 10min 26sec in the process. The problem cleared itself towards the end of the stage, which allowed the veteran crew to finish in 19th place, still well within reach of the leaders.\n\nNext up is the 48h Chrono Stage, which serves as Stage 2 of the rally. This special stage is run over two days, with the crews starting near the bivouac in Bisha. The total timed section for this stage is 957km, and includes sand, rocks and some of the first dunes of this year's rally. To add intrigue to the longest stage of the event, the crews will start the stage as normal, but will have to stay over at the nearest of seven mini bivouacs when the clock reaches 4pm. They will then resume racing at sunrise the next morning, and complete the stage taking them back to Bisha.\n\nThe 48h Chrono caused some upsets during its inaugural use during the 2024 Dakar Rally, but this year's Chrono comes much earlier in the race, is run over more varied terrain than last year, and features nearly twice the distance. As such, it may prove pivotal in the outcome of the race, and a clean run through this imaginative test is crucial, especially so early in the rally.\n\nThe Dakar Rally will head from Bisha to Al Henakiyah for Stage 3, before the crews take on the Marathon Stage to Alula in Stage 4. Stage 5 will bring them to the northern town of Hail, for a much-needed break, before taking on the second week of the rally.\n\nQUOTES:\n\nSeth Quintero:\n\n\"It was a good first one. We drove at about 70% in the first 100 kilometers or so and then started picking people off. Passed a lot of guys. Got right behind Guy after passing a few more guys and then Laia [Sanz] had a big crash in front of us. A really big one. We stopped and pulled her out and stayed with her for a while. She was okay, but we had a weird feeling, seeing all of this unfold. So, that kind of shook me up a little bit. And then about 110 kilometers to go we lost the ERTF and road book and everything. Dennis did a great job trying to give me hand signals. But yeah, it's kind of just a shake up on the first day for sure.\"\n\nSaood Variawa:\n\n\"I mean we pushed, we had a bit of a different plan to the others. We just wanted to sort of build a gap if we could. I know some of the guys were going to back off for tomorrow. But we'll gain experience tomorrow also, even if we are at the head of the field.\"\n\nLucas Moraes:\n\n\"Yeah, wow, what a strategy, thanks to the team. Perfect strategy, it gave me goosebumps. Because we knew we were going quite well and we made a strategy to say, hey, if you pass like three, four cars, just stop in the end. So, we did that, we stopped for five minutes and hoped to be not leading. I think we finished fourth or fifth. So yeah, the strategy went perfect. I think we are right there with Carlos [Sainz]. So, great start, thanks to the whole team for coming up with this plan. And yeah, we're ready to go.\"\n\nHenk Lategan:\n\n\"It was almost like they made it out to be an easier stage last night. They were like: no it's gonna be really fast, really flowing... And then when we started, this system of the slow guys being in front made a mess. We caught the guys really quickly and they were quite slow and then our navigation system stopped working. We couldn't communicate with the car in front that we're behind them so you really had to just push through the dust and then try and get in front, so it was a bit of a mess. It's taking risk without even going quick if you're in the dust, so you don't really want to be in there.\"\n\nGuy Botterill:\n\n\"That was a really tough stage. We started quite far down in the field and had a huge amount of dust. The dust was unbelievable and then about halfway through our tracking device stopped working so we got a little bit lost, and then when the tracking device stops working the buzzer stops working too. We caught up to a bunch of cars and we just couldn't get any closer.\"\n\nGiniel de Villiers:\n\n\"Yeah, we had some issues in the beginning after we pulled off about 3 km in the stage. The car went into limp mode, so we had no power basically for 120 km. Then, all of a sudden it came right after we stopped a couple of times to reset the ECU. I don't know, we'll have to check what happened. But yeah, then obviously quite a few cars passed us, and we were in the dust the whole day, so it was very, very difficult with the dust.\"\n\nDAKAR RALLY 2025 - STAGE 1 RESULTS\n\n1 #204\u200b S.

The Ram trucks sales went down significantly (by -16.1%), and the Nissan Titan production was discontinued this year. Here are all the details. Let\u2019s dig in!\n\nThere is a big controversy about the following statement. Which pickup truck is the best selling in the country? Ford will say that the F-Series continues to be the best selling truck and vehicle in the country. GM will tell you that Chevrolet and GMC pickup truck combined are the best selling. Take a look at the table below.\n\nWhile the F-Series is indeed the best-selling name plate, GM sells more pickup trucks than any other company. When you combine the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra sales, GM sold 874,679 pickups last year. Ford sold 765,649 F-Series in 2024. Ford F-Series made huge gains in Q4 2024, growing by 21.1%.

We do not know exactly how many EV pickup trucks Tesla, Rivian, or GMC Hummer sold. They either report these numbers at a later date or combine their numbers with other vehicles in their lineup.\n\nSince General Motors breaks our their numbers by pickup truck classification, we can take a closer look below. Ford and Ram do not separate their full-size and heavy-duty truck sales numbers.\n\nGMC Sierra pickup trucks are growing across the board: light duty, heavy duty, and electric. The Silverado 1500 is struggling (selling less than last year), while Silverado HD is growing by 7%.\n\nGeneral Motors Full-size/HD Pickup Truck Sales: Q4 2024\n\nModel Q4 2024 Q4 2023 Change (%) Chevy Silverado 1500 88,835 89,398 -0.6% Chevy Silverado HD 54,078 50,518 7.0% Chevy Silverado EV 2,176 443 391.2% ===== GMC Sierra 1500 60,899 51,541 18.2% GMC Sierra HD 33,036 27,969 18.1% GMC Sierra EV 1,401 0 NEW\n\nHere is one of our recent real-world test video.",

            "content": "Toyota introduced the manual-transmission GR Supra partway through 2023, finally putting a clutch pedal in its flagship sports car. It proved relatively popular, accounting for 43% of Supras sold in the US in 2023. For 2024, the manual take rate went up by quite a bit\u2014Toyota tells us 65% of Supras sold here in 2024 were manuals.\n\nOf course, with 2,615 Supras sold in the US total in 2024, it only amounts to 1,700 cars. Not that much in the greater scheme of things, given that Toyota sold 6,391 cars per day in the US last year. Still, it's an increase over 2023, with 1,140 manuals of the 2,652 Supras total.\n\nThe model mix for the Supra also changed for 2024, with the four-cylinder, automatic-only base model ending production partway through the year. Perhaps if the four-cylinder had been on sale a bit longer, the overall manual take rate for all Supra models would've been lower. It'll be interesting to see how things pan out next year.\n\nMore popular than the manual Supra was the manual GR86. Toyota tells us 53% of the 11,426 of GR86s sold were stick-shifts, putting the number at 6,056. The manual Tacoma did decently well, too. Despite only accounting for 2% of sales, or 3,856 units out of 192,813 Tacomas sold.\n\nToyota announced a \"Final Edition\" Supra for Japan and Europe last year, with more power, fancier suspension, and a six-speed manual as the only available transmission. We know that the Supra's mechanical twin, the BMW Z4, is ending production outright, but Toyota hasn't announced what's next for the Supra in America. Hopefully those hints about a Mk6 Supra portend a real car coming soon.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "When did existence stop being enough? If you\u2019re a car shopper who\u2019s willing to break the bank, you\u2019re currently spoiled for choice if you want a soft-roady crossover that looks like an off-roady SUV, an off-roady SUV that drives like a soft-roady crossover, a mainstream car with luxury aspirations, a luxury car with sporting aspirations, a performance car disguised as a luxury car, or a luxury car disguised as a pickup truck. However, what if you just want a car that\u2019s good at being a car?\n\nSomething that\u2019s not too big but not too small, not wildly expensive but not a penalty box either. Something that offers all-wheel-drive for dreary winter days when the snow plough\u2019s blocked your driveway with a few inches of hard-pack but isn\u2019t trying to be an SUV [Ed note: I\u2019m just gonna keep it Canadian and not change plough to plow, it\u2019s fun \u2013 Pete]. Oh, and make it a hybrid while we\u2019re at it, because you don\u2019t want to buy another new car until 2040 and fuel savings would be appreciated. The Toyota Corolla Hybrid AWD seems laser-targeted towards those who just want a car, and it makes a rather good argument against needing anything more.\n\n[Full disclosure: Toyota Canada let me borrow this Corolla Hybrid AWD for a week so long as I kept the shiny side up, returned it with a full tank of fuel and reviewed it.]\n\nThe Basics\n\nPrice: $26,360 base including freight, $30,810 loaded ($30,350 Canadian base, $38,115 Canadian as-tested)\n\nEngine: 1.8-liter 16-valve twin-cam inline-four.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBattery Pack: 1.3 kWh lithium-ion.\n\nCombined Output: 138 horsepower.\n\nFuel Economy: 47 MPG city, 41 MPG highway, 44 MPG combined (5.0 L/100km city, 5.7 L/100km highway, 5.3 L/100km combined)\n\nBody Style: Compact sedan.\n\nWhy Does It Exist?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHere\u2019s a little fact you can bore your friends with: The Toyota Corolla is the best-selling car nameplate in the world. Nifty, right? With such widespread popularity, it only makes sense to build a hybrid variant, and Toyota\u2019s hybrid all-wheel-drive system is simple enough to implement, so here you go. A compact, reasonably priced hybrid sedan with a little something extra for snow belt residents is such a good idea, you almost wonder why it wasn\u2019t built sooner.\n\nHow Does It Look?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that the twelfth-generation Corolla sedan is now on its sixth model year in America because it still looks smart. It\u2019s rounded, compact, and modern, and although the front end and rear bumper on the sporty trims are a bit overly aggressive for a compact sedan, I can\u2019t help but get the sense they\u2019ll actually age just fine. The rotund, cab-forward optimism just overpowers any hints of visual aggression, and makes the Corolla look bubbly in a positive way. I dig it.\n\nHow About The Inside?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSliding behind the wheel of the 2025 Corolla Hybrid AWD, you\u2019re greeted with a cabin that\u2019s more basic than in most competitors and yet still complete. You have almost all the physical controls you could want, a slim dashboard fascia, enough soft-touch materials and stitched flourishes to add a little something to the cabin without posturing as premium, and solid build quality. Instead of trying too hard to be minimalist, it\u2019s just pleasantly simple. The learning curve is remarkably shallow if you\u2019re coming from an older car, and that\u2019s an underrated quality in a vehicle.\n\nAs for space and comfort, the rear seat on the sedan is both more spacious than in the hatchback and properly comfortable for adults, although the front seats don\u2019t offer as much thigh support as the ones you get in a Honda Civic or Mazda 3. Although the steering column telescopes, the wheel\u2019s still a bit close to the dashboard on the column\u2019s most extended setting, so this might not be the best car for long-legged drivers. Outward visibility is quite good though, and that\u2019s a lost art these days.\n\nHow\u2019s It Drive?\n\nUnsurprisingly, the 138-horsepower Corolla Hybrid AWD isn\u2019t quick, but it\u2019ll keep up with traffic no problem and settle down into a nice, quiet freeway cruise once you reach 60 mph. As for the all-wheel-drive system, it\u2019s not exactly what you\u2019d get in a Subaru or an all-wheel-drive Mazda 3. The engine isn\u2019t connected to the rear wheels, a 40-horsepower electric motor on the rear axle does all the work. Does it still work in the snow? Yeah, with winter tires, it works well enough to get you going without wheelspin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs for handling, the steering is predictably light and a bit vague, but it\u2019s also quicker than a chipmunk on 5 Hour Energy. Combine that with a stiff body structure and well-tuned suspension, and the Corolla Hybrid AWD feels eager to change direction, chipper in a way that many compact cars aren\u2019t these days. Add in perfectly comfortable ride quality, and the result is a reasonably priced hybrid that won\u2019t bore you when the roads get twisty or grow excessively tiring when freeways get monotonous. Well done, Toyota.\n\nDoes It Have The Electronic Crap I Want?\n\nAlmost all of it. Every new Corolla gets wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, radar-guided adaptive cruise control, LED headlights, lane-keep assistance, four USB-C ports, and single-zone automatic climate control. This particular fully loaded trim also gets a JBL eight-speaker stereo that\u2019s perfectly dandy for the compact car segment, a digital instrument cluster, heated seats, and a larger 10.5-inch touchscreen infotainment system (an eight-inch unit is standard) that annoyingly, deletes the volume knob. That\u2019s an electronic thing I\u2019d like to still have.\n\nThree Things To Know About The 2025 Toyota Corolla Hybrid AWD\n\nIt starts at a rather sensible $26,360 in America, or $30,350 in Canada. The all-wheel-drive system\u2019s meant more for security and less for snowy heroics. A combined fuel economy rating of 44 MPG is pretty good, yeah?\n\nDoes It Fulfill Its Purpose?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf you stick near the cheap and cheerful end of the model range, absolutely. Here\u2019s a quality-feeling, economical, well-priced, practical yet properly compact hybrid sedan with all the headline features you really need and the confidence of four-wheel traction for particularly slippery winter conditions. However, if you load up a Corolla Hybrid, pricing really overlaps with the much more powerful, much more luxurious Honda Civic Hybrid. Best not go HAM on the options, but how many people would?\n\nWhat\u2019s The Punctum Of The 2025 Toyota Corolla Hybrid AWD?\n\nWhen it comes to being a sensible car, this thing\u2019s a valedictorian.\n\n(Photo credits: Thomas Hundal)\n\nSupport our mission of championing car culture by becoming an Official Autopian Member.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPlease send tips about cool car things to tips@theautopian.com.

            "content": "2025 Toyota 4Runner Standard Equipment\n\nJust like the fourth-generation Toyota Tacoma, the 2025 Toyota 4Runner is new from the ground up. The 2025 4Runner rides on the same TNGA-F platform and utilizes a boxed ladder frame with a multi-link coil live rear axle, while the front continues to ride on a double wishbone independent suspension. This allows the brand-new 4Runner to tow up to 6,000 pounds with its 2.4-liter turbocharged I-4 engine making 278 hp and 317 lb-ft of torque. However, the 4Runner will get two versions of that engine, with the second being the i-Force Max hybrid pumping out 326 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque thanks to its 48-hp electric motor sandwiched between the engine and the transmission.\n\nThis turbocharged hybrid four-banger replaces the old 4.0-liter V-6 and produces 86 hp more, while also allowing for a 2.4-kW 120-volt AC inverter for powering electronics. All 4Runners will use an eight-speed automatic transmission sending power to either the rear wheels, or to a full- or part-time 4WD system, depending on the trim you select. Rear-wheel-drive models will gain an automatic limited-slip differential, while all 4WD models will get an electronically controlled Active Traction Control in addition to the auto LSD.\n\n2025 Toyota 4Runner Standard Safety and Convenience Features\n\nEvery 2025 Toyota 4Runner will get Toyota Safety Sense 3.0, as that has become standard for every TNGA-F vehicle and will include Proactive Driving Assist that helps during regular driving if conditions are met while its active. Inside is very Tacoma-like, including the cover on the driver\u2019s side dash that says \u201cAccessory Ready\u201d in Morse code. The Multi-Terrain Select system now works in both 4-High and 4-Low while a new CRAWL Control function is quieter than the previous iteration.\n\nAlso standard across all trims is the Smart Key System with push-button start, which enables phone-as-key ability for connected smartphones when you have an active Remote Connect trial or subscription. All 2025 4Runners will also feature wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard, while also offering connection though a USB-C data and charging port located on the right-hand side of the touchscreen. Dual USB-C charging ports are included in the front row as standard. All 2025 Toyota 4Runners will have second-row tumble seats for expanded cargo room.",

Grocery stores coming to 9 states, including Alabama\n\nAccording to Toyota's defect report, the defect can cause the engine's bearings to fail, which can in turn produce engine knocking, rough running, failing to start completely or stalling while driving, leading to a potential loss of motive power at high speeds and increased risk of crashing.\n\nThough the defect can cause the engine to stall, interim letters from the company notifying customers of the situation and the progress on the remedy found their way to Toyota owners in late July, almost two months after the recall was issued.\n\nThe remedy for this defect \u2014 engines replaced at Toyota dealers free of charge \u2014 was not set to launch until December 2024, leading disgruntled owners to file a class action lawsuit in December.\n\nOn Dec. 2, plaintiffs Tom Daley, Marty Holstien, and Terrance Regan \u2014 who all hail from different states \u2014 filed on behalf of all Toyota drivers \u201cstuck driving a vehicle that Toyota knows is dangerous but has no concrete timetable for a workable fix.\u201d\n\nThe 41-page lawsuit details that the faulty engine \u201ccan result in numerous unsafe driving scenarios,\u201d that the unsatisfactory recall measures don\u2019t include Toyotas with similar engines which are also experiencing the defect, and that being \u201cforced to wait it out\u201d for a remedy that is \u201cnot even guaranteed\u201d to fix the problem is \u201centirely unfair and unsafe.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the lawsuit cites a wealth of online complaints about the Toyota Tundra\u2019s engine and claims that Toyota \u201cknew or should have known\u201d about the engine defect before selling the vehicle due to industry-standard testing processes and that, despite allegedly knowing about the dangers of the engine defects, Toyota sold and leased the affected vehicles anyway.\n\nThe proposal for the lawsuit includes relief measures such as compensation for economic and non-economic damages the affected nationwide class has suffered and an injunction that would enact a cease and desist of Toyota\u2019s \u201calleged wrongful conduct\u201d in selling the Tundra and a requirement to engage in a \u201ccorrective advertising campaign.\"\n\nMore: Party City is going out of business. What we know so far\n\nToyota has not responded to a request for comment on the situation itself, the proposed lawsuit, the remedy timeline nor their intentions to rectify the manufacturing process in the two plants that produced the faulty engines.\n\nAll drivers of 2022, 2023 and 2024 Toyota Tundras and Toyota Tundra hybrids who purchased or leased vehicles in the U.S. fall under the class the lawsuit covers.

They out-accelerate the muscle cars of a generation ago and corner like little sports coupes. They have extreme creature comforts \u2014 buttery-soft leather, heated seats and steering wheels, and huge panoramic glass roofs to let passengers kick back and take in the sky.\n\nLuxury SUVs have sophisticated all-wheel drive (AWD) systems that keep you secure in foul weather and on the roughest roads while feeling easy and smooth on ribbons of highway.\n\nThey\u2019re good at everything. And they\u2019re priced like it.\n\nWhat if you wanted just slightly less? What if, say, you wanted a luxury car\u2019s cabin but were satisfied with casual performance? What if you were willing to pay a bit more for some luxury trappings but not take on a luxury car payment to get technologies you rarely use?\n\nFor 2025, Toyota has an answer for you. Meet the 2025 Toyota Crown Signia \u2013 a midsize hybrid SUV with a bit of style and many of the creature comforts of a luxury car but the performance credentials of a mainstream commuter. Call it Lexus light.\n\nIt\u2019s one of two Crown cars you might have seen recently. Toyota also introduced a high-riding Crown sedan in 2023.\n\nA week in the Crown Signia showed me the virtues of being selective about what you want.\n\nMy tester was a Cown Signia Limited in a dusty medium blue Toyota calls Storm Cloud with an interior of Saddle Tan Leather. It retailed for $49,385, including the mandatory $1,395 destination fee.\n\nThat squeezes it in just under the price of the cheapest Lexus RX midsize SUV, which explains this car\u2019s reason for being.\n\nStyled for Sleek, Not Rugged\n\nIf the Crown Signia stands out in the midsize SUV field, it\u2019s because it has no off-roading pretensions. Its styling leans toward sleek, with slit-thin headlights that lend it an almost snake-like look.\n\nThe Storm Cloud shade of my tester got positive comments from friends, but Toyota also cribbed from Lexus in offering a copper-like hue called Bronze Age that might be the car\u2019s best look.\n\nA Near-Luxury Cabin\n\nThe Crown Signia\u2019s best angle is the one from the driver\u2019s seat. Its cabin feels a level above what most mainstream cars provide.\n\nEven the base XLE model gets heated and ventilated power front seats with memory settings for the driver, as well as heated outboard rear seats. Upholstery throughout is leather, and it\u2019s everywhere. The passenger is cocooned from the driver by a curved leather footwell panel that makes the front passenger\u2019s position feel a bit like a first-class airline seat.\n\nThe driver has a heated leather steering wheel and faces a big 12.3-inch digital instrument screen, with a similar central touchscreen canted slightly toward the driver. It all feels more sculpted and intentional than many mainstream SUV cabins. It looks great in Saddle Tan.\n\nMany parts are taken directly from the Lexus bin\u2014the screen housings, volume control, and drive selector are Lexus parts, not Toyota parts.\n\nIt lacks a few of the highest-end luxuries you might get from a car with a sculpted L badge on the front instead. The sound system, for instance, uses fairly good JBL Premium speakers instead of the exceptional Mark Levinson speakers in a Lexus product. However, the cabin offers near-Lexus luxury at a lower price. Hence, the \u201cLexus\u201d in \u201cLexus light.\u201d\n\nA Camry-Like Driving Experience\n\nThe luxury comparison falls apart when you stomp on the accelerator.\n\nThe Crown Signia is carried forward by a nicely balanced 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to three electric motors for hybrid power. It makes 243 horsepower and sends power to all four wheels through an AWD system. A continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) passes it on.\n\nIt\u2019s roughly equivalent to what you find in a 2025 Toyota Camry and less than you\u2019d get in a Highlander. Enough for an easy commute and a stable highway drive. But that little Lexus shifter fools you. Shift it into drive, and you won\u2019t find anything like luxury SUV power.\n\nSteering is light and unremarkable. I didn\u2019t challenge the AWD system with anything more than a dirt road, but found it well-balanced and easy.\n\nEverything about the Crown Signia\u2019s performance is, well, easy. It never felt out of place in a half-day road trip starting on a well-maintained highway and ending on bumpy dirt roads. But it never felt remarkable, either.\n\nThis car won\u2019t excite you with its acceleration or cornering poise. That\u2019s the \u201clight\u201d part.\n\nAn SUV With Priorities\n\nFor some shoppers, that description probably sounds unappealing. For others, it\u2019s precisely what they need.\n\nIf you want much of the luxury car but not all of it\u2014want the luxurious cabin but see no need for speed you\u2019ll never use\u2014the Crown Signia is for you.\n\nNot every car has to be great at everything. That\u2019s how we get overpriced cars. The 2025 Toyota Crown Signia is genuinely stylish, comfortable, tech-packed, and perfectly at home as a family car with nothing to prove.",

All three models are competitively priced and designed to appeal to mainstream buyers.\n\nToyota Camry: Car of the Year\n\nBase Price: $28,400 (excluding destination charge)\n\nThe 2025 Toyota Camry redefines the midsize sedan with hybrid power standards across all trims. Its 2.5L hybrid engine delivers robust performance, offering up to 51 mpg combined fuel efficiency. This model\u2019s sleek, modern styling and advanced safety features depart from the \u201cboring\u201d reputation of previous Camrys.\n\nEven the sportiest version, the XSE AWD, achieves an impressive 44 mpg.

Its EPA-estimated fuel economy outpaces competitors like the Ford Ranger and Nissan Frontier.\n\nNotable features include a 14-inch touchscreen, connected navigation, and off-road enhancements such as 33-inch tires and monotube shocks.\n\nSecond Place: Ford Ranger (Base Price: $32,980) \u2013 The Ranger shines with its 400-hp Raptor model and advanced off-road capabilities.\n\nThird Place: Ram 1500 (Base Price: $43,025) \u2013 The Ram gains efficiency with a turbocharged inline-six engine and offers hands-free highway driving technology.\n\nChevrolet Equinox EV: Utility Vehicle of the Year\n\nBase Price: $33,600 (excluding destination charge and tax incentives)\n\nThe Chevrolet Equinox EV is a game-changer in the compact SUV segment, offering more than 300 miles of range and a starting price that\u2019s competitive with traditional gas-powered rivals like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. Eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit, it combines affordability with cutting-edge EV technology.\n\nThe Equinox EV\u2019s bold styling, spacious interior, and Tesla-compatible charging network make it a standout. However, the lack of Apple CarPlay support is a notable drawback.\n\nSecond Place: Hyundai Santa Fe (Base Price: $34,200) \u2013 With a boxy new design and enhanced cargo space, the Santa Fe offers a hybrid option and third-row seating.\n\nThird Place: VW ID Buzz (Base Price: $59,995) \u2013 This nostalgic electric minivan charms with its design but falls short on range and pricing.\n\nElectrification continues to shape the market\n\nThe success of these award-winning vehicles underscores the growing influence of electrification in the automotive industry. Whether through hybrid systems or fully electric powertrains, automakers embrace innovation to meet evolving consumer demands.

It may have sacrificed acceleration bragging rights to its V6-powered minivan competitors, but its fuel economy smoked them with a 13- to 14-mpg advantage that could translate to nearly $1,000 in annual fuel savings. Choosing something else could have had big consequences for your budget.\n\nThe 2025 Kia Carnival Hybrid represents the first time minivan shoppers have had a true \u201csomething else\u201d to consider when it comes to a traditional hybrid minivan. (There\u2019s a plug-in-hybrid Chrysler Pacifica, which costs much more.) The V6-powered Carnival was already a very impressive van, so Edmunds editors decided to compare Kia\u2019s new hybrid minivan to the 2025 Toyota Sienna, which also gets updates, to see which is the best hybrid minivan out there.\n\nSeat versatility and storage\n\nSince minivans are for hauling people and things, solet\u2019s look at what you\u2019re getting behind the first row. Both vans offer multiple second-row seating arrangements, including far-sliding captain\u2019s chairs that offer pop-up leg rests.

Other considerations are more important.\n\nThe Toyota\u2019s captain\u2019s chairs slide even farther fore and aft than the Kia\u2019s, but they cannot be removed. The most versatile choice is the Kia\u2019s eight-passenger configuration, in which all three pieces of the 40/20/40-split second row slide, creating even more seating versatility, especially with child seats. The Sienna\u2019s eight-passenger version has a small removable middle seat placed between shorter-sliding captain\u2019s chairs. The Kia\u2019s 40/20/40 option aside, the Toyota makes it easier to install LATCH-equipped child seats. The Kia\u2019s anchor points are harder to access. In the third row, meanwhile, the Kia may have less space on paper, but its seat is more comfortable than the Toyota\u2019s.\n\nThe specs say the Carnival Hybrid has a lot more maximum cargo space than the Sienna (145.1 cubic feet versus 101 cubic feet) and that there\u2019s more cargo space when all seats are in place: 40.2 cubic feet versus 33.5 cubic feet). The situation flips in terms of small-item storage \u2014 an important minivan consideration. The Toyota has more bins that are more useful. Its cupholder count is superior, especially up front, but the Kia\u2019s are larger.\n\nAdvantage: Kia Carnival Hybrid\n\nInfotainment and safety tech\n\nNext on the priority list? Keeping everyone safe and entertained. Both vans come standard with roughly the same driver assistance technologies, but we rate the Sienna\u2019s ever-so-slightly higher in terms of their functionality. A new rear seat reminder system actually detects kids or animals left in the car rather than just telling you to check in the back for a living being.\n\nAs for entertainment, we give a slight nod to the Carnival thanks to its massive touchscreen with crisp graphics and a well-organized interface. It is arguably best-in-class. Well, except for its voice controls, which we found to be lacking compared to those in the Sienna. The rest of its system is generally strong.\n\nFor those in the back, the Kia offers an integrated entertainment system with two seatback-mounted screens. The Sienna\u2019s has one large screen that folds down from the roof. Advantage Kia there, but really, aren\u2019t your kids using their own devices anyway? In that case, the Kia has fewer USB ports, but the ones it has are placed better and it has multiple household-style plugs.\n\nAdvantage: Toyota Sienna\n\nFuel economy and driving experience\n\nBoth of these contenders have exceptional fuel economy for a minivan. The Sienna returns 36 mpg combined versus the Carnival Hybrid\u2019s 33 mpg combined. So advantage Toyota, but the EPA estimates that difference will only amount to about $150 per year. It probably shouldn\u2019t be a deciding factor.\n\nWe do rate the Sienna\u2019s overall driving experience to be superior. Primarily, its hybrid system is smoother and more refined, especially at low speed. We also scored its handling, steering and overall drivability slightly higher. Furthermore, it offers all-wheel drive, an option that Toyota says is picked by 63% of buyers. It\u2019s obviously important, then.\n\nAdvantage: Toyota Sienna\n\nValue\n\nThe Kia Carnival Hybrid costs a couple hundred more to start, but the range-topping SX, even with the $2,500 rear seat entertainment package, comes in thousands under the top-grade Sienna Platinum. The Sienna offers more variety than the Carnival, though, with sporty (XSE) and outdoorsy (Woodland) trim levels and available all-wheel drive.\n\nAdvantage: Kia Carnival Hybrid\n\nEdmunds says\n\nThis is a really tough call to make and we strongly recommend considering both of these excellent hybrid minivans. We ultimately rate the Sienna higher and give it the nod, but the advantage is minuscule.\n\n_____\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

They represent three of buyers\u2019 favorite classes of vehicle: midsize sedans, midsize pickups and compact SUVs.\n\nThe politics of the moment may affect 2025\u2019s vehicle sales in surprising ways, but the vehicles also show the auto industry\u2019s march to higher levels of electrification continues.\n\nLook for increasing electrification as hybrid and EV technologies evolve and buyers see how well they work in increasing numbers of vehicles.\n\nIn addition to being Free Press Car, Truck and Utility of the Year, the Camry, Tacoma and Equinox EV got my votes for North American Car, Truck and Utility of the Year. Those awards will be announced Jan. 10 at Huntington Place in Detroit, in the first event of the 2025 Detroit Auto Show.\n\nFree Press Car of the Year: Toyota Camry\n\nBase price: $28,400 (excluding destination charge)\n\nToyota went all-in on the 2025 Camry midsize sedan, making hybrid power standard on all models. The results were nothing but good, as the electrically amplified 2.5L engine delivered capable performance and up to 51 mpg EPA rating for combined city/highway fuel economy.\n\nMore: Story of independent automaker AMC gets new telling in comprehensive book\n\nMore: How Detroit auto dealers plan to make their annual show special, even if it's not as big\n\nNow low and sleek, the Camry long ago outgrew the image of boring reliability that dogged it for years. The 2025 is stylish inside and out, loaded with advanced safety and convenience features and enjoyable to drive.\n\nThe Camry also offers all-wheel drive for improved all-weather control. Even the sportiest and best-equipped Camry, the XSE AWD, scored 44 mpg city/highway in EPA tests.\n\nSecond place: Honda Civic hybrid\n\nBase price: $28,750 (excluding destination charge)\n\nHybrid power made a welcome return to the Civic lineup in 2024, powering sedan and hatchback versions of the bestselling compact car.\n\nWith 200 hp and 232 pound-feet of torque, the hybrid is among the most powerful Civics ever. It also rated 49 mpg in combined city/highway driving. Honda reworked the Civic\u2019s suspension and acoustics to make the most of the hybrid\u2019s characteristics.\n\nHonda expects the hybrid to account for at least 40% of hybrid sales, the first fruit of a renewed commitment to hybrid drivetrains as the automaker juggles the arrival of its first internally developed EVs and a proposed merger with Nissan.\n\nThird place: Kia K4\n\nBase price: $21,990 (excluding destination charge)\n\nStrikingly attractive and loaded with advanced features, the K4 is by far the most appealing compact Kia has ever sold in the United States, leaving the bland Forte in its dust.\n\nKia also declares it to be one of just eight new vehicles in the United States with a base price below $22,000.\n\nThe K4 offers up to 190 hp and 196 pound-feet of torque from the top turbo model, but no hybrid. Base models have a normally aspirated engine producing 147 and less sophisticated rear suspension.\n\nFree Press Truck of the Year: Toyota Tacoma\n\nBase price: $33,700 (excluding destination charge)\n\nAlready America\u2019s bestselling midsize pickup, the Tacoma became the first to offer a hybrid model. The result: an EPA city/highway fuel economy estimate 9% better than the Ford Ranger, the other new midsize to hit the market and a competitor for truck of the year. Compared with an older midsize pickup \u2015 the Nissan Frontier \u2015 the improvement mushrooms to more than 26%.\n\nThe Tacoma I-Force Max hybrid delivers 326 hp, 465 pound-feet of torque and can tow up to 6,000 pounds\n\nThe hybrid drivetrain is available only on 4WD models, but it\u2019s just one of many features in the new Tacoma\u2019s arsenal, which includes a 14-inch touch screen, connected navigation and points of interest info, a six-speed manual transmission (not on hybrid models), 33-inch Goodyear off-road tires, 2.5-inch Old Man Emu monotube shocks and color-selectable LED fog lamps.\n\nSecond place: Ford Ranger\n\nBase price: $32,980 (excluding destination charge)\n\nFord\u2019s midsize pickup made major strides with the addition of a Raptor desert-racing model and many welcome features.\n\nThe eagerly awaited Ranger Raptor made headlines, with its bold looks, lifted ride, chassis and powertrain upgrades \u2015 a twin-turbo 3.0L V6 producing 400 hp and 405 pound-feet of torque, for a start \u2015 but every Ranger improved markedly when the pickup moved to a new architecture in 2024.\n\nKey features include: choice of turbocharged 2.3L or 2.7L engine in non-Raptors, 10-speed automatic transmission on all models, electronic trail-assist features for off-roading, trailer backup assist, up to 7,500-pound towing, 10.1- or 12-inch touch screen, automatic parking.\n\nThird place: Ram 1500\n\nBase price: $43,025 (excluding destination charge)\n\nRam\u2019s powerful and boldly styled 1500 full-size pickup gained power and improved fuel economy when it dropped the long-running 5.7L Hemi V8 for the smooth new turbocharged Hurricane inline six-cylinder engine. Ram\u2019s long-running 3.6L V6 remains available.\n\nThe base Hurricane develops 420 hp and 469 pound-feet of torque. The HO model ratchets those figures up to 540 and 521.\n\nThe Ram 1500 is also the first vehicle to offer Stellantis\u2019 sophisticated hands-free highway driving system. Launched with little fanfare, it\u2019ll be a boon on highway drives long and short.\n\nThe 1500\u2019s spacious cab continues Ram\u2019s tradition of raising the stakes for interior looks and comfort with its new top-of-the-line Tungsten trim. The 1500 can tow up to 11,580 pounds.\n\nFree Press Utility Vehicle of the Year: Chevrolet Equinox EV\n\nBase price $33,600 (excluding destination charge and tax incentives)\n\nThe Equinox is the electric vehicle we\u2019ve been waiting for: An affordable compact SUV that can go more than 300 miles on a charge. Priced starting at $33,600 and eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit off the top \u2015 for the moment, at least; it\u2019s unclear how the opposing political forces of hostility to EVs and desire to support American jobs and manufacturing will play out \u2015 the Equinox competes with the affordability of top-selling gasoline-powered SUVs like the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V.\n\nAdd access to Tesla\u2019s nationwide charging system and the lower cost and convenience of off-hours home charging, and the Equinox seems to answer the most common questions and complaints about EVs.\n\nThe EV\u2019s rakish styling would be at home on a luxury brand. The AWD model will satisfy enthusiastic drivers.\n\nThe interior is accommodating and attractive.\n\nMaddeningly, General Motors chose not to allow Equinox EV owners to use the popular Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring feature. Using my smartphone was the only unpleasant aspect of testing the Equinox EV. I hope consumer resistance convinces the automaker to change that misguided policy.\n\nMore: Ford, Chevy, Ram among finalists for vehicles of year as EVs and hybrids stand tall\n\nSecond place: Hyundai Santa Fe\n\nBase price: $34,200 (excluding destination charge)\n\nThe Santa Fe compact SUV is Hyundai\u2019s bestselling vehicle, but the automaker didn\u2019t hesitate to tear up the playbook with the new model. Out with the old design theme and dimensions. In with a new boxy shape, proportions and interior based on the premise that the rear hatch and cargo space must grow to accommodate more cargo.\n\nThat may sound utilitarian, but the result was a roomy SUV several luxury-wannabe brands should envy.\n\nThe Santa Fe looks better, rides better, and seems destined to sell better. From its many safety and convenience features and third row of seats for small children, to a fuel-efficient hybrid, the Santa Fe is a formidable player in one of the industry\u2019s most competitive segments.\n\nThird place: VW ID Buzz\n\nBase price: $59,995 (excluding destination charge and tax incentives)\n\nThe VW ID Buzz electric minivan is hands-down the most appealing design of any vehicle going on sale now. It\u2019s nearly impossible not to smile when the happy-looking little vehicle pulls into view, but the ID Buzz is much more than a tribute to the creaky \u201860s-era Microbus. In addition to electric power and available all-wheel-drive, the Buzz offers clever touches including power-opening inset second-row windows, a cargo organizer and more cargo space behind the front seat than a Chevy Suburban.\n\nThe Buzz\u2019s high price and low cruising range leave room for improvement.\n\nContact Mark Phelan: 313-222-6731 or mmphelan@freepress.com.

            "content": "Investors in Toyota Motor Corporation TM need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 17, 2025 $280 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Toyota Motor shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Toyota Motor is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Automotive - Foreign industry that ranks in the Bottom 34% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.53 per share to $4.36 in that period.\n\n\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Toyota Motor right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nThe Toyota Tundra truck's reliability is dropping like a rock.\n\nToyota Tundra truck owners are seething with frustration due to the pickup's persistent problems. Take Damien, for instance, who purchased a 2022 Tundra only to have the engine fail on him. His truck has depreciated by half its value, leaving him with a useless vehicle. And he's not alone. Here's Damien's harrowing experience.\n\nIf you've read my report on the Toyota Tundra engine issue, you're aware of the magnitude of the problem. The Japanese automaker must replace over 100,000 - 2022 and 2023 Tundra pickup and Lexus LX SUV engines with the V35A twin-turbo 3.4-liter V-6 power plant. This recall is not just a minor inconvenience but a significant disruption for Tundra owners. Read my full report here.\n\nToyota's excellent reputation for building reliable vehicles is in serious decline. The recent Tundra recall to replace its 3.4-liter V-6 is the latest problem the automaker is facing.\n\nOne of my readers, Damien Broomes, wrote to me about his 2022 Tundra truck. I'll share his comments along with other Tundra owners who are fuming because of the truck's reliability issues.\n\nImagine driving your truck on a busy road on a Friday afternoon, going 55 miles an hour with your four-year-old daughter in the backseat. You purchased a Toyota Tundra because you wanted a safe vehicle for your young family.\n\nSuddenly, your truck engine loses power and dies in the middle of traffic. You have to make an emergency maneuver, pull the truck over, and deal with vehicles that are speeding past you.\n\nIt's not a good situation.\n\nThe worst thing is you have your daughter in the backseat who isn't happy with the situation. She picks up on your frustration and starts crying. Now you have a serious safety issue and a small child to deal with.\n\nYou have to call your wife, tell her to calm down your little girl, and have her come and pick you up. You must also contact a tow truck company to get your truck out of the road. You are fuming mad.\n\nThat's what happened to Damien. Here is his story.\n\nDamien says, \"This is very concerning. I own a 2022 Toyota Tundra. On Friday, I suddenly lost engine power while driving on a main street at a pretty good speed.\"\n\n\"My four-year-old daughter was sitting in the back seat. I immediately called the dealer, who strangely enough had called me just the week prior.\"\n\n\"I was concerned for the safety of my kids and myself. Feeling hopeful, I thought I could trade the truck and get a new one.\"\n\nDamien was shocked at what the dealer offered him for his truck.\n\n\"The dealership's offer was a mere $35,000 for my truck, which I had purchased two years ago for $60,000,\" he laments.\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the Toyota dealer offered to sell him a used truck for the same price he paid for his truck two years ago.\n\nDamien says, \"Then they offered me a pre-owned truck also at $60,000.\"\n\nDamien has three options at this point because his truck is undrivable, and he needs a vehicle to drive. His wife has a car but needs it to drive to her job.\n\nIt doesn't leave Damien with many options. He can:\n\n1. Sell the truck back to the Toyota dealer (at half the price he paid)\n\n2. Trade the truck in and get a new one.\n\n3. Wait on the new engine, which could take months.\n\nDamien continues, \"My question is this. Why would I be stuck with the price tag if the dealership sold me a lemon? This was no fault of mine; it was Toyota's mistake. I have been to the dealership countless times with this truck for various recalls and programming updates; I even had to replace the brake pad and disc in less than two years.\"\n\n\"As someone who drove the Tundra for 10 years, Toyota should do right by their customers and not ask them to foot the bill. That is certainly not customer service.\"\n\nIn my previous report on the Toyota Tundra recall, I detailed the lengthy process customers must endure to fix their trucks. Toyota has to replace the defective engines with new ones, a task that will take between 13 to 21 hours for each engine.\n\nWith 100,000 engines being replaced, customers will be lined up waiting to get the work done.\n\nTundra owners are left \"holding the bag.\"\n\nAs Damien found out, and other Tundra owners are now concerned, engine failures affect the resale value of their trucks before they get the engine replacement.\n\nHere are some other comments from Toyota Tundra owners who have experienced similar issues.\n\nChris R. - Owned a 23 Tundra TRD Pro Hybrid. The first motor failed at 19,500 miles. The dealer had the vehicle for 2.5 months and replaced the short block. I got the truck back 3 weeks, and 500 miles later, 2nd motor failed. I got rid of it last weekend. I would not accept anything short of a completely brand-new crate motor. You've been warned.\n\nMike H. - I have a 2022 Tundra SR5 Crewmax that experienced an engine issue back in early July. I usually drive in \"sport mode,\" and as I went to pull out into traffic, and as you'll know, the throttle responds quickly, the rpm went to 5-6,000rpm, and instantly, my check engine light came on, and I lost power.\n\nFortunately for me, no one was driving towards me, so I managed to steer my truck to the left onto a side road. I shut the truck off, waited for about 5 minutes, and then fired it back up. A warning came across the infotainment screen telling me to contact the dealer.\n\nEver since that incident, I've noticed what I refer to as hiccups or a slight knock. I hope Toyota will send me the recall papers soon. I have been driving it to and from work because I have no other option.\n\nI also hope Toyota does what is right: Get your reputation back on track\u2014crack down on quality control. Learn your lesson, and don't repeat it.\n\nWalter Sysun - Great article! I own a 2022 Toyota Tundra Platinum, which is part of the engine recall.\n\nBetween the engine and fuel line recalls, I've been without using my truck for almost 8 months! Based on your article, It could be approaching a year without my truck.\n\nToyota won't do a buyback, and they indicated that this recall doesn't fall under the Massachusetts Lemon Law. I do have a loaner, but not to the level of my truck. Toyota will not provide an exact date for the engine replacement!\n\nIt's unacceptable to pay for a truck that I can't use and basically be kept in the dark by Toyota.\n\nConclusion.\n\nToyota Tundra owners like Damien are stuck with a truck that needs a new engine and has to wait months for the dealer to fit them in to get a replacement engine. Their trucks are worth half what they paid two years ago.\n\nIt's not a good place for Toyota to put their loyal truck owners in. Is Toyota's stellar reputation dropping? Some say it's dropping like a rock.

This package caters to adventure enthusiasts, offering flexibility for tailored modifications based on customer preferences and budgets. By showcasing these two visions \u2014 one based on futuristic sci-fi inspiration and the other rooted in functional off-road utility \u2014 Toyota seeks to highlight the versatility and evolving identity of the RAV4.

            "content": "We typically don\u2019t post much about the Toyota bZ4X, Toyota\u2019s all-electric compact SUV. Most reports say it hasn\u2019t sold that well, perhaps due to average range and charging speed.\n\nThe name bZ4X doesn\u2019t really have that sound or feeling of a known vehicle; it\u2019s obscure, is it not? It certainly does not fit the Toyota naming convention: Camry, Corolla, Tacoma, Highlander, Tundra, and so on. Why not give it a recognizable and memorable name?\n\nToyota has reduced the oddly-named EV\u2019s cost by up to $6000 for 2025 to just under $39,000, so maybe it\u2019s more attractive at that price point. Toyota certainly has a huge customer base and some of them are brand loyal. Maybe some of the Toyota stalwarts will buy a bZ4X soon.\n\nKelley Blue Book summed up the bZ4X in this way: \u201cFor commuting and normal everyday duties, an all-electric SUV built by Toyota sounds ideal. And yes, there are many upsides, such as the comprehensive array of safety equipment, the roomy and noise-insulated cabin, and optional features like a self-parking function. The bZ4X is also quite new, having debuted just last year. Toyota is a huge company with incredible resources and smart engineers. Which might have resulted in high expectations for the bZ4X. So we wonder why the company didn\u2019t install batteries with bigger capacities to enable better ranges. Or a system that could charge faster. A joint project with Subaru (the Solterra is the other side of this coin), the bZ4X is a good first attempt from Toyota, but far from the class best.\u201d\n\nThe thing is, for about $43,000, before incentives, you could get a new Tesla Model 3, the updated one, which has greater range, faster charging speed, access to the Tesla charger network, and it is a proven electric vehicle.\n\nA better comparison might be the Nissan Ariya. In its base form, the price is just a shade under $40,000 and the range is about 216 miles. The Toyota bZ4X base model has a range of about 250 miles, and it\u2019s not all-wheel drive. The AWD version has about 220 miles of range. The bZ4X base model wins on range versus the base Ariya.\n\nThe next-gen Chevy Bolts, another potential competitor, might be priced less than the bZ4X, but no one knows exactly what that amount will be. Currently, the Chevy Equinox EV is priced comparably and looks to be a better vehicle than the Toyota bZ4X.\n\nThe bZ4X has a 71 to 72 kWh lithium-ion battery. The MPGe is 119 \u2013 112 for the two front-wheel drive models, and less for the AWD version.\n\nThere has been speculation online that Toyota wants to hang on to the success of its gas and hybrid models such as the Prius, Corolla, Camry, RAV4, Highlander, etc. much more than venturing into full electrification. Hence the bZ4X with its unimpressive metrics, because it is not threatening to the huge auto manufacturer\u2019s fossil-fuel and fossil fuel-hybrid vehicle lineup.\n\nEven with the price cut, bZ4X sales may not increase much. If they do not, will there be another decrease? Maybe a name change would help too. Or bring back the RAV4 EV?",

            "content": "Now that the racing season has started winding down I finally have time to dig into my Prius Prime and start swapping parts. The Prius is quite a bit different than the Lexus RC F GT3 that I work on in IMSA or the Cup car that I\u2019ve worked on in NASCAR, but as my engineer friends say, it\u2019s all about four tires and physics when it comes to cars and how they handle, so all the basic concepts of suspension adjustment transfer over. I\u2019ve learned a bunch about the car, as I\u2019ve successfully installed lowering springs and failed to install a rear anti-roll bar. The most recent set of changes involves wheels and tires. Let\u2019s dig into the details of the latest set of changes and improvements to PROJECT: OPRIUS PRIME.\n\nI spend a lot of time in my car between my various gigs and chose the Prius Prime because I wanted something fuel efficient that was also fun to drive. The Prius Prime handles quite well out of the box, but I decided to take it to the next level with a few key modifications. We left off our last column with a discussion of the TEIN High Tech springs I had obtained from Japan through an auction site. These springs were fairly painless to install on the car, although accessing the top hat bolts required removing the windshield wipers and some of the plastic trim as seen in my video below. The car felt transformed as soon as it was down on the ground because the wheel gaps closed up so nicely and a test drive showed that handling was moving in the direction I was seeking.\n\nThe front springs are rated at 145 lbf/in while the rears are rated at 200 lbf/in, so they\u2019re not overly aggressive, but offer a great compromise of improved handling without any noticeable increase in NVH.\n\nOnce everything settled out, the car ended up being around an inch and a half lower all around, which was perfect from a clearance standpoint as there was still plenty of gap from the fenders to the tires to prevent rubbing. While it may not seem significant, getting into the car took a few days of adjusting since I had gotten used to the previous height of the aggressive roofline, but it became natural after about a week.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInstalling the rear anti-roll bar was not quite as successful as the springs due to the fact that I used old notes and did not actually double check under the car prior to making a purchase. Earlier this year, I borrowed a standard Toyota Prius and examined the suspension, which is where I noticed that the rear anti-roll bar connection matched the Corolla and CH-R. This led me to track down parts made for those cars once I bought my own Prius, which is how I ended up purchasing the 27mm adjustable rear anti-roll bar from Progress Technology.\n\nWhat I failed to consider at the time was that the Prius Prime had a slightly different anti-roll bar due to some of the battery packaging, which necessities a hump in the middle of the anti-roll bar, which meant that my shiny new bar would not fit. Fortunately I noticed this quickly when I attempted to unbolt the OEM anti-roll bar but now I am on the hunt for one that will properly fit on my Prime.\n\nAnother set of components that didn\u2019t end up working out are the GR Corolla performance shocks and struts, which I picked up from a local Toyota dealership. These shocks are intended as an OEM upgrade for the GR Corolla, and since the Prius is based on the same suspension geometry I figured that it would be worth testing out since the set was fairly inexpensive. Once everything was apart I could see that the components would physically all bolt together but actually putting it on the car wouldn\u2019t work out due to the length of the strut shafts on the GR Corolla pieces, resulting in the Prius being slammed on the ground if assembled as intended. The shocks in the rear seemed to be quite a good match, but I did not want to install them without the matching sets in the front. For these reasons, I ended up just installing the TEIN lowering springs on the stock Prius structs and shocks for the time being.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile using OEM components would have worked out great, there just doesn\u2019t seem to be a great solution in this scenario without customizing the GR Corolla components to some extent or moving their internals into a Prius strut housing, which isn\u2019t feasible for the resources that I have in my garage. My next move for this area of the car is to hunt down some coilovers, and the current leading candidate is the Sports-I coilover system from RS-R due the reputation of their builds and the fact that they have an adjustment dial on the bottom of the struts in the front. This is a huge selling point because a traditional top mount adjustment knob requires removing the windshield wipers and trim for access when you wish to make a change.\n\nPart of the reason for wanting to move to a full coilover set is the option for a variety of adjustments and more spring rate choices. While my current solution of lowering the car has improved the handling to an extent and significantly improved the aesthetics, it has the drawback of impacting the roll center of the car, making the handle worse in certain conditions. You can get a great primer on why that is the case in this column from Huibert Mees, which goes into great detail why lowering a car can often be worse for handling. It\u2019s a great example of why any single change in a suspension system can have a huge impact on handling. I am fortunate that in my situation, the lowering spring improved the handling of the car in most daily driving conditions but I have noticed that there is some unpredictable roll when pushed hard in certain situations.\n\nThere are a few ways to correct this, and the first fix that I am examining is to machine a spacer to place between my front suspension upright and the ball joint mounting plate. This can correct some of the issues caused by the lowering springs, but can also introduce some bumpsteer changes (basically, when your steering wheel moves on its own, often after hitting a bump in the road, thus bumpsteer) unless I also build a matching spacer for the suspension tie rod end, so this will still require some research if I decide that I want to follow this path. The most likely scenario is that I will end up with a combination of parts that will result in what I consider the best compromise in handling for my purposes, which will likely mean that I\u2019ll end up with a set of coilovers, stiffer rear anti-roll bar, and some sort of roll center correction spacers eventually.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWheels and tires were my next item on the list, and my initial plans were to grab some of the 19\u00d78.5 inch wheels from the Camry TRD or Nightshade, but as many of you pointed out, they ended up being a bit heavier than what I was looking for since they are cast and each clock in at 30 pounds a piece, which would be an 8.5-pound increase per corner over the 17\u00d76.5 wheels that came with the Prius.\n\nAs a reference point, the optional 19\u00d77.5 inch wheels that are available for the Prius clock in at 28 pounds each. I ended up hunting for forged wheels and found that Lexus offered optional forged 19\u00d77.5 inch wheels for the NX that weight just 24 pounds. I did some math regarding the offsets and the figured out that they would be a perfect match for the Prius and would result in less than a 1% circumference change if paired with a 225/40R19 tire.\n\nThe increase in wheel weight wasn\u2019t huge, but we also have to consider tire weight, since adding rubber can tip the scales quickly, and moving from a 195/60R17 low rolling resistance tire to a 225/40R19 all season tire also had an impact as tire weight increased by around 6 pounds per corner. I ended up picking the Michelin Pilot Sport All Season 4 as the tire of choice due to the weather conditions in my area and how I planned to use the car. I considered the Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tire as well but ultimately decided that it wasn\u2019t worth the tradeoff of having to swap back to the 17s once temperatures dropped.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMany may not look at all-season tires for a performance increase, but the car was transformed from a handling perspective once the rubber was installed due to the softer compound and contact patch of the tires compared to the stock low-rolling resistance units.\n\nThe car felt like it really woke up and that it could now be pushed with the upgraded tires even with some of the added weight. As expected, the added contact patch and weight in addition to the aero effects of the wider tire meant that fuel efficiency was impacted. I try to plug the car in on a fairly regular basis, and during the first few thousand miles, I was averaging around 44 miles of all-electric range and an overall fuel economy of around 75 miles per gallon. Once I lowered the car that improved to 45 miles of electric range and an overall fuel economy of around 76 MPG. Moving to the big wheels and tires had an immediate impact, and after a few hundred miles, the average all-electric range settled to 38 miles and overall fuel economy dropped to around 70MPG.\n\nDecreasing efficiency obviously defeats the purpose of this type of car to an extent, but as with anything in life there are always compromises, and for my purposes, it is absolutely worth the trade-off for the increase in driving fun and a better appearance. From a big-picture perspective, it\u2019s also still a significant improvement compared to the 25 MPG that I was seeing in my previous car, which means that I am still seeing significant fuel savings even with the compromises that I\u2019ve decided to make.\n\nOutside of the suspension changes, I ended up adding an inexpensive front lip in order to change the appearance of the car and make it look a bit longer and more balanced, but outside of that, I have just been enjoying the ride as it has crossed over the 20,000-mile mark on the odometer.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI have picked up more parts for test fitment including a set of GR Corolla brake calipers, which I was able bolt up to the car for mock-up, but found that my current wheels were a bit too close so that has been shelved for the time being while I decide whether I want to consider a different type of wheel in the future. One consideration is moving to something like an 18-inch Enkei RPF01 in the future which would result in a six-pound reduction in wheel weight from the current Lexus wheels that I am using and likely offer multiple benefits. For now I\u2019m happy with the balance and look of the car and plan to enjoy it for a while before I dig into any future options but I am also always open to suggestions for cool components to try out.",

            "content": "This week I have really enjoyed having the 2025 Toyota Sequoia, the 3rd generation of the flagship SUV that was changed dramatically for the 2023 model year, and is assembled at the state-of-the-art Toyota plant in San Antonio, TX.\n\nPowertrain\n\nThe Sequoia shares a chassis and power train with the Texas-built Tundra pickup. The only engine option is the i-Force Max engine. This engine places a 48-horse electric motor between the 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 and a traditional 10-speed automatic transmission. It comes standard with 4-wheel drive.\n\nThis hybrid system produces exceptional results. It has 437-horses and an amazing 583 pound-feet of torque.\n\nExterior\n\nMy test vehicle is the next to the top-of-the-line 1794 trim. There are 3 trim levels below this, or you can move up to the TRD Pro and Capstone edition.\n\nIn case you are wondering why it is called the 1794, you see in 1794, a Spanish colonist named Juan Ignacio de Casanova established a ranch in the heart of Texas, between Leon Creek and the Medina River. Many years later, Toyota purchased this ranch from Casanova's successors, and upon that land built the factory where the Toyota Tundra and Sequoia are made.\n\nI find the exterior to be just beautiful, especially in this Wind Chill Pearl color. The 20\u201d alloy wheels are gorgeous (wish it had the 22s), the sculpted V-shaped hood looks great, there is a nice amount of aluminum trim on the outside, a spoiler on the rear, and I love the new sequential front and rear turn signals. It\u2019s a great-looking SUV overall.\n\nInterior\n\nAs you enter the cabin, the brown all-leather interior looks amazing with darker brown accents (think Ford King Ranch). The seats are wide and incredibly comfortable, and they are power on both sides with memory, they are heated and cooled, and offer power lumbar support. The interior is very Lexus-like, and real American walnut wood adorns and looks great.\n\nWhen you hit the start button, a 12\u201d configurable gauge cluster comes to life and gives you a lot of different information on the i-Force Max power train. You can get real-time fuel economy rating as well as fuel range.\n\nHowever, it is the massive 14\u201d infotainment screen that steals the show. It operates the 14-speaker JBL stereo, navigation system, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, SiriusXM, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This system is lightning fast and super simple. This is one of the best touchscreens I\u2019ve ever seen, and I was able to sync my iPhone in a matter of seconds.\n\nUnder that are your air conditioning controls and switches for your heated and cooled seats.\n\nMoving down is another row of buttons including: enabling the trailer towing mode, and the absolute best 360-degree camera I\u2019ve ever seen. The onscreen SUV circles, and you can see everything around you. This is a great safety feature especially when in parking lots.\n\nThe center console is simple with the gear shifter, drive mode selector, a button to engage the 4-wheel system, and a wireless phone charger. Drive modes are eco, normal, Sport, and Sport S. There is also a button to enable tow/haul mode.\n\nMoving to the second row, the captain chairs are as comfortable as the front ones, they recline but do not slide, and they are heated and cooled. Rear occupants have their own climate control settings, USB and USB-C ports and a 120-volt power outlet.\n\n2nd row seats flip for easy access to the 3rd row seat, which have a power recline feature. Leg and headroom in the 3rd row are not as roomy as I expected, but usable for two not-so-large adults. The problem exists due to the raised floor to house the big hybrid battery.\n\nUtility\n\nMoving to the cargo area, there is an adjustable shelf that will allow you to make a flat surface with the 3rd row seats folded down. The 3rd row has power buttons and they go up and down quickly.\n\nIf there is a drawback to this wonderful SUV, it is cargo area behind the third-row seat. You can fold the third-row seats down, then slide them forward for 22-cubic inches of cargo area, but if there are people sitting in the third-row, it cuts that space in half. There is a movable shelf that I personally found annoying and cumbersome. If Sequoia comes up short anywhere, it is in cargo area in the rear.\n\nThe tailgate is power and hands-free, and you can open just the rear glass if you desire, a feature you\u2019ll find you use often, and one that is pretty rare these days..\n\nStandard Features and Options\n\nThis Sequoia 1794 comes extremely well-equipped with a huge panoramic moon roof, sign recognition, keyless entry, dual power seats, trailer hitch, a rearview camera mirror, and power tilt steering wheel.\n\nOptions include: The $600 10-inch color head-up display, $1,045 for the rear height-control load leveling system, the Pearl paint is $475, the deployable running boards cost $1,005, and the Tech Tow package with wireless trailer camera system is $850.\n\nSafety\n\nOn the safety side, Sequoia comes standard with Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 which includes pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, automatic high beam headlights, and lane tracing assist. It also has blind spot warning.\n\nRide and Drive\n\nDriving impressions are very good. The truck-based frame makes it feel solid, acceleration is fantastic, and it even has a very nice exhaust rumble that is reminiscent of a V8. Visibility is quite good, and the cabin is very quiet. The ride is terrific and has a luxury feel to it, and handling and steering are great for a very heavy SUV. Fuel economy for this Sequoia is 19 in town, 22 on the highway, and 20 overall. This SUV will tow 9,520 pounds.\n\nWhat You'll Pay\n\nMSRP is $86,055 as you see it here, which is actually less than many luxury SUVs equipped as this one is.\n\nVerdict\n\nOther than less 3rd row seat and cargo room than I\u2019d like to see, this is an extremely impressive SUV.",

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\n\"I Bought a 2024 Tacoma a month ago, and my transmission has been slipping since week two; I know I'm not imagining it.\"\n\nThat's what one 2024 Toyota Tacoma customer says about the all-new Tacoma pickup. With its new redesigns, is Toyota having reliability issues with two of its new-generation trucks? I'll explore the question here, but first, imagine this scenario.\n\nImagine buying a new 2024 or 2025 Toyota Tacoma pickup. You know about Toyota's reputation for building reliable vehicles. So, when you pay well over $40,000 for the truck, you expect it to last forever.\n\nYou plan on keeping the truck for a long time and aren't expecting it to break down right out of the gate. However, you start having issues with the truck's transmission. Your new truck is fewer than 2,000 miles old, and you feel the transmission slip.\n\nYou call the dealer where you bought the pickup to get it into the shop. You can't believe it when the Toyota dealer tells you your new Tacoma transmission must be replaced.\n\nTo make matters worse, the service department tells you they will need your new Tacoma for two weeks while they order the new 8-speed automatic transmission. You would not be happy.\n\nWhat's going on with Toyota?\n\nChristopher Pearce (@thechristopherpearce) says that the Toyota brand is becoming unreliable. He reports that the new generation Toyota Tacoma is now experiencing transmission problems.\n\nChristopher's report explains why the quality of the new generation Toyota Tacoma could be dropping.\n\nChristopher says, \"Owners of the new Toyota Tacoma are reporting that their cars are breaking down with less than 1,000 miles. A problem reportedly stems from the truck's new eight-speed automatic transmission.\"\n\n\"It's obviously a huge red flag when you consider the last generation Tacoma was regularly getting over half a million miles.\"\n\n\"2024 has been hell for the Japanese automaker with the massive recall of the Toyota Tundra pickup.\"\n\nIn my recent report on the new Toyota Tundra truck, I reported that Toyota USA is confronted with a monumental task.\n\nDue to a new recall in December, Toyota is gearing up to replace a staggering 100,000 engines in Tundra pickups and Lexus LX SUVs. I said, \"If you own a 2022 or 2023 Tundra pickup, brace yourself for a potentially lengthy wait.\"\n\nWhat caused the Tundra recall?\n\nIn the 2022 and 2023 Tundra pickup and Lexus LX SUV models with the V35A twin-turbo 3.4-liter V-6 engine, internal passages in either block or cylinder heads were improperly cleaned. Small chips of metal, called \"swarf,\" a result of the machining process, remained inside the engine after assembly.\n\nThe presence of these metal chips poses a serious risk. If they break loose, they can contaminate the engine's oil, leading to severe internal damage and potentially causing the engine to seize. It's a safety concern, especially if the vehicle stalls in traffic. Nearly 1,000 engines made in two Toyota plants have already failed due to this issue.\n\nCustomers may have a long wait.\n\nToyota has to replace the defective engines with new ones. Each engine replacement will require between 13 to 21 hours to complete. With 100,000 engines having to be replaced, many customers will wait in line to finish the work. Read my report here for more information on the Tundra recall.\n\nIs the Toyota Tacoma having reliability issues as well?\n\nChristopher says, \"Now, Toyota's crown jewel, the Tacoma, is also in trouble. This model year (2024), Toyota refreshed pretty much its entire lineup: the Tacoma, Tundra, 4Runner, and Sequoia. Pretty much every truck got a new look and also a new powertrain.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the new engines and transmissions are smaller but more efficient, and now they have been plagued with problems.\"\n\n\"Now, the brand has just announced that they'll replace all the transmissions for affected trucks. Toyota has not released an official number of how many owners are actually affected by the issue, and they are not calling this an official recall even though it sounds like it should be.\"\n\n\"If your Tacoma has the affected eight-speed transmission, you will be notified by Toyota, and you will be able to get it replaced for free,\" Christopher says.\n\n\"I'm curious if this changes your opinion on the new Tacoma?\"\n\nHere are a few comments from Christopher's post.\n\nMeowmeow mf - I just got rid of my 23 Highlander. I had it for less than 10 months, with transmission problems since week two. It drove like an old car. Never again, Toyota. I'm so done.\n\nMiss Suspish - They're also insanely expensive for what they offer now. I love Toyota, but there is no reason a midsized truck should be going for nearly 60k (at least here anyway)\n\nDark Christmas - My brother had a newer 2024 Tacoma and had to have it lemon-lawed.\n\n100PoundsDown - My 2023 Tundra Platinum needed a new transfer case at 500 miles. PLUS, the engine is recalled and needs to be replaced!\n\nAD - I bought a 24 Tacoma a month ago, and I felt like my transmission had been slipping since week two. I knew I didn't imagine it.\n\nuser9517259468510 - I'm glad I have the 2020 Toyota Tundra TRD Pro 4X4, V8 5.7 L. I almost fell for it and got a 2023 Toyota TRD Pro Tundra with a V6. I love the truck, but not the payments.\n\nShould you be concerned about the Toyota Tacoma and Tundra truck quality?\n\nThere will be issues whenever any automaker gives a vehicle a complete redesign, like the new Tundra and Tacoma. The longer a model is in production, it is generally the case that the vehicle will have fewer problems.\n\nHowever, it is unusual for Toyota to have to recall over 100,000 trucks to replace the entire engine. The Toyota Tundra has a major design flaw with its V35A twin-turbo 3.4-liter V-6 engine.\n\nDoes Toyota have another design flaw with the 2024 Tacoma pickup's 8-speed automatic transmission? Recent reports say it's a possibility. I will continue to follow this story. Stay tuned.\n\nWe want to hear from you.\n\nHave you purchased a 2024 Toyota Tacoma?

            "content": "The N.C. Commerce Department\u2019s annual ratings of the economic status of the state\u2019s counties involved 18 changes this year, causing some head-scratching not unlike the debate among college football fans over who should make up the 12-team College Football Playoff.\n\nState officials use these rankings to shape economic incentive packages, with 20 counties in the best-off Tier 3 required to share part of any recruiting aid with their 40 worse-off counterparts in Tier 1. Another 40 are in Tier 2.\n\nThe rankings consider four factors: a county\u2019s average unemployment rate, median household income, population growth percentage and adjusted tax base per capita.\n\nPerhaps this year\u2019s most surprising result was Randolph County\u2019s slide from Tier 2 to Tier 1, suggesting it is among the state\u2019s most-distressed counties. The Piedmont county and its county seat, Asheboro, are best known as the home of the N.C. Zoo. But the county is also the site of the biggest corporate expansion in state history. Japanese automaker Toyota is investing about $14 billion in a massive complex to produce batteries for electric vehicles and hybrids, starting this year. Employment at the site 20 miles south of Greensboro is projected to eventually reach 5,100.\n\nSuch a high-profile project isn\u2019t typical of Tier 1 counties. But, commerce officials attribute Randolph\u2019s slide to a decline of 11 positions in its per-capita tax base and a 14-position decline in median household income, relative to other counties.\n\nAt $90,480 per person in the county of about 148,000 residents, Randolph\u2019s tax base is the 10th-worst of North Carolina\u2019s 100 counties. Edgecombe County in eastern North Carolina is at the bottom at $78,238 per person.\n\nA factor in the tax base calculation is the timing of county valuations, however. Randolph is in the middle of a four-year revaluation cycle, with current values taking effect in 2023. Toyota started grading the factory site in early 2022, so there\u2019s some lag.\n\nCounty Manager Zeb Holden\u2019s recent budget requests show that the Randolph tax base increased 30% in 2023 to $16.6 billion, from $12.8 billion during the previous cycle. The fiscal 2024-25 request was the first to credit Toyota with increasing Randolph\u2019s tax base, which now stands at $17.2 billion. Toyota accounts for almost $1.1 billion, or about 5.8%. The factory generated an additional $1.6 million of revenue, helping balance Randolph\u2019s budget at a level 11% higher than before, without a tax increase.\n\n\u201cA new era is about to begin for Randolph County,\u201d Holden says in his budget message.\n\nTax base is also a big factor in Granville County, as the per-capita number there is $129,003, ranking 50th in the state. That was an increase of 14 places. Still, Granville remained among the 20 counties in the most-distressed Tier 3 ranking.\n\nGranville benefits from spillover growth from the Triangle, mainly around Creedmoor and Butner, but also now impacting Oxford. A revaluation this year caused its tax base to rise nearly 60% to $8.7 billion. Its population was about 61,000 in 2020.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s most-distressed county is Scotland County, around Laurinburg on the border with South Carolina. It has bottom-10 rankings in three measures, and the state\u2019s worst unemployment rate of 6.4% between November 2023 and October 2024.\n\nConversely, Currituck County topped the state list, aided by soaring beach property values in the coastal county that touches Virginia. It had top-10 rankings in three categories, and ranked 12th for median household income.\n\nNine counties moved up in the latest rankings. Cherokee, Chowan, Duplin, Gates, Haywood, Jones, Onslow and Pasquotank counties each moved from Tier 1 to Tier 2. Haywood joined Granville County in Tier 3, on the strength of its median household income. Its population is about 32,000.\n\n\n\nConversely, nine counties slid in the rankings. Along with Randolph, they were Alexander, Caldwell, Camden, Cleveland, Davie, McDowell, Montgomery and Surry. Camden and Davie counties dropped out of Tier 3, making way for Granville\n\nand Haywood. \u25a0",

            "content": "The 2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter is kind of a caricature of an overland vehicle. It looks like it was driven straight out of a kid\u2019s imagination, making it fun or embarrassing to be seen in depending on your disposition. I felt a bit of both during my test drive. The Trailhunter has all the trappings like a capable rig, but it looks like a toy. Or, really, it\u2019s a lot of individual toys packaged together. They\u2019re all pretty fun to play with.\n\nThe Trailhunter has so many interesting features and things to look at that I made a quick (long) video running through them, which you can watch here. Then we\u2019ll rate those features on the two critical scales of coolness and usefulness.\n\nWhen I was in high school, most of the conversations my friends and I had revolved around what modifications we planned to put on our cars. Reality usually reflected a small portion of the fantasies. I talked about having a show-winning tuner car while maxing out my budget with a salvage-title Integra and an aftermarket front bumper (unpainted, of course). Once I got into trucks, big tires, roof racks, and snorkels dominated my dreams. At the time, the best I could do was a rear ladder I ripped off of a dead Land Rover at a junkyard and some Hella fog lights off the rack at AutoZone.\n\nAll this to say\u2014the Trailhunter\u2019s loadout pretty much represents peak overland fantasy build. And it\u2019s much wilder-looking than the modded rigs I\u2019ve had; everything about it is dramatic. You\u2019d think an army convoy was approaching when you see its barrage of lights at night. The intake noise from the snorkel is like a video game sound effect. And speaking of games, in this particular shade of Bronze Oxide, the Trailhunter has big Halo Warthog vibes.\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nToyota Tacoma Trailhunter Overland Equipment and Bling Review\n\nSince there are already plenty of Tacoma driving impressions online and, sadly, I wasn\u2019t able to get the thing on a proper multi-day overland expedition, we\u2019ll zoom in on the Trailhunter\u2019s unique features for this review.\n\nThe Snorkel\n\nCoolness: High Usefulness: Low\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nThe Trailhunter breathes through a plastic elephant trunk creeping up the starboard A-pillar. This does not mean you can drive into five feet of water. In fact, Toyota does not call its snorkel a snorkel, this is a \u201chigh-mount air intake.\u201d The idea is to let the engine grab cleaner, dryer air than any dusty, dirty muck you might be wheeling around in. Practically speaking, it adds drama to your driving experience because it\u2019s pretty loud.\n\nIntake air comes in from a vent near the top of the windshield, and then passes through the fender and into a standard airbox containing a filter element under the hood before moving to the throttle body.\n\nStepping on the throttle treats you to an emphatic whhhish; the snorkel is effectively an instrument played by the truck\u2019s engine. I loved listening to it, but my wife hated it\u2014comments on our Instagram video (where you can hear the sound for yourself) are similarly mixed, so I\u2019m curious to read what you (our commenters) here think.\n\nI saw at least one comment claiming the sound was fake, but Toyota\u2019s rep confirmed that \u201cthe turbo and wastegate noises heard from the high air intake are not pumped in or simulated.\u201d I can confirm from my end that we didn\u2019t dramatize the sound in the video either, what you hear is what my iPhone 13 picked up.\n\nAs for its actual functionality, there could be a real benefit in a dusty convoy situation which is common when you\u2019re wheeling with friends. Toyota\u2019s published a zillion specs on the 2024 Tacoma from horsepower to rear-seat hip room but no official max water fording depth is provided by the company. Toyota did confirm, however, that the raised intake reduces the engine power claim from 326 hp to 323. Negligible, not enough for the automaker to feel compelled to disclose it.\n\nFrankly, I suspect its practical benefits are minimal. But if anybody gets the chance to go wheeling in the sand for a few days with one of these and a standard Tacoma, crack open the airboxes and see if the snorkle\u2019d truck\u2019s air filter is any cleaner, then email me pictures!\n\nJBL Bluetooth Speaker\n\nCoolness: Medium Usefulness: Low\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nA dashboard-integrated, Toyota-branded JBL Bluetooth speaker is a $255 option on this and other Tacomas. The sound quality and volume are good enough for a tailgate/hangout setting, and it\u2019d be a neat accessory to have for the truck when it\u2019s old.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason you\u2019d need this in addition to whatever Bluetooth speaker you already own. But I could see splurging for it\u2014the novelty factor is decent. Just, please, don\u2019t be one of those people who blasts music at night in a populated campground\u2014enjoy the noises of nature and be a nice neighbor.\n\nAccording to Toyota, this speaker boasts 10 hours of playtime on a charge, IPX7-rated waterproofness, and is linkable to other JBL Flex devices.\n\nARB Sport Bar\n\nCoolness: High Usefulness: Low\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nThe ARB sport bar, the rack-like thing behind the cab across the front of the bed, can hold 25 pounds on each of its gridded side areas. But its real function is to make the truck look cool (seeing a pattern?). It\u2019s an expensive option at $1,450, but I will admit that it\u2019s an elegant piece of industrial art. The irregular quadrilateral shape as viewed from the side has a lot of visual energy in it, and the swooping cross-brace makes it look simultaneously tough and sporty. I love looking at it, and would probably spring for it if I were buying one of these.\n\nYou can get a couple of other non-ARB branded bedside racks too, which look more functional but a little less stylish.\n\nAuxiliary Lights and Switches\n\nCoolness: High Usefulness: Medium\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nThe Trailhunter has rectangular fog lights and a wider LED bar, all of which are neatly integrated into the truck\u2019s face. The fog lights have a cool party trick, you can toggle them between white and yellow with a button on the dash. The light bar only does white, but it throws illumination a good way down the track.\n\nCan\u2019t say they felt necessary; the truck\u2019s stock lights are pretty damn good on their own. The extra lights are undoubtedly fun to play with, though.\n\nIf you somehow still need more electronics up front than what Toyota provides, there are three pre-wired aux switches on the dash linked up to a harness you can easily tap into under the hood. Again, it doesn\u2019t seem critical, but it is cool. All that stuff is part of the Trailhunter\u2019s base loadout, anyway.\n\nBed Scene Lighting\n\nCoolness: Medium Usefulness: High\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nOur test truck was equipped with a set of outwardly pointing lights on the bedsides, which is an optional function listed at $599. It\u2019s good, and would certainly be handy in a making-up or breaking-down camping situation, or trying to load some cargo in at night.\n\nThe light thrown is decent and integration with the truck body is smooth.\n\nSkid Plates and Underbody Armor\n\nCoolness: High Usefulness: High\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nThe Trailhunter\u2019s skid plate situation appears quite impressive. The underside of the engine is protected by an expansive spread of aluminum that looks like it strikes a nice balance between size and strength. Jack points are easily accessible, and all the vehicle\u2019s important running gear is shielded with at least a little piece of armoring.\n\nThese underbody shields will disappear under a layer of road grime and dirt shortly after you start using the truck but they\u2019re hugely valuable. A rock or heavy branch hitting something below your truck the wrong way can really ruin your day. And if you\u2019re thinking you can just cut up and bend some aluminum sheets yourself, well, making custom skid plates that are actually effective and efficient is tougher than you might think. There\u2019s a reason they ain\u2019t cheap!\n\nAll that to say\u2014I think the skid plates are a great value-adder to the Trailhunter kit. They\u2019re just part of the standard loadout, not an option.\n\nTow hooks and jack points all seem easy to find, and the rails that double as steps on the side feel very robust.\n\nOff-Road Trail Pipe\n\nCoolness: Low Usefulness: Medium\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nWhile the normal Tacoma exhaust terminates under the left taillight, the Off-Road Trail Pipe option puts the muffler and exhaust output just ahead of the rear axle, underneath the truck\u2019s bed. That makes it better protected from rocks and roots that might bend it out of shape, and it also somewhat minimizes the monoxide you have to suck down while standing behind the truck running the power inverter.\n\nThe only disadvantage I could imagine is that the hot, sometimes moist air coming out of an exhaust pipe could ultimately encourage rust right above it. Probably only a third-owner problem, though. Toyota lists this exhaust as a weirdly cheap $75 option.\n\nAir Compressor\n\nCoolness: High Usefulness: Medium\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nThe Trailhunter\u2019s built-in air compressor, like this whole truck in general, is way fancier than it needs to be but pretty cool. Using a digital screen and button interface\u2014which does feel robust enough to live in a truck bed\u2014it\u2019s an easy way to air up or deflate tires accurately. The hose has adapters so you could also inflate lake toys or a raft or anything else that needs air, too.\n\nMy little off-road equipment tour video includes real-time deflation and inflation so you can see exactly how long it takes to do a tire, but I was certainly impressed with how high-quality it felt at the control panel. An air compressor is a great thing to have in an adventure rig, and one that\u2019s this cleanly integrated is exceptionally cool.\n\n2,400-Watt Power Inverter\n\nCoolness: Low Usefulness: High\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nA high-wattage power inverter is a rare option on a car. A decent amount of vehicles can be purchased with a 400-watt inverter and a house-style AC power plug, and that\u2019s enough power to run a camera or laptop or small LED lighting setup. But with over 2,000 watts, you can run a coffee maker, bean grinder, power tools, some cooking equipment, or a decent-sized fridge.\n\nAnything electrical that generates heat (kettle, griddle, coffee machine) uses an immense amount of power, justifying the unit Toyota\u2019s got here. Also in the video you can see that I made some coffee\u2014having an entire pot ready to go for the boys on a backcountry trip would be legendary. I love this feature.\n\nCameras and Vision Assistance\n\nCoolness: Low Usefulness: Medium\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nThis ain\u2019t your dad\u2019s 22RE-powered Hilux \u2026 it\u2019s a land yacht by comparison, and you absolutely will make use of the huge in-dash screen and abundance of cameras while trying to maneuver it. I do appreciate how many viewing options Toyota provides. Not only are there front, back, and 360-degree cameras but there are also various side-view options and sweeping 3D displays that help you see small things that might be near your wheels, like kids or dogs.\n\nI don\u2019t make a habit of letting people or pets hang out by my tires. But if you\u2019re at a campsite with the family, it\u2019s easy to imagine a young critter hiding in a blind spot.\n\nOff-road visibility is claimed as a selling point for this system too, though I still prefer stopping and poking my head out the window rather than watch for rocks on a screen. Depth perception is tough for me to maintain through video. While the front camera is great for climbing steep crests and the back camera is helpful for street parking, I use the 360 views more for making sure the family dogs and nephews are clear of all blind spots than I do for wheeling.\n\nThis stuff has been common in high-dollar trucks for years now and I\u2019m still kind of \u2026 grumpy about it. Yeah, it\u2019s nice that it can help you park. But you know what would be way cooler? A truck you could see out of without a military grade surveillance system.\n\nDriving the Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter\n\nWhile it was impossible to go on a multi-day off-road adventure during our time with the Trailhunter, we did quite a few highway trips and rural miles with some light dirt mixed in. In those conditions, where most of us do the majority of our driving anyway, this Tacoma rides remarkably well.\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nThe Old Man Emu suspension floats at a Goldilocks softness that makes general driving feel very comfortable without seeming numb. The Trailhunter dispenses with rear leaf springs that many pickups have for a multi-link setup that, in short, is lot more forgiving when the cargo bed is empty than a lot of older trucks.\n\nAll Trailhunters get Toyota\u2019s i-Force Max hybrid powertrain\u2014a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-banger paired with a 1.87-kWh battery and 48-hp electric motor integrated with the transmission. Total output claims are 323 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque, which provide more than adequate acceleration despite the truck tipping scales at around 5,400 pounds. Power comes on very low in the rev range, which does a lot to mask the mass of the truck.\n\nIn fact, if you stomp on the gas pedal from a slow roll you get a decent sensation of acceleration. Another big benefit of going hybrid, in theory, is to match good power with acceptable fuel economy. Toyota says this truck should be good for 24 mpg in combined driving. My average was more like high-teens, but I did a lot of idling and throttle-stabbing for photos.\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nThe seats are very comfortable and the interior fit-and-finish on this Trailhunter felt appreciably better than it did in the TRD Off-Road Tacoma I drove earlier in the year. But I think that had more to do with manufacturing discrepancies than actual material choices. The stereo volume knob and passenger seat adjustment switch both fell off in the TRD truck I tested, but the Trailhunter seemed more completely screwed together.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used to the sports-bar-TV-sized infotainment screen taking up a colossal chunk of my peripheral vision behind the wheel of the current-gen Tacoma. It\u2019s large enough to be a parody of modern vehicle interiors and while you can turn it off, it lights back up if you do something as trivial as adjust the stereo volume by one notch.\n\nWithout actually taking it on an overland trip but thoroughly inspecting it in person, I think, yes, it\u2019d be a fun multi-day expedition machine. It looks cool no matter where you park it, which helps make it fun every time you take it out. But as far as being a good buy, it runs into the same problems you\u2019ll get with any high-dollar off-roader: There\u2019s no trail this thing lets you run that you couldn\u2019t do in an old XJ Jeep on great tires and a stash of recovery accessories. Except that, in this, you\u2019d be a lot more comfortable.\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nThe real tragedy is that Toyota\u2019s trotting this out the same year it torpedoed its reliability reputation with major manufacturing issues in its truck engines and transmissions. It\u2019s a difficult thing to reconcile in a review like this. I for sure had fun driving this truck around and playing with its accessories. I think the design is great, and the Trailhunter package is well-executed as an overlander-in-a-box starter pack.\n\nFor daily driving, casual adventuring, and making miniature trips enjoyable, the Trailhunter\u2019s a fun truck. It did make some childhood dreams of driving a truck bristling with every conceivable off-road accessory come true. But if I had $65,000 to set up an overland rig for a serious, off-grid, self-rescue-required expedition, I might be more tempted to grab a last-gen Taco with its trustworthy, albiet anemic, V6 and caveman-spec dash screen.\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter Specs Base Price (as tested) $64,395 ($64,944) Powertrain 2.4-liter turbo-four | 8-speed automatic | part-time 4-wheel drive with 2-speed transfer case Horsepower 323 @ 6,000 rpm Torque 465 lb-ft @ 1,700 rpm Seating Capacity 5 Max Towing 6,000 pounds Curb Weight 5,360-5,410 pounds Ground Clearance 11.0 inches Off-Road Angles 35.7\u00b0 approach | 24.6\u00b0 breakover | 22.6\u00b0 departure EPA Fuel Economy 22 mpg city | 24 highway | 23 combined Quick Take The ultimate overlander starter pack for the \u201cI\u2019ll take one of everything\u201d crowd.

            "content": "Consumer Reports' brand reliability report for 2024 has been released. According to the survey, the brands that make up the top five remain the same as last year, but it is Subaru which now holds the #1 spot, becoming the single most reliable car brand.\n\nThat\u2019s right, Toyota and its sub-brand Lexus are no longer the very top brands when it comes to reliability. The findings are based on the nonprofit research, testing, and advocacy organization's statistics on over 300,000 automobiles, trucks, and SUVs that were sold between 2000 and 2025.\n\nThe total score in this reliability report is determined by averaging the results of several criteria, including owner satisfaction, safety rating, expected reliability, and road test results. These reliability rankings also assess issues and weak spots that affect consumers either immediately or long after they leave a car dealership.\n\nConsumer Reports' list of the most reliable car makers Consumer Reports\n\nIt is worth noting that the list does not include any models from brands like Lincoln, Alfa Romeo, Dodge, and Land Rover. This is because it only considered companies that had \u201csufficient data\u201d for at least two of their current models. Thus, the likes of Fiat, Jaguar, Lucid, Maserati, Polestar, and Ram, too, are all missing from this report.\n\nSo, what made Subaru so reliable? Was it the integration of new tech or advancement in car designs? None of that actually \u2013 the answer is quite the opposite. According to Steven Elek, head of Consumer Reports' car data analytics program, the likelihood of new issues arising dropped because many Subaru vehicles carry forward a lot of their parts across several model years.\n\nCar reliability was assessed in this finding using member survey responses concerning personal car issues during the previous 12 months. Twenty possible \"trouble areas\" are included in the study; ranging from small irritations like paint and trim concerns to more serious difficulties like engine or gearbox problems.\n\nSubaru took the top spot in Consumer Reports' annual brand rankings too Subaru\n\nA reliability ranking out of 100 points was generated by combining the scores for trouble areas, which were weighted according to the severity of the issue. These statistics, along with the findings of Consumer Reports' owner satisfaction surveys and internal testing, are taken into account in the overall model scores.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that this year's reliability results feature more electric vehicles than ever before. So is it finally OK to expect a long-term, reliable EV? Maybe, but it depends on the brand.\n\nSix of the seven Subaru vehicles that were ranked in the survey received average, above average, or well above average ratings \u2013 all six of those cars have internal combustion engines. The sole subpar Subaru was the Solterra EV, which was created in partnership with Toyota.\n\nSix of the seven Subaru models received average, above average, or well above average ratings Subaru\n\nSubaru had an average reliability rating of 68 out of 100. Toyota's luxury car brand Lexus had an average reliability score of 65, while Toyota itself scored an average reliability score of 62. Apparently, the Toyota Tacoma, Toyota Tundra, and the all-electric Toyota bZ4X SUV all performed below average, which had a bearing on Toyota's overall reliability score.\n\nIn the meantime, Jeep (average reliability rating: 33), GMC (33), Cadillac (27), and Rivian (14), the four automakers with the most unreliable vehicles in the research, were all made-in-US brands.\n\n\"This year, among US brands, the Ford Mustang scored well above average, while the Chevrolet Trailblazer and Ford Escape scored above average. The Buick Encore GX and Envision; Cadillac XT5; Chevrolet Corvette, Silverado 2500, and Trax; Chrysler Pacifica; Ford Bronco, Bronco Sport, Explorer, Maverick, Maverick Hybrid, and Mustang Mach-E; GMC Sierra 2500; Ram 2500; and Tesla Model 3 and Model Y all scored average,\" stated Consumer Reports.\n\nSubaru offers a range of cars, achieving an average reliability rating of 68 out of 100 Subaru\n\nIn an industry constantly chasing the next big thing, sometimes the real winners are the ones who stick to what works. In addition to bagging the top spot in the reliability report, Subaru took the top spot in the annual overall brand rankings report too, dethroning BMW off its perch. Subaru has surpassed marques like BMW, Porsche, and Honda, which make up the rest of the top five brands.\n\nBrands like Audi, whilst still outside the top five, moved up from 12th to 6th place. In a similar vein, Infiniti rose six points to take the 10th spot on the list.\n\nNow that\u2019s no mean feat.\n\nSource: Consumer Reports",

Will the funky-looking minivan find success as an EV?\n\nWhen will Toyota launch its first electric minivan?\n\nAlthough Toyota launched Japan\u2019s first \u201celectrified,\u201d or PHEV models less than two weeks ago, we are already learning that a fully electric minivan is coming.\n\nToyota launched the Alphard and Vellfire PHEV minivans on December 20, offering both gas and hybrid powertrains. The new PHEV system provides up to 45 miles (73 km) of all-electric driving range, while the interior features \u201cthe quietness of a BEV.\u201d Meanwhile, Toyota has bigger plans to enter the electric minivan market.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Japan\u2019s leading auto magazine, Best Car (via Forbes), the Toyota Previa will be revived in 2026.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nKnown for its egg-shaped design, the Toyota Previa was sold in the US and overseas markets in the early 1990s. However, due to stiff competition from the Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Caravan, and others, the Previa was discontinued in 1997. In its final sales year, only 3,780 units were sold, compared to a peak of around 52,000 in 1991.\n\nToyota Fine-Comfort Concept FCV minivan (Source: Toyota)\n\nThe Previa was replaced by the Sienna, which has a much more toned-down design and is still sold primarily in the North American market.\n\nAlthough Toyota was expected to use the e-TNGA platform, which underpins the bZ4X electric SUV, a Toyota insider said the Previa EV will use the GA-K platform, currently used for the Crown, Camry, and RAV-4 models.\n\nIt will be available in both electric (EV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) options. Like its predecessor, the electric minivan is expected to feature a similar egg-like design for aerodynamics.\n\nThe revived Previa was initially developed as a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCEV), but Toyota changed its plans due to a lack of demand and charging. The FCEV model was previewed as the \u201cFine-Comfort Ride\u201d Concept (shown above) in 2017.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nAn all-electric Toyota minivan could help the Japanese auto giant finally gain traction in the EV market. Sales of its first electric model, the bZ4X, have been slower than expected due to an early recall and an influx of mid-size electric SUVs, many times with more range and features.\n\nToyota is known for its hybrids, like the Prius, so it\u2019s no surprise that it will offer a PHEV version. However, without a dedicated EV platform, the electric Previa could suffer the same fate as the bZ4X, with less range and options.\n\nRivals like Hyundai are also launching their first electric minivans soon. Hyundai is preparing to begin production of its Staria Electric minivan next year. It\u2019s expected to launch in Korea next year, followed by Europe in the first half of 2026. European-made models will be imported to places like Australia and Thailand, two key overseas markets for Toyota.\n\nRecently, reports surfaced that Toyota is dropping the bZ4X (bZ) naming system, so an electric Previa minivan could make sense.\n\nToyota has teased other EV revivals, including electric Land Cruiser and Supra models. It also just launched the Urban Cruiser electric SUV in Europe. Check back soon for more info on Toyota\u2019s first electric minivan.",

And it might return with plug-in powertrains.\n\nAccording to a report in Japan's Best Car magazine, spotted by longtime Japan-based correspondent Peter Lyon at Forbes, a new Previa is slated for a 2026 launch using the TNGA-K platform that underpins the Toyota Camry, Crown, and RAV4, among others, with the intention of accommodating both plug-in hybrid and all-electric powertrains. A hydrogen fuel-cell powertrain was also reportedly considered but discarded.\n\nThis report, which is based on conversations with an anonymous Toyota source, doesn't mention the U.S. market. But the fact that the TNGA-K platform is already homologated for use here in so many other models could perhaps give Toyota a head start on making the new Previa U.S.-ready.\n\n1991 Toyota Previa\n\nGranted, the original Previa wasn't very successful in the U.S. While it gave Toyota an up-to-date entry in the then-booming minivan segment, sales gradually tapered off from its introduction in 1990 to its discontinuation in 1997. Just 3,780 were sold in that final year, Forbes notes, before the Previa was replaced by the more conventional Toyota Sienna.\n\nThe Previa stood out thanks to its rounded exterior, often described as egg-like in silhouette. The new Previa will reportedly feature similar styling, while offering seating for up to seven. If it reaches the U.S., it might be a counterpoint to the Sienna, which is now hybrid-only, but still more conservative in design.\n\n1991 Toyota Previa\n\nAmong U.S.-market minivans, all but the Honda Odyssey have switched to hybrid powertrains. The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid has been a plug-in hybrid for years and as we've seen, can go more than 30 miles without the engine.\n\nFor the U.S., the Volkswagen ID.Buzz is the first time the minivan\u2014or passenger van\u2014has gone all-electric. But it might not be alone soon. Kia has teased another quirky possibility in the PV5, one of a series of electric vans based on a modular architecture.

            "content": "According to a Bloomberg report, advisers to President-elect Donald Trump are proposing a two-pronged strategy to reshape the U.S. auto industry. The plan includes cutting federal subsidies for EVs while fostering a domestic supply chain for their production. This approach aims to prioritize U.S. automakers without taxpayer support for consumers. Recommendations also include easing environmental reviews, speeding up permits for EV projects, and expanding tariffs on EV-related imports.\n\nHowever, intense competition and oversupply in the domestic market could lead to consolidation among Chinese manufacturers. The market is anticipated to face challenges in 2025 due to policy changes, but strong growth is expected to resume later in the decade.\n\nChina is set to lead global EV sales, with domestic EV sales expected to exceed 12 million units by 2025, a 20% increase from the previous year, as reported by the Financial Times. This growth comes as traditional car sales are expected to decline by over 10%. China's EV success is attributed to advancements in technology and resource supply chains, lowering manufacturing costs. While EV growth has slowed in Europe and the U.S., China\u2019s market continues to expand rapidly, overtaking Western competitors.\n\nMeanwhile, China's vehicle market is expected to see continued growth, especially in new energy vehicles, supported by incentives and subsidies. Global production is forecast to decline by 0.4%, with regional variations. Electric vehicles are still a growth sector, with battery electric vehicle sales projected to reach 15.1 million units, a 30% increase from 2024, the report states. However, uncertainties regarding infrastructure, policies, and supply chains persist.\n\nAccording to the S&P Global Mobility report, global vehicle sales in 2025 are expected to reach 89.6 million units, growing 1.7% from 2024. However, several challenges, including high interest rates, economic uncertainty, and evolving electrification policies, are likely to limit growth. In the US, the incoming administration's policies, including tariffs and deregulation, could further complicate the market. The European market is projected to grow modestly due to economic risks and stricter emission rules.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Biggest EV Stocks In the World Heading into 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) stands against the other EV stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoreover, federal incentives like the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers would be repealed, and fuel economy and tailpipe pollution regulations would return to 2019 levels. The proposals also seek to support domestic manufacturing, including EV battery production, the report states. Additionally, the transition team is considering deregulating the autonomous vehicle industry and easing reporting requirements for carmakers using automated driving technologies.\n\nPotential U.S. Tariffs Could Undermine Canada-U.S. Automotive Trade\n\nThere are growing concerns that President-elect Donald Trump's proposed 25% tariffs on Canadian imports could harm the recovering Canadian auto industry, especially in Ontario, where major automakers produce vehicles largely for U.S. consumers, as per CNBC.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford warned that such tariffs could increase vehicle prices, slow production, and cost jobs in both Canada and the U.S. Trump's tariffs, intended to address national security concerns, could add significant costs to vehicles and automotive parts from Canada, Mexico, and China. The report states that while Canada's auto exports to the U.S. are substantial, industry leaders fear the tariffs could disrupt this balance, negatively impacting both sides. Ontario Premier called for closer collaboration between Canada and the U.S. rather than imposing tariffs on their closest ally.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we created a list of the largest auto manufacturers in the world that manufacture and sell EVs. We then narrowed our list to 12 stocks with the biggest market cap and were traded on either the NYSE, NASDAQ, or OTC markets. The 12 biggest EV stocks in the world are listed in ascending order of their market cap. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWorkers assembling a car in a modern manufacturing plant, emphasizing the company's sense of progress.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 18\n\nMarket Capitalization: $268.2 Billion\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) produces and sells passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and related accessories worldwide. Operating under the Toyota and Lexus brands, it offers a range of vehicles, including compact cars, SUVs, minivans, trucks, and buses. It also provides services, including retail and wholesale financing, leasing, insurance, and credit cards.\n\nWhile the company takes the second biggest EV stock by market cap spot, most of the company\u2019s revenue is generated from ICEs. The company sold less than 200,000 EVs in the first nine months of 2024 compared to Tesla\u2019s 1.3 million. Most of those sales were attributed to hybrid EVs. However, the company is scaling its operations to catch up to the growing EV market. According to the company\u2019s recent 2024 North American Environmental Sustainability Report, 77% of Toyota and Lexus vehicles currently offered for sale or lease in North America come with an electrified option, with additional models expected soon.\n\nApart from electric cars, Toyota (NYSE:TM) is also collaborating with Joby Aviation to develop electric air taxis for commercial passenger services. In November, the companies announced the completion of Joby\u2019s first international exhibition flight in Japan, held at Toyota\u2019s Higashi-Fuji Technical Center near Mount Fuji. Toyota engineers have been working alongside Joby in California, and in 2023, they signed a long-term agreement for Toyota to supply key components for Joby\u2019s aircraft. Moreover, Toyota also committed an additional $500 million investment in Joby to support the air taxi\u2019s commercial production, bringing its total investment to nearly $900 million.\n\nOverall TM ranks 2nd on our list of the best EV stocks in the world heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of TM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "Toyota could be impacted by Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Mexican-built vehicles.\n\nSeveral major companies are working to gain favor with the incoming President.\n\nFord and GM recently announced they will provide vehicles for the inauguration.\n\nSoon after it was revealed that Ford and GM would each contribute $1 million to Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, Toyota of North America announced that it would also match the donations of its competitors. Several other companies are also donating to the fund, and all indications point towards donations exceeding the $107 million raised for Trump\u2019s first inauguration in 2017.\n\nUnlike its Detroit-based rivals, however, Toyota has decided not to lend any vehicles for the event, sticking to a straight cash donation. And while $1 million might sound like an eye-watering figure to most of us, for Toyota, a global titan sitting on roughly $820 billion in assets, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. Think of it as a polite handshake rather than a bear hug.\n\nRead: Ford And GM Throw $1M Each At Trump\u2019s Inauguration Amid EV And Emissions Fears\n\nCozying up with the incoming President could help Toyota get in his good graces. Trump has threatened to slap Canadian and Mexican imports with hefty tariffs, which could hurt Toyota, alongside many other automakers. Toyota operates factories in both countries. Mexico is particularly important for the Japanese carmaker as that\u2019s where it builds the popular Tacoma.\n\nOther companies reportedly donating $1 million each to the inauguration include Amazon, Meta, and Open AI. Both Uber and chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi are tipped to throw in $1 million each, as is hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin.\n\nSpeaking with CNBC recently, the director of research for nonprofit OpenSecrets, Brendan Glaving, says donating to the inauguration \u201cis a great opportunity for them to curry favor with the incoming administration. None of these people, they don\u2019t want to be Trump\u2019s punching bag for four years.\u201d\n\nThe research director of political reform advocacy group Issue One, Michael Beckel, added that \u201cone of the oldest adages in Washington is that if you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and the price of admission to have a seat at the table keeps going up.\u201d\n\nIn other words, these corporations aren\u2019t just being generous, they\u2019re buying insurance policies, ensuring they aren\u2019t left out of the political conversation when the big decisions are made. For Toyota, Ford, and GM, those decisions could mean the difference between a thriving North American trade network and a nightmare of stifling tariffs.",
