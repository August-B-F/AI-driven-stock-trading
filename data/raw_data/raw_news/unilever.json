The market is driven by increasing awareness of oral hygiene, rising disposable incomes, and demand for premium dental products. Expanding urbanization and advancements in oral care technology further contribute to market growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRising Awareness of Oral Hygiene and Preventive Care\n\n\n\nIncreasing awareness about oral health and preventive dental care is a key driver of the oral care market in India. Government programs, school initiatives, and advertising campaigns by major brands educate people on the importance of brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash regularly. Social media and digital platforms further amplify awareness, influencing consumer choices. As more individuals recognize the connection between oral health and overall well-being, demand for premium oral care products, including herbal and medicated toothpaste, is rising. This trend is powerful among urban consumers who are more conscious about long-term dental care. In February 2023, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reported that 60-80% of children have dental gaps and misaligned jaws, while over 85-90% of adults face oral health problems. Over 50% of those with dental issues rely on untrusted sources for treatment, contributing to India's status as the world capital for oral cancer.\n\n\n\nGrowth of Ayurvedic and Herbal Oral Care Products\n\n\n\nThe increasing preference for natural and herbal products is fueling the growth of the oral care market in India. Consumers are shifting towards ayurvedic formulations that use ingredients like neem, clove, and charcoal, which are known for their antibacterial and therapeutic properties. Companies such as Patanjali, Dabur, and Himalaya have capitalized on this trend by offering herbal oral care products. Additionally, rising concerns over synthetic chemicals in toothpaste and mouthwash are pushing demand for fluoride-free and chemical-free alternatives, making the herbal oral care segment one of the fastest-growing categories in India. July 2024: Zandu Care has launched Dantveer Toothpaste, an Ayurvedic solution for holistic dental care. This innovative product provides a natural and effective way to maintain oral hygiene and promote a healthier smile.\n\n\n\nExpanding Retail and E-commerce Channels\n\n\n\nThe expansion of modern retail, including supermarkets, hypermarkets, and convenience stores, along with the rapid growth of e-commerce platforms, is driving the accessibility and availability of oral care products in India. Consumers now have various choices, including premium and imported brands, which were previously difficult to access. Online marketplaces such as Amazon, Flipkart, and Nykaa, along with direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands, offer doorstep delivery, discounts, and subscription services, making oral care products more convenient to purchase. The rise of digital marketing and influencer-led promotions further boosts online sales in this segment. Dec 2024, Colgate Palmolive (India) Limited, a leader in Oral Care, has launched a new MaxFresh range featuring heart-shaped cooling crystals. This innovative design offers a unique visual experience along with fruity flavors. Using proprietary Ultrafreeze Technology, the product delivers 10X longer-lasting cooling* for an exceptional freshness experience.\n\n\n\nLimited Penetration in Rural Areas\n\n\n\nDespite growing awareness, oral care penetration in rural India remains low due to affordability issues and lack of access to quality dental products. Many people in rural areas still rely on traditional practices, such as using neem twigs or salt for cleaning teeth, rather than commercial toothpaste and toothbrushes. Additionally, limited distribution networks and lower disposable incomes restrict the growth of premium oral care products in these regions. Companies are launching smaller, affordable pack sizes to overcome this challenge and conducting awareness campaigns to educate rural consumers on modern oral hygiene practices.\n\n\n\nHigh Competition Among Established and Local Brands\n\n\n\nThe Indian oral care market is highly competitive, with global players like Colgate, Pepsodent, and Sensodyne and domestic brands like Dabur and Patanjali vying for market share. Numerous regional and local players offering affordable alternatives intensify price competition. Additionally, the growing popularity of ayurvedic and herbal products has led to increased fragmentation in the market. Brands must invest heavily in marketing, innovation, and product differentiation to maintain consumer loyalty. This competition makes it challenging for new entrants and smaller brands to establish themselves in the market.\n\n\n\nIndia Toothpaste Oral Care Market\n\n\n\nToothpaste is the dominant segment in India's oral care market, with high household penetration and daily usage. The market is witnessing strong growth due to rising awareness about dental hygiene, increasing demand for herbal and fluoride-free toothpaste, and innovations such as sensitivity and whitening. Brands focus on specialized formulations for gum care, cavity protection, and fresh breath. With growing rural awareness and the introduction of affordable sachets and small packs, the toothpaste market is expanding across all income segments. Additionally, premium and medicated toothpaste variants are gaining traction among urban consumers seeking advanced oral care solutions. Dec 2024, Dabur India has entered the kids' toothpaste market with 'Dabur Herb'l Kids Toothpaste,' designed for children over 3 years. It offers cavity protection and comes in strawberry flavor featuring characters like Iron Man for boys and Elsa from Frozen for girls.\n\n\n\nIndia Mouthwash/Rinses Oral Care Market\n\n\n\nThe mouthwash market in India is growing as consumers become more conscious about complete oral hygiene beyond just brushing. Increasing awareness about bad breath, gum diseases, and plaque control has driven demand for mouth rinses. The segment is witnessing innovations, including alcohol-free, herbal, and medicated mouthwashes. Listerine, Colgate Plax, and Dabur Red have been popular among urban consumers. Dentists' recommendations and increased dental visits have further contributed to the rise in mouthwash usage. However, penetration in rural areas remains low due to the perception of mouthwash as a non-essential, premium product. Feb 2024, Sensodyne, part of Haleon, announced the launch of Sensodyne Complete Protection+ Mouthwash in India, aiming to expand its presence in the growing mouthwash market, particularly for sensitive teeth.\n\n\n\nIndia Oral Care Convenience Stores Market\n\n\n\nConvenience stores, including local kirana shops and mini-marts, are significant in distributing oral care products in India. Toothpaste, toothbrushes, and essential oral hygiene products are commonly stocked items in these stores, making them the primary purchase point for a large population segment. The advantage of accessibility and affordability makes convenience stores an essential retail channel, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. Brands ensure the widespread availability of their products through extensive distribution networks, enabling impulse purchases. However, premium oral care products are less visible in these stores than in supermarkets and online platforms.\n\n\n\nIndia Oral Care Pharmacies Market\n\n\n\nPharmacies are a key distribution channel for specialized and medicated oral care products, such as sensitivity toothpaste, gum care solutions, and fluoride treatments. Brands like Sensodyne, Colgate Pro-Relief, and Himalaya Dental Cream are commonly sold at pharmacies, targeting consumers with specific dental issues. Dentists' recommendations play a significant role in driving sales of these products. Additionally, pharmacies cater to consumers seeking herbal and prescription-based oral care items. With rising dental concerns and increased focus on preventive healthcare, pharmacies are witnessing steady growth in oral care product sales, especially in urban and metro areas.\n\n\n\nIndia Adults Oral Care Market\n\n\n\nIndia's adult oral care market is expanding due to increased health awareness, changing lifestyles, and rising disposable incomes. More adults opt for specialized oral care products such as sensitivity toothpaste, whitening solutions, and herbal formulations. The demand for advanced dental care solutions, including mouthwash, dental floss, and electric toothbrushes, is also rising. Urban professionals and millennials are particularly driving demand for premium oral care brands. Additionally, social media influence and dentist recommendations contribute to the growing trend of investing in high-quality oral hygiene products among adults.\n\n\n\nNorth India Oral Care Market\n\n\n\nWith its densely populated cities like Delhi, Chandigarh, and Lucknow, North India is a significant market for oral care products. Increased urbanization, income levels, and dental awareness contribute to market growth. The region strongly demands premium oral care brands, including sensitivity and herbal toothpaste. However, rural penetration remains a challenge due to traditional oral care practices. Companies are expanding distribution networks and launching smaller pack sizes to increase accessibility in rural markets.\n\n\n\nSouth India Oral Care Market\n\n\n\nSouth India, with states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala, has a well-established oral care market. High literacy rates and greater awareness of dental hygiene contribute to steady demand for oral care products. The region strongly prefers herbal and ayurvedic formulations, with brands like Dabur and Himalaya performing well. Additionally, metro cities like Bengaluru and Chennai see increasing demand for premium oral care products, including whitening toothpaste and mouthwash. Expanding retail and e-commerce channels further supports market growth in this region.\n\n\n\nEast India Oral Care Market\n\n\n\nThe East India oral care market is growing steadily, with rising awareness in cities like Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, and Patna. Rural areas still rely on traditional methods, but increasing government campaigns and dental awareness programs are improving penetration. The region shows a strong preference for affordable and herbal oral care products. However, limited access to dental care facilities and lower income levels in some areas slow market expansion.\n\n\n\nWest India Oral Care Market\n\n\n\nWest India, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, has a large consumer base for oral care products. Metro cities like Mumbai and Pune drive demand for premium oral care brands, while semi-urban and rural areas show strong growth in mass-market toothpaste and toothbrushes. The presence of large retail chains and e-commerce adoption further boost sales. However, competition from local brands and price-sensitive consumers creates challenges for premium product penetration.\n\nCompany Analysis: Overview, Key Persons, Recent Developments, Revenue\n\nColgate Palmolive India Limited\n\nHindustan Unilever Limited\n\nProcter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\n\nPatanjali Ayurved Limited\n\nJohnson & Johnson Private Limited\n\nDabur India Ltd.\n\nPhilips India Limited\n\nHimalaya Drug Company\n\nKey Attributes\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 200 Forecast Period 2024-2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $2.03 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $3.2 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 5.1% Regions Covered India\n\nKey Topics Covered\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "At Nvidia\u2019s Global Artificial Intelligence 2025 conference on March 17-21, consumer goods conglomerate Unilever took to the stage to announce that it is scaling its use of digital twins \u2014 or photorealistic 3D versions of products \u2014 to reshape how it creates and deploys brand content.\n\nThe initiative is part of a wider drive for operational efficiency spurred by the company\u2019s lack of growth over the last couple of quarters. In February, Unilever reported its full-year results for 2024, showing a 2.3% increase in turnover to \u20ac60.8 billion ($65.5 billion). While volumes were up, the rise largely came from cost-cutting and margin expansion.\n\nThe pressure to maintain profitability amid rising media investment has led the company to re-evaluate how it creates content at scale. On its February earnings call, Unilever confirmed that it increased marketing and media investment by more than \u20ac600 million ($647 million) last year, a notable uptick that CEO Hein Schumacher framed as critical for growth. According to a Financial Times report from March 10, Unilever is funneling much of that investment into digital channels and influencer partnerships to remain competitive with beauty-first rivals like L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Procter & Gamble.\n\nAlongside that spending, there\u2019s a push to make content production smarter, faster and less redundant. Enter digital twins and a more automated content creation pipeline.\n\nA digital twin, in marketing terms, is a detailed 3D rendering of a product that can be modified and reused across multiple campaign formats. Rather than shooting a physical product in a studio, Unilever\u2019s teams now work with a master Universal Scene Description file that contains every variant of the product, from regional packaging to label language. Built using 3D developer platform Nvidia Omniverse, the digital twin is accurate enough to be used across advertising formats, from TV to e-commerce to social.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about creating one universal file that becomes a raw material for any creative brief,\u201d Selina Sykes, Unilever\u2019s vp and head of digital marketing and social-first for beauty and wellbeing, told Glossy. \u201cLocal teams can brief what they need, and the asset can be generated and deployed quickly, whether that\u2019s for Instagram, Amazon or a billboard.\u201d\n\nThe benefit isn\u2019t just consistency across markets \u2014 it\u2019s also speed and cost. According to Sykes, the company is now producing content roughly twice as fast and at around 50% less cost when digital twins are used. These efficiencies are being seen most clearly in the beauty and wellbeing division, which includes brands like Dove, Tresemm\u00e9, Vaseline and Clear\n\nIn Thailand late last year, a Tresemm\u00e9 campaign showed an 87% drop in content production costs when using digital twins, alongside a 5% increase in purchase intent. According to internal performance metrics shared by the company, digital twin assets are also delivering higher engagement, at double the click-through rate and three times the average viewing time, compared to traditional product visuals.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a broader effort to simplify content workflows,\u201d Sykes said. \u201cIt allows us to reallocate resources from repetitive execution to more strategic, creative thinking.\u201d\n\nUnilever is applying this logic to other parts of the business, too. Its 2-year-old GAP 2030 strategy, which stands for Grow, Accelerate, Power, aims to remove duplication across functions, reduce unnecessary SKUs and drive end-to-end efficiency.\n\nAt the same time, the company is balancing rising spend on media and influencer marketing with internal pressure to prove ROI. With digital twins, fewer assets need to be created from scratch, and content can be refreshed with more agility \u2014 a vital capability when social trends evolve daily.\n\nThe rollout began in 2024, with a focus on innovation pipelines and hero SKUs. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t create a twin for a delisting product,\u201d said Sykes. \u201cWe focus on launches, redesigns and products we know will need ongoing content support.\u201d\n\nThe production of digital twins is still largely handled by agencies, with developer agency Collective World being a key partner for Unilever in its digital twin project. But Unilever has also integrated digital twins into its internal content systems. Teams across global markets can now access digital twins through a central platform, making briefings and turnarounds far more streamlined than the previous model of studio photography and 2D edits.\n\n\u201cWe call it a content supply chain,\u201d said Sykes. \u201cThe idea is to treat content with the same operational discipline as you would a product \u2014 something that can be systematized without losing its impact.\u201d\n\nDespite the efficiencies, the shift hasn\u2019t come without its limitations. Creating high-quality twins still requires a skilled 3D design capability, which has kept some of the work external for now. And while early signs suggest improved performance, broader consumer perception studies will be needed to fully assess long-term value.\n\nStill, digital twins have become a significant part of Unilever\u2019s Beauty and Wellbeing group\u2019s strategy for 2025. The tech also offers potential for further integration across R&D and supply chain logistics, though Sykes was clear that those applications are still in exploratory stages.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing what else is possible,\u201d she said. \u201cBut marketing is where we\u2019ve scaled it first, because that\u2019s where we had an immediate need and clear benefit.\u201d\n\nThe move reflects a wider industry trend: Global brands are leaning into infrastructure-level AI tools, not just for experimentation but also for measurable business gains. As AI adoption moves beyond chatbot novelty, digital twins represent a practical step toward a more responsive and efficient creative model, one that aligns with both consumer expectations and investor demands.\n\n\u201cThis is not about replacing creativity,\u201d Sykes said. \u201cIt\u2019s about removing barriers so teams can spend more time on ideas that matter.\u201d",

            "content": "Collective\u2019s Adam Cleaver helped Unilever develop a digital innovation that helps creatives make better use of AI to create ads. He reflects on the early results.\n\nUnilever is now creating product imagery twice as fast and at less than half the cost \u2013 all with 100% brand consistency and much-simplified workflows.\n\nThe results speak volumes:\n\n55% cost savings.\n\n65% faster content creation turnaround.\n\nHigher consumer engagement, with images holding attention three times longer and doubling click-through rates.\n\nAnd it is doing it using digital product twins.\n\nThese remarkable results were announced last week at Nvidia GTC in San Jose, where Unilever took the stage alongside me and St\u00e9phane Bourez, our head of 3D and emerging technology, to discuss how these efficiencies were achieved.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nWe all want faster, cheaper, great-quality visuals and content, but many have hit a brick wall when trying to use AI. That\u2019s understandable since achieving true consistency at scale with AI alone remains challenging. The slightest error can have big implications \u2013 if the product your customer sees isn\u2019t pixel-perfect, it can seriously affect brand perception.\n\nIntegrating AI-driven technologies such as Nvidia Omniverse to create real-time, physically accurate 3D product twins boosts product desirability, reduces complexity, and accelerates content creation.\n\nSo, when Unilever approached us a year ago to help overcome perennial industry-wide workflow issues, we knew we could help. Product twins provide a foundational layer for AI, ensuring 100% brand accuracy and consistency that would otherwise be hard.\n\nSo, what are conventional workflows?\n\nTraditionally, brands bridge the digital product asset gap through costly, repetitive, and time-consuming photoshoots or imperfect, single-use 3D assets. Both of these make it expensive to deliver product variants and localization needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDigital product twins solve this challenge. They leverage existing CAD data from manufacturing, with physically accurate, measured materials. These have all the physical qualities of real-world materials and perfectly mimic real-world behaviors, right down to the viscosity of a liquid. Labels are taken directly from the printer\u2019s files, which respect every color and substrate. The result is a model that is 100% physically accurate, so accurate that if you shine a digital light source onto it, it reflects like the real thing.\n\nWhy is this twice as fast and 50% cheaper?\n\nBecause digital twins provide a single digital truth. Along with the speed and cost savings of saying goodbye to product photoshoots, digital twins contain all product variants, labels, packaging, and language formats within a single file \u2013 one digital truth of product data. Need a variant for Brazil? Simply change the layer in your master file and, with a couple of clicks, it\u2019s ready \u2013 no extensive rendering, re-touching or reshoots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major stumbling block digital twins solve is compatibility \u2013 traditional 3D files created in one tool often don\u2019t work in another, resulting in duplicated effort. Universal Scene Description (USD), developed by Pixar, solves this. USD is an open-source format allowing seamless asset sharing across teams and platforms. Imagine a universal charging cable \u2013 create once, use everywhere.\n\nBeyond the obvious efficiency gains, digital twins offer less obvious but equally powerful benefits. Marketers and creatives are freed from tedious and repetitive tasks, allowing them more time to be strategic and \u2013 critically \u2013 allowing more time for high-value ideas and creativity. Marketers also gain the freedom to test audience reception earlier in the process without waiting for physical products, integrating strategy seamlessly into creative workflows.\n\nSuggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Pixel-perfect. Cost-efficient. Game-changing.\n\nSometime soon, the digital version will be seen as the original \u2013 and the physical product as its twin.\n\nThat\u2019s how significant this shift is.\n\nAdam Cleaver is founding partner at Collective. Collective is a global independent creative and technology company and proud B-Corp. Continue the conversation with him on LinkedIn.\n\nRead more opinion on The Drum.",

            "content": "[SINGAPORE] Forget about eating the rich, just eat ice cream. Ben & Jerry\u2019s, long known for its progressive activism, has accused its parent company Unilever of ousting the ice cream maker\u2019s CEO over his refusal to rein in the brand\u2019s social mission. Unilever, for its part, is contending that the producer of Cherry Garcia has ventured into advocacy so polarising that it has put the company and its employees at risk. This latest tug-of-war, currently unfolding in a US federal court, is part of a broader corporate retreat as a conservative tide in Washington DC turns against social activism. Unilever now finds itself in ample corporate company alongside firms such as Disney, Amazon and BlackRock, taking cover from the White House by backing away from progressive causes.\n\nConsequently, much has been made of the corporate sector\u2019s cravenness, but assigning a human trait to a legal entity is fundamentally problematic. Would it be lovely if corporations, with their ample pockets and incredible sway over society, conducted themselves impeccably with the most unerring of moral compasses? Of course it would. Would it be folly to expect such a thing from a bean-counting, arse-covering, lawsuit-avoiding group of people held together by the most transactional of covenants? Indubitably.\n\nFirms only make good guardians of social causes for as long as enlightened self-interest prevails. But, enlightened self-interest cannot be held constant when external factors change. The reality of 2025 is that having an administration that is hostile to your business holds more downside risk than championing a trendy cause holds upside potential. As long as businesses have shareholders and employees, these interest groups will always need to be prioritised, and rightly so. And for as long as firms have a profit to turn, they will have a flank to expose to critics who say that social causes are a distraction from the bottom line.\n\nIn fact, you could argue that firms have the obligation to maximise profit, and governments have a corresponding obligation to its citizens to prevent unfettered profiteering by the private sector, and never the twain shall meet. Today, both parties appear to have swapped motivations with each other, and we have had to watch a US president hawk Teslas on the lawn of the White House. The problem with conflating profit-driven motives with moral imperatives is that, when conflicts arise, neither is served well.\n\nPerhaps this debacle will be a chance to re-focus on the parts of civilisation that already live up to the values that companies are disavowing, such as non-profit and advocacy groups. If we cannot be activist consumers because companies want to sell apolitical ice cream, we can be activist donors to non-profit organisations. If we cannot find employers whose values we can stomach on weekdays, we can volunteer for societies that fit the bill on weekends.",

The round was led by Forestay Capital, with participation from Anais Ventures, VI Partners, and existing investors Insight Partners, Seedcamp, DvH Ventures, and Tomahawk Ventures.\n\nThe cash will support global expansion, with a focus on North America, and enhance Buynomics\u2019 Virtual Shoppers AI technology.\n\n\"We see immense potential in Buynomics\u2019 AI technology to redefine commercial decision making,\" says Jonas Jeandupeux, Principal at Forestay Capital. \"Their data driven approach is already changing the mindset on how companies optimise revenue and pricing strategies.\"\n\nFormer Asda executive Dan Owens hits out at 'sensationalist' Telegraph coverage of epic technology transformation\n\nDan Owens, former Group Product Manager/Head of Product for E-commerce Fulfilment at Asda, has taken to social media to slam The Telegraph after it published an article entitled \u2018Asda sacks staff behind Mohsen Issa's IT upgrade disaster\u2019.\n\nThis focused on Asda launching a fresh round of job cuts as the grocery giant reeled from a botched \u00a3800 million IT upgrade that had been championed by Issa.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, Owens, who now serves as Head of Digital Product - Supply Chain and Last Mile Fulfilment, said: \"I've really struggled with this headline over the last few days, and my personal opinion is that it's incredibly sensationalist and unfair journalism from The Telegraph. There has been much written about Asda (the company) in recent years, and I'm not aiming to add to that discourse, I want to talk about the people.\"\n\n\"This week, and back in November, hundreds of people - humans: with lives, families, ambitions, feelings - left a business that they have undoubtedly given their all to. These were people who took on the challenge the business laid at their feet, many of them on secondment from other roles, to work on Europe's largest tech transformation, without any real experience of doing it. Sounds crazy, doesn't it? But that was what we were asked to do.\"\n\nHe added: \"I was there, I saw it: they did it brilliantly, they gave it their all, they operated with a drive and a passion to do the best by the business and it's customers, they were committed to building a platform for the future. Then, they lose their jobs and headlines like this get published. We cannot and should not forget about the human impact when we decide to talk about something. Language matters.\"\n\nCo-op and Uber Eats shake hands on new three-year rapid grocery deliveries partnership renewal\n\nUber Eats and Co-op have announced a three-year extension of their quick commerce partnership.\n\nThe tie up, which started in 2022, has seen the number of Co-op stores where Uber Eats is available increase to more than 1,300.\n\nThe retailer will now extend its work with Uber Direct - Uber\u2019s white label last mile delivery service. Uber Direct already offers a delivery service from Co-op\u2019s own online shop, and will now work with Co-op on deliveries for orders placed via the convenience retailer\u2019s newly launched app, Peckish, which is dedicated to supporting independent local grocery retailers in communities across the UK.\n\nCo-op will also continue to offer member price savings for Uber Eats users. Uber Eats was the first delivery platform to include these savings, with the former\u2019s more than six million member-owners able to access them on approaching 200 products when ordering groceries and everyday essentials through Uber\u2019s app.\n\nChris Conway, Co-op Quick Commerce Director, says: \u201cGrowing our quick commerce channel is a core part of our strategic approach, and I am delighted to extend and deepen our successful partnership with Uber Eats. Innovation is fundamental to our approach, whether extending reach and choice, creating value through member price savings, or, delivering the Peckish app to give independent grocery retailers a voice online.\u201d\n\nLucy Jones says farewell to the green machine Asda as she joins SAP consultancy Resulting IT\n\nLucy Jones has left Asda where she has spent the last eight years, joining from Tesco and most recently serving as Project Manager. She is now heading to SAP consultancy, Resulting IT.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, she said: \"After seven and a bit years at Asda, the time has come to say goodbye to the green machine. It\u2019s been an amazing journey full of growth, learning, and a fair share of challenges along the way.\"\n\n\"I started out as a graduate in Gosforth, and never could have imagined all the incredible opportunities that would come my way. I\u2019ve had the chance to work across multiple departments in Asda House, and each experience has taught me something new. One of the standout moments for me was working on the innovation store, trialling things like holograms and personalised chocolate machines, with way too many nights spent at the Holiday Inn Express in Stevenage.\"\n\nShe added: \"I\u2019m also incredibly proud to have been part of the Future Programme, where I helped project manage the conversion of our convenience estate. It\u2019s been an incredible achievement to see all 799 stores now fully converted onto the new systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlong the way, I\u2019ve made some incredible friends who I know I\u2019ll keep for life. A massive thank you to all my colleagues, suppliers, and everyone who\u2019s been part of my journey. Your support, teamwork, and collaboration have meant so much, and I\u2019ve learned a lot from every single one of you.\"\n\n\"Now, I\u2019m looking forward to two weeks off with a few trips away before starting off my next chapter at Resulting IT as a Delivery Manager.\"",

            "content": "Unilever has been at the forefront of innovation since day one. And now we\u2019re applying our pioneering spirit to revolutionise the way we create marketing content.\n\nWe\u2019re living in a world with more touchpoints and more channels defining what we buy. For brands, that means more ways to capture attention across media, social, retail and search platforms. Every moment is an opportunity to engage, create and convert desire for our brands.\n\nWe need to meet the increasing demand for content, engaging the distinct needs and desires of the 3.4 billion people we serve at a time when their attention is in high demand. Technology helps us to do this, consistently and at scale, while enhancing creativity and improving quality, beauty, speed and cost efficiency.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re working with like-minded partners to reinvent our approach \u2013 and one of the biggest unlocks starts with pixel-perfect product images.\n\nCreating digital twins for our brands\n\nOur product images are essential to our brand equity. They help our brands stand out in a crowd, building desirability and reaffirming consistency and quality.\n\nWhat\u2019s new is that we\u2019re now able to create digital twins of every pack, using technology such as Real-Time 3D, Nvidia Omniverse and OpenUSD. These 3D replicas reflect every measurement, shade and shape to provide a completely accurate digital representation of a product at a level of realism we\u2019ve never been able to achieve before.\n\nOur creatives can then integrate product images into our AI-enhanced creative workflows seamlessly, reducing duplication across the process from an average of five to one. They can also repurpose wording, languages, backgrounds and more from a single product shot, delivering different formats, variants, assets and versions at unprecedented speeds for multiple channels from TV to digital commerce and more.\n\nExecuting campaigns with creativity\n\nThis efficiency frees up our teams to focus on the human elements of creativity while reducing the costs and energy associated with lengthy technical production processes.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about pushing out more content \u2013 anyone can do that. It\u2019s about starting with a deep understanding of people\u2019s needs and desires, using creativity to create campaigns to cut through and connect with people, and a high-quality content creation machine to deliver desire at scale,\u201d explains Esi Eggleston Bracey, Unilever\u2019s Chief Growth & Marketing Officer.\n\n\u201cOur product twins can be deployed everywhere and anywhere, accurately and consistently, so content is generated faster and on brand. We call it creativity at the speed of life.\u201d\n\nThe implications for business growth\n\nIt\u2019s not just great for creativity; this is a move that can impact the bottom line too. With digital twins, we can streamline production and marketing processes, reducing the time and costs associated with traditional methods and allowing us to boost desirability and bring products to market faster than ever before.\n\nFor example, our Beauty & Wellbeing brands were the first to pioneer this technology and are now integrating digital twins into wider content creation workflows across product lines for TRESemm\u00e9, Dove, Vaseline and Clear.\n\nAnd results are already showing up to 55% in savings and 65% faster turnaround on content creation. Insights show higher engagement with these images, holding users\u2019 attention for three times longer than previous assets, and doubling click-through rates.\n\n\u201cOur digital twins do not work in isolation. We have created bespoke tools at Unilever to integrate them into our content ecosystem,\u201d says Esi.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve transformed what was once a complex, slow process into a marketing system that frees up our teams to focus on what they do best \u2013 think bigger, be creative, push boundaries and create magic for our brands,\u201d she adds.",

            "content": "Ben & Jerry\u2019s has accused its parent company, London-based Unilever, of ousting the Vermont ice cream maker\u2019s CEO over his support for the brand\u2019s progressive social activism.\n\nIn a Tuesday filing from an ongoing lawsuit, Ben & Jerry\u2019s alleged that Unilever breached the terms of the roughly quarter-century-old merger agreement between the two parties earlier this month, when it moved to dismiss David Stever as the ice cream maker\u2019s CEO without properly consulting the brand\u2019s independent board.\n\n\u201cUnilever\u2019s motive for removing Mr. Stever is his commitment to Ben & Jerry\u2019s Social Mission and Essential Brand Integrity \u2026 rather than any genuine concerns regarding his performance history,\u201d the filing said.\n\nPrior to Stever\u2019s ouster, Unilever had \u201crepeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry\u2019s personnel, including CEO David Stever\u201d over their resistance to the company\u2019s \u201cattempts to silence the Social Mission,\u201d according to the amended complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York.\n\nSince its acquisition by Unilever in 2000, the iconic Vermont ice cream maker has publicly championed progressive causes \u2014 such as the Black Lives Matter movement and Palestinian rights \u2014 under the oversight of an independent board, which was established during the merger for the purpose of pursuing the brand\u2019s \u201cSocial Mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor 25 years under Unilever\u2019s ownership, this unique governance structure has been key to Ben & Jerry\u2019s success,\u201d Anuradha Mittal, chair of Ben & Jerry\u2019s board, said in a written statement. \u201cBut today, that structure \u2014 and the values it protects \u2014 is under direct attack. Unilever has repeatedly interfered with the Independent Board\u2019s authority, attempting to silence Ben & Jerry\u2019s advocacy, and even threaten the Board\u2019s dissolution.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Unilever has appointed a new CEO or whether Stever, who has been with the brand since 1987 and was appointed as its chief executive in May 2023, has continued to work for Ben & Jerry\u2019s in a different capacity since his ouster.\n\nMittal declined to comment on Stever\u2019s employment status, citing the ongoing litigation, but in the statement said, \u201cThe Board remains steadfast in our support for Dave. We believe he is uniquely qualified to lead Ben & Jerry\u2019s at this pivotal time.\u201d\n\nThe allegations are the latest in a long line of legal complaints that Ben & Jerry\u2019s has filed over what it claims are attempts by Unilever to suppress the brand\u2019s progressive values, especially its expressions of support for Palestinians.\n\nIn November, Ben & Jerry\u2019s launched an initial lawsuit against Unilever in U.S. District Court in New York, accusing the packaged-goods conglomerate of muzzling its attempts to issue public statements in support of Palestinian rights, including calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. The brand also claimed Unilever had blocked donations from the ice cream maker to activist organizations like Jewish Voices for Peace.\n\nIn January, Ben & Jerry\u2019s further alleged Unilever had \u201cunilaterally barred\u201d the brand from making a social media post on the day of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration that would have criticized the president, providing \u201cno evidence whatsoever\u201d for the decision.\n\nIn the latest complaint, lawyers for Ben & Jerry\u2019s wrote that Unilever\u2019s ongoing attempt to stymie the brand\u2019s political expression \u201chas reached startling new levels of oppressiveness\u201d since its previous court filings.\n\nAmong other recent instances of muzzling cited in the complaint, Unilever prevented Ben & Jerry\u2019s from posting on social media in honor of Black History Month, the filing said.\n\nThe conglomerate also prevented the brand from posting in support of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian student activist who was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week. The post in its entirety was included in the lawsuit:\n\n\u201cProtect the First Amendment! Free speech and peaceful protests are the lifeblood of our democracy, and student activists have always been at the center of the fight for justice. Political speech is protected by our constitution and peaceful civil disobedience should never be the basis for deportation. Protect your right to dissent and take action with the @ACLU,\u201d the post said, according to the filing. It also contained a link to an ACLU petition calling for Khalil\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cOnce again, Unilever provided no explanation for the censorship,\u201d the filing said.\n\nThe legal feud comes as Unilever has been trying to spin off Ben & Jerry\u2019s and its other ice cream brands, which it previously said it would do by the end of 2025.\n\nBloomberg reported last month Ben & Jerry\u2019s founders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfeld, were in talks to reacquire the brand from the conglomerate.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the Board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public,\u201d a Unilever spokesperson said in a statement to VtDigger. \u201cWe hope that the B&J Independent Board will engage as per the original, agreed process.\u201d",

            "content": "Ben & Jerry\u2019s Alleges Unilever Fired CEO Over Activism Disputes The Vermont ice cream brand claims its parent company suppressed its progressive social mission, escalating tensions in a continuing legal battle.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s, the iconic Vermont-based ice cream brand, has hurled serious allegations at its parent company, Unilever, claiming it unlawfully fired CEO David Stever over disputes regarding its progressive activism. The legal complaint, filed on March 18, 2025, in the Southern District of New York, asserts that Unilever's motives for Stever's dismissal stem from his commitment to the company\u2019s social mission, particularly concerning issues like human rights and support for Palestinian rights.\n\nFounded in 1978 by childhood friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, Ben & Jerry\u2019s has a long-standing reputation for championing progressive causes alongside its offbeat flavors. However, tensions have escalated between the ice cream maker and its corporate parent since Unilever acquired the company in 2000. A merger agreement established an independent board to oversee Ben & Jerry\u2019s adherence to its social values\u2014values that now seem to conflict with Unilever\u2019s corporate strategy.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, Unilever informed Ben & Jerry\u2019s that Stever was being replaced, claiming that the decision was made without proper consultation with the independent board, thus breaching the merger agreement. According to Ben & Jerry\u2019s filings, the removal represents an effort by Unilever to silence the brand\u2019s advocacy. The company has accused Unilever of not only firing Stever but also of attempting to suppress its ability to engage on sensitive social issues, including both social media expressions and support for various activist causes.\n\nIn their complaint, Ben & Jerry\u2019s stated, \u201cUnilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry\u2019s personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever\u2019s efforts to silence the Social Mission.\u201d The ice cream brand\u2019s board chair, Anuradha Mittal, emphasized that Stever\u2019s commitment to the brand and its values should have shielded him from such corporate maneuverings.\n\nIn the wake of Stever\u2019s departure, Ben & Jerry\u2019s co-founders publicly expressed their support for him, arguing that his leadership was crucial for the brand\u2019s future. Cohen and Greenfield stated, \u201cDave has been a tireless champion of this company and its progressive values. We believe there\u2019s no one better to lead Ben & Jerry\u2019s at this moment in its history.\u201d\n\nThis latest conflict is not isolated but part of a broader trend among corporations facing pressure to align their public stances with shareholder interests. As political landscapes shift, many companies, including Disney, Walmart, and Meta, have begun retreating from diversity and inclusion initiatives in the face of consumer and political pushback. Critics argue that businesses should prioritize their fiduciary responsibilities over political posturing, a sentiment echoed by Ben & Jerry's critics who felt its position on Israeli policies was damaging to brand integrity.\n\nOn a corporate level, Unilever is reportedly preparing to spin off its ice cream division, a move that would effectively separate Ben & Jerry\u2019s from the conglomerate. Some industry analysts see this as an acknowledgment that the partnership may have become untenable due to the contentious nature of the brand\u2019s advocacy. The maneuver suggests that Unilever could prefer to disengage from the complications associated with the vocal social mission of Ben & Jerry's.\n\nDespite Unilever's efforts to quell the brand's activism, including maintaining control over its social media presence, Ben & Jerry\u2019s has continued to stand firm. The complaint alleges that Unilever blocked various public statements, including one regarding a ceasefire amid ongoing conflicts in Gaza, which emerged significantly heated following notable events in October 2023. The ice cream brand also claimed it faced obstacles when attempting to express solidarity with detained pro-Palestinian activists.\n\nAs the legal battle unfolds, the focus remains on how much corporate governance can appropriately intervene in a company\u2019s ethical stances or social mission. One key aspect of the merger agreement emphasized the importance of respect for Ben & Jerry\u2019s independent board designed to uphold its social accountability. After Stever's firing, Murphy Twin, spokesperson for Unilever, characterized the decision as compliant with corporate rights while asserting that the company values Ben & Jerry\u2019s commitment to social causes but must balance that with strategic corporate initiatives.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s contention that it has been silenced feeds into a much larger narrative about corporate complicity in political schisms and the potential risks they pose in terms of market viability. As these tensions continue to make headlines, they raise critical questions about the intersection of business, ethics, and activism. Can companies navigate their economic interests while being tied to social responsibilities? And how might that tension reshape corporate America moving forward?\n\nThe case has garnered significant public and media attention, and it reflects a growing divide within American corporate culture. As consumer sentiment evolves, companies like Ben & Jerry\u2019s might find that a robust engagement with social issues is no longer just a point of brand differentiation but essential to the identity of their customer base. Whether Unilever\u2019s attempts to re-align Ben & Jerry\u2019s with more centrist views will succeed in light of the brand's passionate following remains to be seen.\n\nAs the saga continues, the implications for both organizations\u2014and the consumers caught in the crossfire\u2014could lead to longer-term shifts in how corporate America interfaces with social activism. The coming weeks will likely see heated discussions surrounding freedom of expression, corporate responsibility, and the influence of shareholder interests.",

Credit - Mike Kemp\u2014In Pictures/Getty Images\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s has accused its parent company Unilever of removing its CEO because of his support of the company\u2019s political activism, according to a late Tuesday federal court filing.\n\nThe ice cream company, known for its liberal and pro-Palestinian stances, claimed that Unilever informed the Board on March 3 that it planned to remove and replace chief executive David Stever without the approval of the advisory board. The act, Ben & Jerry\u2019s claims, goes against the acquisition deal signed in 2000.\n\n\u201cUnilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the social mission,\" the court filing said. Ben & Jerry\u2019s did not respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe ice cream company first filed a lawsuit against Unilever in November related to Unilever\u2019s alleged censorship of their political values.\n\n\u201cIn line with the terms of the acquisition agreement, decisions on the appointment, compensation and removal of the Ben & Jerry's CEO will be made by Unilever after good faith consultation and discussion with the B&J's Independent Board,\u201d Unilever told TIME in an emailed statement. \u201cRegrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the Board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public. We hope that the B&J Independent Board will engage as per the original, agreed process.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what to know.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s has a history of political activism\n\nSince the company\u2019s start in 1978, Ben & Jerry\u2019s has been a staunch advocate for social justice initiatives, standing in favor of LGBTQ+ rights, fair trade practices, and against racism. One of the company\u2019s first forays into political activism came when the company issued a statement in 1989 against recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), due to its potential impact on family farming and \u201cpublic confidence in the wholesomeness of dairy products,\u201d the ice cream company says in its about page.\n\nThe ice cream giant has also participated in different campaigns, advocating for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, campaign finance reform policies, and Black Lives Matter.\n\nStill, the brand has continuously called itself nonpartisan. \u201cWe don\u2019t support candidates or political parties nor do we make contributions to candidates, parties, or super PACS, and we never have. It is clear to us that elected representatives in government are supposed to represent people, not corporations,\u201d their website reads.\n\nHow we got here\n\nIn 2000, Ben & Jerry's became a subsidiary of Unilever, which owns other well-known ice cream companies such as Wall\u2019s and Magnum. Under the acquisition, the food company maintains an independent board of directors with the intention of maintaining their own product quality and social mission.\n\nWhile Ben & Jerry\u2019s has made headlines for their support of Palestinians following the start of the Israel-Hamas War, the brand had already expressed such beliefs. In 2021, the company announced in a statement that it would no longer sell ice cream in \u201coccupied Palestinian territory,\u201d Doing so, they said, would be inconsistent with their values.\n\n\u201cWe have a longstanding partnership with our licensee, who manufactures Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream in Israel and distributes it in the region. We have been working to change this, and so we have informed our licensee that we will not renew the license agreement when it expires at the end of next year,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cAlthough Ben & Jerry\u2019s will no longer be sold in the OPT, we will stay in Israel through a different arrangement. We will share an update on this as soon as we\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nThe decision to release a statement that mentioned continued sales of the product in Israel went against the board\u2019s wishes, NBC News previously reported. \u201cI am saddened by the deceit of it,\u201d Anuradha Mittal, chair of the company\u2019s independent board, told NBC. \"This is not about Israel. It is about the violation of the acquisition agreement that maintained the soul of the company. I can't stop thinking that this is what happens when you have a board with all women and people of color who have been pushing to do the right thing.\"\n\nIn November 2024, Ben & Jerry\u2019s filed a lawsuit against Unilever due to their alleged threats of censorship. The initial complaint alleges that Unilever tried to dismantle the board and prevent it from calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, or the end of U.S. military assistance to Israel. More recently, the amended complaint claims that Unilever refused to allow Ben & Jerry\u2019s to post their support for Mahmoud Khalil, the green card holder and pro-Palestinian activist who is currently being detained by ICE.\n\nUnilever has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, saying that it does not want to appear to \u201cbe taking sides on the Gaza conflict and/or associating itself with organizations that supported Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel and its abduction of hundreds of hostages and made highly divisive comments about Israel.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIt is unclear what effect the ongoing lawsuit will have on the company, but Unilever announced in May 2024 that it would be spinning off its ice cream businesses by the end of 2025.\n\nA court date for a hearing about the complaint has not yet been set.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",

We\u2019re not talking about feelings now, but about our favourite ice creams, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, a company that was more than just an ice cream shop. It had a sense of justice, social commitment, and community belonging. Every spoonful of its ice cream was worth it precisely because of that, but lately, something has broken. And unfortunately, it\u2019s not just about this company.\n\nThe world is becoming increasingly aggressive and individualistic, and where respect, logic, and common sense once reigned, there are now only remnants and gaps being filled with hate. What once tasted like revolution and chocolate now leaves only a bitter aftertaste.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAlarms have gone off in the community, as CEO Dave Stever has been fired for openly defending the identity of a company that had been well-defined for over 40 years.\n\nWhy was Stever fired?\n\nUnilever, the parent company of this ice cream brand since the 2000s, revealed that it fired Stever without even consulting the board that oversees the brand. The one and only, and paradoxical, reason: his commitment to the company\u2019s social mission.\n\nApparently, Unilever had repeatedly criticized Stever for \u201ccontinually engaging\u201d in Ben & Jerry\u2019s social initiatives, such as celebrating Black History Month.\n\nThe radicalization of society has unfortunately reached every level, and Stever has faced significant censorship for expressing support for Palestine or even celebrating the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal resident and activist for Palestine at Columbia University. Stever has even reported being told not to criticize Donald Trump publicly.\n\nActivism that makes people uncomfortable\n\nSince Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield founded the company, it hasn\u2019t been just a brand of ice cream, it\u2019s been a political platform that has aimed to fight against climate change and for social and racial justice, among many other causes pursued over the years. This spirit was somewhat diminished when Unilever acquired the company in the 2000s, but one condition remained very clear: that social mission had to be protected.\n\nNow, however, it seems that Unilever wants to change course and dismantle the social activism that has been present for so many years and which many consider to be the soul of the brand.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind this clash?\n\nThis isn\u2019t an isolated incident. In the current context, many companies are rethinking their social policies under pressure from conservative sectors and growing political radicalization. Since 2021, Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Unilever have had disagreements, especially after the brand\u2019s decision to halt sales in Israeli-occupied territories, a stance that generated major controversy but was also proudly applauded by many others.\n\nSince then, tensions have risen. This dismissal seems to be the last straw and has reignited the debate over how much real power brands have to defend their values within large corporate conglomerates.\n\nSetting a (bad) precedent?\n\nThis case doesn\u2019t only affect Ben & Jerry\u2019s, it could have significant implications for other brands that have built their image around activism and social impact. Can they continue doing so in an environment increasingly controlled by global parent companies that prioritize neutrality? It also highlights the issue of freedom of speech within the corporate world. If a CEO can be fired for defending social causes that are part of the brand\u2019s DNA, then where does that leave corporations\u2019 real commitment to their values?\n\nWhat\u2019s clear from all this is that the landscape is getting very ugly, and in a world where social rights are under threat, collective struggle, activism, and consistency must be our priority.\n\n\u201cCommit yourself to the noble struggle for human rights. You will make a better person of yourself, a greater nation of your country, and a better world to live in.\u201d \u2014 Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights activist.",

The deal is expected to be finalised by the third quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and consultation processes.\n\nUnilever, which acquired The Vegetarian Butcher in 2018, is selling the business as part of its ongoing portfolio restructuring under its Growth Action Plan 2030 (GAP2030). The company aims to divest brands worth approximately \u00a31 billion in annual sales to focus on its 30 core brands, including Hellmann\u2019s, Dove, and Knorr. Investment bank Piper Sandler is handling the transaction.\n\nThe Vegetarian Butcher operates in 55 countries and supplies products to over 40,000 retail locations, including partnerships with fast-food chains like Burger King and Subway. Despite Unilever\u2019s investment in marketing and reported double-digit growth, the brand remains unprofitable, generating around \u20ac50 million in annual sales. Unilever cited the brand\u2019s distinct supply chain and technological requirements as factors that made it less scalable within its broader operations.\n\nVivera, founded in 1990 and one of Europe\u2019s largest plant-based meat companies, was acquired by JBS in 2021. The company\u2019s CEO, Willem van Weede, stated that the acquisition of The Vegetarian Butcher would strengthen its ability to drive the shift toward plant-based protein.\n\nThe sale is part of a broader restructuring at Unilever, which is also spinning off its ice cream division\u2014including brands like Magnum and Ben & Jerry\u2019s\u2014and exploring divestments of several Dutch food brands. The company has revised its ESG commitments while reporting a 1.9% revenue increase to \u20ac60.8 billion in 2024.\n\nThe deal reflects a wider trend of consolidation in the plant-based food sector, which has seen multiple acquisitions in the past year amid declining investment and slowing sales.",

Meat substitutes have lost Unilever\u2019s attention, as they are facing increasing competition and declining consumer interest.\n\nNew owner Vivera says it will form a powerful combination with The Vegetarian Butcher, which has an extensive product portfolio in the retail channel and is also big in food service and at quick service restaurants. On the other hand, Vivera has a strong market position in the retail channel, with a wide range of products under the Vivera brand and various private labels.\n\nVivera started producing meat substitutes in 1990 and was acquired by Brazilian meat processor JBS in 2021. Today, the products are available in more than 32,000 supermarkets in 25 European countries. The Vegetarian Butcher was founded in 2010 and grew into a global brand available in 55 countries after its acquisition by Unilever in 2018.",

Earlier this month, the company\u2019s new Chief Executive, Fernando Fernandez, stated that he would accelerate the pace of disposals of smaller regional food brands after his predecessor Hein Schumacher said last year that he was looking to prune products from its portfolio that made up around \u20ac1bn of group revenues.\n\nThe plant-based food category has experienced a significant slowdown in the last couple of years, with other major manufacturers pulling brands from the market.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Unilever noted that The Vegetarian Butcher\u2019s chilled and frozen products required \u201ca distinct supply chain and sourcing model\u201d, which made the brand \u201cless scalable\u201d within its broader foods portfolio, which includes the likes of Knorr, Hellmann\u2019s, and Marmite.\n\nIt went on to say: \u201cThe unique set of technological and R&D capabilities that drive the remarkable innovations of The Vegetarian Butcher differs significantly from the requirements of the wider Unilever portfolio.

The creative, impactful communication campaigns have fostered genuine love for the brand among consumers. These efforts have not only driven the success of the brand but also reinforced Unilever\u2019s commitment to plant-based foods and breakthrough innovation.\n\n\u201cI believe that The Vegetarian Butcher is poised for even greater success in the next phase of its journey under new ownership that is dedicated to plant-based meat replacements. This focused expertise will support the brand in its ambitious goal to become the Biggest Butcher of the World.\u201d\n\nVivera is a leading maker of vegan food and has been owned by meat processing giant JBS since 2021.

            "content": "Ben & Jerry's alleges its CEO was fired over its political activism. Here's the scoop\n\ntoggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nBen & Jerry's is accusing parent company Unilever of ousting its CEO in retaliation for its social media activism, the latest escalation in a long-running battle over the ice cream maker's independence.\n\nThe Vermont-based company and five directors of its independent board originally sued Unilever and its U.S. subsidiary, Conopco, in federal court in November 2024, alleging the companies had silenced its attempts to show public support for Palestinian refugees, among other causes.\n\nBen & Jerry's said those actions violate its 2000 merger agreement, which created the independent board and gave it \"primary responsibility for Social Mission Priorities and the Essential Integrity of the Brand.\" The company has a well-documented history of outspoken advocacy, supporting causes from racial and climate justice to campaign finance reform through what it calls its \"progressive, nonpartisan social mission.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn an amended complaint filed in the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, Ben & Jerry's accused Unilever of continuing to censor its social media posts \u2014 including about Black History Month and free speech \u2014 and waging a \"campaign of professional reprisals\" culminating in the abrupt removal of its CEO.\n\n\"Contrary to their obligations under Section 6.14, Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the Social Mission,\" it reads. \"This month \u2026 Unilever followed through with their threats.\"\n\nBen & Jerry's said Unilever executives announced Stever's removal on March 3, for reasons unrelated to his job performance and without following the steps outlined in the merger agreement.\n\nA spokesperson for Unilever told NPR in a statement that \"decisions on the appointment, compensation and removal of the Ben & Jerry's CEO will be made by Unilever after good faith consultation and discussion with the B&J's Independent Board,\" in line with the merger agreement.\n\n\"Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the Board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public,\" the company added. \"We hope that the B&J Independent Board will engage as per the original, agreed process.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBen & Jerry's says Unilever ignored the merger agreement's stipulation that it consult with an advisory committee from the board before making any decisions about the removal of a CEO.\n\n\"Unilever announced their decision before the committee had even been appointed and attempted to force the Independent Board into rubberstamping the decision by unilaterally dictating artificial and hasty deadlines,\" it wrote, accusing Unilever of giving the board only four days to respond and refusing its request for access to materials.\n\nStever was named CEO in May 2023, more than three decades after joining the company as a tour guide. Ben and Jerry's says that under his tenure, it \"outperformed Unilever's ice cream portfolio\" and was ranked #2 on the Brand 500 Authenticity Index two years in a row.\n\nEven so, the lawsuit alleges that Unilever executives chastised Stever in his January 2025 performance review for \"repeatedly acquiesce[ing] to the demands of the Independent Social Mission Board\" by permitting certain social media posts.\n\n\"On information and belief, Unilever's motive for removing Mr. Stever is his commitment to Ben & Jerry's Social Mission and Essential Brand Integrity and his willingness to collaborate in good faith with the Independent Board, rather than any genuine concerns regarding his performance history,\" the complaint reads.\n\nIn response, Unilever has filed a motion to dismiss Ben and Jerry's complaint, saying its claims are without merit because independent board members do not have the right to bring lawsuits on behalf of the company and also did not specify the damages that resulted from Unilever's alleged actions.\n\nIt says the current dispute is the \"direct result\" of the board's decision to opine on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \"without any regard to the negative impact\" on both companies.\n\n\"Unilever continues to support B&J's and its social advocacy work,\" it wrote in its response. \"Over time, the social mission of B&J's shifted, but in recent years it has come to a head as B&J's seeks to advocate for one-sided, highly controversial, and polarizing topics that put Unilever, B&J's, and their employees at risk.\"\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen did the feud begin?\n\nThe last few years have been a rocky road for Ben & Jerry's and Unilever.\n\nIn 2021, Ben & Jerry's announced it would stop selling its ice cream in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, calling that practice \"inconsistent with our values.\"\n\nThat decision prompted multiple lawsuits in the U.S. and Israel, accusations of antisemitism and the divestment of \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" in Unilever's stock, Unilever said in its Wednesday court filing.\n\nUnilever said in this week's legal filing that it continues to suffer the consequences of Ben & Jerry's decision \"to this day,\" saying it remains on anti-boycott lists in at least nine states and is under a fatwah in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2022, Unilever sold its intellectual property rights to its Israeli distributor, which then put the products (with Hebrew and Arabic labeling only) back on shelves in the West Bank.\n\nBen & Jerry's then sued Unilever, accusing it of bypassing its board with business decisions. The 2022 lawsuit ended with a settlement, about which details have been scarce \u2014 until Ben & Jerry's filed its November 2024 lawsuit.\n\nThat lawsuit says the 2022 settlement agreement requires Unilever to \"[r]espect and acknowledge the Ben & Jerry's Independent Board's primary responsibility over Ben & Jerry's Social Mission and Essential Brand Integrity\" and \"work in good faith with the Independent Board to ensure that both are protected and furthered.\"\n\nAnd it accuses Unilever of failing to do so in the years since, citing \"various threats, reprisals, and censorship.\"\n\n\n\nWhat are the social media posts at issue?\n\nBen & Jerry's alleges that Unilever has silenced its social media activism in direct violation of the settlement on multiple occasions.\n\nIt says Unilever blocked four posts \"in support of peace and human rights\" about the Israel-Hamas war and ensuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza in the span of six months.\n\nThe first example was a post calling for peace and a permanent ceasefire in December 2023.\n\n\"Unilever threatened to dismantle the Independent Board and sue the board members individually if Ben & Jerry's \u2014 with its decades-long motto of 'peace, love, & ice cream' \u2014issued the statement supporting 'peace' and a 'ceasefire,'\" the lawsuit says.\n\nIt says Unilever also stopped Ben & Jerry's social media managers from posting in support of Palestinian refugees in May 2024. The lawsuit says Unilever executives took issue with the statement because it \"coincided with the Iranian missile attack on Israel.\"\n\n\"When the matter was escalated to me, I expressed concerns about the continued perception of antisemitism that is a persistent issue,\" Peter ter Kelve, Unilever's president of ice cream, wrote to the board, according to its lawsuit. \"It was my judgment that in light of the timing and nature of the post, it was not an appropriate message at this time.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnother example, Ben & Jerry's says, was a blocked post supporting campus protesters' First Amendment rights in June 2024. Unilever said in its legal filing that it had \"raised reasonable concerns about the need to condemn the violence associated with the protests and support rights of Jewish students as well.\"\n\nBen & Jerry's lawsuit accuses Unilever of censoring posts on other topics, including one for Inauguration Day that \"identified several social issues Ben & Jerry's believed would be challenged\" under President Trump, including minimum wage, universal healthcare, abortion and climate change. The company alleges that Unilever blocked it, after weeks of work, because it mentioned Trump by name.\n\nIt says in recent weeks, Unilever prevented it from issuing a post commemorating Black History Month, and another supporting free speech and linking to a petition for the release of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate detained by U.S. immigration authorities over his role in pro-Palestinian campus protests.\n\nUnilever has denied \"muzzling\" the board, writing in its motion that members \"have hardly been silent.\"\n\nIt listed instances in which board members released statements \u2014 such as calling for a ceasefire and supporting campus protesters \u2014 to media outlets, including Reuters and the Financial Times, and on their personal social media accounts.\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBen & Jerry's also accuses Unilever of blocking its donations to two organizations, Jewish Voice for Peace and the Council on American Islamic Relations.\n\nUnilever says it \"exercised its right to withhold consent to donate\" after researching the organizations and finding that they had \"made inflammatory comments\" about Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nBen & Jerry's is asking the court to order Unilever to release funds to those organizations, in addition to unspecified damages.\n\nIt also asks the court to order Unilever to \"prospectively respect and acknowledge\" the independent board's authority and comply with the merger agreement's rules around appointing and removing a CEO.\n\nIt also hopes the court will ensure that \"any restructuring of Ben & Jerry's or its parents does not eliminate or diminish the authority\" of the board. That restructuring is not hypothetical.\n\nUnilever announced last May that it would separate its ice cream unit \u2014 including Ben & Jerry's \u2014 into a separate business as part of a restructuring expected to be completed by the end of 2025.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBen & Jerry's lawsuit says Unilever told the board on March 5 that the restructuring was \"imminent.\"",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nUnilever is selling The Vegetarian Butcher , a plant-based offering, to Vivera for an undisclosed amount. Vivera, a plant-based food brand sold in Europe, is owned by meat processing company JBS.\n\nThe sale comes as Unilever sharpens its portfolio to focus on long-term growth and scalability by prioritizing fewer, bigger brands such as Knorr and Hellmann\u2019s.\n\nUnilever also is on track to spin off its ice cream business, which includes Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Talenti , in 2025.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nUnilever purchased The Vegetarian Butcher in 2018 from founder Jaap Korteweg. During that time, it averaged double-digit growth and expanded to more than 55 markets around the world.\n\nDespite its success, Unilever is focusing on shrinking its portfolio under new CEO Fernando Fernandez, a 37-year veteran of the company. Unilever unexpectedly ousted its prior CEO last month amid concerns the company wasn\u2019t moving fast enough in its turnaround efforts.\n\nUnilever said The Vegetarian Butcher doesn\u2019t fit at the food and personal care products company for two reasons. First, it has a distinct supply chain and sourcing model that makes it less scalable within the company\u2019s broader food portfolio. Second, The Vegetarian Butcher also has a \u201cunique set of technological and R&D capabilities\u201d that differ from the rest of Unilever\u2019s products.\n\n\u201cThis divergence makes a sale of the brand the best option for both Unilever and The Vegetarian Butcher,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nFor a company trying to do more with less, divesting a brand that doesn\u2019t generate a lot of synergies with the rest of its portfolio is a logical place to start. The company can not only devote more of its finite resources to its higher-profile, faster-growing brands, but it can also use the money it receives from the sale to pay down debt or invest in other parts of its operations.\n\nThe sale, which is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, occurs as the plant-based food space has seen its star dim, especially in the U.S.\n\nConsumer demand for the products is slowing, forcing manufacturers to cut spending, pull back on product development and lay off employees. Beyond Meat announced last month it was cutting 6% of its workforce and suspending operations in China.",

The deal is subject to the usual closing conditions, regulatory requirements, and consultation processes, and expected to be completed by Q3 this year.\n\nUnilever, which bought The Vegetarian Butcher in 2018, said the brand no longer aligned with the requirements of its wider portfolio, and the divergence made a sale the best option. It enlisted Piper Sandler to handle the transaction.\n\nThe wider picture, though, is that this is part of the CPG giant\u2019s Growth Action Plan 2030 (GAP2030). It intends to clear out brands collectively worth around \u00a31B in annual sales, sharpening its focus on its 30 \u2018power brands\u2019 \u2013 like Hellmann\u2019s, Dove, Knorr, and Surf \u2013 which represent over three-quarters of its turnover.\n\n\u201cI believe that The Vegetarian Butcher is poised for even greater success in the next phase of its journey under new ownership that is dedicated to plant-based meat replacements,\u201d said Unilever Foods president Heiko Schipper. \u201cThis focused expertise will support the brand in its ambitious goal to become the \u2018Biggest Butcher of the World\u2019.\u201d\n\nUnique supply chain and tech needs necessitated sale\n\nCourtesy: The Vegetarian Butcher\n\nOne of the world\u2019s leading plant-based meat makers, The Vegetarian Butcher was established in 2007 by Jaap Korteweg \u2013 a ninth-generation livestock farmer \u2013 and politician Niko Koffeman. In 2016, it co-produced a line of vegetarian meatballs with Unilever under the Unox soup brand, and was purchased by the CPG behemoth two years later as it looked to capitalise on the boom in meat-free eating.\n\nThe Vegetarian Butcher\u2019s products are available in 55 countries and over 40,000 retail locations, as well as restaurants and chains like Burger King and Subway. According to Unilever \u2013 which spent over \u00a38M on a marketing push for the brand in 2019 \u2013 the plant-based meat maker has delivered \u201cstrong double-digit growth on average\u201d since the acquisition, although Reuters reported that it only records around \u20ac50M in annual sales and is loss-making.\n\nThe Vegetarian Butcher\u2019s chilled and frozen products require a \u201cdistinct supply chain and sourcing model\u201d, which made it \u201cless scalable\u201d within Unilever\u2019s broader portfolio, the group said. It added that the plant-based business\u2019s innovations were driven by a \u201cunique set of technological and R&D capabilities\u201d that differed significantly from the needs of its broader product range.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited for The Vegetarian Butcher to be joining forces with Vivera, as it will bring the opportunity to combine our strengths and deliver even greater value to our partners and our consumers,\u201d said The Vegetarian Butcher CEO Rutger Rozendaal.\n\nCourtesy: Vivera\n\nVivera is one of Europe\u2019s oldest and largest vegan meat producers, having been around since 1990. It was initially part of the Enkco Foodgroup, whose flagship brand was a namesake meat maker. But the group sold the Enkco business to focus solely on the plant-based enterprise in 2017, paving the way for strong growth. This led JBS to acquire Vivera in 2021.\n\nToday, Vivera\u2019s products are available in over 27,000 supermarket stores across 25 European countries. Its retail and private-label portfolio and in-house technologies are \u201ccomplementary\u201d to The Vegetarian Butcher, the firm said.\n\n\u201cWe join forces to create a great purpose-driven company with many talented and highly motivated people. Acceleration of the protein transition is more important than ever and we look forward to inspiring more people to eat more plant-based,\u201d said Vivera CEO Willem van Weede.\n\nThe Vegetarian Butcher eyes success as Unilever shakeup continues\n\nCourtesy: The Vegetarian Butcher\n\nChange has been fast afoot at Unilever in recent months. The group has of late begun demerging its ice cream units in India and Indonesia, and will list global brands like Magnum and Ben & Jerry\u2019s on public markets this year. The latter is in a spat with its parent company over the ouster of CEO David Stever last month, with Unilever accused of removing the executive over his political activism.\n\nThe CPG company is also looking to sell a number of its Dutch food brands, including Unox and Conimex. Speculation about the future of brands like Colman\u2019s, Marmite, and Pot Noodle has been rampant since the departure of CEO Hein Schumacher, who only took over in July 2023 and masterminded the GAP2030 strategy focused on \u201cdoing fewer things, better and with greater impact\u201d.\n\nSchumacher, who has been replaced by CFO Fernando Fernandez, said the board was keen to \u201cstep up the pace of our strategy execution and realise swift value creation underscored by a change in leadership\u201d.\n\nUnilever has additionally scaled back a number of its key climate goals, a break from its reputation as one of the world\u2019s ESG leaders. The company recorded a 1.9% hike in turnover in 2024, reaching \u20ac60.8B. Its power brands led the way with sales growth of 5.3%. Meanwhile, the group\u2019s food business made up 22% of its 2024 revenue. At \u20ac13.4B, this was second only to the personal care segment.\n\n\u201cMarket growth, which slowed throughout 2024, is expected to remain soft in the first half of 2025,\u201d Schumacher said last month. \u201cThe steps we have taken in 2024, including the launch of our refreshed GAP2030 strategy, further reinvestment in our brands and strong innovation pipelines leave us better positioned to deliver on our ambitions in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nCourtesy: The Vegetarian Butcher\n\nThere had been scepticism about Unilever\u2019s ability to find buyers for The Vegetarian Butcher at the right price, and some had (correctly) suggested it could appeal to trade buyers like meat producers looking to diversify into plant-based alternatives.\n\n\u201cThis marks a significant step towards becoming one of the largest and most influential companies in the plant-based industry, making us uniquely positioned towards further accelerating the global shift to tasty and healthy plant-based solutions,\u201d said Rozendaal.\n\nThe deal comes amid a downturn in investment in plant-based food (by 75% in 2024) and faltering sales, resulting in a number of mergers and acquisitions in the past year, including Ahimsa Companies\u2019s takeover of Wicked Kitchen, Simulate, and Blackbird Foods, the separate deals for ready meal brand Allplants by Deliciously Ella\u2019s founders and Grubby, and Misha\u2019s Inc\u2019s purchase of vegan cheese producer Vertage, among others.",

            "content": "One of America\u2019s most popular ice cream brands found itself in the news for a not-so-sweet reason earlier this week. According to a report from ABC News, a court filing from Ben & Jerry\u2019s with the Southern District of New York alleged that parent company Unilever removed CEO Dave Stever for his liberal political stances without consulting the brand\u2019s independent board.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while it\u2019s a subsidiary of Unilever, Ben & Jerry\u2019s maintains its own board and is well-known for lending vocal support to social justice causes dating back decades.\n\n\u201cUnilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry\u2019s personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever\u2019s efforts to silence the Social Mission,\u201d the filing reads in part.\n\nUnilever responded to the filing with a statement, attributing it to an unspecified spokesperson.\n\nIn line with the terms of the acquisition agreement, decisions on the appointment, compensation and removal of the Ben & Jerry\u2019s CEO will be made by Unilever after good faith consultation and discussion with the B&J\u2019s Independent Board. Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the Board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public. We hope that the B&J Independent Board will engage as per the original, agreed process.\n\nErika Schneider, an assistant professor of public relations at Syracuse University, described the Unilever-Ben & Jerry\u2019s turmoil as a potentially defining moment in the relationship between \u201ccorporate governance and the autonomy of socially conscious brands within larger corporate structures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe approach is defensive and stresses confidentiality, but right now, consumers want transparency,\u201d said Schneider, who specializes in crisis communications. \u201cYes, confidentiality is important, but it is ineffective to deflect the question of whether this is an attempt to suppress Ben & Jerry\u2019s engagement in political discourse.\u201d\n\nThe external pressure to maintain brand loyalty amid political pressure\n\nSchneider noted that the statement from Unilever seems to \u201cpoint fingers but perhaps understandably evades the question people want to know about,\u201d namely if the company silenced the brand for its political stances.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s their core brand identity,\u201d Schneider said, pointing to an \u201cIssues We Care About\u201d section on the Ben & Jerry\u2019s website under an \u201cActivism\u201d pull-down tab. \u201cWhen you buy Ben & Jerry\u2019s, you\u2019re not just buying ice cream; you\u2019re supporting Fair Trade, sustainability and a company that stands for social justice,\u201d the web copy reads.\n\nA perhaps coincidentally timed Instagram post on Wednesday, co-authored by the ACLU, calls for people to contact their representatives to vote \u201cno\u201d on the SAVE Act to \u201cprotect voting access,\u201d has drawn thousands of likes and comments.\n\n\u201cWe need to flood Unilever with emails now that they fired your CEO for no reason,\u201d one comment reads.\n\nThe timing of the CEO\u2019s removal is interesting given Unilever\u2019s well-known plans to spin off Unilever ice cream brands into a separate company, said Anne Marie Squeo, founder and CEO of Proof Point Communications. Having the brand go silent on social issues also risks alienating Ben & Jerry\u2019s longtime customers.\n\nBut it\u2019s also understandable why Unilever would want to tame that social action given the growing tension between corporate values and political scrutiny, Squeo said.\n\nSqueo, a former CCO at Xerox, called Unilever\u2019s acquisition of Ben & Jerry\u2019s a cautionary tale, emphasizing the importance of aligning company cultures during mergers.\n\nUnilever, more of a buttoned-up company, knew what it was getting when it acquired its politically charged ice cream brand in 2000. Squeo noted that the SEC filing for the merger mentioned the word \u201csocial\u201d 107 times. That number includes dozens of mentions of the Vermont company\u2019s longstanding social mission and its commitments to social investments, as well as Unilever\u2019s contractual agreement to increase \u201csocially beneficial activities as a percentage of sales\u2013every year. Ben and Jerry\u2019s will be doing more good than it does today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was pretty clear from the outset that Ben & Jerry\u2019s was never going to be controlled, but the environment back then made it seem OK,\u201d Squeo said. \u201cTwenty-five years ago, they felt that would be fine, but it\u2019s not fine anymore.\u201d\n\nThe internal communications ripple effects\n\nWhile much of the focus on the battle between Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Unilever has been in the public forum, there are also key factors to consider about the effects on internal comms. For example, Stever\u2019s ouster challenges the status quo of Ben & Jerry\u2019s organizational culture. Removing him stands to erode Unilever\u2019s standing with employees as the parent of Ben & Jerry\u2019s.\n\nMontieth Illingworth, CEO of Montieth and Company, told Ragan that C-suite leaders are often reflections of a company\u2019s mission and values.\n\n\u201cIf the CEO doesn\u2019t or can\u2019t express the established values, employees may wonder \u2018Are we just fair-weather friends?\u2019\u201d Illingworth said.\n\nThis also stands to affect employer reputation. Illingworth said that employees at companies like Ben & Jerry\u2019s may view commitments to social issues as lip service if leaders who embody these values are removed. In many instances, companies that maintain social stances like Ben & Jerry\u2019s are popular employers because of the stances they take, not despite them.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out that people are scared to participate in a survey or express an opinion internally, then we\u2019re in a moment of reckoning,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that great leaders need license to express sentiments that reflect the company\u2019s values. This involves looking to long-term strategic goals rather than reacting to every single bump in the road that employees might see coming from the outside in.\n\n\u201cThe CEO is an expression of the company\u2019s values in a person,\u201d Illingworth said. \u201cWe need to carefully evaluate what leaders are saying and when they\u2019re saying it to reinforce internal culture and create minimal external risk.\u201d\n\nKerry O\u2019Grady, comms consultant and professor of communications at Holy Family University, said that the move reads as a way of grabbing authority back on the part of Unilever.\n\n\u201cAs communicators, we need to stop throwing around words like \u2018autonomy,\u2019 \u2018independent,\u2019 and \u2018free speech\u2019 unless we operationalize what those words mean to both parties,\u201d she said.\n\nWith that in mind, she recommended that internal communicators take an audit of employee sentiment via surveys and social media monitoring to see their reactions to such a move. Doing so will help internal comms plot their next employee comm moves as needed.\n\n\u201cYou need to monitor your employee landscape to see how both internal and external reactions are affecting their sense of connection to the company\u2019s established culture,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.\n\nCasey Weldon is a reporter for PR Daily.

Further, the brand\u2019s technological and R&D capabilities stood apart from that of its sibling Unilever product lines.\n\nHeiko Schipper, president of Unilever Foods, was confident The Vegetarian Butcher would be better served under new ownership that is dedicated to plant-based meat replacements. It has been a tumultuous month for Unilever, which had said late last year that it would be spinning off its ice cream business as part of the portfolio management strategies mentioned above. Latest news was that plan remained on track.\n\nHowever, last month, the company unexpectedly announced that CEO Hein Schumacher would step down \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d and be replaced by CFO and executive director Fernando Fernandez.\n\nThen, just two days ago (March 18), Unilever-owned Ben & Jerry\u2019s escalated the years-long battle between parent and subsidiary, filing a lawsuit accusing Unilever of firing Ben & Jerry\u2019s CEO David Stever earlier this month because he supported the Vermont ice cream company\u2019s increasingly vocal social mission.\n\nAs for where The Vegetarian Butcher is headed, JBS S.A. said during its presentation to the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) in mid-February that its plant-based business, which includes Vivera, ranked No. 3 in Europe. Vivera was acquired by JBS in 2021, and its CEO, Willem van Weede, said of the acquisition that the company was proud to unify with the \u201clike-minded believers\u201d at The Vegetarian Butcher and looked forward to leveraging both companies\u2019 competencies.\n\nTerms of the offer were not disclosed, but the deal was expected to be completed by Q3 2025.",

The independent board, it says, was established for communicating the brand's social mission and brand identity.\n\nOngoing clashes\n\nBen & Jerry's independent board and Unilever have consistently clashed over the brand's public stance on social matters.

Dave Stever/LinkedIn\n\n\u201cUnilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry\u2019s personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever\u2019s efforts to silence the Social Mission,\u201d the filing reads in part. \u201cThis month, [Unilever\u2019s President of Ice Cream Peter ter Kelve] and Unilever followed through with their threats. On March 3, 2025, Unilever informed the Independent Board that they were removing and replacing Mr. Stever as Ben & Jerry\u2019s CEO.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit said the board believes Unilever's motive for removing Stever was his \"commitment to Ben & Jerry\u2019s Social Mission and Essential Brand Integrity and his willingness to collaborate in good faith with the Independent Board, rather than any genuine concerns regarding his performance history.\"\n\nThe lawsuit noted that under Stever\u2019s tenure, Ben & Jerry\u2019s outperformed Unilever\u2019s ice cream portfolio and was ranked #2 on the Brand 500 Authenticity Index in both 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn a statement provided to ABC News, a representative in the Unilever press office said the parent company attempted to engage with the independent board about the status of the Ben & Jerry's CEO.\n\n\"In line with the terms of the acquisition agreement, decisions on the appointment, compensation and removal of the Ben & Jerry's CEO will be made by Unilever after good faith consultation and discussion with the B &J's Independent Board,\" the Unilever statement said. \"Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the Board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public.

We have a progressive, nonpartisan social mission that seeks to meet human needs and eliminate injustices in our local, national, and international communities by integrating these concerns in our day-to-day business activities,\u201d the ice cream maker proclaims on its website.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Shahmeer Halepota, an attorney for Ben & Jerry\u2019s board said, \u201cBen & Jerry\u2019s is an American institution that has spent four decades unabashedly supporting social justice. We will not sit idly by as Unilever attempts to tarnish that legacy through its censorship, threats, and reprisals.\u201d\n\nBen & Jerry's was founded in Vermont in 1978 by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield. Unilever acquired the ice cream maker 25 years ago but the London-based consumer goods company and shareholders agreed the ice cream producer would be able to continue with its social missions and uphold \u201cbrand integrity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ben & Jerry\u2019s website, Stever, the ousted CEO, started working at Ben & Jerry\u2019s in 1988 as a tour guide and rose up the ranks to become its chief marketing officer for 12 years before he was internally promoted to the top job in May 2023.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s said its parent company Unilever fired the ice cream maker\u2019s CEO David Stever for backing the brand\u2019s social mission and not because of his job performance.\n\nThe Cherry Garcia maker said in a court filing on Tuesday Unilever has \u201crepeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry\u2019s personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever\u2019s efforts to silence\u201d its social mission.\n\nUnilever said it planned to remove and replace Stever on March 3. Earlier this year, the ice cream brand said Unilever \"chastised\" Stever in his annual review for \u201crepeatedly acquiesce[ing] to the demands\" of Ben & Jerry's independent social mission board, which oversees the brand's activism.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe allegations are the latest salvo fired between Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Unilever, which also owns frozen novelties such as Talenti, Breyer\u2019s and Popsicle.\n\nIn January, Ben & Jerry\u2019s claimed the CPG giant suppressed a social media statement that mentioned President Donald Trump and referenced issues such as abortion, climate change, minimum wages and universal healthcare.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s also said in the lawsuit it was prohibited from issuing a post commemorating Black History Month and commenting on the protection of the First Amendment after Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil was recently detained.\n\nThe brand claims the removal of Stever was another attempt to clamp down on Ben & Jerry's political views and violates an agreement in place with Unilever outlining the process for replacing the company's top executive.\n\n\u201cConcurrently with their efforts to remove Mr. Stever, Unilever\u2019s suppression of Ben & Jerry\u2019s Social Mission has reached startling new levels of oppressiveness,\u201d the ice cream brand said in a court filing.\n\nIn a statement, a Unilever spokesperson said its purchase of Ben & Jerry\u2019s required decisions on the appointment, compensation and removal of the brand\u2019s CEO to be made by Unilever \u201cafter good faith consultation and discussion with the B&J's Independent Board.\u201d\n\nThe person added that \u201cregrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the Board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public. We hope that the B&J Independent Board will engage as per the original, agreed process.\u201d\n\nLast year, Unilever announced plans to spin off Ben & Jerry\u2019s and its other ice cream brands in 2025 as part of a sweeping restructuring plan designed to create \u201ca simpler, more focused company.\u201d\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s has expressed concern that Unilever so far has failed to outline how the spinoff will preserve its independent board, social mission and brand integrity. The independent board of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, which controls social responsibility matters, was formed as part of its merger agreement with Unilever in 2000.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s was the leading ice cream brand in the U.S., with $951 million in sales during 2023, according to the latest data from Statista. The U.S. ice cream market generated more than $19 billion in revenue.",

The company has also embraced Nvidia\u2019s Open Universal Scene Description 3D framework.\n\nOpen Universal Scene Description 3D framework. Such efficiency-minded efforts are touching channels from TV advertising to e-commerce and are part of Unilever\u2019s Growth Action Plan (GAP) 2030 strategy focused on boosting performance. Unilever is vying to step up growth after ousting CEO Hein Schumacher late last month.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWhile AI-generated commercials still fail to cross the uncanny valley for many consumers, Unilever is seeing success leveraging the technology for a specific use that could be relevant to other packaged goods marketers. The CPG is tapping into 3D modeling tools like Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse development platform to spin up digital twins of its products, cutting down on costs and time spent while preserving a sense of brand identity. Unilever\u2019s Bracey spoke about the organization\u2019s AI initiatives at Nvidia\u2019s GTC developer conference earlier this week.\n\nDigital twins, a form of physically accurate 3D replicas, contain a number of assets related to a product, including different variants, packaging and language labels, in a single file, serving as a \u201csingle digital truth,\u201d as Unilever terms it. This allows product imagery to be pumped out faster and slashes duplicative efforts adapting content across marketing channels. By removing the busywork, Unilever hopes to enable its marketing teams to pursue more ambitious brand-building projects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve transformed what was once a complex, slow process into a marketing system that frees up our teams to focus on what they do best \u2014 think bigger, be creative, push boundaries and create magic for our brands,\u201d said Bracey in a statement. \u201cThis isn't about pushing out more content \u2014 anyone can do that. It\u2019s about starting with a deep understanding of people\u2019s needs and desires, executing our campaigns with creativity and backed by a high-quality content creation machine to deliver desire at scale.\u201d\n\nUnilever\u2019s beauty and well-being segment was the first to test out the AI tech, with promising early results. The group that includes Tresemm\u00e9, Dove, Vaseline and Clear saw 55% growth in savings and turned around content 65% faster, while some brands even recorded an increase in purchase intent from consumers.\n\nUnilever has taken a more cautious approach to AI in other areas. Dove last year pledged to never use AI models in place of real women in its advertising as part of a long-running \u201cReal Beauty\u201d platform. An accompanying campaign illustrated how automation technology could lead to even more unrealistic beauty standards for women and shared inclusive prompting guidelines for generative AI software.\n\nUnilever\u2019s broader marketing mandates are starting to change under new leadership in ways that could dovetail with its proliferating AI applications, which now number in the hundreds. Fernando Fernandez, who replaced Schumacher as CEO in February, recently told a Barclays analyst that the company is aiming to allocate half of its marketing budget to social media while vastly expanding its work with influencers, The Drum reported.\n\nFernandez is tasked with speeding up a turnaround plan that was sluggish to take hold under his predecessor. Proctor & Gamble, a top rival, recently overtook Unilever on the performance front, The Wall Street Journal reported.",

Their influence is reshaping the hospitality industry and restaurants that fail to adapt risk being left behind.\n\nGen Z\u2019s influence on dining habits\n\nNew research from social insights firm More in Common, commissioned for Future Menus Volume 3, confirms that Gen Z diners have distinct preferences that set them apart from other generations:\n\nGen Z are the only generation where a majority say they eat out at least once a week, with over 25 percent eating out multiple times a week\n\nOne in ten only go to restaurants where they can customise dishes\n\ngo to restaurants where they can customise dishes Customisation fosters loyalty \u2013 62 percent of Gen Z are more likely to return to a restaurant that encourages customisation\n\n77 percent of Gen Z are more attracted to restaurants with adventurous, global cuisine\n\nGen Z are more likely to use TikTok or Instagram than Google search when looking for new places to eat, with 56 percent using TikTok and 32 percent Instagram.\n\n62 percent say they are likely to return to a restaurant that features modern takes on food from around the world\n\n60 percent of Gen Z would be more likely to return to a restaurant where the chefs blend food from different cultures\n\n26 percent would be less likely to return to a restaurant that only serves British cuisine\n\n26 percent of Gen Z are often overwhelmed by long menus, compared to 15 percent of the nation\n\nWith such strong preferences, the report suggests that restaurants must embrace flexibility and innovation to secure Gen Z\u2019s loyalty.\n\nThe four key trends shaping future menus\n\nTo help chefs and operators navigate these shifts, Future Menus Volume 3 outlines four major trends shaping the future of dining:\n\nBorderless cuisine \u2013 A fusion of global flavours, inspired by migration and multicultural influences. Street food couture \u2013 Elevating street food staples into premium, chef-driven experiences. Diner designed \u2013 Increased demand for interactive, personalised dining experiences. Modernised comfort food \u2013 A fresh take on nostalgic and heritage-based dishes, blending tradition with contemporary tastes.\n\nColin Butler, Managing Director at Unilever Food Solutions, emphasised the importance of these trends in the current economic climate:\n\nMr Butler said:\n\nWe understand the many headwinds and challenges operators of all sizes are facing right now. Trade body UKHospitality has stated that the changes in the 2025 Budget will cost hospitality businesses \u00a33.4bn, so our latest Future Menus report could not be more timely or relevant.\u201d\n\nCustomisation is key\n\nOne of the strongest insights from the report is Gen Z\u2019s demand for control over their dining experience. With one in ten only visiting restaurants that allow customisation, and 62 percent stating they are more likely to return to establishments that encourage it, offering flexible menus is crucial.\n\nMr Butler added:",

            "content": "In my \u2018fireside chat\u2019 with Unilever\u2019s new CEO Fernando Fernandez this month, there were three standout points: his laser-focus on demand generation and premiumisation; his ambition to drive \u201cdesirability at scale\u201d; and a major pivot in its marketing approach. His comments on marketing particularly caught the attention of fmcg peers, marketeers, and influencers alike.\n\nConsumers are increasingly suspicious of brand messages from companies, Fernandez said, and younger shoppers are increasingly making brand purchases because of trusted influencers, celebrities, and TikTokers. In fact, research shows 56% of Gen Z consumers make brand purchases after recommendations from influencers.\n\nAs such, Unilever is moving to a \u2018social first\u2019 marketing strategy, and is creating a marketing system that involves getting others to advocate for its brands and convey their messages at scale. Unilever\u2019s aim is to increase social media from 30% of its marketing mix to 50% in time. This is significant given Unilever is one of the biggest fmcg advertisers in the world, spending \u20ac9.4bn on brand and marketing in 2024 \u2013 an increase of \u20ac1bn on 2023.\n\nLessons from L\u2019Or\u00e9al\n\nFernandez\u2019s aim is to create a machine of content creation, which will entail multiplying its content creation 20 times. That will be enabled by AI technology as well as hiring 20 times more influencers. There are 19,000 zip codes in India and 5,746 municipalities in Brazil, and he wants at least one influencer in each. Fernandez believes returns are higher in social media marketing than any other alternative allocation of marketing funds.\n\nIt seems to us Unilever is moving towards the model of L\u2019Or\u00e9al, which is a leader in social-first marketing. It has a 14% global market share in cosmetics, but a 23% share of paid voice and 30% share of influencer voice.\n\nThe company has a 1.5 times index in share of voice and historically has grown around 1.5 times faster than the global cosmetics markets, although that has slowed recently. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s strategy is to outspend peers by a substantial margin and close the gap between its share of the global cosmetics market and its share of voice. It works with more than 50,000 influencers worldwide.\n\nThere are lessons from L\u2019Or\u00e9al in how Unilever engages with consumers. It must work across all engagement touchpoints: paid, advocated, and owned.\n\nIn L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s case, it is optimising its marketing spend mixes with an AI tool called BetIQ, which is yielding significant productivity improvements of 10%-15%. It is already present in six of its key markets with two more planned this year. The tool covers 60% of its advertising spend and is really helping its marketeers optimise spend and returns. As the AI learns and gets smarter, returns are only likely to increase.\n\nHowever, there are big differences in the financials of L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Unilever. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s gross margin is 74%, while Unilever\u2019s is 45%. Meanwhile, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s advertising spend as a percentage of sales is more than 30% \u2013 that\u2019s double Unilever\u2019s spend of 15.5%.\n\nUnilever will need to increase its gross margin significantly and continue to evolve its portfolio more towards beauty to get to a similar point. Separating its ice cream unit is a big step on its journey, as is its ambition to increase the weight of premium brands in its portfolio from 35% today to 50% in time.\n\nDove is an example of where Unilever\u2019s premiumisation strategy is most visible. It is Unilever\u2019s largest brand: worth \u20ac7bn and accounting for more than 11% of sales. Dove has been growing 10% in recent quarters \u2013 helped by its premium Dove Advanced Care range, its entry into serums, and most recently the launch of Dove whole-body deodorants.\n\nRight influencer, right brand\n\nHowever, there is a big debate as to whether this bold vision is the right approach for Unilever at the right time. Is Unilever just playing catch-up, or making a bold attempt to get ahead of the consumer and play where the consumer is spending more time?\n\nClearly, Unilever needs a balanced approach to its media marketing mix, we see the goal to attribute 50% of its weight to social media as more a direction of travel and a signal of intent.\n\nMore important will be matching the right influencer with the right brand. Understanding influencer output and consumer reaction will be crucial, and to generate buzz and scale sustainably, there are more nuances than ever before. For example, getting Usain Bolt to partner with Unilever\u2019s recent Wonderwash laundry brand launch makes sense, given the brand message is all about speed (a 15-minute wash cycle).\n\nWhat we find most interesting is Unilever\u2019s thinking around a hyper-targeted approach to micro-influencers, especially in emerging markets. Unilever will need to think carefully about which influencers align best to its values, as well as topics around brand safety and the balance of short-term versus long-term returns.\n\nUltimately, boosting long-term brand equity is key, and building more trust with less waste will be crucial, so the devil will be in the detail.\n\nRisk versus reward\n\nYes, there are risks in Unilever\u2019s approach to marketing. But sticking to the status quo also carries risks given how fast consumer trends are moving. There have never been more smaller \u2018ankle-biter\u2019 digital native brands around, which means cutting through and staying visible is getting harder. Legacy brands that don\u2019t adapt to the new reality will quickly lose relevance.\n\nThe pace of change in geopolitics and consumer trends requires clarity and precision of strategy, coupled with a bold vision to get ahead of the consumer. CEOs are being replaced at a record rate in fmcg, and a big reason is their not being sufficiently consumer-centric.\n\nSimply tweaking what you did last year isn\u2019t enough, and playing catch-up is less effective than it was. Unilever has set out its stall and peers will be watching closely. The question is not whether they will follow, but how fast.",

This prompts the question \u2018is Retail Media Distribution or Advertising? Here Skye Frontier, Executive Vice President at Incremental , looks for some answers.\n\nUnilever\u2019s new CEO Fernando Fernandez recently participated in a \u201cfireside chat\u201d with Barclays to address investor concerns following the leadership change. While he never explicitly mentioned retail media or ecommerce marketplaces during the interview (unusual in itself), his comments reveal significant implications for Unilever\u2019s approach to digital marketplaces and retail platforms.\n\nI\u2019ll break down some of the key themes from the fireside chat and what Fernandez\u2019 vision means for consumer goods competitors, as well as for retail media networks. Note that a very wide range of topics were discussed, including a big focus on Unilever\u2019s international markets. For the purpose of this breakdown, this article\n\nWhere\u2019s the Retail Media?\n\nBut first, one of the most striking aspects of Unilever CEO Fernando Fernandez\u2019s recent \u201cfireside chat\u201d with Barclays isn\u2019t what he said\u2014it\u2019s what he didn\u2019t say. In an era where digital commerce dominates CPG strategy discussions, Fernandez\u2019s complete omission of retail media and e-commerce stands out as unusually conspicuous.\n\nThis silence is particularly notable because:\n\nMost major CPG CEO speeches or investor calls in the last few years have included specific references to e-commerce channels and retail media, reflecting their importance in modern consumer engagement.\n\nPeer companies like Procter & Gamble, Nestl\u00e9, and PepsiCo consistently highlight Amazon, Walmart Connect, or their own D2C channels when discussing marketing mix shifts, ROI, and digital acceleration.\n\nUnilever itself has historically featured e-commerce updates in earnings calls under previous leadership, making Fernandez\u2019s omission all the more striking.\n\nThe omission is conspicuous because it runs counter to a near-universal pattern in CPG leadership communications, where digital commerce\u2014and especially retail media\u2014is highlighted as a key growth vector. Even if Fernandez plans to invest heavily in these channels, not mentioning them in a major first interview seems unusual to me.\n\nThe marketing investment surge\n\nOne of the most striking revelations is Unilever\u2019s dramatic increase in Brand and Marketing Investment (BMI). The company has moved from what Fernandez called a \u201cnon-competitive\u201d 13.1% of sales in 2022 to 14.3% in 2023, with projections reaching 15.9% by late 2024. Fernandez didn\u2019t mince words about the previous spending level, noting there\u2019s \u201can implicit recognition that our level of investment in 2022 was noncompetitive.\u201d\n\nThis reminded me of some research that I came across recently and have been saving for a rainy day. Keen Decision Systems \u2018 2024 Marketing Insight Report had a neat breakdown of 350 consumer brands\u2019 marketing investment relative to revenue.\n\nAccording to Keen\u2019s research, enterprise brands with >1BN revenue typically are spending 9% of revenue on marketing. Unilever\u2019s goal to spend 15-16% of revenue on marketing appears very ambitious.\n\nThis aggressive stance on marketing investment comes at a time when many CPGs have pulled back spending due to inflation and margin pressures.\n\nThe social-first revolution\n\nPerhaps the most transformative element of Fernandez\u2019s strategy is to eschew mass advertising campaigns and pivot to highly localized influencer marketing. In his words: \u201cmarketing activity systems in which others can speak for your brand at scale.\u201d His ambition is staggering\u2014recruiting influencers down to the municipality level:\n\n\u201cThere are 19,000 postcodes in England. In Brazil there are 5,764 municipalities. I want one influencer in each of them\u2026in some of them I want 100.\u201d\n\nFernandez believes Unilever can tap into local authenticity\u2014where brand messages come from someone who\u2019s \u2018one of you\u2019 rather than a big corporate entity.\n\nThis represents a fundamental shift away from traditional corporate messaging, which Fernandez bluntly describes as \u201csuspicious.\u201d Instead, he\u2019s betting on authenticity through third-party voices, requiring a \u201cmachine of content creation very different to the one we have had in the past.\u201d\n\nAI-powered localisation\n\nThe scale of content creation Fernandez envisions would be impossible without technological intervention. He explicitly calls out AI\u2019s role in scaling this massive influencer operation. This suggests Unilever is building capabilities to produce high volumes of localized, targeted creative\u2026. which could also feed into retail media platforms.\n\nThe premium push\n\nFernandez also revealed Unilever\u2019s aim to have 50% of its business in the \u201cpremium\u201d segment. This premiumization strategy has major implications for retail media:\n\nHigher Margins: Premium products can justify more aggressive advertising spend, potentially making retail media\u2019s pay-to-play model more palatable. Enhanced Product Detail Pages: Premium positioning requires exceptional online presentation\u2014from enhanced content to compelling images and authentic reviews\u2014all areas where retail media networks are expanding offerings.\n\nWhat this means for retail media networks\n\nThough Fernandez never explicitly mentions retail media, the implications for platforms like Amazon, Walmart Connect, and other e-commerce channels are significant:\n\nHigher Marketing Budgets: The substantial increase in BMI will likely include more spending on retail media placements, sponsored products, and display ads across digital marketplaces. Influencer-to-E-commerce Pipeline: The influencer-first strategy creates a natural funnel to e-commerce product pages, potentially driving higher-quality traffic to retail media placements. Accountability Pressure: Fernandez emphasizes Unilever\u2019s proprietary \u201cUBS methodology\u201d for measuring marketing performance, stating that investments must deliver \u201chigher returns versus any alternative allocation of funds.\u201d This will place significant pressure on retail media networks to prove their ROI. Driving down costs in other areas of the business \u2013 particularly procurement \u2013 was a key talking point for Fernandez, but it follows that media and marketing ROI also be under the microscope. With Fernandez\u2019s strict ROI yardsticks, retail media networks must prove their incremental value. This will be particularly challenging for smaller networks that, as I\u2019ve written about extensively, already struggle with transparency and measurement issues. Integrated Approaches: Successful platforms will need to demonstrate how they can integrate with Unilever\u2019s influencer-led strategy, potentially offering new types of influencer collaborations or sponsored content.\n\nWhat this means for other consumer brands\n\nUnilever\u2019s strategic shift under Fernandez has significant implications for competitors and other consumer brands operating in the retail media space:\n\n1. Increased Competition for RMN Inventory\u2014and Rising Costs\n\nWith Unilever dramatically increasing their overall marketing investment from ~13% to ~15-16% of revenue and likely allocating a substantial portion to retail media, other brands should prepare for:\n\nHigher Auction Prices: As more Unilever marketing dollars pour into sponsored product listings, display ads, and brand stores on retail media networks, CPCs and CPMs are likely to rise, especially in competitive categories. Brands must be prepared for a more expensive pay-to-play environment.\n\nBudget Allocation Agility: If costs spike on dominant platforms like Amazon, brands should consider diversifying spend across other retail media networks or rebalancing between brand-building and lower-funnel tactics to maintain efficiency.\n\n2. Battle for \u201cPremium\u201d Perception Within E-Commerce\n\nUnilever\u2019s shift toward positioning 50% of its portfolio as \u201cpremium\u201d despite potential consumer spending slowdowns creates both challenges and opportunities:\n\nStrategic Positioning Choices: Competitors must decide whether to compete directly in the premium space or reinforce value propositions for price-sensitive segments that Unilever might be de-emphasizing.\n\nEnhanced Content Investment: To compete in the premium space, brands will need to utilize brand stores and enhanced content modules (like A+ Content on Amazon) to convey higher-value brand stories\u2014ideally complemented by influencer endorsements.\n\nExclusive Offerings: Consider developing unique bundle offerings or limited-edition SKUs exclusive to specific retail media networks, which can justify higher price points and create a sense of scarcity.\n\n3. AI-Powered Content Creation and Optimization\n\nUnilever\u2019s use of AI to produce vast amounts of localized, influencer-driven content sets a new benchmark:\n\nAutomated Creative Production: Brands should explore AI-driven solutions to produce multiple versions of product images, ad copy, and videos tailored to different geographies or consumer segments\u2014at scale and cost-effectively.\n\nDynamic Testing: Implement AI-powered dynamic content testing to optimize retail media creative in real-time based on performance metrics, potentially gaining efficiency advantages over less agile competitors.\n\n4. Strategic Opportunities in Unilever\u2019s Blind Spots\n\nAny major strategic shift creates potential gaps that competitors can exploit:\n\nValue Segment Opportunities: As Unilever focuses on premium positioning, brands can target cost-conscious consumers with performance-driven retail media ads highlighting affordability and value, potentially capturing market share in segments Unilever may be deprioritizing.\n\nDirect Retail Partnerships: While Unilever channels resources to influencer-based brand-building, competitors might strengthen co-marketing efforts directly with retail networks through negotiated search brand amplification or special brand day takeovers.\n\nMeasurement Advantage: Brands that develop superior ROI measurement capabilities for retail media may gain advantage over competitors still using traditional metrics, allowing for more efficient spend allocation and better negotiations with retail media networks.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nFernandez\u2019s omission of retail media from his investor discussion doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unimportant\u2014rather, it\u2019s likely become table stakes in Unilever\u2019s marketing mix. The real transformation lies in how these platforms will need to adapt to Unilever\u2019s new social-first, influencer-driven, and ROI-focused approach.",

I'm very confident about the launch of Nexxus in China and believe that it will become a big brand for us,\" said Elsharkawy Mohamed, Unilever China head of hair marketing, who is also global vice-president of Clear.\n\n\"There is a reason why we are here in China today to talk about that, because it's a great path that is similar to what China wants and what Unilever wants to accomplish,\" said Julien Moignard, senior vice-president of Unilever global beauty and well-being prospective innovation and design, who is also founder of Nexxus Promend collection.\n\n\"The consumers are very sophisticated and market is very promising and demanding.

            "content": "We haven\u2019t ditched our Sunday sundaes, weeknight binges with Ben & Jerry\u2019s, or our Monday Magnums entirely, but the data is irrefutable: America is eating less ice cream. And consumer giants like British powerhouse Unilever are well aware.\n\nThe conglomerate\u2019s foray into frozen treats dates back to the 1920s, when it began selling ice cream to offset its slumping sausage sales in the summer. What started as a seasonal side hustle laid the foundation for what would become the world\u2019s largest ice cream manufacturer, with Unilever now responsible for roughly 20% of the licks and scoops of the global market.\n\nBut that\u2019s a title it won\u2019t hold for much longer.\n\nAfter decades of dominating freezer aisles, Unilever is planning to part ways with its $8.7 billion ice cream empire, home to Magnum, Wall\u2019s, and Ben & Jerry\u2019s.\n\nThe breakup comes as Unilever undergoes a major upheaval of its own. Hein Schumacher, the CEO who spearheaded the ice cream spin-off deal, was abruptly ousted last month after just 20 months on the job, reportedly for failing to turn the struggling company around fast enough.\n\nBut even without the man who orchestrated the split, the plan seems to be moving forward: after a lackluster Q4 earnings release, Unilever confirmed that its ice cream business will be a stand-alone company, headquartered in Amsterdam with secondary listings in New York and London.\n\nSo, why is Unilever walking away from this multibillion-dollar unit packed with household name brands? For starters, it might not want to swim against the tide in its largest market, the US.\n\nSherwood News\n\nAccording to data from the US Department of Agriculture, per-capita consumption of ice cream and frozen desserts has been shrinking for nearly 50 years.\n\nSince 1975, per-capita consumption of ice cream is down 28% in the US.\n\nInterestingly, this decline lines up with a drop in caloric sweetener consumption, which has fallen ~20% over the past two decades \u2014 a sign that Americans are becoming more calorie conscious, cutting back on indulgences, or opting for healthier alternatives. The yogurt scene has certainly boomed as ice cream has melted away.\n\nMore recently, of course, there is the Ozempic wave to contend with, ice cream\u2019s newest \u2014 and potentially its biggest \u2014 threat yet. A 2024 Morgan Stanley study forecast that because of the growing use of GLP-1 medications (already taken by one in eight US adults as of last May), ice cream consumption could fall a further 5.3% by 2035, the largest expected decline among all food categories analyzed, including confections, soda, and alcohol.\n\nThe margin meltdown\n\nIce cream makes up 13% to 14% of Unilever\u2019s revenue, but it\u2019s been dragging down profits for years. While higher-margin segments like personal care (with brands like Dove) and foods (home to mayo giant Hellmann\u2019s) have been more lucrative, ice cream has consistently posted the lowest \u2014 or second-lowest \u2014 underlying operating margin of all five product segments since 2019.\n\nSherwood News\n\nOf course, it isn\u2019t hard to see why \u2014 running an ice cream business is expensive. Unilever operates over 3 million freezers in 60 countries, a massive fixed cost that only pays off if sales can keep up. But there\u2019s a catch: ice cream is also brutally seasonal. As Schumacher once put it, \u201cYou make your money in five months a year,\u201d with even a one-degree temperature swing throwing off sales projections.\n\nWere sales strong enough to justify this scale? For a while, yes. During the pandemic, the company\u2019s home delivery business boomed as cooped-up consumers loaded up on comfort food like never before. But once the lockdown era ended, demand took a different turn.\n\nSherwood News\n\nSince 2022, nearly all of Unilever\u2019s ice cream revenue growth has been driven by price hikes, while the actual volume of ice cream sold declined year over year for seven consecutive quarters. The streak only broke in late 2024, when new product launches finally helped Unilever regain some lost ground.\n\nWith margins already tighter than its other divisions, Unilever was clearly keen to pass on price increases for key ingredients like dairy, cocoa, and sugar to consumers. But, with ice cream being the company\u2019s \u201cmost discretionary category,\u201d consumers weren\u2019t willing to keep paying more. Sales tumbled in Europe and China, Unilever\u2019s two key markets, as more shoppers cut back or traded down to cheaper private-label brands.\n\nFurthermore, each region had its own challenges. China\u2019s economic slowdown has driven people away from premium labels like Unilever\u2019s Magnum \u2014 just look at the country\u2019s booming $1 ice-cream-and-tea chain that now has more stores than McDonald\u2019s worldwide. In Europe, extreme heat waves dented demand because, apparently, when it\u2019s too hot, people opt for cold drinks over ice cream, Unilever\u2019s CFO said.\n\nBut falling demand isn\u2019t Unilever\u2019s only headache.\n\nChurn of events\n\nInternally, Unilever executives have long clashed over corporate control and political messaging with Ben & Jerry\u2019s, a brand known almost as much for its activism as for its iconic cookie-dough ice cream.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Ben & Jerry\u2019s founders believe this tension may have played a role in the spin-off decision. When asked during a shareholder meeting last May whether the Ben & Jerry\u2019s feud factored into the move, Schumacher didn\u2019t fully address the question.\n\n\u201cWe love Ben & Jerry\u2019s. We think it\u2019s a great brand,\u201d he said, adding that Unilever has endorsed the brand\u2019s social mission and the agreements set \u201cat the time of the acquisition.\u201d Ben & Jerry\u2019s corporate website discusses issues that the company cares about, including \u201cSocial & Economic Justice\u201d and \u201cEnvironmental Protection, Restoration, & Regeneration,\u201d and the company\u2019s YouTube channel is similar:\n\nBought in 2000 for about $326 million, Ben & Jerry\u2019s is run as an independent subsidiary, with sales hitting \u20ac1 billion ($1.1 billion) for the first time in 2021, per the company\u2019s report. The brand also outpaced its parent\u2019s broader ice cream sales growth in three of the past five years, the WSJ reported.\n\nWith Unilever looking to shed its ice cream business, Ben & Jerry\u2019s founders are reportedly exploring ways to buy back their namesake company.\n\nMeanwhile, outside competition is also heating up in the space.\n\nSherwood News\n\nNestle\u2019s Froneri, a joint venture founded in 2016 between the food giant and a private equity firm, is catching up fast. Since acquiring H\u00e4agen-Dazs for $4 billion and expanding into the US, Froneri has more than doubled its revenue, from \u20ac2.6 billion in 2019 to \u20ac5.3 billion in 2023, its annual reports show. In 2019, Froneri was less than half the size of Unilever\u2019s ice cream business. Now, it\u2019s closing in, generating more than two-thirds of Unilever\u2019s revenue.\n\nSmaller scoop\n\nEven with the challenges ahead, Unilever\u2019s new spin-off may still be able to carve out a sweet spot.\n\nOne major trend working in its favor is the continued rise of small-portion snacking habits. According to Nielsen, sales of bite-sized snacks jumped 14% year over year in Europe in 2023, and a 2022 study by market research firm Mintel found that 62% of US ice cream consumers \u201cwould rather eat a small amount of indulgent ice cream than more low-cal ice cream.\u201d\n\nUnilever has already tapped into this space, launching mini-sized ice creams last fall, which helped reverse nearly two years of volume declines in the past two quarters.\n\nUnilever\u2019s new snacking ice cream: Magnum Bon Bons (Image courtesy of Unilever)\n\nIf anything can hold its ground against the weight-loss drug craze, the ice cream behemoth seems to think this is it. As then CFO (now CEO) Fernando Fernandez said at November\u2019s investor event, referring to Magnum\u2019s new micro-bite treats: \u201cThere is no Ozempic that can stop that one, I can promise you. I have become addicted.\u201d",

Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Unilever (LON:ULVR), we liked what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Unilever, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.21 = \u20ac11b \u00f7 (\u20ac80b - \u20ac25b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nSo, Unilever has an ROCE of 21%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Unilever\n\nLSE:ULVR Return on Capital Employed March 14th 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Unilever's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Unilever .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nUnilever deserves to be commended in regards to it's returns. The company has consistently earned 21% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 24% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\n\nOur Take On Unilever's ROCE\n\nIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. However, over the last five years, the stock has only delivered a 24% return to shareholders who held over that period. That's why it could be worth your time looking into this stock further to discover if it has more traits of a multi-bagger.\n\nOn a separate note, we've found 1 warning sign for Unilever you'll probably want to know about.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The maker of Marmite and Magnums is adopting a \u201clove it or hate it\u201d strategy. Traditional ads are being increasingly ignored and there\u2019s a strong business case to prioritise meeting consumers \u201cface-to-face\u201d in the digital spaces where they spend most of their time. But handing over message control to individuals is inherently risky. Off-script remarks or personal controversies can quickly erode trust at a time when the credibility of institutions is low across the board.\n\nSpreading like (in)flu(encer). \u201cInfluencer marketing was once just fashion and beauty \u2013 now it spans every sector,\u201d says Ben Craig, head of digital and campaigns at Montfort. \u201cBrands are recognising in the new information environment we live in, attention is everything.\u201d No area is too niche, with brands piggybacking outlandish trends like\n\n#DustBunnyCare.

Beauty brands partnering with survivalist influencers to showcase \u201cend of the world\u201d makeup tutorials and hairstyles.\n\nMicro is the new macro. Fernandez, who took the helm at Unilever following Hein Schumacher\u2019s surprise exit, says he wants a \u201cmachine of content creation\u201d with \u201cat least one influencer\u201d promoting its brands in every region of every country, including in 19,000 Indian zipcodes and 5,764 municipalities in Brazil. After the US, it\u2019s these two countries that account for the largest share, equivalent to more than a fifth, of influencer-sponsored posts online.\n\nNeedless to say these regional influencers won\u2019t have the same clout as David Beckham. Instead, Unilever is likely to employ \u201cmicro influencers\u201d \u2013 creators with smaller, highly engaged audiences whose recommendations feel more word-of-mouth than broadcast. A recent survey of 400 firms found that nearly 90 per cent of influencers employed fit the category of \u201cnano\u201d or \u201cmicro\u201d, with between 1,000 and 50,000 followers.\n\nRunning the risks. Influencers are in a new category of \u201cinformation broker\u201d \u2013 as are journalists and review sites \u2013 that help consumers navigate choices, says Craig. Their appeal comes from authenticity, but if they become overly commercial they risk losing trust and audience. Brands need to tread carefully: \u201cToo much control kills authenticity, too little invites chaos.\u201d Risks fall into three main buckets:\n\nDisclosure failures.

Shein invited influencers on a sponsored trip in 2023 to its \u201cinnovation centre\u201d in China to improve its image following criticism of unethical labour practices. Influencers\u2019 glowing reviews of the site were met with major online backlash, as critics said they were being used for \u201cdamage control\u201d.\n\nSocial purpose. Unilever\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of ESG made it a target for activists when the share price didn\u2019t perform and since Schumacher the company has been much more careful about raising its head above the parapet on social and political issues. In that context, delegating marketing to influencers with opinions might seem foolhardy. Unilever would be wise to vet carefully anyone it plans to work with.\n\nWhat\u2019s more\u2026 The number of influencer-focused marketing agencies globally has risen from 1,120 in 2019 to nearly 7,000 today, while the sector as a whole is expected to reach $32 billion in total value this year. Cutting back on costs has obvious appeal, but caveat emptor. Giving up control has costs as well.",

            "content": "In a major strategic pivot, its new CEO says it\u2019ll spend half of its media dollars on social channels and work with 20x more creators. Here\u2019s why the move makes sense.\n\nIn a shock leadership change last month, Hein Schumacher stepped down after less than two years as chief executive of Unilever, to be replaced by Fernando Fernandez, an Argentine executive with almost four decades at the conglomerate.\n\nAt that point, Unilever was already going through significant change. Last year it announced 7,500 job cuts in an effort to save some \u20ac800m. Meanwhile, it has been upping marketing investment: financial results last year revealed that its brand and marketing investment (BMI) rose to 15.5% (up from 13% two years prior).\n\nLast week, Fernandez hit the ground running by announcing a sweeping re-think of how his Unilever will think about marketing. In a conversation with Warren Ackerman of Barclays, he said that modern consumers are \u201csuspicious\u201d of traditional corporate messaging, and so the firm will switch to a social-first advertising model. That move will see media spend on social channels rise from about 30% to 50% of its budget, and it will look to work with 20x more influencers.\n\nSuggesting also that the FMCG-giant will concentrate marketing efforts on its strongest markets including India and Latin America, Fernandez said: \u201cThere are 19,000 Zip codes in India. There are 5,764 municipalities in Brazil. I want one influencer in each of them.\u201d\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nShaking up its marketing investment to this degree will have a knock on effect for the social ecosystem. If any other clients of Unilever\u2019s scale followed suit, we\u2019d be looking at a bonanza. But will they?\n\n\u201cTo this scale \u2013 50%? Most likely not,\u201d Claudia Ratterman, director analyst at Gartner tells The Drum. Why? Because, for most, 50% would be quite the jump. Gartner\u2019s CMO Spend Survey in 2024 found that around 6% of budgets go into influencer marketing (though the total for all social activity will be higher). So, rather than waiting for Unilever\u2019s massive peers to jump immediately on the bandwagon, Ratterman says, expect them to be watching on carefully.\n\nAnd Ratterman cautions against taking the move as Unilever\u2019s last word on the matter: budgets go up and down, and minds can be changed. \u201cWhile the 50% is aggressive it can be scaled down based on results,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know when a campaign is working or not in real-time. Adjustments to these budgets and strategies will be made based on results.\u201d\n\nWhere might the money go?\n\nStill, influencer marketing agencies will be licking their lips. Unilever\u2019s media agency assignments are already quite dispersed, with global ties to each of the six major advertising networks and accounts largely dished out by local markets. So the spoils of that extra spend may be quite dispersed among agencies \u2013 and Fernandez\u2019s focus on India and Latin America may mean that specialist shops in those areas are particularly well positioned to gain from the move.\n\nDom Smales, founder of one of the first influencer talent agencies in the UK (and now chief executive of GloMotion Studios), says that the macro result of a big influx in cash will be increased competition among influencer agencies: \u201cThe increase of budget and activity from one of the world\u2019s biggest talent buyers will mean there may be even more mouths around the table to be fed.\u201d The upshot? A market that favors specialization. \u201cI think it means agencies have to get smarter about what their \u2018influencer\u2019 offering is. This kind of focus on the channel means that competition to spend that money will intensify and solutions have to perform.\u201d\n\nDominic McGregor, one of Social Chain\u2019s founders, says specialists in social commerce, particularly on TikTok, will be a major growth area with this uplift of spend. In fact, McGregor says, he expects such massive growth in this area that it might be the big bet that underwrites Unilever\u2019s whole social strategy. Unilever, McGregor speculates, might be \u201clooking at this as a step towards using TikTok as a transactional platform. To do that, you need to have a lot of content and a lot of relationships to start selling products at high volume... [It is] potentially using this as a learning curve and building relationships; seeing which influencers perform well, so that when they come fully to social commerce, they've got a data bank of who performs\u201d.\n\nWhy now?\n\nPlenty of signals show the industry is primed for a step-change in social spend. Last year, Kantar\u2019s Media Reactions 2024 study found that 53% of marketers planned to invest more in influencer content this year, with only TV and streaming having higher expected spends. Similar research from Forrester last year found 66% of B2C marketing decision-makers planning to invest more in creator/influencer marketing this year. In 2023, Goldman Sachs pegged the global creator economy for a fresh explosion into $480bn total value by 2027.\n\nThere are, of course, plenty of brands already well on that social-first path: the direct-to-consumer revolution has given us a raft of success stories where social and influencer spend accounts for far more than 50% of budget. From those brands\u2019 perspective, McGregor says, \u201cthe big boys are just catching up\u201d \u2013 held back, he argues, by a media environment that has long struggled to truly understand social.\n\nStill, this is a conspicuous ideological shift for Unilever. Despite the existing 30% spend in the area, it has previously kept the influencer channel at arm\u2019s length: it was among the loudest voices calling attention to influencer fraud back in 2018, and set careful limits on the creators it would work with (for example ruling out those who had bought followers). Later, in 2022, it set careful rules limiting collaboration with creators who appeal to anyone under the age of 16.\n\nThe change here is simple, says McGregor: while ad fraud was \u201crife\u201d back in 2018, \u201cthat has since been really addressed by the platforms\u201d. Gartner\u2019s Claudia Ratterman agrees: \u201cThe influencer marketing landscape has evolved and is now quite refined. Organizations now have access to advanced platforms and tools that make campaign management, analytics, and fraud detection much more efficient.\u201d\n\nIs the market up to the challenge \u2013 and what are the risks?\n\nFor Ratterman, the influencer industry\u2019s success in tackling fraud is evidence that it\u2019s a business coming into maturity, and is primed for the challenge that a fresh influx of spend would provide. \u201cMany marketing agencies have honed their skills in influencer marketing, making it easier to execute large-scale campaigns. I say the influencer marketing space is more than ready.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the onward road will be straightforward. The b\u00eate noire of influencer marketing has long been attribution; don\u2019t expect it to go away overnight, says Jane Ostler, executive vice-president of global solutions marketing and thought leadership at Kantar. \u201cThe market has been around for a while but is still immature in terms of measurement,\u201d Ostler says. \u201cDoes the content that creators produce work for brands in the short and long term? Does it drive sales and brand impact? Who controls the briefing, the use of the brand\u2019s assets, and the guardrails around content, at scale? This will require extensive management and expertise.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, anyone thinking of following Unilever\u2019s lead will do well to remember the value exchange of influencer marketing work, says Ostler: 50% spend on influencers would mean 50% spend over which you don\u2019t have complete control. \u201cWith brands having little control over influencers\u2019 output, partnering with creators can result in damage to the relationship they have with their consumers if their endorsements are inappropriate or less than transparent... Understanding creators and how to get the best out of them will be key.\u201d\n\nAnother risk of a massive social push, Ratterman of Gartner says, is \u2018social fatigue\u2019. Influencers are being recognized for their ability to make authentic connections with consumers, and to make those connections work for commercial partners. But if we open the taps for a more commercialized social environment, that prized authenticity may be in jeopardy: \u201cWill that have an impact on effectiveness? Most likely unless we keep evolving our strategies to meet consumer behaviors.\u201d\n\nThis concern is shared by almost every analyst we spoke to. Smales, for example, cautions that in a new social gold-rush, agencies will have to innovate formats and relationships to avoid over-commercializing: \u201cThe social channel as a whole will have to get more sophisticated and more creative to make sure that consumers don\u2019t just get bored by creators plugging products. The focus should be on entertaining and informing the consumer/audience first. So: use that extra spend to come up with more entertaining ways to connect with influencers and audiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial distribution will be the entertainment networks of the future. Brands just have to get smarter to cut through the ever-growing volume of noise.\u201d",

            "content": "Consumers expect a lot from their personal care products.\n\nIn fact, body care is one of the most dynamic areas in beauty, with value growth of 20% across the premium segment.\n\nThis trend is echoed in a 2024 Mintel report that states that one in five consumers in China would pay more for shower products that solved specific skin issues.\n\nNew Lifebuoy launch delivers hygiene with skincare benefits\n\nLifebuoy has been quick to capitalise on this trend with a new range of premium soaps and bodywashes. Using plant-based technologies and naturally derived functional actives, the range targets specific skin concerns like acne, oily skin, dull skin and hyper-pigmentation.\n\nLaunched in Vietnam last summer, the new Skin Solutions range has already enjoyed significant success.\n\n\u201cThe success of this launch reflects how we\u2019ve leveraged our existing position as a trusted hygiene brand to answer the growing consumer demand for effective, science-backed solutions that deliver cleansing and skin health solutions,\u201d explains Nitish Kumar, Head R&D Skin Cleansing, Lifebuoy.\n\nWhy Skin Solutions?\n\nThis shift mirrors a change within the skincare space that has seen focus moving away from cleansing as simply a way of getting rid of impurities and towards cleansing as a way of also enabling the skin to activate its own healing.\n\n\u201cWith an increased awareness of skin health, consumers now prefer cleansers that not only clean but also provide protective and restorative benefits,\u201d says Nitish.\n\nThe new Skin Solutions range ticks all these boxes by continuing to offer the germ protection that Lifebuoy\u2019s core products are known for, while also providing effective, science-backed solutions for specific skin issues.\n\nThis is a great example of targeting specific consumer groups with tailored products that address the skin issues they are most concerned about Nitish Kumar, Head R&D Skin Cleansing, Lifebuoy\n\nScience-led success\n\nLifebuoy\u2019s Acne Reduction bodywash offers a great example of this approach in action.\n\nBy leveraging the power of two plant-based Unilever proprietary platform technologies \u2013 Armis technology (12 Hydroxystearic acid/12-HSA) and Acne Combat Technology (Thymol and Terpineol/TT) \u2013 the bodywash addresses the root causes of acne through multiple pathways including sebum control and inflammation reduction.\n\nConcern about skin surface issues, such as pores and acne, is one of the top three areas that people equate with skin health.\n\n\u201cThis is a great example of how the new range is targeting specific consumer groups with tailored products that address the skin issues they are most concerned about,\u201d says Nitish.\n\nConnecting with a new generation of consumers\n\nThe inclusion of popular natural ingredients is also adding to the range\u2019s appeal for skin savvy consumers. The Healthy Glow bodywash, for example, leverages trending ingredients such as Pink Clay and Japanese Shiso which are locally recognised for their effectiveness in skincare.\n\n\u201cOne of the big wins for the launch so far is that it has captured the attention of younger \u2018beauty-seeker\u2019 consumers who are looking for benefits beyond cleansing for their skin,\u201d says Nitish.\n\n\u201cBy creating a range that targets specific skin issues through science-backed solutions, we have been able to better connect with an informed audience which has resulted in the brand acquiring new consumers from a new demographic.\u201d\n\nLifebuoy will be expanding its roll-out to additional key markets soon.",

            "content": "Defichain expands Defi Horizons with new dTokens for Unilever and US Oil Fund\n\nThe DeFi space is evolving at breakneck speed, and DeFiChain is at the forefront, shaking things up with its latest expansion. In an ambitious move to push decentralized finance (DeFi) further into mainstream markets, DeFiChain has introduced new decentralized tokens (dTokens) for Unilever (UL) and the US Oil Fund (USO). This addition strengthens DeFiChain\u2019s commitment to bridging traditional finance with blockchain-based solutions, giving users more investment opportunities while staying true to the principles of decentralization.\n\nWhy DeFiChain\u2019s Expansion Matters\n\nDeFiChain has been steadily building a robust ecosystem where users can gain exposure to traditional assets without the need for intermediaries. With the introduction of dTokens for Unilever and the US Oil Fund, traders and investors can now speculate on these assets in a fully decentralized manner. Unlike conventional stocks or commodities, dTokens on DeFiChain allow users to trade synthetic versions of real-world assets without actually holding the underlying securities.\n\nThis is a game-changer for DeFi enthusiasts who want to participate in global markets without the geographical restrictions and regulations imposed by traditional stock exchanges. By adding Unilever and USO to its suite of dTokens, DeFiChain is ensuring that traders have a wider selection of assets to hedge, diversify, and capitalize on market movements.\n\nWhat Are dTokens, and How Do They Work?\n\nDeFiChain\u2019s dTokens are synthetic assets that mimic the price movements of traditional stocks, commodities, and ETFs. These assets operate on the DeFiChain blockchain and are secured through a decentralized mechanism that eliminates the need for intermediaries. Users can mint, trade, and stake these tokens using DeFiChain\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX), all while maintaining full control over their assets.\n\ndTokens derive their value through an intricate price-oracle mechanism rather than direct backing by the actual assets. This allows users to gain exposure to price movements without the need for brokerage accounts or compliance with traditional stock market regulations.\n\nWhy Unilever and US Oil Fund?\n\nUnilever (UL) dToken\n\nUnilever, a global consumer goods giant, is an interesting choice for DeFiChain\u2019s expansion. As a multinational company with a diverse product portfolio spanning personal care, food, and household products, Unilever presents an attractive option for DeFi investors looking to tap into the consumer goods market. The dToken for Unilever enables traders to speculate on its stock price movements without the limitations of traditional brokerage accounts.\n\nUS Oil Fund (USO) dToken\n\nThe US Oil Fund is one of the most popular exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that tracks the price movements of crude oil. Given the volatility of oil prices and its influence on global markets, DeFi traders now have the ability to engage in decentralized trading strategies without interacting with centralized oil markets. The introduction of the USO dToken allows DeFi investors to hedge against inflation, energy crises, and geopolitical events that affect oil prices.\n\nAdvantages of Trading dTokens on DeFiChain\n\n\u2013 Decentralized Access: No intermediaries, meaning users can trade 24/7 without restrictions.\n\n\u2013 Fractional Ownership: Users can trade even the smallest fractions of traditional assets.\n\n\u2013 Enhanced Liquidity: Trade dTokens on DeFiChain\u2019s DEX with better accessibility.\n\n\u2013 Reduced Barriers to Entry: No need for traditional brokerage accounts or KYC.\n\n\u2013 Security & Transparency: Fully decentralized system secured by DeFiChain\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHow to Get Started with DeFiChain dTokens\n\nIf you\u2019re eager to jump into the DeFi trading arena and explore Unilever and US Oil Fund dTokens, here\u2019s a quick guide:\n\n1. Set Up a Wallet \u2013 Ensure you have a DeFiChain-compatible wallet to store and trade dTokens.\n\n2. Get DFI Tokens \u2013 Acquire DeFiChain\u2019s native token (DFI) to interact with the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n3. Mint or Buy dTokens \u2013 Use your DFI tokens to mint or purchase dTokens for Unilever and USO on DeFiChain\u2019s DEX.\n\n4. Trade and Stake \u2013 Hold, trade, or stake your dTokens to earn passive income while enjoying decentralized exposure to traditional assets.\n\nThe Future of DeFiChain and Synthetic Assets\n\nWith this expansion, DeFiChain is reinforcing its position as a leading force in the DeFi space. The integration of traditional finance with blockchain-powered solutions is a bold step toward a more inclusive financial future. By continuously expanding its dToken offerings, DeFiChain is making decentralized finance accessible to a broader audience, allowing users to experience the power of blockchain without the complexities of traditional markets.\n\nAs DeFi adoption grows, we can expect more innovative assets to be added to DeFiChain\u2019s ecosystem, further bridging the gap between decentralized and traditional finance. The introduction of Unilever and US Oil Fund dTokens marks just the beginning of what\u2019s possible in this ever-evolving landscape.",

            "content": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Hindustan Unilever Limited ( ) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Hindustan Unilever's Net Debt?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2024 Hindustan Unilever had debt of \u20b916.5b, up from \u20b912.7b in one year. However, its balance sheet shows it holds \u20b9129.0b in cash, so it actually has \u20b9112.5b net cash.\n\nHow Strong Is Hindustan Unilever's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Hindustan Unilever had liabilities of \u20b9143.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of \u20b9154.6b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had \u20b9129.0b in cash and \u20b937.1b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling \u20b9131.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nGiven Hindustan Unilever has a humongous market capitalization of \u20b95.11t, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Hindustan Unilever boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nWhile Hindustan Unilever doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Hindustan Unilever can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Hindustan Unilever has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Hindustan Unilever recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 84% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Hindustan Unilever has \u20b9112.5b in net cash. And it impressed us with free cash flow of \u20b9103b, being 84% of its EBIT. So is Hindustan Unilever's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out without delay.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

Expanding what \u2018influencer\u2019 means as a siloed channel, and building creators, community leaders, and storytellers into an end-to-end brand narrative, with diverse touch points, that is more natural, meaningful and un-manufactured.\n\n\u201cThe scale of Unilever, its markets and range of audiences presents an exciting roll out challenge, but it\u2019s a strategy that is more agile, scalable and effective than traditional \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approaches.\u201d",

Similar sentiments were felt when L\u2019Oreal USA bought Lisa Price\u2019s Carol\u2019s Daughter in 2014. It also doesn\u2019t help that Dove, which is under the Unilever umbrella, was recently under scrutiny for an ad that depicts a black woman becoming a white woman after using one of the brand\u2019s body washes.\n\n\n\nWith Dennis still at the helm of Sundial, there\u2019s promise that the company will positively influence Unilever\u2019s venture into the multicultural space.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted Sundial Brands to be an inspiration to other minority-owned companies of how a business against all odds can achieve excellence, have significant social impact in our communities and be successful on a world stage,\u201d said Richelieu Dennis, founder and CEO, Sundial Brands in a press release.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am excited Sundial and Unilever have created this partnership, rooted in a purpose-driven ethos, that represents an incredible opportunity to take our Community Commerce economic empowerment and impact model to another level.\u201d",

            "content": "ROTTERDAM, Netherlands and LONDON, March 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Unilever Food Solutions (UFS) has launched its third annual Future Menus, highlighting four key food service trends for this year. In depth research shows Asian flavours are overtaking traditional European culinary strongholds like France and Italy. Chinese and Japanese cuisines now rank in the top five global favourites across all age groups, while Korean and Mexican flavours are also increasing in demand.\u00b9\n\nThe big culinary shift from West to East and North to South is influencing this year's four distinct global menu trends:\n\nA bold, modern take on global food trends--this vibrant stacked dish showcases the fusion of richly braised meat, creamy cheese, crisp greens, and indulgent toppings, embodying the Future Menus 2025 vision by Unilever Food Solutions. Highlighting culinary innovation, this image represents the evolving landscape of foodservice, where tradition meets creativity to inspire the next wave of chefs and operators worldwide.\n\nStreet Food Couture \u2013 Traditional street foods are being elevated to gourmet offerings with chef expertise in every food service channel, including fine dining. Gen Z is a major driver of this trend, with 65% seeking value for money when it comes to food and dining experiences.\u00b2 Mexican, Indian, Korean, and Filipino street foods are surging, with Filipino cuisine gaining the most traction in the U.S. and Asia.\u00b3 To support chefs, UFS offers products like Hellmann's Real Ancho Chipotle Sauce and Spicy Mayonnaise \u2013 favourites in the U.S. - and ideal for tacos, burritos, spring rolls, dumplings, bao buns, and Korean corn dogs.\n\nBorderless Cuisine \u2013 Globalisation and migration are blending diverse food traditions as chefs honour their multicultural origins. Travellers eager to expand their palates are driving this trend\u201476% of tourists are keen to explore local food cultures.\u2074 The growing integration of Eastern flavours into Western cuisine is being enabled by key ingredients like Knorr Professional's best selling Chicken Powder, which delivers an authentic umami boost. This helps chefs blend traditional flavours to create something unique. For example, bringing Southeast Asian spice to classics like pasta, stews and burgers.\n\nCulinary Roots \u2013 Chefs are reviving culinary heritage by uncovering lesser-known and forgotten recipes, ingredients and hyperlocal cuisines like Hunan, Emirati, Basque, and Oaxacan.\u2075 UFS' international team of 250 in-house chefs empower customers in their regions to embrace and promote indigenous food traditions with creative recipes and technique inspiration.\n\nDiner Designed \u2013 Growing demand for personalised and immersive dining experiences is driving this trend, with 47% of people now preferring to spend money on experiences over material goods.\u2076 UFS supports businesses with training, menu engineering, and the easy integration of menu trends.\n\n\"Future Menus ensures chefs are prepped to meet evolving diner demands by tapping into the top menu trends,\" said Star Chen, CEO of Unilever Food Solutions. \"We provide more than 3 million customers worldwide with expert insights, recipe inspiration and professional products to satisfy growing appetites for the Asian and South American flavours identified in this year's research. Future Menus is going from strength to strength each year, helping chefs to stay on trend and contributing to double digit growth for our business. In fact, 7 out of 10 customers say they would recommend UFS to others today.\"\n\nThe Future Menus trends book will be followed by locally tailored editions on ufs.com throughout the year, showcasing top dishes and recipes designed to meet specific diner demands in the countries where UFS operates.\n\nAbout Unilever Food Solutions\n\nUnilever Food Solutions (UFS) is a business of chefs for chefs, operating in over 75 countries and accounting for 20% of Unilever's Foods Business Group.

According to the decuple from jan-2024, The pandemic accelerated retail digitalization in China, and snack food sales via e-commerce channels have been proliferating ever since. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show China registered online retail sales of 14 trillion yuan ($1.92 trillion) in the first 11 months, up 7.4 percent over the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\nUrbanization and Changing Lifestyles\n\n\n\nChina's continued process of urbanization has increased the disposable income as well as modified consumer behavior, thus further increasing the urge for portable easy-to-eat snack foods. Cities' residents are looking for packaged snack foods which are easy to consume and allow them to save time in their very hectic schedules of work.\n\nConsequently, packaged read-to-eat foods such as protein bars, chips, biscuits, etc, are gaining popularity due to this fact.

Make our brands, make our best brand travel fast,\" he explained.\n\nHe stressed the importance of adapting to rapid changes in consumer preferences and channel dynamics, especially in markets like China and Indonesia.\n\nFuture Vision",

But Unilever's position in India remained exceptional and it has gained 200 basis points in the last three years.\"The rise of affluent India is very important - there are 60 million households of the 320 million households in India that have serious money,\" he said. \"The economically active population in India is 430 million, so it's 30% (of the entire population) and probably the lowest in the world. There are 80 million female workers in India in a 750 million female population. Every time women get into the labour force at a scale, companies like Unilever really have a tailwind. I am very bullish about the long-term prospects of India regarding the changes in consumer preferences.\"In India, the contribution of quick commerce to ecommerce sales has been doubling every year on a small base. Quick commerce started off as a top-up service for last-minute purchases for groceries and small-ticket items, but is now the fastest-growing sales channel, especially for premium portfolios. Quick commerce accounts for 2% of HUL's revenue but Fernandez said he expects the new-age channel to contribute 10-15% in the next three-four years.Two months ago, HUL acquired direct-to-consumer beauty brand Minimalist for about Rs 3,000 crore, strengthening its position in a high-growth, premium-demand space in a key market. Also, consumer preferences in beauty are changing faster than other categories and the latest acquisition is an indication of how it will premiumise its portfolio faster.\"India is a very special place because richer Indians and poorer Indians live in close proximity that basically provide demand and supply of labour, making quick commerce a logical channel to grow,\" he said, adding that the mix in the channel is much better and favourable for margin improvement. \"The only category in which we have some headwinds due to channel and segment development is in beauty. We have tailwinds in home care, in personal care, in foods, so it's not that we have a portfolio that has to be completely rebuilt in India.\"",

            "content": "New Delhi: As Unilever ramps up its social-first strategy, increasing its marketing spend from 30% to 50%, CEO Fernando Fernandez has reaffirmed the company\u2019s strong commitment to influencer-driven marketing.\n\nIn a conversation with Warren Ackerman of Barclays, Fernandez stated, \"Desirability at scale and marketing activity systems of \u2018other say\u2019 will be the fundamental principles of our marketing strategy.\"\n\nFernandez underscored the importance of \"other say\" marketing, explaining, \"Today, brands\u2014by definition and by default\u2014are met with skepticism when their messages come directly from corporations. So, creating marketing activity systems where others can speak for your brand at scale is incredibly important. Influencers, celebrities, TikTokers\u2014these are the voices that matter.\"\n\nUnveiling an ambitious influencer strategy, Fernandez outlined a vision for hyper-local engagement: \"There are 19,000 zip codes in India and 5,764 municipalities in Brazil. I want at least one influencer in each of them. In some, I want 100. That\u2019s a significant shift. It requires a machine-like approach to content creation\u2014very different from what we\u2019ve done in the past. AI will play a crucial role in this, and I\u2019m absolutely committed. This is one of the things I will drive like hell in the company over the next few years.\"\n\nFernandez also revealed a significant increase in Unilever's marketing investment, emphasising its critical role in brand growth. \"We spent 13.1% in 2022, increased to 14.3% in 2023, then 15.1% in the first half of 2024, and 15.9% in the second half of 2024. We're pleased that our improved gross margin has enabled us to reinvest in brand building. We believe a marketing spend of 15\u201316% keeps us at competitive levels.\"\n\nHe further expressed a firm stance against underinvestment: \"I follow a principle I learned from an old boss\u2014being consciously uncompetitive is a criminal act. We will always ensure our investment levels keep us competitive.\"\n\nFinally, Fernandez emphasised the importance of measuring returns on these investments: \"We now use UBS methodology to measure brand performance and its impact on brand equity. We have a very clear understanding of the returns on all these efforts. The key question is not whether returns are higher than in the past, but whether they are higher than any alternative allocation of funds today.\"",

This partnership strengthens the ICC's ambition to accelerate the development of women's cricket on a global scale, kicking off at the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 in India.\n\nThe partnership will include other major events in the international calendar including Women's T20 World Cups, U19 Women's T20 World Cups and the inaugural Women's Champions Trophy in 2027.\n\nRexona is the world's leading deodorant brand, with a purpose to inspire people to move more and give them confidence to break their limits. Ranging from the Flag Bearers programme to digital initiatives and experiences during event time, ICC and Rexona will work across a range of activities that aim to break barriers and give confidence to women and girls on the world stage.\n\nBeyond major events, Rexona will play a pivotal role in enabling participation through a series of women's criiio festivals while using its science and technology expertise to lend support and collaborate on education programmes around women's hygiene.\n\nICC Chairman Jay Shah said: \"This International Women's Day, we are proud to announce a groundbreaking partnership with Unilever, which signifies a pivotal moment for women's cricket. By aligning with a global leader like Unilever and its personal care brands for the ICC's first-ever women's partnership, we are not only securing valuable commercial support but also reinforcing the growing importance of women's sports on the world stage.\n\nThis collaboration will empower female cricketers, inspire future generations, and contribute significantly to the continued growth and success of women's cricket globally.\n\nICC Chief Commercial Officer Anurag Dahiya said: \"We are delighted to welcome Unilever's personal care brands, including Rexona and Dove, to the ICC Commercial Partner Programme in this breakthrough partnership.\"\n\n\"The ICC has taken the forward-thinking approach to pursue more partnerships with a focus on the women's game, and we are delighted to see this come to fruition through this exciting deal, which not only highlights the growing commercial appeal of women's cricket but also underlines ICC's position as one of the pioneers of the women's sports movement.\"\n\nRohit Jawa, CEO & Managing Director, Hindustan Unilever, said: \"This is an exciting opportunity for Rexona, one of our biggest Personal Care brands, to tap into a cultural moment, connect with new audiences, and importantly help drive women's cricket further.

            "content": "When Unilever made its surprise announcement last week that it would replace chief executive officer (CEO) Hein Schumacher, the board was about as blunt as boards tend to get in a corporate press release.\n\n\u201cWhile the Board is pleased with Unilever\u2019s performance in 2024, there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results,\" said Unilever chairman Ian Meakin in the announcement. Schumacher will be replaced by current Unilever chief financial officer (CFO) Fernando Fernandez, who has the ability \u201cto drive change at speed\" and capitalize on the company\u2019s growth plan \u201cwith urgency.\"\n\nIt all came down to that one word, much beloved by Wall Street: urgency. In the end, the board decided that if Schumacher was not going to move fast enough, it would. Just 20 months into his tenure, Schumacher was out.\n\nIt\u2019s not fun for a board to replace a chief executive, which is why CEOs often hold onto their jobs longer than they should. Big transitions can open up a company to big risks, and a board never quite knows how chief executives will perform until they\u2019re in the chair.\n\nBut in this age of urgency, driven by impatient shareholders, boards are giving their CEOs less time to execute their business strategies or turn things around before deciding it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nI\u2019ll diagnose it as a serious case of corporate FOMO\u2014fear that if they don\u2019t have the right leader in place, they will miss out on the opportunities that can come in rapid moments of change. While that risk might be real, boards need to balance that against pushing out talented executives before they have time to deliver results.\n\n\u201cMore than I\u2019ve ever seen, boards will say their companies are at a crossroads right now,\" said Jim Citrin, partner and lead of the CEO practice at executive search firm Spencer Stuart.\n\nIt\u2019s a critical moment to leverage technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) and changing consumer behaviour such as personalization and e-commerce, but they realize \u2018if we don\u2019t capitalize on it, we\u2019re going to be roadkill.\u2019\n\nAlso Read: How AI is transforming the role of venture capital for startups\n\nAn analysis of the Russell 3000 Index by Exechange.com found that more CEOs were fired or forced out in 2024 than at any point since the firm began tracking the metric in 2017. And overall, Spencer Stuart found that the tenure of departed CEOs of S&P 500 companies was 8.3 years in 2024, a low since 2017 and down by about three years since a 2021 high of 11.2 years.\n\nIn the last six months or so, a slew of high-profile exits have clocked in under that average. Bernard Kim departed as CEO of Match Group in February after less than three years in the job, unable to stem a user exodus from its flagship dating app Tinder.\n\nIn January, David Kimbell was gone from Ulta Beauty after 3.5 years in the face of greater competition; in December, Patrick Gelsinger was out as Intel. CEO after less than four years, having lost the confidence of the board in his turnaround plan; two months earlier, Karen Lynch exited from CVS Health after 3.5 years amid earnings misses; and Laxman Narasimhan didn\u2019t even make it a year and a half at Starbucks before the board pushed him out in August as activists circled and the stock price cratered.\n\nThat same month, David Calhoun left Boeing Company after less than four years, the aeroplane maker\u2019s safety crisis making his continuation in the job untenable.\n\nPart of what\u2019s behind the decline is a shifting mindset among corporate directors, who are getting more hands-on and are unwilling to act as a rubber stamp for their CEOs. This move toward more \u2018active management\u2019 started in 2002 with Sarbanes-Oxley and really ramped up during the pandemic, Citrin told me.\n\nThis is particularly true of big companies; Spencer Stuart found that between 2010 and 2024, there were significantly more forced exits at S&P 500 companies than S&P 600\u201415% versus 6%. \u201cThe bigger the board, the more professional they are and the more they hold their CEO accountable,\" said Claudius Hildebrand, a consultant at the search firm and co-author of The Life Cycle of a CEO.\n\nYet boards should be wary of thinking that a CEO change is going to be some magical overnight cure for all of their problems. Look at Boeing, which is still burning through cash despite the CEO switch. Or Starbucks, where sales have continued to fall under new CEO Brian Niccol.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that Starbucks hired Niccol in the first place because he transformed a faltering Chipotle Mexican Grill into one of the quick-service food industry\u2019s biggest success stories.\n\nThat turnaround took time, as most do. The board didn\u2019t give him a pass; it was just willing to be patient. \u00a9Bloomberg",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) stands against the other skincare stocks.\n\nAccording to NielsenIQ, the global beauty market is expected to increase by 7.3% annually to reach $1 trillion in 2025, with Latin America by 19.1% and Africa-Middle East by 27.1% leading the way. Since TikTok Shop is the eighth-largest health and beauty shop in the US and generates around $1 billion in sales, e-commerce now accounts for 41% of US beauty sales. Nevertheless, 43% of customers believe that anti-theft methods like locked shelves discourage them from returning to a store. The fragrance and bath & shower segments drove the US beauty market\u2019s 6.2% sales growth in 2024. Boomers choose product efficacy and anti-aging remedies, while Gen Z stresses skincare and values-driven companies. As a result, brands must implement data-driven generational strategies. To retain customer trust and relevance across changing demographics, successful beauty players will strike a balance between innovation and sustainability, integrating digital and physical shopping, and guaranteeing inclusivity and transparency.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, Circana reported that sales in the US beauty industry have increased for the fourth consecutive year. According to the report, mass-market beauty sales rose by 3% in 2024, while prestige beauty sales climbed 7% year over year to $33.9 billion. The fastest-growing prestige category was fragrance, which now accounts for 28% of prestige beauty sales and is the second-largest prestige category with double-digit unit growth and dollar sales up 12%. The growth rates for eau de parfums and parfums were 14% and 43%, respectively. Sales of high-end products surged by 12%, while sales of body sprays and hair fragrances jumped by 94% and 32%.\n\nSpecifically, skincare concluded the year as the slowest-growing category in the prestige market, with dollar sales up 2% and units expanding slightly faster\u2014and a modest rise in both metrics in the mass market. Since top-performing masstige brands that are distributed across markets are propelling growth in both, skincare has emerged as the market that is best aligned across mass and prestige. Face cleansers and lip treatments were among the standout categories in the premium market. Body care products, such as lotions, creams, cleansers, and hand soaps, continued to outperform the facial market.\n\nAs per Circana\u2019s report, the beauty industry continues to evolve as a result of the \u201cskinification\u201d of beauty, which involves incorporating skincare ingredients into body care, hair care, and makeup products. The first half of 2024 saw a 7% spike in U.S. skincare sales, with unit sales up 10% YoY. Body care and sun care are driving this growth, outpacing facial care as retinoids, AHAs, and vitamin C penetrate into these markets. Furthermore, this innovation drove double-digit growth in makeup sales, driven by serum foundations that give skin benefits and coverage and are packed with niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and squalane. Hybrid makeup-skincare products are sought after by more than half of American consumers, with 60% of Gen Z and Millennials giving them top priority. Even the haircare industry has adopted skinification; salicylic and glycolic acids are popular for scalp care, and fragrance companies are experimenting with alcohol-free formulas to cater to sensitive skin. Brands must innovate and educate to remain competitive as consumers\u2019 demands for multipurpose, benefit-driven products grow.",

Credit: Unilever media files\n\nUnilever CEO Fernando Fernandez has set course to fashion a \u201cmachine of demand creation\u201d, with a focus on \u201cgeographical anchors\u201d in the US and India.\n\n\n\nInnovation, with a slant to premium, is one of the core aspirations of Fernandez\u2019s strategy as he outlined his priorities yesterday (6 March) in a chat with Barclays\u2019 head of consumer staples Warren Ackermann.\n\n\n\nWith less than two weeks under his belt since replacing CEO Hein Schumacher, Fernandez seemed to make a commitment to the food component of Unilever\u2019s portfolio, but plans to speed up disposals of \u201cnon-core\u201d assets in Europe.\n\n\n\nFernandez said at the Barclays Fireside chat event that the immediate-term objectives are to complete the demerger of the ice-cream business on target by year-end and complete the productivity programme set in motion by Schumacher, now earmarked for around June.\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel in the long term, it is all about creating a machine of demand creation in Unilever. I have always said that in a one-to-ten scale, I\u2019d probably score us a six,\u201d the Unilever veteran of 37 years said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the long run, any company that is a best performer tends to have a couple of very strong geographical anchors. I believe that the US and India should be our geographical anchors in the long run.\u201d\n\n\n\nFernandez put the premium portion of Unilever\u2019s portfolio at 35% but the new CEO is seeking to build that to about 50% \u2013 and \u201cdesirability\u201d led \u2013 as he hinted at bolt-on acquisitions in the US and India, while ruling out any \u201ctransformational\u201d M&A.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a great believer that there are always inefficiencies in the company. If you tackle them, you release money that you can put behind your brands, and you build a virtuous circle of volume growth, investment, more profit, more volume growth,\u201d he explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have to build portfolio resilience to deal with economic volatility, and you have to have clever pricing management to deal with that.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn terms of food, a segment of Unilever\u2019s portfolio that has long attracted speculation for divestment, Fernandez said \u201cit\u2019s a very attractive business\u201d, adding: \u201cIt gives us a lot of flexibility and we are committed to grow that business.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, he repeated Schumacher\u2019s observation that Unilever has around \u20ac1bn ($1.1bn) tied up in \u201cnon-core\u201d food brands, and while some disposals, particularly in the Netherlands, have been completed, the process has \u201cnot really been happening that quickly\u201d.\n\n\n\nA further \u20ac500m of food and \u201cother categories\u201d are also considered as non-core, \u201cparticularly in the smaller markets\u201d in which Unilever operates. \u201cProbably we will also act on that,\u201d Fernandez said.\n\n\n\nOutlining his assessment of food, Fernandez added: \u201cKnorr is our-second largest brand. Hellmann\u2019s is our fifth-largest brand. They are accretive in margin, they are accretive in terms of cash generation [and] they have a huge return on investing capital.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are 60% of our food business, and the two categories in which they play are 70% of our food business. So our food business is not a classic food business.\n\n\n\n\u201cI internally call it edible personal care because the margin structure of that business is very similar to the personal care one.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough Fernandez did not pin point categories for potential M&A, he made a clear commitment to grow Unilever\u2019s business in the US and India, along with China and Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel fixing some of the geographical issues we have \u2013 China, Indonesia, accelerating India \u2013 is very important for me at this point of time,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have not been good enough in rolling out our brands globally. I believe in the long run, we need more widest presence of our strongest brands. I feel we have made a significant step with the top-30 brands and the focus we are putting on them, but I believe we can go faster in rollout, continue driving optimisation of our portfolio into premium, with a good programme for total acquisitions and disposals.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added with respect to potential M&A in the US.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe US is a very important market because it\u2019s probably the only market that gives you two things. It gives you enough local critical mass, and it gives you a platform for global brands because American brands tend to travel.\u201d",

The Web series supporting Sprint TV, Unilever's Suave brand and MSN, called \"In the Motherhood,\" will run on MSN.com starting this week through June and will be supported by a partnership with \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\"\n\nThe program, the result of a joint initiative between Suave and Sprint Nextel and created by MindShare Entertainment, entails consumers who are moms, who have the opportunity to submit their own ideas for scripts and also do some of the writing for the show, which profiles the lives of three mom girlfriends.\n\nAlthough the characters and story lines are being developed by Hollywood scribes, the material will come from consumers, who will be encouraged via integrated advertising to describe their experiences in narrative form, not as a script, at inthemotherhood.com. An \"online mom\" community will vote for the best entries, which the pros will polish and put in the Webisodes.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nSuave and Sprint are promoting via integration with \"DeGeneres,\" which will publicize the series for 10 weeks, and print promos in People magazine. \"DeGeneres\" will run segments within the show showing clips of the five Webisodes and detailing how the videos were made. The first will air on May 11 and subsequent Webisodes will air on May 22 and 29 and June 5 and 12.\n\nThe Web site will offer games, blogging and peer-to-peer conversation. They also can be viewed at suave.com as well as on Sprint TV, available on Sprint Power Vision phones.\n\nAnita Newton, VP marketing at Sprint, says that while Sprint will promote the series only on Sprint TV, the effort is meant to pitch the Sprint brand and the portfolio of cell phones and services as solutions for busy moms.\n\nAmong those services are the Sprint Music Store, which offers wireless music downloads to Sprint Power Vision phones for 99 cents per download; Sprint Navigation, a GPS turn-by-turn direction guidance system; Sprint Family Locator, and the Sprint TV and Sprint Picture mail.\n\nBoth Suave and Sprint have mom-directed marketing programs. Suave has an exclusive partnership with the Hot Moms Club, an online community. The brand, per a release, has developed a study of 3,000 mothers nationwide.\n\nNewton suggests Sprint might be working with Unilever on other projects directed to women.",

            "content": "This week's PR Roundup looks at how Ben & Jerry's and Unilever would have to approach decoupling from a communications standpoint, if Apple's new product announcements were an opportunity or mistake, and how bird flu is affecting companies you may not have thought of.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s Meltdown with Unilever\n\nWhat happened: Sometimes bigger isn\u2019t always better.\n\nIt\u2019s been reported that Ben & Jerry\u2019s founders are interested in buying back their ice cream company from Unilever. According to a recent Bloomberg report, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield are not happy with the parent company\u2019s efforts to silence the brand\u2019s social and political commentary over the past several years.\n\nFor example, in 2021, the brand decided to stop selling its ice cream in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, citing it as stolen land from Palestinians. More recently, Ben & Jerry\u2019s said Unilever stopped its plans to make a statement calling for a ceasefire and end to the war in Gaza. It\u2019s also been blocked by Unilever from making any statements regarding the current U.S. President, Donald Trump.\n\nThe brand was originally sold for $326 million to Unilever in 2000. Twenty-five years later, Ben & Jerry\u2019s is now worth upwards of billions of dollars. It won\u2019t be easy for the founders to buy it back, even though reports say Unilever is eager to spin its ice cream division off.\n\nIt\u2019s a sticky situation, but in reality this partnership could melt down at any time. (Had to do it).\n\nCommunication takeaways: Anyone who\u2019s grown up with Ben & Jerry\u2019s knows the brand\u2019s vibe: hippie, free-thinking, creative and do-gooding. It makes sense that its founders would like to preserve that.\n\nBut a buy-back of any brand consists of major steps which include a variety of stakeholders. It\u2019s not just the owners who are involved, but employees, customers, investors and more.\n\nSeth Horowitz, President, Horowitz Agency, says when a popular brand joins a multinational CPG company, and the owners then decide to buy back the brand in order to realize more autonomy, there have to be compelling reasons communicated for doing so.\n\n\u201cFrom a customer relations standpoint, one or more of the reasons must reinforce the brand\u2019s ability to provide a better experience or added value,\u201d Horowitz says. \u201cUnilever has made it clear that it wants to focus on rapid growth. Sometimes rapid growth comes at the expense of the customer experience.\u201d\n\nHorowitz also notes the delicate communications strategy that must be understood from a legal standpoint.\n\n\u201cUnilever will be best served to have the Ben & Jerry\u2019s founders and departing executives sign a separation agreement that protects the interests of both Unilever and Ben & Jerry\u2019s, including a non-disparagement clause to ensure that both Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Unilever use positive public-facing language for the reasons behind the separation.\u201d\n\nApple Announces New Products: In this Economy?!\n\nWhat happened: This week Apple announced the debut of its newest iPad and MacBook Air models. The new MacBook will include a faster M4 chip and an upgraded video conferencing camera. The latest iPads also have new chips and increased storage.\n\nThe releases come at an interesting time when considering U.S. economic activities. Many federal workers across the country are losing their jobs, and announcements of tariffs on countries like China, a large manufacturing hub for Apple, will have an impact on electronic imports.\n\nHowever, the company also dropped the price on computers by $100 and has not increased the prices on iPads\u2014yet.\n\nCommunication takeaways: Some may say that Apple did not announce its new products at the right time, and instead needed to \u201cread the room\u201d regarding the current economy. Adam Ritchie, Principal at Adam Ritchie Brand Direction and author of \"Invention in PR,\" believes Apple\u2019s audience is so strong and knowledgeable that the company can be given some grace when it comes to making product announcements.\n\n\u201cApple has always run on its own clock\u2014or smartwatch,\u201d Ritchie says. \u201cIt issues new product announcements on its own schedule because it can. And when those announcements come, consumers expect a significant price increase, even if the features aren't a quantum leap forward.\u201d\n\nAnd historically, Apple does not do discounts. Ritchie says the company did show it was \u201creading the room\u201d with the price cut.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it offered a price cut this time \u2026 sets a precedent for other premium brands to do the same,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's not particularly shrewd. It's coming from a common sense desire to not become prohibitively expensive in a laptop category which peaked years ago.\u201d\n\nCat Food Recall Shows a Bird Flu Issue Response\n\nWhat happened: Avian flu is not only affecting the cost and availability of eggs.\n\nAs the virus mutates, it is spreading to other mammals including dairy cows, cats and dogs. According to the Centers for Disease Control, \u201cmammals can be infected with H5N1 bird flu viruses when they eat infected birds, poultry or other animals and/or if they are exposed to environments contaminated with virus.\u201d\n\nA Washington state-based pet food company, Wild Coast, announced a recall on its cat food products as a precautionary measure after two domestic cats in Washington state tested positive for bird flu and reportedly both ate the brand\u2019s food. One cat passed away after euthanization due to the severity of its illness.\n\nWild Coast posted a letter on its website alerting customers of possible products contaminated with bird flu virus, including its frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula raw pet food for cats. The letter includes product codes, reasoning for the recall, an explanation of the company\u2019s food processing and what will come next. It also expressed condolences.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our products and that of our customers\u2019 beloved pets is always our top priority. We were devastated to learn of the passing of a beloved pet, and our hearts go out to the owner,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nCommunication takeaways: Dan Rene, Strategic Communications Counselor at Dan Rene Communications, who also serves as a cat dad to Isla, notes that pets are more than companions to many.\n\n\u201cCompanies that recognize the importance of this bond will be the most successful as they communicate news that impacts them,\u201d Rene says. \u201cIn Wild Coast Pets\u2019 letter to customers, they acknowledge and empathize with the loss of a pet, which is important.\u201d\n\nRene also says the brand\u2019s ongoing commitment to safety should be communicated and demonstrated.\n\n\u201cEven after a recall, brands should demonstrate a commitment to safety through enhanced testing, independent audits and public-facing updates on preventative measures,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have seen many brands emerge stronger after handling these situations effectively. Ongoing reassurance (such as updates on testing and future safeguards) will help their customers maintain confidence.\u201d\n\nMany communicators also learned intense lessons during the COVID pandemic, and unfortunately, the avian flu is something that could also affect stakeholders in different industries.\n\n\u201cI hope there isn\u2019t further escalation with bird flu, but after COVID, most organizations should already have protocols in place for symptom monitoring, reporting illness and workplace safety,\u201d Rene says. \u201cWe need to keep these ideas top of mind, and communicate expectations to employees, visitors, suppliers, etc.\u201d\n\nBonus: March 8 Is International Women\u2019s Day\n\nAccording to Page Center research, women make up about 70% of the public relations industry. It\u2019s important to remember why days like International Women\u2019s Day are so important and to honor women who get the job done.\n\nThe National Organization for Women President, Christian F. Nunes, provided PRNEWS with a statement on what the day should mean to everyone. We thank her for her response and dedicate it to all of our female colleagues and friends.\n\n\u201cInternational Women's Day started as a women's labor strike against sex discrimination in the workplace,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cIt supports equal pay for equal work, the right to vote, the right to hold public office and other political issues affecting women. This day serves as a reminder of the brave women advocates who came before us and a call to action to move forward together toward a future where all people's rights are protected and honored. It's also a celebration of women, our contributions and an acknowledgment of what we still have to accomplish.\u201d\n\nNicole Schuman is Managing Editor at PRNEWS.",

Mudaly was most recently the GM of sales at Essano, where he was responsible for driving development across numerous channels and major retail banners in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\u201cThe next year will be about re-founding Ice Cream to create a world-leading, stand-alone business with greater flexibility and autonomy,\u201d said Mudaly.\n\n\u201cThis will enable us to focus, move with pace, and foster closer collaborations with our customers to deliver market-leading availability, category growth, and perfect execution.

            "content": "Unilever Bangladesh Limited (UBL), the country\u2019s premier Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company, announces the launch of life insurance policy for waste workers as part of its plastic waste management initiative in Chattogram, a press release said on Thursday, March 6.\n\nIn line with its global ambition to end plastic pollution through reduction, circulation, and collaboration, Unilever is driving a transformative change in the plastic waste value chain in Bangladesh. Since 2020, the company has established an innovative and scalable circular model for plastic waste, successfully collecting more plastic than what it uses in its product packaging.\n\nDespite their crucial role, waste pickers often face significant challenges, working under hazardous conditions with limited access to safety measures and personal protective equipment (PPE). They collect and sort up to 60% of recyclable plastic waste but frequently endure severe health and safety risks, including injuries and fatalities.\n\nTo address these issues, UBL has collaborated with government, experts, and NGOs to create a socially-just circular economy. In partnership with MetLife Bangladesh and Young Power in Social Action (YPSA), UBL\u2019s groundbreaking initiative aims to enhance the wellbeing and livelihood of Chattogram\u2019s waste workers by providing comprehensive life insurance coverage.\n\nThe agreement signing ceremony was attended by Sheikh Muhammad Tauhidul Islam, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Chattogram City Corporation (CCC); Zaved Akhtar, Chairman and Managing Director of UBL; Ala Ahmad, CEO of MetLife Bangladesh; Md Arifur Rahman, CEO of YPSA; Shamima Akhter, Director of Corporate Affairs, Partnerships & Communications at UBL; and Md Kamruzzaman, Director and Head of Employee Benefits, MetLife Bangladesh, along with other senior officials.\n\nUnder this initiative, 1,827 waste workers involved in the plastic waste management programme will receive life and health coverage, ensuring their financial stability. Eligible workers can receive compensation of up to 150,000 BDT, with benefits extending to 100% of the insured sum for specified medical conditions. In addition, insurance coverage of up to three lakh taka will be provided in case of accidental death. The scheme also includes reimbursements for essential healthcare costs, such as physician consultations and hospital charges.\n\nZaved Akhtar, Chairman and Managing Director of Unilever Bangladesh Limited, stated, \u201cUnilever Bangladesh has been championing the Plastic Sustainability initiative as part of its commitment to ending plastic pollution. The individuals collecting plastic in the informal economy play an integral role in our solution\u2014 without them, scaling plastic collection is impossible. By enhancing the health, safety, and human rights of waste workers, we set a benchmark for a socially-just circular economy today. I believe this initiative will encourage others to step forward, and together we can build a more equitable future.\u201d\n\nAla Ahmad, Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Bangladesh, said, \u201cWe are delighted to partner with UBL and YPSA, as this industry-leading initiative highlights the importance of insurance in building stronger communities. Our longstanding experience of serving around 10 lakh individual customers and 900 corporate clients has enabled us to develop the insurance solution that not only improves the livelihood of waste workers but also provides them assurance to build a confident future.\u201d\n\nMd Arifur Rahman Chief Executive YPSA, said, \"YPSA has worked for this plastic waste management project in Chattogram since 2022, and waste workers have always been at the heart of our efforts. Through our partnership with Unilever Bangladesh, we are not only improving plastic waste management but also securing a better future for waste workers and their families. The insurance coverage introduced under this initiative ensures financial stability, safer working conditions, and long-term economic security. This collaboration will collectively empower the waste workers, giving them a future of potential and prosperity.\"\n\nUnilever Bangladesh, in a multi-stakeholder partnership, launched a plastic waste management project in Chattogram in 2022, aiming to collect more plastic than it sells. Since 2022, it has collected over 21750 tonnes of plastic waste and upskilled over 3000 waste workers, improving their livelihoods. Expanding its impact, the innovative project now targets 10% of Chattogram\u2019s plastic waste, strengthening more than 5,000 waste workers' socioeconomic well-being.",

            "content": "For over a century, Lifebuoy has been synonymous with germ protection\u2014shielding millions from everyday transmittable germs and illnesses with an unwavering commitment to hygiene. During COVID-19 Lifebuoy emerged as the 1st brand globally to prove its efficacy against the SARS-CoV2 virus and led the communication on using the power of handwashing with soap to prevent the spread of infection. It has stood the test of time, adapting to global health needs while remaining a household staple.\n\nSo, what's changing? Everything, but also, not everything.\n\nLifebuoy is no longer just about germ protection anymore\u2014it\u2019s about skin protection. As skin concerns like rashes, acne, and dryness take centre stage, the brand is evolving to offer comprehensive skincare with powerful germ protection.\n\nLifebuoy\u2019s big transformation involves pivoting the brand from germ protection to unmatched skin protection, changing packaging, and creating new communication. Vipul Mathur, Executive Director, Personal Care.\n\nThe science of protection with Stratos\n\nAt the core of this transformation is the revolutionary (and patented) Stratos Technology\u2014a breakthrough, novel, skin-friendly formula that uses 100% plant-based polysaccharides scientifically designed to protect skin while bathing and strengthen it from within.\n\nUnlike high-TFM soaps (containing large quantities of harsh insoluble soaps) that can strip away natural moisture and weaken the skin\u2019s defenses, Lifebuoy\u2019s new formulation is engineered for balance\u2014providing gentleness without compromising efficacy. All the benefits are delivered in a skin friendly formula that is significantly better than ordinary beauty bars in terms of mildness and many other attributes.\n\nThis new formula, with Stratos and powerful actives derived from nature, effectively protects against a wide range of germs, especially those that cause skin infections. By reinforcing the natural skin barrier, it helps mitigate issues such as rashes, dryness, irritation, and sensitivity\u2014problems often exacerbated by germs and harsh cleansing routines.\n\nThe new Lifebuoy formulation is a science-backed innovation that ensures hygiene is delivered in tandem with skin barrier reinforcement, setting a new standard for protection.\n\nUnlike ordinary soaps, Lifebuoy is superior for skin health and yet, stronger on germs. It fights against skin infection-causing germs and is designed to provide 100% superior protection against germs that cause rashes, itchiness and acne. Nitish Kumar, Global Head R&D, Lifebuoy.\n\nA new look that reflects a bigger purpose\n\nA transformation this big deserves a bold new identity. And it extends beyond cosmetic updates to deliver a visual commitment to its new purpose.\n\nThe iconic red remains, a testament to efficacy and trust, while white elements emphasize gentleness and dermatological credibility.\n\nThis fresh, modern look ensures that Lifebuoy continues to stand out on shelves and in the minds of consumers looking for a soap that cleans, cares, and strengthens.\n\nMaking waves at Mahakumbh Mela\n\nLifebuoy has always been deeply intertwined with India\u2019s cultural and social fabric. So, what better way to announce this game-changing relaunch than at the world\u2019s largest human gathering\u2014Maha Kumbh Mela 2025?\n\nLifebuoy made a spectacular impact with a breathtaking drone show, lighting up the skies and capturing the attention of millions of attendees. The on-ground buzz was electric, with reactions pouring in as people witnessed a brand, they\u2019ve trusted for generations unveil its bold new chapter.\n\nJavaScript must be enabled to view this content\n\nShah Rukh Khan: The face of Lifebuoy\u2019s new era\n\nLifebuoy has joined forces with Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) a renowned Bollywood actor. With unparalleled credibility and massive reach, SRK is the perfect ambassador to champion Lifebuoy\u2019s all-new transformation.\n\nThe future of protection\n\nHygiene is now part of a larger health and wellness ecosystem, and consumers expect brands to bridge the gap seamlessly. This shift underscores the need for brands like Lifebuoy to stay ahead by redefining the parameters of protection, ensuring every household has access to a soap that cleans, cares, and delivers proven skin health and hygiene benefits.\n\nAs Lifebuoy enters this new phase, the brand mission remains clear: to keep families safe, healthy, and confident in their skin. The progression from germ protection to skin protection is an evolution that ensures protection is holistic, scientifically grounded, and future focused.",

            "content": "For all the corporate drama at Unilever, shareholders had relatively little to complain about in 2024. Revenue growth was good, profit margins were heading in the right direction and the FTSE 100 group delivered a total return of 24 per cent in the year, ahead of its bigger American rival Procter & Gamble at 17 per cent. Yet its chief executive, Hein Schumacher, has been pushed out after only 20 months in the job.\n\nUnilever, which owns a huge stable of brands ranging from Dove soap to Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, had been undergoing one of its many transformation plans under Schumacher \u2014 its \u201cgrowth action plan\u201d to boost productivity and get its growth back on track. It was the latest in a series of big strategic revamps, after a \u201csustainable living plan\u201d in 2012, \u201cconnected 4 growth\u201d in 2016 and \u201ccompass for sustainable growth\u201d in 2020.\n\nIt had been progressing well, with a sharper focus on its best brands, improving sales and the imminent spin-off of its \u00a313 billion ice cream division. In 2018 its return on invested capital, which measures how effectively it profits from its investments, stood at 28.9 per cent. Last year this stood at 18.1 per cent, though that marked an improvement of almost one percentage point against 2023. Gross margins have improved too, at less than 40 per cent in 2022 to 45 per cent at the end of last year.\n\nThe decision to appoint the chief financial officer Fernando Fernandez as chief executive appears to be down to his management style \u2014 the Argentinian, who has been at Unilever since 1988, is reported to have a more \u201cmaverick\u201d approach. The theory is that he is perhaps less worried about unsettling people if necessary and could achieve better and faster results.\n\nNo doubt his in-tray will be overflowing, especially as shareholders ramp up pressure on the group to slim down. Unilever has been pursuing a listing of its ice cream division in Amsterdam and, under Schumacher, pledged to sell up to \u00a31 billion in food brands. It has already sold off chunks of its food business over the past decade, including spreads and tea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ice cream business was an obvious target, given it is much less profitable than the rest of the group, partly because of the expensive freezing process. Its operating profit margin stood at just under 7 per cent last year, compared with an average of 16.7 per cent in the four other divisions.\n\nBut Fernandez is likely to face further calls to spin off its \u20ac13.4 billion food business, too. It is not hard to see why: such a move would leave a more homogeneous beauty, personal care and home care group, though there are some worries that removing the food division from Unilever\u2019s vast and interconnected supply chain could be a headache.\n\nUnilever still benefits from very strong brand power \u2014 Dove alone generated roughly \u20ac5 billion in sales in 2024. More than half of the group\u2019s turnover comes from emerging markets, with a particularly strong presence in India, China, Brazil and Indonesia, so it should benefit from rising levels of consumption in most of these countries. As such, Unilever remains a popular investment among pro stock pickers, including the fund manager Terry Smith, who told investors last week he thought the move to replace Schumacher was \u201cgood news\u201d for shareholders, describing Fernandez as \u201cbasically dynamite\u201d.\n\nSince this column last rated Unilever as a hold, the shares have nudged up 3 per cent, though not without a few wobbles in between. The stock now trades at 17.2 times forecast earnings, broadly in line with its average of 17.9 over the past five years. The sudden change in chief executive does bring considerable uncertainty to the group, especially as Schumacher was delivering results. The board seems to hope that Fernandez will be able to move fast and break things, but a more patient approach may be better suited for the \u00a3116 billion behemoth.\n\nAdvice Hold\n\nWhy Good turnaround progress but change of chief executive is risky\n\nWPP\n\nWPP, one of the world\u2019s biggest advertising groups, had a painful drop on the stock market last week, losing \u00a3400 million from its market value. The FTSE 100 business has been struggling with weak demand for ads for a while, but a warning of an even worse than expected decline in organic revenue has scared some investors off. With the shares now languishing at around their lowest level in four years, is there an opportunity for value investors at hand?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results were underwhelming to say the least: overall revenue fell 0.7 per cent to \u00a314.7 billion in 2024, with pre-tax profit down 3.8 per cent to \u00a31.5 billion. Mark Read, who took over as chief executive from Sir Martin Sorrell in 2018, said the group expected revenue to stay flat this year, taking a cautious outlook on the global economy given the possible impact of trade wars and higher inflation.\n\nChina, which is WPP\u2019s fifth biggest market, continued to be a thorn in its side. While like-for-like revenue dropped by 2.7 per cent in the UK and 0.7 per cent in North America, in China it dropped by 20.8 per cent.\n\nWPP is still a powerhouse, with a huge blue-chip client base, including the likes of eBay, Warner Bros Discovery and Levi\u2019s. But it looks like triggering more meaningful growth may be difficult, which is reflected in a lowly forecast price to earnings multiple of just 7.1. That is in stark contrast to its French rival Publicis at 11.4, as well as Omnicom and IPG, which are in the process of merging, at 9.5 and 10 respectively.\n\nConsolidation in the sector may be the best way to stimulate returns, and the recent $31 billion Omnicom-IPG deal has set a helpful precedent, though a competitor of this size will be difficult to go up against. WPP itself has been the object of takeover speculation over the years, but without a more meaningful catalyst for growth, the low price tag on the stock looks justified.\n\nAdvice Hold\n\nWhy No significant growth catalyst",

            "content": "Unilever has revealed the business impact of its UAE mangrove restoration campaign, A Great Deal for Everyone, which drove a 12 per cent uplift in sales for the brand.\n\nThe campaign, initially covered by Campaign Middle East in December 2024, sought to address the long-standing value-action gap that has persisted in the industry despite consumers stating that sustainability remains a top priority. Creative agency Impact BBDO, production house Chop Chop, and activation and production agency, Helium Marketing partnered with Unilever on the campaign.\n\nPartnering with LuLu Group, Mastercard, and Emirates Nature-WWF, the initiative linked purchases to real-world impact. It combined promotions, education, digital engagement, as well as the restoration of 6,000 mangroves and more than a hectare of land, offsetting 120,000 kg CO2e over five years.\n\nBrand and business outcomes of the Unilever campaign\n\nBeyond sentiment, the campaign saw strong engagement across digital and in-store touchpoints. The initiative generated 63 million impressions and reached 9.8 million people \u2014 14 per cent above projections. The digital campaigns received 314,000 clicks \u2014 3 per cent above forecast \u2014 and a click through rate of 0.64 per cent, which was 16 per cent above forecast.\n\nVideo content performed exceptionally well, with 7.1 million views, exceeding forecasts by 70 per cent. Additionally, campaign awareness rose by 7.9 points, significantly outperforming the industry benchmark of 1.1 points.\n\nIn terms of in-store and mall engagements, the in-store stands engaged with 4,000 consumers, while the mall activations reached and engaged with 529 consumers, resulting in 259 pledges and 187 competition entries.\n\nThe Virgin Radio competition was aired during a prime 5pm slot, reaching an estimated 630,000 listeners. This listenership underscored the strategic importance of the radio component within the brand\u2019s integrated media mix. Although Unilever did not isolate direct attribution (such as call-in volumes or immediate web traffic spikes) from this channel, the qualitative boost in overall brand awareness was significant.\n\n\u201cIn an omnichannel campaign, every touchpoint \u2014 from radio to digital and in-store experiences \u2014 plays a vital role in building a comprehensive narrative and gradually shifting consumer behaviour,\u201d said Shazia Syed, General Manager Personal Care Unilever Pakistan, Turkey, Arabia and Bangladesh and Head of Arabia.\n\nThese figures highlighted not only heightened awareness, but also a willingness to engage with sustainability content when it is made relevant and rewarding.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by these early survey signals, which highlight that consumers respond positively when sustainability is made accessible,\u201d Syed added. \u201cConsumers are looking for brands to take the lead in sustainability, but accessibility remains a challenge. These findings suggest that, alongside improving accessibility, a combination of clear incentives and other supportive measures is needed to influence consumer behavior, laying the groundwork for potential long-term change.\u201d\n\nBy integrating consumer engagement with tangible climate action, Unilever demonstrated how brands can scale sustainability efforts using the power of marketing. Unilever\u2019s mangrove restoration initiative was part of a broader commitment to environmental stewardship.\n\n\u201cWith this campaign, we\u2019ve taken an important first step toward fostering long-term behavioural change,\u201d added Syed. \u201cThrough innovation and partnerships, we aim to turn sustainable choices into second nature for consumers.\u201d\n\nUnilever\u2019s initiative reinforces that purpose-driven campaigns can drive both commercial success and measurable climate action \u2014 demonstrating the power of brands to influence meaningful change.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges in sustainability marketing is measuring behavioral shifts, not just transactions. Sales spikes and engagement metrics tell a partial story, but the real impact of campaigns like these is seen over months and years, not days and weeks.\u201d Syed said.\n\n\u201cUnilever\u2019s top 13 purpose-led brands, including Dove and Lifebuoy, have consistently demonstrated that sustained commitment \u2014 not one-off campaigns \u2014 is what drives long-term change. If we, as an industry, want to truly move the needle on sustainability, we need to evolve our measurement frameworks to go beyond sales and clicks. Are we changing mindsets? Are we building habits? Are we making sustainability the default choice? These are the questions we need to answer in the long run,\u201d Syed added.\n\nIntegrated campaign rollout and post-campaign study\n\nIn mall advertising: From November 21 to December 15, Unilever products such as Dove, Jif, and Comfort were on promotion at LuLu outlets across Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, as well as on LuLu\u2019s ecommerce platform. Shoppers were made aware of the campaign through visuals at every turn, from pop-up banners and floor stickers to shelf tags and checkout displays.\n\nRadio spots: To amplify awareness, Unilever partnered with Virgin Radio for a five-day competition that offered AED 5,000 in cash and daily prizes worth AED 1,000.\n\nDigital and social media marketing: Unilever extended its message online with a targeted ad campaign on Instagram and TikTok, running concurrently with in-store promotions. Consumers were encouraged to scan a QR code that led them to a microsite where they could learn more about mangroves and enter a themed competition.\n\nOn-site, in-person activations: A three-day activation at LuLu Barsha\u20131 Hypermarket (November 22\u201324) brought the campaign to life, , where visitors learned about the mangrove ecosystems and participated in a competition to win an educational trip to explore them.\n\nA Unilever commissioned post-campaign study by Kantar among 883 UAE consumers reinforced consumer willingness to support sustainable brands.\n\nThe research revealed that while 67 per cent of shoppers agreed the campaign will help them make more sustainable choices in the future, it also revealed a 6 per cent uplift in consumers prepared to invest their time and money in companies that prioritise doing good.\n\nMeanwhile, 65 per cent felt it empowered them to contribute to protecting the environment.",

Learn More .\n\nBack in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway bought 400m shares in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) for $1.3bn. But what if Warren Buffett\u2018s investment vehicle had decided to invest in FTSE 100 giant Unilever (LSE:ULVR) instead?\n\nThe answer is that the results would have been quite different for Berkshire shareholders. And there\u2019s an important lesson in this for investors to consider today.\n\nThe difference\n\nBerkshire hasn\u2019t reinvested any of its Coca-Cola dividends, preferring to use them elsewhere. But in 2024, the investment returned $776m (\u00a3617m) in cash (before taxes).\n\nThe market value of the investment\u2019s also grown. Based on the current share price, it\u2019s worth $28.5bn \u2013 over 20 times Berkshire\u2019s initial investment.\n\nA similar investment in Unilever 31 years ago would have bought around 180m shares. And the (pre-tax) dividend from this in 2024 would have been around \u00a3266m.\n\nAt today\u2019s prices, that would have a market value of \u00a38.1bn. That\u2019s not a bad result by any means, but it\u2019s well short of what Buffett has achieved with Coca-Cola.\n\nInvestment lessons\n\nThere are a couple of lessons investors can take from this. The first is that steady growth over a long period of time can achieve outstanding results.\n\nCoca-Cola isn\u2019t known for its explosive growth prospects. But despite this, Berkshire\u2019s stake has reached a point where it\u2019s returning almost 60% of the initial investment each year.\n\nThe other is that there\u2019s a difference between great companies and outstanding ones. And \u2013 again \u2013 this matters more over the long term, rather than months or years.\n\nUnilever isn\u2019t a bad business at all. But it hasn\u2019t been as strong as Coca-Cola and there\u2019s a huge difference in the amount of cash an investment in each from 1994 would generate today.\n\nUnilever\n\nOver the last 30 years, Coca-Cola\u2019s been relatively focused \u2013 while it has expanded its lines, it\u2019s looked to concentrate on soft drinks. This has proven to be a winning strategy. By contrast, Unilever has opted for a much broader portfolio. Its products have ranged from shampoo and toilet cleaner to ice cream and mayonnaise.\n\nThat however, is changing. The firm has divested some of its weaker brands, is in the process of spinning off its ice cream division, and is reported to selling off some of its other lines.\n\nThere are no guarantees, but a more focused operation could have stronger growth prospects going forward. At least, that\u2019s what investors should think about right now.\n\nRisks\n\nBoth Coca-Cola and Unilever are relatively steady companies. But even the most stable of businesses come with risks. With Coca-Cola, there\u2019s an obvious threat on the horizon in terms of GLP-1 drugs. This \u2013 and a general trend towards healthier choices \u2013 could limit demand for its products going forward.\n\nAs Unilever moves away from its food \u2013 especially ice cream \u2013 products, this risk subsides. But it will still have to contend with the threat of inflation cutting into its profit margins.\n\nDespite this, I think both stocks are worth a look. Growth might be more incremental than exponential, but that\u2019s a formula that\u2019s generated outstanding returns for Buffett.",

The condiment is losing market share to less-well-known rivals such as Duke's Mayo, which was founded in the U.S. south, and Mike's Amazing mayo, which is gaining traction in the U.S. northeast, where it says it is the fastest growing condiments brand. Both are often priced for less than Hellmann's.A 30-ounce jar of Duke's, for example, is priced below USD 5 versus Hellmann's USD 6.49 for the same size. It is now one of the country's fastest growing brands of mayo with more than USD 100 million in sales, according to the buyout firm that acquired its parent company, Sauer Brands , for about USD 1.5 billion in January.Duke's market share grew to 9 per cent from 6 per cent in 2021, said Joe Tuza, Sauer Brands chief growth officer. The sugar-free mayo is the country's fifth-largest by market share, Tuza said, behind Hellmann's and other Kraft Heinz and Unilever brands . The rival products' success shows the challenges facing global consumer product and food marketers such as London-based Unilever, which in February surprised retailers, investors and employees when it replaced its second CEO in two years, Hein Schumacher, in part because he failed to turn around its 60.8 billion euro business quickly enough.Unilever declined to comment for this story. The company paid USD 24.3 billion, including the assumption of debt, to acquire Hellmann's owner Bestfoods in 2000, expanding its presence in food. Unilever has aggressively marketed Hellmann's, and launched new flavors of the condiment, but in recent years, the brand's hold has weakened in the U.S. mayo category, according to Euromonitor data tracking brick-and-mortar and online retailers.Adam Theo, 45, of Arlington, Virginia, said he switched to Duke's after a friend introduced him to the condiment about three years ago. \"Before that, I never thought much about my choice of mayonnaise,\" he said. Unilever's food business, dominated by Hellmann's and Knorr seasonings, saw sales volume remain roughly flat last year, while prices rose, Fernando Fernandez, who was Unilever's chief financial officer, said last month. Fernandez replaced Schumacher as CEO on March 1.Fernandez said Hellmann's and Knorr performed better than Unilever's other food brands.Volume sales of packaged food in the United States, Unilever's biggest market, have been pressured due to price hikes. The makers of household staples, ranging from condiments like Hellmann's to Procter & Gamble's Luvs diapers, have seen some shoppers drift away from their products due to steep prices and fewer innovative products that shoppers would pay more for.About two weeks before announcing Schumacher's departure, Unilever reported lackluster full-year earnings and said it has had a slower start to 2025, sending its shares crashing.The board declined to detail how Schumacher lost directors' support but a source familiar with its thinking said the decision to dismiss the 53-year-old executive was unanimous. Unilever hired Schumacher as CEO in 2023 from Dutch dairy cooperative FrieslandCampina with the backing of Nelson Peltz, a billionaire U.S. hedge fund manager who first invested in Unilever in 2022 and joined the board several months later.A representative for Peltz declined to comment. In his 18 months on the job, Schumacher announced plans to sell some of Unilever's smaller food brands , worked to spin out its ice cream business and cut thousands of jobs. Shares had been up about 9 per cent in his tenure.Rival Nestle , the world's biggest food maker, has also endured turmoil at the top. In August, it fired CEO Mark Schneider, tapping insider Laurent Freixe to replace him.A Nestle spokesperson said its U.S. brands, which include Lean Cuisine and Coffeemate, are either in the top spot or second position in 13 categories, including instant coffee and frozen meals.\"Underperforming CEOs are more exposed than ever to the risk of being shown the door,\" said Matteo Tonello, head of benchmarking and analytics at research group The Conference Board. Consumer products CEOs must deftly manage not only changing consumer habits but also supply chain disruptions and high commodity prices, he said. Four investors and bankers who spoke with Reuters said the talent pool to run a consumer goods company is limited, partly because executives choose other fields, like tech. The people said joining the ranks of diaper, detergent and canned food makers was not considered sexy two decades ago when executives who should now be in line for the CEO job were graduating from business school.This has forced several consumer companies, including Nestle and Unilever, to pick an insider for the top spot instead of finding an outsider to take over.Part of the problems facing companies like Unilever, Kraft Heinz and Nestle are smaller, fast-growing independent brands like Duke's, according to four industry consultants. Procter & Gamble lost its footing in value-priced diapers, while Kraft Heinz's boxed macaroni and cheese is under threat from Gooder Foods' Goodles.A Procter & Gamble spokesperson said it upgraded its Luvs diapers and added new Pampers products to serve all consumers.Kraft Heinz did not respond to a request for comment.Consumer goods makers delayed developing new products during the pandemic and immediately after, leaving an opening for newer brands.Bain & Co tracks fast-growing, independently-owned consumer brands, which it calls \"insurgents.\" The consulting firm found that these brands, a list which has included Chobani yogurt and Fatty jerky, accounted for 39 per cent of growth in 2024 in their categories, such as food or personal care. That's up from 17 per cent in 2023, Bain said.Former Olympian Samyr Laine, now an investor in food start-ups including electrolyte drink maker Berri Organics, said bureaucracy and red tape are the largest hurdles for big food makers.\"It takes a lot of yeses and lots of presentations to just get going, and their infrastructure isn't built to do smaller things and incubate and test in smaller communities,\" said Laine, who has met with executives at firms such as Diageo, Unilever, P&G and Moet Hennessy to incubate new brands or pitch products. To drive sales volume, Unilever ran its fifth consecutive Super Bowl ad this year, featuring a tongue-in-cheek visit to a New York deli with the lead actors from the 1989 romantic comedy hit \"When Harry Met Sally.\"But Hellmann's has seen its share fall to 46.7 per cent of the U.S. mayo market last year from 50.6 per cent in 2022, Euromonitor found.Four consumer industry bankers said Unilever can be slow to make M&A decisions. The conglomerate has sold some of its businesses to private equity firms in the last decade including its spreads business, tea business and a group of personal care brands called Elida Beauty. Unilever has acquired a few fast-growing start-up brands, including high-end mayo brand Sir Kensington's in 2017 - though they were not among the bidders for Duke's, according to a source close to the deal.",

Some readers may remember how in the \u201870s, \u201880s or even the \u201890s, we would take an empty bottle to the grocery shop to refill it with mustard oil. Most households would have separate refill bottles, containers or cans for commodities such as kerosene, milk or ghee. These practices were common till cooking gas connections and the packaging revolution changed our food consumption habits.\n\nHowever, amid concerns over plastic packaging pollution and the search for sustainable alternatives, refillable solutions seem to be gaining ground again \u2013 be it in food, personal care or homecare solutions.\n\nUnilever\u2019s refill initiative\n\nMultinational consumer packaged goods company Unilever, for example, says it is running refill pilot projects globally, including in Asian countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka \u2014 seeking ways to reduce virgin plastic use and tackle plastic sachet, pouches and container waste.\n\nUnilever says it has run more than 50 refill and reuse pilot projects since 2018, which are helping to shape its strategies to reduce single-use plastic packaging. The British company, it may be mentioned, was under fire last year for scaling back its sustainability targets.\n\nIn Indonesia, Unilever piloted a refill machine in 2020, selling home and personal care brands such as Dove, Rinso and TRESemm\u00e9, in a packaging-free store in Jakarta. Two digital machines were introduced in an apartment building and a general trade kiosk. As on date, Unilever says it serves an estimated 6,000 customers at 1,000 refill stations, saving approximately six tons of plastic per year.\n\nSimilarly, in Sri Lanka in 2019, Unilever installed two large high-tech refill machines in modern trade outlets, working with sustainable technology provider Vega Innovations. Each machine offered pre-set amounts or fixed doses of personal and home care products, from brands such as Dove, Sunlight and Sunsilk. Subsequently, the machines were redesigned to allow consumers to choose the exact amount they wanted to purchase.\n\nIn Bangladesh, Unilever tested self-service refill machines in modern trade stores in 2021. However, servicing and maintenance became an issue. A year later, the company created a user-friendly machine that dispensed multiple products including Sunsilk, Dove and Lifebuoy, in varying amounts. Approximately 43% of the machine\u2019s users are now returning customers, the company says.\n\nAmong other products, Unilever\u2019s detergent brand OMO came up with a 6x concentrated formula designed to be poured into a standard 3-liter bottle. The product, a hit with consumers in Brazil, was launched in South American countries, the Middle East and Europe. The packaging uses 70% less plastic, is fully recyclable and contains 50% recycled plastic.\n\n\u201cWe need bold innovations that challenge existing designs, materials and business models. Our priority is to fundamentally rethink our approach and pave the way for new solutions such as reusable and refillable formats,\u201d Richard Slater, chief R&D Officer, Unilever, says.\n\nOther brands join in\n\nMany other companies have come up with reusable and refillable solutions \u2013 small but crucial steps on the road to reducing plastic use.\n\nMondi, a specialist in sustainable packaging and paper, for example, has collaborated with Sherwin-Williams, a global leader in paints and coatings, to introduce a recycled spouted pouch as a refill option for its concentrated paint, sold in the UK market. The paint concentrate has been developed to replace the traditional 5-liter pre-mixed paint in rigid plastic tubs. The company says it encourages consumers to reuse these tubs to mix the paint concentrate and then recycle the refill pouch.\n\nFood major Heinz has introduced a ketchup dispenser, a joint effort with npk design and the AMS Group, for use in restaurants and food joints. It includes a completely new pump that can be quickly disassembled, cleaned in the dishwasher, and easily reassembled into a sealed system.\n\nThe dispenser cartridge, which was among the 50 finalists of Packaging Europe\u2019s 2024 Sustainability Awards, contains a sauce pouch. By using large pouches instead of small sachets, single-use plastic waste can be significantly reduced, the company says.\n\nIn mid-2022, Godrej Consumer Products launched a ready-to-mix body wash in order to penetrate the body wash category in India. The Godrej Magic Bodywash was made available as a single gel sachet and as a combi-pack consisting of a refillable bottle and the gel sachet.\n\nIn Switzerland, FMCG giant Nestl\u00e9 tried out reusable and refillable dispensers for petcare and soluble coffee as part of its efforts to reduce single-use packaging.\n\nUnilever was, however, smart enough to add a rider, saying such alternative reusable packaging models require commitment across every level of the supply chain, from manufacturers and retailers to the waste management industry and governments. Clearly enough, such pilots are a drop in the ocean and not enough to meet sustainability targets, However, these are small but crucial steps in the long road to sustainability.\n\nPackaging South Asia \u2014 authentic, impactful and influential An English-language packaging industry B2B platform in print and web, Packaging South Asia is in its 19th year of publication.

            "content": "In recent years, companies have largely abandoned the \"move fast and break things\" approach, popularized by tech giants in the early 2000s, recognizing the risks of prioritizing speed over sustainable long-term growth. However, in today\u2019s era of rapid disruption and heightened competition, the need for speed is making a comeback.\n\nUnilever\u2019s sudden leadership shakeup last week exemplifies this shift. The company behind Dove and Ben & Jerry\u2019s announced that CEO Hein Schumacher would step down after less than two years in the role. Despite implementing a strategic overhaul\u2014including cost reductions, plans to spin off the ice cream division, and a sharpened focus on core brands\u2014the board determined that progress was too slow, particularly compared to industry rivals like Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble. In response, CFO Fernando Fernandez was named the new CEO, signaling an urgency to accelerate Unilever\u2019s turnaround.\n\nThe decision stunned many, including Schumacher himself, as his early results had been promising. Since he assumed the role, Unilever shares have risen by approximately 10%, reflecting investor confidence in his strategy. Yet, the board had higher expectations, demanding not just growth but faster growth. Chairman Ian Meakins underscored this urgency in a statement: \u201cThe Growth Action Plan (GAP) has put Unilever on a path to higher performance, and the Board is committed to accelerating its execution,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile the Board is pleased with Unilever\u2019s performance in 2024, there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results.\u201d\n\nUnilever\u2019s bold decision to fast replace a well-regarded CEO\u2014one who had delivered positive, albeit modest growth\u2014highlights the intense pressure on executives today. Simply put, good performance isn\u2019t good enough. CEOs are expected not just to succeed but to outperform competitors at record speed.\n\nBeyond speed, leadership style appears to have played a role in the decision. As I\u2019ve noted in a previous newsletter, companies are increasingly favoring leaders who are aggressive, mercenary, and willing to push change swiftly. According to the Financial Times, insiders described Fernandez as \"abrasive\" yet \"decisive\" and a leader who would move far quicker than Schumacher, whose leadership style was considered \"cuddlier.\u201d One analyst at Bernstein described Fernandez as \"fiery and charismatic,\" while Schumacher was more \"understated.\"\n\nWhether Fernandez\u2019s leadership will deliver the rapid transformation Unilever desires remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: Companies today aren\u2019t just demanding results\u2014they want them immediately.",

As part of this, we have set out some proposed plans which are now subject to consultation. No final decisions have been made and we recognize that this is an unsettling time for employees, and we will do what we can to support them during the consultation process.\u201d\n\nIn its memo to partners, Unilever wrote that it remains committed to trying to supply Ren products and to meeting its commitments, while aiming to sustain uninterrupted service.\n\n\u201cWe will keep you updated on any developments that may affect our partnership,\u201d Unilever wrote.\n\nUnilever \u2014 and the beauty industry \u2014 are undergoing sea changes, which are likely contributors to Ren\u2019s fate.\n\nIn late February, in a surprise announcement that sent shockwaves through the industry, Unilever said its chief executive officer Hein Schumacher was exiting the company after less than two years in the job.\n\nRen Skincare\u2019s #WeAreAllies initiative Courtesy\n\nThe phrase, \u201cWe committed to doing fewer things, better and with greater impact,\u201d became Schumacher\u2019s mantra during his short tenure. On his watch, Unilever decided to separate the ice cream business, which will be separated by way of a demerger expected by the end of this year.\n\nFernando Fernandez, Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer and executive director, replaced Schumacher. Prior to becoming CFO in January 2024, Fernandez had a successful tenure as president of beauty and well-being, among Unilever\u2019s fastest-growing businesses.\n\nAt the time of the CEO announcement, Fernandez said in a statement that Unilever will now concentrate \u201con building a future-fit portfolio with an attractive growth footprint and delivering unmatched functional and perceivable superiority across our top 30 power brands.\u201d\n\nSuch brands generally generate upward of 1 billion euros annually. The prestige division has two brands knocking on the door of that status: Dermalogica and Paula\u2019s Choice. Five brands exceed $100 million in sales \u2014 Murad, Living Proof, Tatcha, Hourglass and K-18, while Ren, Kate Somerville and Garancia, are thought to make less than $50 million annually.\n\nIt had been said that Unilever was shopping around some of its prestige brands, including Ren and Kate Somerville, as part of the consumer giant\u2019s wider efforts to streamline operations, boost profits and deliver more value to shareholders.\n\nIn mid-June 2024 it was announced Vasiliki Petrou, who assembled the then 1.4 billion-euro prestige division through an M&A-based strategy over a decade, was leaving the company. She was succeeded by Mary Carmen Gasco-Buisson.\n\nUnilever acquired Ren Skincare in May 2015. The British brand had been created 15 years earlier by Antony Buck and Robert Calcraft. It positioned itself in the naturals category, which had by the time of its acquisition become among the fastest-growing skin care segments globally.\n\nThe brand\u2019s premium positioning complemented Unilever\u2019s burgeoning prestige beauty portfolio, and the multinational planned to build on Ren\u2019s global potential.\n\nBy the time of its purchase by Unilever, Ren had built a committed consumer base around the motto of \u201cperformance; purity; pleasure.\u201d\n\nThe range of high-performance skin care was at the time predominantly in specialty stores and pharmacies, then branched out to perfumeries and department stores, as well.\n\nThe natural and clean beauty space has become ever more competitive, with many brands trying to find their footing in the crowded space today.\n\nMost recently, Ren \u2014 which had added \u201cClean\u201d as part of its moniker \u2014 was doubling down on its Clean to Planet positioning. The company had met its zero-waste promise by the end of 2021, with its packaging fully recycled, recyclable or reusable.",

Unilever is looking to sell The Vegetarian Butcher, Nestl\u00e9 has cut back its meat-free offerings, and Monde Nissin\u2019s Quorn continues to post losses.\n\nMonde Nissin reported further sales declines for Quorn, with mid-teen percentage losses in Q4 2024 compared to the previous year. The company is expected to take an impairment charge of \u00a380-100 million, continuing a trend of write-downs since 2022. Despite this, Monde Nissin projects positive EBITDA for Quorn in Q4.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has also retreated from plant-based meat, focusing its Sweet Earth brand on alternative protein bowls while discontinuing plant-based chicken and bacon products. CEO Laurent Freixe stated that the company had overestimated market demand for meat alternatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Unilever is struggling to offload The Vegetarian Butcher, which it acquired in 2018. The brand, which supplies plant-based meat to Burger King and Subway, generates approximately \u20ac50 million in annual sales but remains unprofitable. Analysts suggest it may attract buyers from the traditional meat industry looking to expand into plant-based options.\n\nThe broader plant-based sector faces challenges from shifting consumer preferences, with demand moving towards fresh, minimally processed foods. The rise of the ultra-processed food debate, amplified by regulatory scrutiny and lobbying efforts, has further pressured the industry.\n\nWhile European retail sales of meat alternatives grew 3% between 2022 and 2023, US sales have declined. For large food corporations, the sector\u2019s financial struggles challenge long-term growth strategies, raising questions about the future of plant-based meat in mainstream markets.",

Most of the time, Unilever is too late to react.\u201d\n\nFor Fernandez, 58, who\u2019s taking over after the abrupt ouster of Hein Schumacher last week, fixing operations in Indonesia is urgent.\n\nIt\u2019s among a slew of challenges, which include spinning off the ice-cream business and cutting costs, as he\u2019s pushed by the company\u2019s board to transform the sprawling group faster.\n\nWith annual sales of around US$2.1bil, Indonesia accounts for just over 3% of Unilever\u2019s global sales.\n\nBut as problems in the South-East Asian nation are increasingly mirrored elsewhere, it has become a test case for Unilever\u2019s developing-markets operations, which rake in around US$36bil annually, or about 58% of total revenue.\n\nGetting strategies right in emerging markets is crucial for multinationals like Unilever, Nestle SA and Procter & Gamble Co that rely increasingly on the rising middle classes in these countries to drive growth.\n\nBut a new cohort of ambitious domestic players is threatening market shares and profit margins.\n\nLocal brands have already taken a majority share of the food and beverage market in Indonesia, overtaking multinationals \u2013 a trend that\u2019s accelerating, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group.\n\nMultinational companies\u2019 strategies that worked for decades in emerging markets have slowly unraveled as hungrier homegrown companies have gained in size and sophistication and as geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties have tipped the scales toward buying locally.\n\nThis stemmed from the Gaza-conflict-led boycott of Western products to the emerging tariff wars being driven by US President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, in recent years, that \u201chalo effect\u201d has waned and local brands have substantially increased their quality and competitiveness,\u201d according to consulting company Bain & Co.\n\nUnilever\u2019s underlying sales advanced 4.2%, as its operations in Indonesia, India and China struggled. \u2014 Bloomberg",

            "content": "Sensex and Nifty began the trade on a positive note on Monday but soon turned negative amid heavy selling in blue chip stocks, including Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank as well as persistent outflow of foreign funds.\n\nSensex climbed 451.62 points to 73,649.72 in early trade, while the Nifty went up by 136.85 points to 22,261.55. However, soon both the benchmark indices turned negative and were trading sharply lower.\n\nThe BSE benchmark fell 852.68 points from day's high to hit day's low of 72,797.04, and the Nifty fell 252.3 points from day's high.\n\nIndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Tata Steel, Adani Ports, Tata Motors, Zomato, Bajaj Finance and Hindustan Unilever were among the biggest laggards.\n\nHere are the key possible factors that led to quick reversal in trend intraday:\n\n1) Global Trade War Fears: 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico by the United States will come into effect on March 4. U.S. President Donald Trump has also threatened China with the extra 10 percent duty, resulting in a cumulative 20 percent tariff. Reuters quoting China's state-controlled Global Times has reported that Beijing is also preparing countermeasures against fresh U.S. import tariffs set to take effect on Tuesday.\n\n2) GDP below estimates: GDP growth for the third quarter of the current fiscal (FY25) was 6.2 per cent. The rise comes after GDP growth fell to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent in Q2FY25. However, the rise was still below expectations as a Moneycontrol survey of 19 economists said that the Indian economy is expected to grow at a faster pace of 6.3 percent amid capex push and uptick in rural spending. The GDP growth stood at 8.6 per cent in Q3FY24.\n\nStock Market LIVE Updates\n\n3) Unabated FII selling: Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 11,639.02 crore on Friday. Foreign investors have pulled out Rs 34,574 crore from the Indian equity markets in February pushing total outflows to Rs 1.12 lakh crore in the first two months of 2025 amid rising global trade tensions and concerns over corporate earnings growth. \"Elevated valuations of Indian equities, alongside concerns about corporate earnings growth, have led to a sustained outflow of FPIs,\" Vipul Bhowar, Senior Director - Listed Investments, Waterfield Advisors, told PTI.\n\nCautious sentiment prevails in the markets, influenced by U.S. tariff uncertainty in the absence of any significant positive domestic trigger, said Hardik Matalia, analyst at Choice Broking told Reuters.\n\n4) No Ukraine deal: The absence of a breakthrough in Ukraine peace talks has kept market sentiment fragile. Investors remain wary of prolonged geopolitical tensions, which could lead to higher crude oil prices and further strain emerging markets.\n\n5) Weak Domestic Data Adds to Pressure: On the domestic front, India\u2019s factory activity slowed to a 14-month low in February, with the manufacturing PMI falling to 56.3 from 57.7 in January. The softer expansion in new orders and production suggests that demand may be cooling.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

            "content": "Hein Schumacher, a consumer goods veteran who started his career as a trainee at Unilever and returned as chief executive a quarter of a century later, is a keen horse rider. But last week he was the one being switched out for a faster steed.\n\nThe board of the Anglo-Dutch giant behind Dove soap and Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise abruptly fired the 53-year-old and replaced him with Fernando Fernandez, 58, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nSchumacher had been in the role for less than two years. His brutal consignment to the glue factory left analysts at RBC Capital Markets \u201cgobsmacked\u201d.\n\nAn investor who met Schumacher several times described the Dutchman as \u201cway too nice, way too soft and way too European to do anything serious with this company\u201d.\n\nA source close to the board said progress under Schumacher had been \u201ctoo slow and a bit tortuous \u2014 we\u2019ve got to step it up, and Fernando is a man of action\u201d, adding: \u201cHe has a great combination of strong financial skills and operational sales and marketing skills. He may be someone we have to rein in more than push forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, a former executive thought the change had been \u201cbadly handled\u201d. He said: \u201cYou cannot run a business like that when there\u2019s so much at stake and so many people depend on it.\u201d He questioned who was really in charge: Ian Meakins, who was appointed chairman in 2023, or Nelson Peltz, the activist investor who revealed a stake in early 2022 and joined the board a few months later.\n\nThe change at the top, which Unilever presented as part of a drive to achieve \u201cbest-in-class results\u201d, was the latest ruction to hit a FTSE 100 constituent that has had more than its fair share of drama since the high period of Paul Polman\u2019s time as chief executive. Unilever is a sprawling empire with more than \u20ac60 billion of sales in 190 countries and 128,000 employees.\n\nPolman, the former head of Nestl\u00e9 in the Americas, delivered a peer group-beating 270 per cent total return between 2009 and 2019. In 2017 he saw off a hostile takeover bid by private equity-backed Kraft Heinz within just three days. But the Dutch Catholic, who was nicknamed Captain Planet for his eco-campaigning and liked to call Unilever \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest NGO\u201d, was seen as having lost focus towards the end of his tenure.\n\nMartin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies at the time, remarked a few years ago that Unilever was \u201cadrift\u201d in Polman\u2019s final three years, bogged down in an overly long succession process and failing to grapple sufficiently with a slowdown in emerging markets such as Brazil and India, where it makes almost 60 per cent of its sales.\n\nPolman retired after a botched attempt to ditch Unilever\u2019s London listing and make Rotterdam its sole headquarters. He was followed by Alan Jope, an amiable Scot and a Unilever \u201clifer\u201d. Jope and Graeme Pitkethly, the finance director, consolidated Unilever\u2019s corporate structure in London, ending the dual-listed arrangement that had endured since the merger of Britain\u2019s Lever Brothers and Holland\u2019s Margarine Unie in 1930.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJope \u2014 \u201ca people person\u201d, in the words of a former colleague \u2014 then guided Unilever through Covid and carried out a reorganisation that got rid of its \u201cmatrix\u201d management structure, putting staff into five simpler divisions. He stuck with Polman\u2019s target of a 20 per cent operating profit margin for too long, however \u2014 a move that Deboo likened to Winston Churchill\u2019s ill-judged restoration of the gold standard in 1925.\n\nPaul Polman retired after he failed to remove Unilever from the London Stock Exchange SIMON DAWSON/GETTY IMAGES\n\nUnilever\u2019s performance stayed sluggish, leading to three trading warnings. Jope\u2019s fate was sealed when he launched a disastrous \u00a350 billion bid for GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s consumer health business, now trading as Haleon, in late 2021. The market\u2019s reaction was summed up in the headline of an RBC note: \u201cPlease Don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSchumacher joined from the Dutch dairy co-operative FrieslandCampina with Peltz\u2019s backing in July 2023. He implemented a \u201cgrowth action plan\u201d that involved concentrating on Unilever\u2019s 30 \u201cpower brands\u201d \u2014 products such as Knorr stock cubes and Surf detergent \u2014 and boosting margins through better productivity. Schumacher announced 7,500 job cuts and plans to spin off Unilever\u2019s ice cream business, which includes Ben & Jerry\u2019s, whose vocally pro-Palestinian stance has caused headaches for its parent company. The standalone entity is expected to be renamed the Magnum Ice Cream Company.\n\nUnilever\u2019s total return under Schumacher was 14.7 per cent, according to broker AJ Bell, ranking it third out of eight quoted consumer goods giants such as Procter & Gamble and Reckitt Benckiser. Alongside details of the ice cream float, though, Unilever reported in January that last year\u2019s sales growth had come in below expectations, at an underlying 4.2 per cent rather than 4.3 per cent, and gave a subdued outlook for trading.\n\nPeltz, a sometime ally of Donald Trump, had wanted Unilever\u2019s ice cream business, which turned over \u20ac8.3 billion last year, to be listed in New York. Unilever instead decided on the Netherlands, where the unit\u2019s headquarters is located. Unilever gave the Dutch government assurances that any future spin-off would be quoted there when it carried out its London consolidation in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNelson Peltz wanted Unilever\u2019s ice cream division to be listed in New York CALLA KESSLER/GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe former executive who criticised the way the transition from Schumacher to Fernandez was orchestrated said the former had further angered Peltz by refusing to countenance a disposal of Unilever\u2019s broader food business, which had sales of \u20ac13.4 billion last year. Schumacher said he wanted to \u201cprune\u201d the portfolio but not sell it outright.\n\nUnder Jope, Unilever considered getting rid of food to help fund its Glaxo bid. Peltz was \u201ca little bit pissed off because he wants to unlock very quick value to then get out and make a good return on his investment\u201d, the former executive said, suggesting that this had contributed to Schumacher\u2019s exit: \u201cHe [Peltz] didn\u2019t get his thing on foods, he didn\u2019t get his total way on ice cream.\u201d\n\nThe source close to Unilever\u2019s board denied that Peltz had proposed selling the entire food business. Peltz\u2019s Trian Partners fund would not comment, but noted that Unilever\u2019s stock continued to trade at a discount to most of its peers.\n\n\u201cTrian believes continued operational improvements and sustained financial out-performance should drive Unilever\u2019s valuation multiple higher,\u201d it said. \u201cNelson shares the belief of the other Unilever directors that Fernando Fernandez has the right skills and expertise.\u201d\n\nFernando Fernandez has been described as \u201chaving the right skills and expertise\u201d PHOEBE CHEONG PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nAs well as costs and productivity, Fernandez will be expected to tackle culture. \u201cPeople have got very used to a nice, cushy lifestyle at Unilever,\u201d said the source close to the board. \u201cIf you were Unilever\u2019s man in Indonesia, you were second to the ambassador \u2026 There is a very settled feeling around the place and we haven\u2019t done a great job, historically, of holding people accountable. We forgive people for a lot. We need to drive a performance culture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchumacher was \u201ca very compassionate person and sees everything as multifaceted, which it is\u201d, the same person added. \u201cHe was prepared to go a little slower to cater to that. And there\u2019s a feeling that we need to go faster.\u201d\n\nFernandez, an Argentine who studied economics at the University of Buenos Aires, was described by analysts at Barclays as \u201cthe star of the show\u201d at a capital markets day in November. A former adviser said that while Schumacher was \u201cthoughtful\u201d, Fernandez was \u201ca bundle of energy\u201d.\n\nHe predicted: \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a much more shareholder value-focused Unilever.\u201d\n\nFernandez, who will be paid a base salary of \u20ac1.8 million, marginally less than Schumacher\u2019s, will form something of a triumvirate with Meakins and Peltz. Meakins\u2019 role will be crucial: Unilever is widely seen as having had a series of weak chairmen. Marijn Dekkers, who left the German pharmaceuticals giant Bayer before its ill-fated takeover of Monsanto, maker of Roundup weedkiller, ran the board between 2016 and 2019.\n\n\u201cHe was always looking at Bayer\u2019s share performance in our board meetings,\u201d a former colleague said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnilever\u2019s offices in Rotterdam ALAMY\n\nDekkers presided over the misjudged attempt to move Unilever\u2019s headquarters to the Netherlands. He was succeeded by Nils Andersen, a former boss of Maersk, the shipping company, and Carlsberg the brewer. It was on Andersen\u2019s watch that Jope came a cropper with his bid for GSK\u2019s consumer healthcare business.\n\nThe present Unilever non-executive line-up is regarded by many in the City as low-calibre, with the exceptions of Peltz and Susan Kilsby, the former investment banker who chaired the drugs developer Shire. Meakins, who also chairs the catering group Compass, is seen as having done a good job during his executive career. He ran the pharma wholesaler Alliance Unichem, the foreign exchange service Travelex and the heating and plumbing parts distributor Wolseley, now known as Ferguson.\n\nWith the UK consumer goods industry facing the aftermath of a high-inflation environment and families likely to come under pressure as next month\u2019s national insurance increase tightens the jobs market, Unilever\u2019s chairman will need to get the most out of his new thoroughbred, and balance Peltz\u2019s demands with the best interests of other shareholders.",

            "content": "Fernando Fernandez, who takes over Saturday as the new CEO of Unilever Plc, has a track record in emerging markets that have driven the expansion in recent years of what\u2019s one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer goods groups. The 37-year company veteran will need all the skills he can muster for a market where the maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream faces some of its most-entrenched problems: Indonesia.\n\nConsider what he\u2019s up against: At Aeon supermarket on the outskirts of Jakarta, Unilever\u2019s Rinso detergent was recently priced at 75,500 rupiah ($4.60) against a discounted 29,800 rupiah for local rival Wings Group\u2019s SoKlin. The capital\u2019s food stalls that use sweet soy sauce \u2014 a staple of dishes from chicken satay to \u201cnasi goreng\u201d \u2014 buy Wings\u2019 Kecap Sedaap label that\u2019s 3,000 rupiah cheaper than Unilever\u2019s Bango brand. Some of the corner stores sprouting across the country say they can\u2019t directly stock Unilever goods because the company doesn\u2019t take small orders.\n\nUrbanization is driving consumers in emerging markets like Indonesia from supermarkets and hypermarkets to small, neighborhood mom-and-pop shops and mini marts, and inflation has fostered penny-pinching habits. That has the maker of Persil, Vaseline and other country-specific brands struggling to re-tailor its strategy. Caught on the wrong foot by nimble local players that have eaten into its market with freebies, slashed prices and rapid product upgrades, the London-based company last month reported a 30% plunge in 2024 net income in the country \u2014 the sixth consecutive annual decline.\n\nUnilever\u2019s local rivals\u2019 \u201cgame is simple: just cut the price,\u201d said Willy Goutama, an equity analyst at PT Maybank Sekuritas Indonesia. \u201cThey are willing to operate at a loss if that means gaining market share; Unilever, like many multinationals, tends to prioritize profitability...Most of the time, Unilever is too late to react.\u201d\n\nFor Fernandez, 58, who\u2019s taking over after the abrupt ouster of Hein Schumacher this week, fixing operations in Indonesia is urgent. It\u2019s among a slew of challenges, which include spinning off the ice-cream business and cutting costs, as he\u2019s pushed by the company\u2019s board to transform the sprawling group faster. With annual sales of around \u20ac2 billion, Indonesia accounts for just over 3% of Unilever\u2019s global sales. But as problems in the Southeast Asian nation are increasingly mirrored elsewhere, it has become a test case for Unilever\u2019s developing-markets operations, which rake in around \u20ac35 billion annually, or about 58% of total revenue.\n\nGetting strategies right in emerging markets is crucial for multinationals like Unilever, Nestle SA and Procter & Gamble Co. that rely increasingly on the rising middle classes in these countries to drive growth. But a new cohort of ambitious domestic players is threatening market shares and profit margins. Local brands have already taken a majority share of the food and beverage market in Indonesia, overtaking multinationals \u2014 a trend that\u2019s accelerating, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group.\n\nMultinational companies\u2019 strategies that worked for decades in emerging markets have slowly unraveled as hungrier homegrown companies have gained in size and sophistication and as geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties have tipped the scales toward buying locally \u2014 from the Gaza-conflict-led boycott of western products to the emerging tariff wars being driven by US President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cHistorically, MNCs led the premium segment, supported by the perception that foreign brands were superior, aspirational, and symbolized trendiness and quality. However, in recent years, that \u2018halo effect\u2019 has waned and local brands have substantially increased their quality and competitiveness,\u201d according to consulting company Bain & Co.",

Learn More .\n\n\u2018Explosive\u2019, \u2018dynamic\u2019, and \u2018high-octane\u2019 are some of my favourite words. They aren\u2019t ones I\u2019d normally use to describe Unilever (LSE:ULVR) shares \u2013 but that might be me being unfair.\n\nOver the last 12 months, the stock is up 13.5%. That\u2019s enough to turn a \u00a310,000 investment into \u00a311,350 \u2013 and that\u2019s before we get to the dividend.\n\nTime to wake up\n\nUnilever shares have come to life over the last year or so. But before that, investors had to wait a long time for any meaningful signs of progress.\n\nA year ago, the share price was just below \u00a340. Unfortunately, that\u2019s also where the stock was trading at the start of 2017.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean the stock was dead money during that time. Investors who bought in March 2017 and held to the start of March 2024 collected \u00a39.94 per share in dividends.\n\nAt just under \u00a340 per share, that\u2019s a return of 24% over seven years. In this context, the stock climbing over 10% in a year is quite a striking shift.\n\nA change of direction\n\nThe climbing share price has coincided with a change in the company\u2019s approach. Unilever has been divesting its weaker brands and focusing its investment behind its most successful lines.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say the results have been impressive \u2013 in 2024, underlying operating income grew 12.6%. The last time this happened was before 2017.\n\nThe epitome of this is Unilever\u2019s decision to divest its ice cream division this year. While Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Magnum, and Wall\u2019s are strong brands, the production costs are ultimately unattractive.\n\nGiven the success of the strategy over the last 12 months, it\u2019s something of a surprise to see the company is also looking to divest its CEO. That\u2019s the most recent news.\n\nMomentum\n\nLast month, the news emerged that CEO Hein Schumacher was going to be replaced as Chief Executive by CFO Fernando Fernandez. The reason given by the board is to increase the pace of change.\n\nExactly what the next stage might be is unclear. But one idea is that it might involve the divesting of Unilever\u2019s food brands, which include Marmite and Pot Noodle.\n\nGrowth in this category has been weak for a while. And there\u2019s also speculation the firm might look to add to its existing strengths in beauty and personal care via acquisitions.\n\nThis is risky. While the company has had a lot of success recently by cutting its portfolio back, attempting to grow by buying other businesses introduces a danger of overpaying for growth.\n\nIs there more to come?\n\nInvestors who bought Unilever shares 12 months ago should probably be very pleased with their returns so far. And I think the stock is still worth considering at today\u2019s prices.\n\nThe firm is clearly looking to keep moving forward. And while growing through acquisition is risky, it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to see where a potential target might be found.\n\nIt\u2019s not so long ago that Unilever tried to buy Haleon for \u00a350bn. With the company currently having a market cap of \u00a334bn, another look at the stock might not be out of the question. But that\u2019s just me speculating, of course.",

So water cycle, the absolute quantity of water remains constant. It has to be the right kind of water, the right kind of place for the right kind of, of use. I think something which has changed very dramatically and particularly for South, South Asia, is the entire issue around ground water.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\nHe added, \u201cGoogle, as it would be in, Hindi and, maybe in the early days, you extracted only so much out of it because it\u2019s not easy to extract. But with the advent of technology, power, electricity. So it, it\u2019s almost like a free resource and you pump it out till some day the realization hits like, you see your credit card bill, you can buy what you want, but today or tomorrow it\u2019ll hit you, and you can pump it out much faster than you can, recharge it. I think that\u2019s one, very critical dimension. And I think the other dimension I\u2019d like to draw attention on very quickly is of late last 4 or 5 years, lots of conversation around, climate change. And, it\u2019s almost as if that\u2019s a separate subject and not connected with water. But the fact that there are two sides, I think gets captured beautifully in all the Indian languages, including Hindi, where climate change straightaway translates to jal viu parivar.\u201d\n\nWhen Dr. Subramanya Kusnur Founder Chairman & CEO, AquaKraft asked Dr. Luisa Cortesi Assistant Professor, Erasmus University, The Hague, \u201cWhat do you think, is the role that academics can play in terms of, contributing towards the emerging trends of water sustainability?\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\nTo this, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because several years ago, I\u2019ve been in India for 25 years. It it felt sometimes that India was scared of academicians that was scared. So to of receiving criticism. And I think your question instead is a symptom of the fact that now India as the strength to engage academicians at a different level. So but let me be clear here, not to make any mistake, you know, a lot of the people of the eminent speaker on this stage, they were I\u2019ve been proposing their ideas. Sometimes the product, they\u2019re selling their products in a way right. If we are talking about the future of AI, of humanity and the future of water, this isn\u2019t window shopping.\u201d\n\nLuisa Cortesi : \u2018Natural resources in the country are not up for grabs\u2019\n\nLuisa Cortesi added, \u201cSo it\u2019s a serious topic, which means that water and the country and the natural resources in the country are not up for grabs. Now, what\u2019s interesting about academia is that we have nothing to sell, at least in the Netherlands, where I am a permanent faculty. We cannot. We are prohibited from private earnings, so we cannot sell anything. That doesn\u2019t mean we cannot give and it doesn\u2019t mean that we cannot.\u201d\n\nShe also shared, \u201cIt only means that we cannot take. So we can give our competence. We cannot become rich ourselves, but we can enrich. And I suggest that there is a lot of wealth there. Of course, there are not all pros. You have to figure out where there is competence. And one way I think to figure it out is to think about who can tell you stuff that are uncomfortable that you don\u2019t want to hear, but they are going to push you in new, right direction. So let me give you, some practical advice here. India is a country with many great doctors, many great engineers, fabulous architects. Somehow I feel that there are some categories of expertise that are not as spread out as they should. An example are historians and ecologists. See the market has no memory. Technology has no memory, market has no memory, means the cash in the pocket is over.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at NXT conclave, Luisa Cortesi said, \u201cTwo steps that we should do for next. And what doesn\u2019t that one quick question on the, startup incubators, how to nationalize that very quickly. And then, the answers from each of the panelists and we close the panel. So I think in water sector, there have been many startups which are coming up and, with many new technologies, I specifically talk about the nature based solutions and related technologies.\u201d\n\nShraman Jha CEO: Raising The Consciousness And Talk More On Water Is The Next Solution\n\nWhen asked , \u201cWhat will be the next and what is sustainability?\u201d She added, \u201cFirst, raising the consciousness, raising the debate, raising the kind of questions that have just just got raised because there is no perfect solution. Everything has things. But first, let\u2019s talk a lot more about water than we have talked about it.\u201d\n\nAbout NXT Conclave:\n\nAs nations navigate complex economic landscapes, rapid technological advancements, and the urgency of sustainability, NXT Conclave 2025 served as a catalyst for action. Designed to accelerate innovation, influence global policymaking, and foster strategic collaborations, NXT will play a defining role in shaping the future of industries, economies, and societies.\n\nMore than just a summit, NXT drove tangible action.

            "content": "Almost a year ago, we launched our biggest Home Care innovation ever, Wonder Wash, under our Dirt Is Good brand (also known as OMO, Persil, Surf Excel, Breeze, Rinso, Ala and Skip).\n\nThis is our first liquid laundry detergent specifically designed to work in short cycles \u2013 as quick as 15 minutes \u2013 in response to the growing need for speed and convenience.\n\nAs well as addressing a huge gap in the market, it also marks the fastest deployment of an innovation from our Home Care business, on the back of unprecedented consumer demand. The roll-out has seen the whole business step up: from our supply chain teams scaling up production to our customer teams engaging retailers.\n\nAs Nadine Slyper, Dirt Is Good Global Marketing Director, says: \u201cWonder Wash is a great example of Unilever\u2019s GAP 2030 strategy in action. We unlocked a truly global consumer insight and used science and technology to develop an innovation that creates a new sub-category. As well as applying the power of AI to transform our operations, we\u2019re also tapping into new audiences and talking to them in innovative social-first ways.\u201d\n\nInsight-led disruption of the laundry category\n\nWonder Wash is the biggest disruptor in the laundry category for decades, responding to the insight that around 80% of consumers in key global markets use the quick cycle setting on their washing machine at least once a week.\n\nWe found that people are using quick washes for loads with either no or light visible staining. With changing lifestyles and jobs, on average, 70% of dirt on clothes is now invisible \u2013 caused by things like sweat and dust.\n\nAlso, the rise in synthetic clothing, such as sports and athleisurewear, can pose particular challenges to consumers as the synthetic fibres retain odours which are difficult to remove.\n\nThe short cycle category is predicted to grow by 21% year on year and be worth \u20ac2 billion by 2026.\n\n\u201cIn line with changing lifestyles, we\u2019re seeing consumers increasingly use short cycles to do their laundry,\u201d says Nadine. \u201cHowever, regular detergents aren\u2019t optimised to perform in short cycles. So we designed Wonder Wash to really deliver against what consumers are looking for even in the shortest cycles.\u201d\n\nOur plan is to roll out to 20 markets in 20 months from its initial April 2024 launch. So far, it\u2019s landed in ten markets and it\u2019s already the fastest-growing innovation in the category.\n\nIt has contributed to OMO becoming the No.1 brand in liquid detergents in the UK, France and Turkey. This is partly down to attracting new consumers to the brand, including pre-family households, Gen X and empty nesters.",

There were unconfirmed reports that the European conglomerate tried shopping the business around but couldn\u2019t find a buyer. Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a rocky relationship lately with its parent, suing Unilever over sales in the West Bank/Occupied Palestinian Territories (Ben & Jerry\u2019s tried to halt sales in protest of Israeli settlements there) and, this January, over Unilever deleting a social media post on abortion, climate change, minimum wages and universal healthcare \u201cbecause it specifically mentioned Donald Trump,\u201d according to several media reports.\n\nAs Bloomberg said, they may need to partner with socially minded investors in any transaction because the Ben & Jerry\u2019s business could be valued at several billion dollars in a sale, which means the founders would need deep-pocketed financial backers to make it happen.\n\nIt\u2019s also uncertain if Unilever would sell Ben & Jerry\u2019s separately from the rest of the ice cream business, which includes such brands as Breyers and Magnum. \u201cWe are on track to separate the ice cream business by way of a demerger.

The arrangement sometimes caused tension between the board and Unilever, and the relationship has been visibly melting since Ben & Jerry\u2019s decided to cease sales in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in 2021.\n\nIn mid-November, Ben & Jerry\u2019s filed a censorship lawsuit against Unilever, alleging that the packaged goods giant \u201cunilaterally blocked\u201d statements made by the ice cream company about the issue of Palestinian human rights.\n\nThen on Feb. 13, the company filed an updated complaint, saying that earlier that day president Peter ter Kulve \u201cunilaterally erected a policy prohibiting Ben & Jerry\u2019s from issuing any posts criticizing President Trump until further review.\u201d Counsel for Ben & Jerry\u2019s asked Southern District Court of New York Judge Kevin P. Castel to have this latest instance added to the censorship suit.\n\nBoth sides have filed multiple motions since November, with Unilever arguing that the suit should be dismissed because Ben & Jerry\u2019s is a wholly owned subsidiary, therefore Unilever cannot legally sue itself.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s, on the other hand, states in the recent filing that its directors are \u201cthe appropriate parties to bring suit in case of a breach by Unilever\u201d because of \u201cthe parties\u2019 multiple agreements cementing the Independent Board\u2019s authority over Ben & Jerry\u2019s Social Mission and brand integrity.\u201d\n\nA status conference with Judge Castel was scheduled for today in federal court in New York.\n\nThis latest action comes as Unilever\u2019s chief executive prepares to leave his position. The UK-based company announced on Tuesday that Hein Schumacher is stepping down as chief executive officer and as a member of the company\u2019s board of directors as of March 1 and will leave the company by May 31.\n\nUnilever Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director Fernando Fernandez will take over the role of chief executive effective March 1, the announcement says.\n\nSchumacher has presided over the roll-out of corporate plans to separate Unilever\u2019s ice cream brands, including Ben & Jerry\u2019s, as a stand-alone entity.\n\n\u201cHein introduced and led a significant productivity programme and the commencement of the Ice Cream separation, both of which are fully on track,\u201d Unilever Board Chair Ian Meakins said in the announcement. \u201cThe Growth Action Plan has put Unilever on a path to higher performance and the Board is committed to accelerating its execution. We are grateful for Hein\u2019s leadership, and we wish him the very best for the future.\u201d\n\nA search will be done for a permanent chief financial officer for Unilever, the company said. In the interim starting March 1, current Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Group Controller Srinivas Phatak will assume the role of acting CFO.\n\nAs for Cohen and Greenfield buying back the brand, the founders would likely need to partner with investors who aren\u2019t just socially minded but also have very deep pockets. In an emailed statement to Fortune.com, a spokesperson for Unilever said, \u201cBen & Jerry\u2019s is an important part of the ice cream business, and it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Ben & Jerry\u2019s said in an email to Waterbury Roundabout that \u201congoing litigation prevents us from commenting on specific matters at this time.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The founders of Ben & Jerry\u2019s have expressed interest in buying back their namesake ice cream brand from Unilever Plc, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield have held some initial discussions in recent months about a potential deal, the people said. They may look to partner with socially minded investors in any transaction, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information.\n\nThe Ben & Jerry\u2019s business could be valued at several billion dollars in a sale, which means the founders would need deep-pocketed financial backers to make it happen, one of the people said. There\u2019s no certainty the discussions will progress and they could decide not to pursue a deal, according to the people.\n\n\u201cAs confirmed during our 2024 FY results announcement, we are on track to separate the ice cream business by way of a demerger,\u201d a spokesperson for Unilever said in an emailed statement. \u201cBen & Jerry\u2019s is an important part of the ice cream business, and it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d\n\nUnilever shares traded down 0.7% shortly after 10 a.m. Thursday in London, mainly due to the stock trading without the right to a dividend.\n\nA representative for Cohen and Greenfield declined to comment.\n\nUnilever has been pursuing a spinoff of its ice cream business as part of a cost-cutting drive. Chief Executive Officer Hein Schumacher, who was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Fernando Fernandez in a surprise ouster this week, had been working on splitting off the ice cream unit and improving its performance.\n\nThe company is planning for the spinoff to go public primarily in Amsterdam, with secondary listings in London and New York. The US is the biggest market for Unilever\u2019s ice cream brands, which also include Breyers and Magnum.\n\nCohen and Greenfield, who started their Burlington, Vermont-based company in 1978, agreed to sell Ben & Jerry\u2019s to Unilever in 2000 for $326 million. In addition to whimsical flavors such as Cherry Garcia, Chubby Hubby and Bohemian Raspberry, their brand became associated with progressive, social justice issues.\n\nThe deal gave power over the social mission of Ben & Jerry\u2019s to an independent board, which has continued to pursue those concerns, sometimes to the consternation of Unilever. The two sides have been fighting since 2021, when Ben & Jerry\u2019s said it would halt sales in the West Bank. Unilever has since sold its ice cream unit in Israel to a local producer.",

            "content": "5 Mins Read\n\nUnilever\u2019s struggle to sell The Vegetarian Butcher and Nestl\u00e9 and Monde Nissin\u2019s slowing meat alternative sales are bad news for the plant-based market.\n\nIn the span of seven months, the CEOs of Nestl\u00e9, Monde Nissin, and Unilever have all left their roles amid weak sales, as the company\u2019s boards look to accelerate strategy executions with fresh leadership.\n\nEach of these Big Food companies owns some of the largest plant-based meat brands in the world, which have been a talking point in their financial discourse. The bottom line is, it feels like they\u2019re not getting what they want out of meat alternatives.\n\nQuorn, the mycoprotein pioneer that Monde Nissin acquired a decade ago, has been struggling for several years now, posting double-digit losses in the last quarter after sales hit a six-year-low the year before.\n\nNestl\u00e9, which pulled its Garden Gourmet brand from the UK in two separate instances, has been forced to slim its meat-free offerings under the Sweet Earth brand.\n\nAnd Unilever, whose CEO Hein Schumacher is stepping down this weekend, is in a bind with The Vegetarian Butcher. The CPG giant has been looking to offload the vegan meat brand as part of its strategy to \u201cprune\u201d its vast portfolio, and is facing an uphill battle to find buyers at attractive prices.\n\nIt paints a dim picture of the plant-based meat industry. Big Food hopped on the bandwagon in the late 2010s on the back of the explosive success of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, but now, it\u2019s stuck in limbo with meat alternatives.\n\nQuorn sales shrink further as Nestl\u00e9 withdraws alt-meat offerings\n\nCourtesy: Quorn\n\nIn September, company accounts showed that the pre-tax losses of Marlow Foods \u2013 the parent division of Quorn and Cauldron Foods \u2013 quadrupled in 2023, surpassing \u00a360M. And while the business slashed its selling and distribution costs by nearly half, the soaring cost of goods caused its gross profit to plunge from \u00a365M in 2022 to just \u00a31.4M in 2023.\n\nShortly after, Quorn CEO Marco Bertacca stepped down and was replaced by former Heineken UK managing director David Flochel, who called 2025 a \u201creset year\u201d for the firm.\n\nHowever, according to Monde Nissin\u2019s latest earnings report published on the Philippines Stock Exchange, Quorn\u2019s losses kept widening in the latter half of 2024, from single-digit declines in Q3 to a decrease in the mid-teens in Q4, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The company said it \u201ccontinues to operate in a challenging environment\u201d, but in spite of the topline weakness, it expected to achieve positive EBITDA \u2013 revenue excluding all non-operational expenses \u2013 in Q4.\n\nStill, Monde Nissin noted that it may book \u00a380-100M in impairment charges for Quorn \u2013 these are reductions in the recoverable value of an asset. \u201cAlthough substantial, this figure is notably lower than last year\u2019s impairment,\u201d the company said. (It wrote down \u00a3145M in 2023 and \u00a3290M in 2022, and has pledged to make up the impairment value for Quorn every year until 2032).\n\nQuorn remains one of the best-selling meat-free brands in the world, though its financial turmoil in recent years is a marker of the troubles that befall plant-based companies today.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem illustrated by the world\u2019s largest food company too. Nestl\u00e9 CEO Laurent Freixe \u2013 who was appointed in August \u2013 has said that the business excessively focused on meat alternatives, subsequently finding that the market wasn\u2019t as big as initially thought, according to Reuters.\n\nA Nestl\u00e9 representative told the news agency that its Sweet Earth label now only sells bowls like General Tso\u2019s tofu and bulgogi, having discontinued items like plant-based chicken strips and bacon.\n\nCan Unilever find the right price for The Vegetarian Butcher?\n\nCourtesy: The Vegetarian Butcher\n\nFaltering sales have also decreased the value of industry-leading brands. You\u2019d think the plant-based meat supplier to Burger King and Subway in multiple markets would be hot property for potential buyers, but Unilever is finding it hard to offload The Vegetarian Butcher at the price it wants.\n\nSky News reported in November that Unilever had hired Piper Sandler to run an auction for the sale of the Dutch vegan business, with \u201ca number of potential buyers\u201d in talks for the deal. Unilever declined to comment on \u201cmarket rumour or speculation\u201d when approached by Green Queen.\n\nThe move followed the consumer goods company\u2019s decision to scale back a number of its key climate goals and focus on its \u201cpower brands\u201d, which collectively represent over three-quarters of its turnover. It had already begun demerging its ice cream units in India and Indonesia, and is mulling a sale of its global ice cream division, which includes Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Magnum.\n\nBut Reuters reports that The Vegetarian Butcher \u2013 which Unilever bought in 2018 \u2013 only records around \u20ac50M in annual sales and is loss-making, according to analysts, who suggest that it may appeal to trade buyers like meat producers looking to diversify into plant-based alternatives.\n\nUnilever this week ousted Schumacher who said the board was keen to \u201cstep up the pace of our strategy execution and realise swift value creation underscored by a change in leadership\u201d, installing CFO Fernando Fernandez as the new chief executive.\n\nBig Food losing faith as UPF discourse heats up\n\nCourtesy: Ben Curtis/AP\n\nThese are the latest signs of uncertainty for plant-based companies, whose sales and valuations have been hurt by the ultra-processed food (UPF) debate. Consumers have been moving towards fresher, more \u2018natural\u2019 foods, leaving processed meat analogue makers like Quorn and The Vegetarian Butcher scrambling.\n\nThese sentiments have been heightened by new US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s anti-UPF rhetoric, and sustained misinformation campaigns led by meat lobby groups.\n\nAll this has led several commentators to mourn an apparent demise of the industry, which they ascribe to an \u201canti-vegan backlash\u201d. But for all the criticism, while retail sales of meat alternatives have continued to decline in the US, they grew by 3% between 2022 and 2023 in Europe\u2019s largest markets.\n\nFor the world\u2019s biggest food companies, plant-based meat still remains an impediment to their aggressive growth strategies, and that\u2019s a problem for the alternative protein sector.\n\nCould a sales turnaround for Quorn and a successful exit for The Vegetarian Butcher convince investors and businesses otherwise?",

            "content": "Unilever surprised investors on Tuesday by ousting well-regarded CEO Hein Schumacher after less than two years on the job.\n\nSchumacher\u2019s departure led to Unilever\u2019s shares falling by as much as 3.4% that day. Despite a slight rebound Wednesday the price hasn\u2019t reached pre-announcement levels yet.\n\n\u201cWe are gobsmacked at the news that Unilever\u2019s very highly regarded CEO Hein Schumacher is to step down,\u201d RBC Capital analyst James Edwardes Jones said, according to Reuters.\n\nSources close to the leadership change indicated that the move wasn\u2019t the result of anything \u201cuntoward.\u201d Instead, the change was due to a desire to speed up Unilever\u2019s recent underperformance.\n\nDespite Schumacher\u2019s efforts to implement changes, including cost cuts and plans to spin off divisions of the company, the board believed CFO Fernando Fernandez was better suited to drive the strategy forward, per the Reuters report. Fernandez is a 40-year veteran of Unilever, so there is some familiarity in leadership going forward.\n\nCompany Chairman Ian Meakins said Fernandez impressed the board with his \u201cdecisive and results-oriented approach.\u201d\n\nWhy it matters: With any leadership change, there are two main questions a company needs to answer: Why and why now?\n\nFor Unilever, the answer to both questions is it wants quicker execution of its turnaround strategy. Though light on specifics, sources looked to stress that the replacement was in a better position to achieve goals faster.\n\n\u201cWhile the Board is pleased with Unilever\u2019s performance in 2024, there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results. Having worked with Fernando closely over the last 14 months, the Board is very confident in his ability to lead a high performing management team, realize the benefits of the [Growth Action Plan] with urgency, and deliver the shareholder value that the company\u2019s potential demands,\u201d Meakins said in a statement.\n\nWhile a definite response to the move, it\u2019s definitely not an answer as to why it happened. It\u2019s vague, jargon-heavy and doesn\u2019t appear to be much of an initial justification move to either investors or analysts.\n\nDiana Radu, equity analyst at Morningstar, described the move as \u201cunexpected\u201d in a conversation with CNBC.\n\nMeakins even praised Schumacher for leading a \u201csignificant productivity programme and the commencement of the Ice Cream separation, both of which are fully on track. The Growth Action Plan has put Unilever on a path to higher performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the company\u2019s recent performance to warrant such a move,\u201d she said, who described his tenure as being marked by \u201cgreater focus\u201d and \u201cdisciplined execution.\u201d\n\nBringing Fernandez in might suggest Unilever is going for a more aggressive, results-focused approach, but the lack of clarity around Schumacher\u2019s departure could leave some investors feeling uncertain, especially those who were optimistic before.\n\nNow, Unilever has the tricky job of convincing the market that this change will boost performance, not cause more instability.\n\nEditor\u2019s Top Reads:\n\nA growing number of Americans expect a recession within the next year, along with a weaker job market, falling stock prices and rising interest rates. The nonpartisan Conference Board reported that consumer confidence experienced its largest monthly drop since August 2021. Concerns over inflation persist, with consumer prices up 3% in January from the previous year. This surpasses the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, according to ABC News . Tariff policies under President Donald Trump have further fueled economic anxieties, with 70% of Americans believing tariffs will drive prices higher, per the ABC News report. While there\u2019s no immediate cause for concern for brands, these indicators suggest that people don\u2019t have much confidence in the direction of the national economy. When that happens, people tend to cut back on discretionary spending and things perceived as luxuries tend to see a drop in sales figures. Brands would be wise to monitor how people are talking about and engaging with them on social media to see if they need to adjust messaging to highlight things like value, need and quality compared to the competition.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is celebrating 50 years of the Egg McMuffin by doubling down on breakfast and emphasizing value as food prices continue to rise.

As restaurants implement surcharges due to rising food prices , McDonald\u2019s is positioning itself as an affordable option. \u201cUnlike others making news recently, you definitely WON\u2019T see McDonald\u2019s USA issuing surcharges on eggs, which are 100% cage-free and sourced in the U.S.,\u201d Michael Gonda, McDonald\u2019s chief impact officer for North America , wrote on LinkedIn . The promotion comes not long after McDonald\u2019s reported its worst quarterly sales drop since the pandemic .

Unilever and the ten collaborative manufacturers expect to generate cost savings of approximately 25% over the 20-year period, compared to the cost of grid electricity.\n\nWith this single contract, we\u2019re aiming to meet nearly a quarter of Unilever\u2019s own operational electricity demand in India with renewables. Yogesh Mishra, Executive Director, Supply Chain for HUL & Nepal\n\nCutting carbon beyond our own operations \u2013 where our suppliers come in\n\nCollaborative manufacturers make products on our behalf and account for around a third of all manufacturing for Unilever in India.\n\nTypically, many have not taken major steps to reduce their climate impact and are too small to secure competitive rates for renewable energy. Having long-term access to fixed-priced electricity will change that \u2013 so we helped negotiate this deal on their behalf.\n\nAlpla India is one of our collaborative manufacturers and part of Alpla Group which also supplies packaging to Unilever. \u201cAs part of Unilever\u2019s Supplier Climate Programme, we are fully aligned with Unilever\u2019s climate ambition and have science-based targets in place,\u201d says Alpla India\u2019s Managing Director and Partner Vagish Dixit. \u201cPartnering on this PPA will help us to lower emissions from our operations faster than we would have been able to working alone.\u201d\n\nThe agreement will help these collaborative manufacturers reduce their Scope 2 (our Scope 3) emissions from electricity use by over 28,000 tonnes of CO2e per year over the 20-year period. It will also enable Unilever to more directly source renewable electricity used to power its own sites, making it easily trackable from generation to consumption.\n\nSupporting new renewable energy infrastructure in India\n\n\u201cWith this single contract, we\u2019re aiming to meet nearly a quarter of Unilever\u2019s own operational electricity demand in India with renewables,\u201d says Yogesh Mishra, Executive Director, Supply Chain for HUL & Nepal.\n\nHUL (Hindustan Unilever Limited) has been working for over a decade to introduce more renewables into its energy mix. It stopped using direct coal on-site for thermal energy in 2021. It has switched to on-site solar arrays and started using PPAs and buying IRECs (renewable electricity certificates).\n\n\u201cNow we are working closely with collaborative manufacturers to make a greater impact with our sustainability agenda and to create value across our supply chain,\u201d Yogesh says. \u201cBy transitioning electricity use to renewable sources of energy, this initiative will help us move towards our climate targets and net zero ambition.\u201d\n\nThis is only the beginning of our work with Indian suppliers in this area. Once the project is live, we have the option of expanding it by a further 20MW to include other suppliers beyond manufacturing, for example those across raw materials and packaging.\n\nStronger government support helps businesses switch to renewables\n\nGovernments that create enabling policies for PPAs can help businesses to reduce emissions faster. This is why Unilever has been calling for strong nationally determined contributions (NDCs).\n\nTo help support the transition to renewables, the Government of India has offered incentives for early adopters. Businesses that have agreements in place before June 2025 will have all central transmission charges waived for the duration of their contract.\n\nCurrently transmitting new renewable energy across state is up to 15-20% more expensive than existing power options. The waiver will be an enabler that generates financial savings, and as such, in this instance has been a significant selling point for our partners.\n\nPioneering power agreements across multiple states with multiple partners\n\nThis is the first time a PPA in India has covered so much ground and it required securing approvals from the Government of India, distribution companies and state governments. But it is the first initiative of its kind across the FMCG industry in India, and it paves the way for other companies to follow.",

Credit: Unilever\n\nUnilever\u2019s revelation of the sudden departure of Hein Schumacher \u2013 before he could celebrate a second summer as CEO \u2013 seemed shrouded in mystery.\n\nBut the devil might just be in the detail \u2013 in the case of Unilever, the choice of words used by chairman Ian Meakins to announce the exit of Schumacher just eighteen months after he joined the CPG giant from dairy group FrieslandCampina.\n\nAnd the expectations on incoming chief Fernando Fernandez \u2013 promoted to CFO in January 2024 from president of the company\u2019s beauty and wellbeing division \u2013 might well weigh heavily, with the terminology expressed by Meakins indicative of the pressures on executives to deliver results in such a fraught operating environment.\n\nThat environment was evident in the comments coming out of CAGNY presentations last week around consumers still struggling with food affordability, while manufacturers are still having to raise prices to offset inflation-linked costs and, at the same time, protect volumes and margins.\n\n\u201cSpeed\u201d and \u201curgency\u201d would appear to be the not-so-obvious details in Meakins comments but you would have to look closely.\n\nThe \u201cboard is committed to accelerating its execution\u201d, the Unilever chairman said in a statement, referring to the Growth Action Plan (GAP) Schumacher put in place in October 2023, a speedy move just three months after taking the CEO baton.\n\nAnd, perhaps more revealing, Meakins added: \u201cThe board has been impressed with Fernando\u2019s decisive and results-oriented approach and his ability to drive change at speed\u2026\n\n\u201cHaving worked with Fernando closely over the last 14 months, the board is very confident in his ability to lead a high-performing management team, realise the benefits of the GAP with urgency, and deliver the shareholder value that the company\u2019s potential demands.\u201d\n\nDemand being another operative word there.\n\nMuted share reaction\n\nOne might have expected the shock announcement would have sent Unilever\u2019s shares into a dive. But, while they started and traded the day yesterday (25 February) in the red, the decline was limited to around one and a half percent.\n\nRead into that what you will.\n\n\u201cWhilst unexpected, we agree with the board that Fernandez is best placed to accelerate the value unlock. We would buy into weakness,\u201d Barclays analysts, led by Warren Ackerman, wrote in a research note.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you get unexpected CEO change, the market worries about a problem or trading. This isn\u2019t the case here \u2013 rather, the board have made a decisive decision to empower, in our view, the best candidate for the next leg of the story.\u201d\n\nEighteen months is still a short innings for a CEO to make an indelible mark on a business and strategy, but Schumacher has put some notable plans in place at Unilever. Of course, the rate of change may not have been to the board\u2019s liking.\n\nMarket talk has suggested the softness in sales growth implied for the early part of Unilever\u2019s new financial year \u2013 when 2024 results were delivered on 13 February \u2013 might have led to Schumacher\u2019s demise.\n\nWhile that reasoning seems unlikely given Unilever\u2019s challenges are generally no different to other food manufacturers \u2013 although still plausible \u2013 his departure is perhaps indicative of the urgency felt by the higher echelons.\n\nSales subdued\n\nUnderlying sales growth (USG) in Schumacher\u2019s first full year as Unilever CEO did slow to 4.2% last year, from 7% in 2023, but volumes ticked up to 2.9% from a meagre 0.2%. Margins also continued in the right direction.\n\nThe underlying operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 18.4%, building on the 60 point-gain in the previous 12 months. And the gross margin rose 280 basis points to 45% \u2013 the highest in a decade, according to Unilever.\n\nAnd, for shareholders, underlying EPS advanced 14.7% to \u20ac2.98 ($3.12), a vast improvement on 2023\u2019s 1.4% pace.\n\nNevertheless, with Unilever more than a month into its new fiscal year when the 2024 results were presented, Jefferies\u2019 analysts suggest the sales environment could have worsened since.\n\nThat said, both the short- and mid-term USG guidance remained unchanged in yesterday\u2019s executive announcement at 3-5% and 4-6%, respectively. But, setting out the course earlier this month, Unilever guided to only a \u201cmodest improvement\u201d in the underlying operating margin in the new year.\n\n\u201cCompany reiterates guidance. But indications [were] that 1Q had seen a much slower start, with OSG indicated to be perhaps no more than 3%,\u201d the Jefferies team, including David Hayes, wrote in a follow-up note. \u201cThe worry will be that this slowdown has deepened in the last few weeks.\u201d\n\nTD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow emphasised the theme, choosing the term \u201curgency\u201d in his follow-up commentary.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, this announcement fits our buy thesis that the board is running Unilever with a performance-driven mindset and urgency that had been lacking previously,\u201d Moskow wrote in a research note.\n\nBut Moskow also expressed some concerns on behalf of TD Cowen: \u201cMaking a decision like this in such a short time frame probably reflects a sense of dissatisfaction with the company\u2019s near-term performance to some degree.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we can\u2019t help but wonder if the company\u2019s guidance for a back-half loaded 2025 will play out as expected, even though management technically reiterated guidance.\u201d\n\nM&A thirst?\n\nAs CEO, Schumacher pledged to streamline Unilever\u2019s portfolio under a productivity programme to realise \u20ac800m in costs savings, but while he disposed of a number of assets, mainly in the Netherlands but also in Germany and Romania, the company\u2019s board may have wanted more. And with sales growth slowing in 2024, perhaps a gap needed plugging in terms of acquisitions, a point put forward by Jefferies.\n\nPerhaps even more so as Schumacher has also overseen the planned demerger of the ice-cream business, which is slated to be spun-off by the year-end with a trio of listings announced this month in London, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nAnd, in November, Unilever confirmed the demerger of its ice-cream business units in India and Indonesia, too.\n\nWhilst Hein\u2019s experience was in foods, remember Fernandez\u2019s background is more HPC (this is Unilever\u2019s future) Barclays analysts\n\nHowever, presenting the Growth Action Plan in October 2023, the outgoing CEO said Unilever would \u201cselectively optimise the portfolio\u201d with \u201cno major or transformational acquisitions\u201d.\n\nHe added at the time: \u201cWe will continue to prune the portfolio in areas that are less strategically attractive. This will be accompanied by selective bolt-on acquisitions focused in specific high-growth areas, provided they meet the higher bar for M&A criteria and parameters for value creation.\u201d\n\nThe Jefferies team wrote on Schumacher\u2019s departure: \u201cWe would see this creating much uncertainty on the performance in 1Q; what it means for strategy, especially M&A; [and] what now for additional cost cuts and other acceleration of changes.\u201d\n\nThey added, noting the aborted bid by Schumacher\u2019s predecessor Alan Jope to buy GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s consumer-health business in 2022: \u201cThis provides free-range to the board and new CEO to review strategy. That may see a different positioning on M&A strategy.\n\n\u201cWe have considered a need to revisit bigger acquisition ambition, as demonstrated in 1Q22 re: the failed approach for GSK CH for \u00a350bn.\u201d\n\nFernandez, meanwhile, will take up the CEO role on 1 March, the same day Schumacher steps down but he will stay on until May. Market talk is, at least according to Sky News\u2018 sources earlier this month, that Unilever has agreed terms to buy the personal-care business Wild, reportedly for \u00a3230m ($290.8m).\n\nUnilever incoming CEO Fernando Fernandez. Credit: Unilever\n\n\n\nWas that prospective deal opposed by Schumacher? Perhaps we will never know.\n\n\u201cWhilst Hein\u2019s experience was in foods, remember Fernandez\u2019s background is more HPC (this is Unilever\u2019s future),\u201d the Barclays team wrote.\n\nAnd what does that suggest for Unilever\u2019s nutrition (food) unit, which has long been touted as a potential divestment target?\n\nJope reorganised operations into five divisions in 2022 \u2013 nutrition, ice cream, beauty and wellbeing, personal care and home care \u2013 at a time when speculation was rife that food could be chopped, and even ice cream.\n\nWhile Schumacher put in motion the plan to spin-off ice cream in March 2024, he had ruled out the full blown disposal of \u2018food\u2019.\n\nThe Barclays\u2019 analysts gave their perspective: \u201cWe believe that Hein did a very good job overseeing a lot of change in a short period of time \u2013 strategy reset, organisational change, productivity acceleration and innovation step-up.\n\n\u201cUnilever delivered its best results in more than a decade in 2024 with EPS +15%, and so this decision is not a slight on Hein Schumacher.\n\n\u201cWe view it as a hard-nosed decision by the board about who is the best person going forward into the next stage of its evolution.\u201d\n\nPace was evident in the Barclays\u2019 comments, too, as the Ackerman-led team suggested Fernandez \u201cmay look to accelerate portfolio change and drive costs out more quickly\u201d.\n\nAnd Moskow at TD Cowen also stressed the point: \u201cUnilever\u2019s sudden announcement that Hein Schumacher will step down as CEO on March 1 suggests dissatisfaction with the pace of the company\u2019s turnaround.\u201d\n\nSo what might Fernandez do differently to the departing Schumacher? We might just get a sense when Unilever presents its first-quarter trading update on 24 April with the new CEO at the helm.\n\nIn the meantime, Hayes\u2019 team at Jefferies wrote: \u201cThe step-up from CFO to CEO by Fernandez will be liked by many investors. They like his direct approach but some may also see his style as somewhat maverick.\u201d",

LISTEN NOW Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nUnilever Plc on Tuesday pushed out Chief Executive Officer Hein Schumacher after less than two years, signaling that the board wasn't satisfied with the pace of restructuring at the maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry's ice cream.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company said Chief Financial Officer Fernando Fernandez will take over as CEO on March 1 and hailed his ability to \"drive change at speed,\" hinting that the board wants to push Unilever's transformation even faster.\n\nSchumacher took over from Alan Jope in July 2023, at a time when investor confidence was low and after Unilever had granted activist investor Nelson Peltz a seat on the board. The Dutch executive quickly kicked off a shakeup that included plans to spin off its ice-cream business and cut costs.\n\nSchumacher has tried to shift away from price-led growth where possible after a period of high inflation, focusing on expanding the volume of products sold. Unilever's brands also include Dove soap, Knorr stock cubes and Pepsodent toothpaste.\n\nThe former boss of dairy cooperative Royal FrieslandCampina also watered down Unilever's \"purpose\" agenda. Jope and his predecessor, Paul Polman, had argued household products espousing a social mission -- such as empowering body confidence or promoting hygiene -- perform better than those without. It was derided by some investors, who wanted to see more sales growth.\n\nShares of Unilever fell 1.7% in London on Tuesday. They've risen 8% during the tenure of Schumacher, who will stay on at the company until May 31.\n\n\"I regret leaving Unilever earlier than anticipated,\" Schumacher said in email to Unilever staff seen by Bloomberg. \"I stand by my record and approach.\"\n\nChairman Ian Meakins said the decision for Schumacher to leave was mutual and the board was impressed with Fernandez's \"decisive and results-oriented approach\" and \"profound knowledge of Unilever's operations.\"\n\n\"While the board is pleased with Unilever's performance in 2024, there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results,\" Meakins said.\n\nFernandez joined Unilever in 1988 and has overseen some of the company's best-performing markets, including in Brazil and the Philippines. He was also president of the Latin America division.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Sarah Jacob and Sabah Meddings of Bloomberg News.",

In previous roles as President Latin America, CEO Brazil and CEO Philippines he led some of the company\u2019s best performing markets, delivering strong financial results while developing exceptional talent.\n\nUnilever Chairman Ian Meakins said: \u201cOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Hein for resetting Unilever\u2019s strategy, for the focus and discipline he has brought to the company and for the solid financial progress delivered during 2024. Hein introduced and led a significant productivity programme and the commencement of the Ice Cream separation, both of which are fully on track.

Our focus will be on building a future-fit portfolio with an attractive growth footprint and delivering unmatched functional and perceivable superiority across our top 30 power brands. I have full confidence in our team's ability to propel Unilever to a global industry-leading position and create substantial value for our shareholders. I would like to thank Hein for his values-led leadership and the performance focus he has brought to the business. I wish him every success for the future.\"\n\nA thorough internal and external search process is being initiated to appoint a permanent CFO. From 1 March 2025, Srinivas Phatak, currently Unilever\u2019s Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Group Controller, will become acting CFO. Srinivas has served in global and local senior finance, strategy and supply chain roles including a successful term as CFO of Hindustan Unilever Limited. Srinivas\u2019 leadership qualities and his broad experience will enable him to partner Fernando in successfully executing Unilever\u2019s strategy.\n\nThere is no change to Unilever\u2019s 2025 outlook or the company\u2019s medium-term guidance.\n\nThis announcement contains inside information.

He brought an extensive track record in sustainability-minded, supply chain overhauls. Unilever was undergoing its own supply chain transformation at the time Schumacher joined the company.\n\nIn 2024, Unilever expanded a collaborative end-to-end supply chain model to key global customers after a successful Walmart Mexico pilot, initiated in 2022, delivered on-shelf availability rates of over 98%.\n\nIt\u2019s part of an effort to achieve what they termed \u201cOne Supply Chain\u201d \u2014 a model that seeks to accelerate end-to-end visibility of the supply chain, including promotional planning and execution. It is synchronized and optimized by the company\u2019s proprietary artificial intelligence solution, Juan-Carlos Parada, Unilever's global head of customer operation, previously told CGT.\n\nAligned with those goals, Schumacher launched the company\u2019s productivity program to drive growth through a leaner, more focused approach supported by investments in tech.

Credit: Unilever media files\n\nUnilever has announced Hein Schumacher will step down as CEO within days, just 18 months after he joined the consumer goods giant from FrieslandCampina.\n\nIn a statement to the London Stock Exchange today (25 February), Unilever said Schumacher will relinquish the CEO role on 1 March and will officially leave the Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise owner on 31 May.\n\nCurrent finance chief Fernando Fernandez will step into the CEO seat from the 1 March. He was only promoted to CFO in January 2024 after heading up Unilever\u2019s beauty and wellness division.\n\nWhile an internal and external search for a replacement CFO is initiated, Srinivas Phatak, Unilever\u2019s deputy chief financial officer, will takeover from Fernandez.\n\nSchumacher is leaving the Knorr brand maker after putting in place a Growth Action Plan (GAP), alongside a productivity programme to realise \u20ac800m ($838.2m) in cost savings, which, while still ongoing, have come at the expense of thousands of jobs.\n\nThe outgoing Unilever CEO has also overseen the planned demerger of the ice-cream business, which is slated to be spun-off by the year-end with a trio of listings in London, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nHe has also made a number of brand disposals to simplify Unilever\u2019s operational structure, mainly with the divestment of some Dutch product lines, along with potentially selling The Vegetarian Butcher meat-free business.\n\nCommenting on Schumacher\u2019s departure, Unilever chairman Ian Meakins said: \u201cOn behalf of the board, I would like to thank Hein for resetting Unilever\u2019s strategy, for the focus and discipline he has brought to the company and for the solid financial progress delivered during 2024.\n\n\u201cHein introduced and led a significant productivity programme and the commencement of the ice-cream separation, both of which are fully on track.\n\n\u201cThe Growth Action Plan (GAP) has put Unilever on a path to higher performance and the board is committed to accelerating its execution.\u201d\n\nMeakins added with respect to Fernandez\u2019s appointment: \u201cWhile the board is pleased with Unilever\u2019s performance in 2024, there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results.\n\n\u201cHaving worked with Fernando closely over the last 14 months, the board is very confident in his ability to lead a high-performing management team, realise the benefits of the GAP with urgency, and deliver the shareholder value that the company\u2019s potential demands.\u201d\n\nUnilever\u2019s shares have so far showed a relatively muted reaction to the executive changes. They were down 1.5% at 4,414 pence as of 11:11am BST in London today.\n\nLess than two weeks ago, Unilever reported its financial results for the 2024 fiscal year and at the same time confirmed the listings for ice cream.\n\nWhile the results were generally positive, Unilever indicated its underlying sales growth (USG) in the new financial year is likely to slow in the early part of 2025 before picking up sequentially, with inflation-linked pricing to play a part.\n\nThe company reported a USG print of 4.2% in 2024, while underlying volumes increased by 2.9%. There was also further progression in the gross margin.\n\nUnilever, meanwhile, reaffirmed its financial outlook for 2025 and its medium-term guidance today.

            "content": "By Yadarisa Shabong and Josephine Mason\n\n(Reuters) - Unilever surprised investors on Tuesday by ousting chief executive Hein Schumacher and replacing him with finance chief Fernando Fernandez, who will focus on speeding up the execution of the consumer group's turnaround strategy.\n\nUnilever's board, which includes billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz, was unified in its decision to oust CEO Schumacher, a source familiar with the board's thinking told Reuters.\n\nSchumacher was surprised by the move, but the decision involved \"nothing untoward\", the person said.\n\nIn an email to associates, Schumacher defended his approach and record as CEO and said he regretted leaving the company earlier than anticipated.\n\n\"The board is eager to step up the pace of our strategy execution and realise swift value creation underscored by a change in leadership,\" he said in the email, which was shared with Reuters.\n\nThe CEO's sudden departure after less than two years in the job hit Unilever's shares, which fell as much as 3.4% on Tuesday. They had gained more than 9% since Schumacher took the helm on July 1, 2023.\n\nThe consumer goods industry has had a difficult time coping with a supply chain crunch triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, plus sky-high commodity prices and an energy crisis after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nProfit margins have been squeezed and sales volumes hit by consumers switching to cheaper options.\n\nUnilever, which gave no specific reason for the CEO change, is facing pressure from investors to revitalise its fortunes and the top management upheaval comes just weeks after Unilever announced underwhelming full-year earnings.\n\nNestle CEO Mark Schneider was ousted last year after several quarters of weak sales volume growth.\n\nUnilever's management change was made after a board meeting on Monday, another source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The board concluded that Fernandez, who has been with Unilever for nearly 40 years, was the right person to execute the company's strategy, the source said.\n\nSchumacher's appointment and strategic changes had been welcomed by Peltz, who built a stake in the company in 2022 and sits on Unilever's board.\n\n\"We are gobsmacked at the news that Unilever's very highly regarded CEO Hein Schumacher is to step down,\" RBC Capital analyst James Edwardes Jones said in a note.\n\nSponsored Bank Accounts\n\nWhen Schumacher became CEO, analysts and investors had applauded the choice of an external candidate as CEO.\n\nSchumacher reset the group's strategy to address years of underperformance and laid out cost cuts last year, including plans to separate its ice cream division and cut thousands of jobs.\n\nThe company has tried to step up the pace of asset sales, although some categories, like plant-based meat, are proving hard to exit.\n\nChairman Ian Meakins said the board was impressed by Fernandez's \"decisive and results-oriented approach\", and had given him the task of executing the growth strategy.\n\n\"There is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results,\" Meakins said in a statement.\n\nEXECUTION\n\nAnalysts and investors said the news was unexpected, but Fernandez was a good choice to lead Unilever's turnaround strategy.\n\n\"We agree with the board that Fernandez is best placed to accelerate the value unlock,\" Barclays analyst Warren Ackerman said in a note.\n\nUBS analyst Guillaume Delmas said \"execution is key\" in the new phase of the company's strategic journey.\n\nFernandez, 58, has been with Unilever since 1988. Before he became CFO last year, he held a number of roles such as President Latin America and CEO Brazil and President of the Beauty & Wellbeing business.\n\nHarsharan Mann in the Global Equities team at Aviva Investors, a Unilever shareholder, said: \"We were surprised by the announcement but have a positive view of the CFO ... He is a 30-year veteran of the business who ran the Beauty and Wellbeing division very well.\"\n\nIn January, Fernandez took up extra responsibilities including overseeing supply chain and procurement.\n\nUnilever, which owns Hellmann's mayonnaise, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream, said there was no change to its 2025 outlook or medium-term forecast and the board was committed to \"further accelerating\" Schumacher's growth plan.\n\nSchumacher, 53, will step down as CEO in March and leave the company on May 31. He is leaving by mutual agreement, the company said.\n\nHe will be treated as a \"good leaver\" and will continue to get his 1.85 million euros ($1.94 million) fixed pay until he leaves the business, the company said. He will then get an undisclosed payment for the remainder of this notice period, it said.\n\nSrinivas Phatak, currently Unilever's deputy chief financial officer and group controller, will become acting CFO, while the company looks for a permanent replacement.\n\n($1 = 0.9549 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Yadarisa Shabong in Bengaluru and Josephine Mason in London; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala, Kirsten Donovan and Jane Merriman)",

            "content": "Updated 7:48 GMT Feb. 25\n\nLONDON \u2014 After less than two years on the job, Hein Schumacher is out as chief executive officer of Unilever, a move that shocked the industry and prompted speculation about what might have led to his exit.\n\nMore from WWD\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchumacher, who joined as CEO in July 2023, will be succeeded by Fernando Fernandez, a Unilever veteran who is currently serving as chief financial officer and executive director.\n\nUnilever did not say why, exactly, Schumacher was leaving. The consumer giant, parent of brands including Dove, Vaseline and Tatcha, said only that he was stepping down as CEO and as a board member \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d and will leave the company officially on May 31.\n\nFernandez will take up the top job on Saturday. The move sent Unilever\u2019s shares down 2.3 percent to close at 43.80 pounds on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement, Unilever chairman Ian Meakins thanked Schumacher for \u201cresetting Unilever\u2019s strategy, for the focus and discipline he has brought to the company and for the solid financial progress delivered during 2024.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said Schumacher introduced and led \u201ca significant productivity program and the commencement of the ice cream [division\u2019s] separation, both of which are fully on track.\u201d\n\nMeakins added that Schumacher\u2019s growth action plan \u201chas put Unilever on a path to higher performance and the board is committed to accelerating its execution. We are grateful for Hein\u2019s leadership, and we wish him the very best for the future.\u201d\n\nWhile the board was \u201cpleased\u201d with Unilever\u2019s performance, Meakins said \u201cthere is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results.\u201d\n\nSchumacher said it was \u201ca privilege to lead Unilever. We have made real progress and I am proud of what we have achieved in a short period of time. With a clear strategy, a portfolio reset in motion and a strong leadership team in place, I look forward to seeing Unilever move from strength to strength in the future.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnilever said there is no change to the company\u2019s 2025 outlook or its medium-term guidance.\n\nUnilever House in London\n\nSchumacher will continue to receive his current level of fixed pay of 1.85 million euros up to the cessation of his employment in May. He will then be eligible for a payment in lieu of the remainder of his notice period.\n\nThe company said he will be treated as a \u201cgood leaver\u201d under the remuneration policy for the purposes of his outstanding incentives.\n\nSchumacher is a Dutch national and was formerly CEO of Royal FrieslandCampina, an international dairy and nutrition business. At Unilever, he succeeded Alan Jope, and immediately began reorganizing the company\u2019s structure and priorities to make it more efficient.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe phrase, \u201cWe committed to doing fewer things, better and with greater impact,\u201d became Schumacher\u2019s mantra during his short tenure.\n\nOn his watch, Unilever decided to separate the ice cream business and, after dragging its heels, finally pulled out of Russia due to the war in Ukraine. His turnaround plan aimed at capturing market share and boosting profits has begun to bear fruit.\n\nAs reported, the ice cream business will be separated by way of a demerger, and the new business will be listed in Amsterdam, London and New York, the same three exchanges on which Unilever shares are currently traded. The demerger is set to take place by the end of 2025.\n\nSome analysts speculated that Schumacher\u2019s warning of a \u201csoft\u201d start to the new year might have signaled the beginning of the end. \u201cThe worry will be that this slowdown has deepened in the last few weeks,\u201d Jefferies said in a report on Tuesday.\n\nThe Venus Dove beauty bar which launched last year.\n\nThe company reported a 1.9 percent uptick in turnover to 60.8 billion euros in 2024, while underlying sales growth was 4.2 percent in the 12-month period.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnilever saw a 10.8 percent drop in net profit to 6.4 billion euros due to a loss on disposals and higher restructuring costs as a result of accelerating its productivity program.\n\nJefferies also speculated that investors will like seeing Fernandez taking charge of the company.\n\n\u201cThey like his direct approach, but some may also see his style as somewhat maverick. We think this is a unanimous decision by the board.\u201d\n\nMany had seen Hein as being a sponsored CEO choice by activist investor Nelson Peltz.\n\nAs reported Peltz muscled his way onto the Unilever board, and was instrumental in getting Jope fired following the CEO\u2019s failed attempts to buy GSK\u2019s consumer goods arm, which now trades as a publicly listed company.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is understood that Schumacher was a Peltz favorite for the job, but something happened, and now it will be a Unilever veteran running the show.\n\nJefferies said the CEO change will give the board free range to review strategy, and especially M&A strategy.\n\nIn its report, RBC Capital Markets said the bank was \u201ccompletely nonplussed by [Hein\u2019s] ejection from the CEO role,\u201d and added that his departure could be read as a \u201cvictory for those Unilever insiders who resented the appointment of an \u2018external CEO,\u2019 and evidence of the old \u2014 and often dysfunctional \u2014 Unilever culture reasserting itself.\u201d\n\nFernando Fernandez, the new CEO of Unilever.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile RBC Capital Markets believed it was good to have an \u201coutsider\u201d in the role, it said the employees may have been unhappy with Schumacher.\n\n\u201cCertainly we have been picking up suggestions that morale has been impacted where restructuring actions have been most assertive. But if that\u2019s the reason [for Hein\u2019s departure], it feels very extreme.\n\n\u201cFor now, the best we can come up with is that as an outsider with a commitment to changing Unilever, he might have ruffled too many feathers internally. Fernando Fernandez, the incoming CEO, has been at Unilever for 37 years and might be a more acceptable change agent,\u201d RBC said.\n\nPrior to becoming CFO in January 2024, Fernandez had a successful tenure as president of beauty and well-being, one of Unilever\u2019s fastest growing businesses.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn previous roles as president Latin America, CEO Brazil and CEO Philippines he led some of the company\u2019s best-performing markets, delivering strong financial results while developing exceptional talent, according to Unilever.\n\nOn Tuesday, Meakins said: \u201cThe board has been impressed with Fernando\u2019s decisive and results-oriented approach and his ability to drive change at speed. He has a strong track record of performance and portfolio management, a love of brands and a profound knowledge of Unilever\u2019s operations.\u201d\n\nFernandez said that Unilever will now concentrate \u201con building a future-fit portfolio with an attractive growth footprint and delivering unmatched functional and perceivable superiority across our top 30 power brands.\n\n\u201cI have full confidence in our team\u2019s ability to propel Unilever to a global industry-leading position and create substantial value for our shareholders. I would like to thank Hein for his values-led leadership and the performance focus he has brought to the business. I wish him every success for the future,\u201d he added.\n\nBest of WWD\n\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter. For the latest news, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.",

The Marmite-to-Dove soap group said Mr Schumacher will leave the role \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d on March 1.\n\nHe will be replaced by recently appointed chief financial officer Fernando Fernandez, who was president of beauty and wellbeing before taking on the top finance role in the firm in January 2024.\n\nUnilever, which makes well-known household brands such as Hellman\u2019s and Magnum, has kicked off a search for a new chief financial officer.\n\nShares in FTSE 100 listed Unilever fell 3 per cent in early trading on Tuesday after it announced the unexpected changeover at the top, though clawed back some of that ground to sit around two per cent down for the day by 9am GMT.\n\nUnilever is the London Stock Exchange\u2019s fourth-biggest company by market cap, behind only AstraZeneca, Shell and HSBC.\n\nChris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot said: \u201cLosing a chief executive after 18 months is never a good thing. For Unilever, especially during a strategy turnaround, it does not suggest things were going well behind the scenes or the business was firing on all cylinders. The last set of results suggested that turnaround had stalled somewhat, with weak guidance and sales growth only likely to improve as the company passes on higher commodity costs.\n\n\u201cEvidence of quick operational improvements are needed when you are embarking on a new strategy, and with new management. The change at the top of Unilever will not see a change in that strategy, which is positive, and guidance has been reiterated. However, the new CEO, current chief financial officer Fernando Fernandez, will have been pivotal in agreeing and implementing that strategy and ultimately is the best the company could do for now.\n\n\u201cUnilever has a long way to go on its road to recovery. The share price offers a bit of headroom to do that, but events such as this will not go down well with investors. Results will be watched even more closely now to ensure there are no signs of cracks within that turnaround strategy.\u201d\n\nMr Schumacher\u2019s sudden departure comes mid-way through a major turnaround plan, which involves 7,500 previously announced job cuts, as well as moves to trim down the number of brands in its food division and focus more attention on its biggest sellers.\n\nThe outgoing boss \u2013 who became chief executive officer in July 2023 \u2013 has also led efforts to offload its Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Wall\u2019s ice cream division, announcing plans earlier this month to spin it off with a stock market listing in Amsterdam, alongside additional listings in London and New York.\n\nBut Unilever has faced increasing pressure from shareholders \u2013 such as activist investor Nelson Peltz \u2013 over a flagging performance.\n\nShares fell after a poorly received set of annual results earlier this month.\n\nopen image in gallery\n\nUnilever chairman Ian Meakins said: \u201cI would like to thank Hein for resetting Unilever\u2019s strategy, for the focus and discipline he has brought to the company and for the solid financial progress delivered during 2024.\n\n\u201cHein introduced and led a significant productivity programme and the commencement of the ice cream separation, both of which are fully on track.\u201d\n\nMr Schumacher said it had been a \u201cprivilege\u201d to lead Unilever.\n\n\u201cWe have made real progress and I am proud of what we have achieved in a short period of time,\u201d he added.\n\nHe was appointed chief executive in 2023 to replace former boss Alan Jope, when he retired.\n\nMr Schumacher was previously chief executive of the global dairy and nutrition business, Royal FrieslandCampina, and became a non-executive director of Unilever in October 2022.\n\nWhile he steps down from the top job next month, he will leave the group on May 31.\n\nOn Mr Fernandez\u2019s appointment, Mr Meakins said: \u201cThe board has been impressed with Fernando\u2019s decisive and results-oriented approach and his ability to drive change at speed.\u201d",

The fall in market value aligns with bearish trends in global equities, as weak global cues and concerns over the ongoing tariff war weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nAmong the major losers, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) faced the largest drop, with its market capitalisation falling by Rs 53,185.89 crore. This reduction in TCS\u2019s value brought its total market cap down to Rs 13.7 lakh crore.\n\nBharti Airtel was another significant casualty, seeing a sharp decline of Rs 44,407.77 crore in its market value, bringing its valuation to Rs 9.3 lakh crore.\n\nOther Major Declines in India\u2019s Top 10 Firms\n\nOther leading companies also experienced market capitalisation losses during the week. ICICI Bank\u2019s market value shrank by Rs 18,235.45 crore, resulting in a valuation of Rs 8.7 lakh crore. Hindustan Unilever saw a reduction of Rs 17,962.62 crore, dropping its market cap to Rs 5.2 lakh crore.\n\nInfosys, another major player, lost Rs 17,086.61 crore, reducing its market valuation to Rs 7.5 lakh crore. Similarly, ITC saw a decline of Rs 11,949.42 crore, bringing its total market cap to Rs 5 lakh crore. HDFC Bank also experienced a minor loss of Rs 2,555.53 crore, which lowered its market cap to Rs 12.9 lakh crore.\n\nState Bank of India (SBI) recorded a smaller decline of Rs 401.61 crore, resulting in a market cap of Rs 6.4 lakh crore.\n\nAlso Read: India Surpasses US and China in AI Downloads, Claims FM Nirmala Sitharaman\n\n\n\nStock Market Outlook and Volatility\n\nThe weak performance of India\u2019s top companies reflects broader market volatility. The BSE benchmark index dropped by 628.15 points, or 0.82 percent, while the Nifty fell by 133.35 points, or 0.58 percent during the week. Experts predict continued market uncertainty in the near term, driven by global economic factors and market sentiment.\n\nInvestors are expected to keep a close watch on key upcoming economic data, including the US Core PCE Price Index and India\u2019s GDP figures, which could provide further guidance on market direction.\n\nTechnical Outlook for Indian Stock Markets\n\nAccording to Dhupesh Dhameja from SAMCO Securities, the Indian stock market has formed an indecision candle at the support zone, indicating uncertainty in the broader trend. He highlighted that the 22,800\u201322,700 range has emerged as a strong buffer against deeper declines, while the 23,000 level, previously a demand area, has turned into resistance due to aggressive call writing and short-term moving averages.\n\nInvestors are advised to stay cautious as the market remains volatile, with key economic events shaping the outlook for the week ahead.",

The BSE Sensex hit a low of 75,112, and ended the week with a loss of 0.8 per cent or 628 points at 75,311.The NSE Nifty gyrated in the range of 23,050 - 22,720 before settling at 22,796 - down 133 points or 0.6 per cent.Among individual Nifty 50 shares - Mahindra & Mahindra was the top loser for the second straight week - down another 9 per cent at Rs 2,669. Bharti Airtel, TCS (Tata Consultancy Services), Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Sun Pharmaceutical, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Maruti Suzuki were the other major losers.On the positive front, NTPC, Shriram Finance, Hindalco Industries, Eicher Motors, Tata Steel, Coal India and ONGC (Oil & Natural Gas Corporation) gained in the range of 4 - 8 per cent.Last week, despite net purchases on Tuesday, FIIs net sold stocks worth Rs 7,793.27 crore; thus taking the monthly tally to Rs 36,976.70 crore.In the holiday-shortened (markets will be closed for trading on Wednesday on account of Maha Shivratri) week ahead, cues from the global markets, developments on the Russia-Ukraine way and updated on new coronavirus detected in China alongside FIIs trading activity and the monthly futures & options expiry shall sway the market mood.Technically, the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are seen trading in an extremely oversold zone; with the Sensex logging gains in just 2 out of the last 14 trading sessions.Given this oversold condition, will the Sensex and Nifty be able to counter weak cues from global markets and stage a relief rally in this holiday-shortened week? Here's what the charts indicate and the key levels to track on these 2 benchmark indices.Last close: 75,311Support: 74,370 - 74,200Resistance: 75,685 - 75,900The BSE Sensex has now given a fresh sell signal on the quarterly Fibonacci chart, as the index broke the S-1 (support) at 75,140 levels. In the week ahead, the Sensex is likely to dip below 74,370 - 74,200 levels; thereby indicating a sell signal on the yearly scale; before attempting a pullback, if any.For a pullback rally to emerge this week, the BSE Sensex will need to trade consistently above 75,100 levels. On the upside, the index may face resistance at 75,685 and 75,900 levels; above which it may spurt back to 76,300 levels.Last close: 22,796Support: 22,600; 22,450Resistance: 22,900; 23,200The NSE Nifty has been moving within downward sloping trend lines after posting a high at 26,277 in late September. At present, the Nifty quotes close to its lower-end of the sloping trend, with support likely around 22,600 levels. The trend lines are seen converging, with the gap now reduced to 600-odd points; thus implying that a breakout on either side could trigger a sharp reaction. CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART Given the negative bias the Nifty seems on course to test 20-MMA (Monthly Moving Average) support at 22,450 levels; below which the Nifty can slide to 21,500 levels.However, in case, the Nifty does find support around the lower-end of the sloping trend line, and then attempts a pullback, the index can potentially rally to 23,400 levels. In case of a pullback, the Nifty may face interim resistance around 22,900 and 23,200 levels.",

Yet, when it\u2019s period blood, it\u2019s met with shame and embarrassment.\n\nResearch conducted by the brand among 1,000 UK teenage girls aged 15-18 found that over three-quarters have stopped playing sports due to their periods.\n\nSimilarly, over half of those who have experienced stains have felt embarrassed, anxious and ashamed, with more than a quarter saying they do not feel comfortable talking openly about periods.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nTo address this, Persil has launched a series of images featuring female athletes who have faced this challenge. In the outdoor campaign, period stains and leaks are reimagined as powerful statements, contrasting stained underwear and t-shirts to challenge the double standards surrounding blood stains in sports. The campaign questions why some stains are seen as marks of bravery, while others are viewed with shame.\n\nArsenal forward, Beth Mead said: \u201cWe\u2019ve all been in that situation, facing a leak or period stain and fearing how others might react to it. But it\u2019s not right to feel shame over something so normal. In football, we wear our stains with pride - they show our commitment and passion for the game.\n\n\u201cThat should be the same for all blood stains, regardless of where they come from \u2013 because they are part of the game. We\u2019re proud to be part of this campaign and to stand up for girls who feel afraid or ashamed about blood stains when playing sports. We all deserve to play with confidence and feel like we belong in the game we love.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of the two-year club sponsorship, a new program through Arsenal in the Community will support young girls and boys to break down barriers to sport participation. The program involves specially designed workshops that educate young girls and boys about periods, the barriers they pose to sporting participation, as well as safe spaces for the children to ask questions about the topic.\n\nTati Lindenberg, chief brand officer at Dirt Is Good, added: \u201cEvery stain tells a story of determination. Of giving everything to the game you love. We\u2019re proud to team up with Arsenal in challenging this double standard that's pushing young players away from sport. We believe that everyone should feel empowered to play on, and enjoy going outside, getting stuck in, and getting dirty. Together, we're backing every player to stay in the game - without fear, without shame, without holding back.\u201d",

They\u2019re then repelled by the accompanying ad campaign, which includes a bottle-shaped mascot named Mrs. Moist, imagery with copy reading \u201cSo Moist!\u201d and a particularly unimaginative jingle.\n\nAlong with the TV buy, Dove is pushing \u201cMoist Humor\u201d on social channels such as YouTube and Instagram. Time will tell whether Dove continues to experiment with comedy, but the brand has kept up its purpose-driven positioning elsewhere. A well-received ad at Super Bowl LIX earlier this month made with WPP agency Ogilvy illustrated how quickly young girls can lose their confidence once they enter their teens. Dove last year saw the departure of longtime marketing executive Alessandro Manfredi, an architect of its \u201cReal Beauty\u201d platform around women\u2019s empowerment that has been running for over two decades.\n\nOther companies have poked fun at queasiness around the word moist. In 2023, Kraft Heinz\u2019s line of mayonnaise \u2014 coincidentally, a competitor to Unilever-owned Hellmann\u2019s \u2014 petitioned Merriam-Webster to make \u201cmoist\u201d its Word of the Year. The stunt included the delivery of a jumbo-sized mayonnaise jar with a \u201cReal Moist\u201d logo to the publishing firm\u2019s headquarters, along with an SEO-hacking blitz to boost the presence of moist online.",

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nThe considerable ownership by public companies in Hindustan Unilever indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n\n62% of the company is held by a single shareholder (Unilever PLC)\n\n\n\nEvery investor in Hindustan Unilever Limited ( ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that public companies own the lion's share in the company with 62% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nFollowing a 3.5% decrease in the stock price last week, public companies suffered the most losses, but institutions who own 22% stock also took a hit.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Hindustan Unilever.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Hindustan Unilever?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Hindustan Unilever does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Hindustan Unilever's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Hindustan Unilever. The company's largest shareholder is Unilever PLC, with ownership of 62%. This essentially means that they have extensive influence, if not outright control, over the future of the corporation. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.6% and 3.7% of the stock.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Hindustan Unilever\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Hindustan Unilever Limited. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own \u20b9452m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nPublic companies currently own 62% of Hindustan Unilever stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Unilever wants to leave no stone unturned when it comes to implementing artificial intelligence throughout its ice cream supply chain, executive Sandeep Desai said during a panel at Manifest 2025 last week.\n\nThe CPG giant currently uses AI to analyze weather data to develop more accurate volume forecasts and limit waste, as ice cream demand is influenced by temperature, according to a January news release. It also leverages AI in its freezer cabinets for real-time inventory updates and in its factories for more efficient production.\n\n\"We're trying to integrate it end to end, so all the way from suppliers to the consumer,\" said Desai, EVP and chief product supply chain officer for the company's ice cream business.\n\nBut emerging technologies haven't solved every supply chain challenge for the ice cream supply chain. One area the company is still trying to improve its visibility is in the final mile of delivery, typically from a customer's distribution center to a freezer, according to Desai. He said the company could gain that additional tracking capability via connected sensors \"that can talk directly to the cloud,\" but a cost-effective deployment of that technology remains a hurdle.\n\n\"If we were transporting diamonds, it's cheap, the technology is available, it's there. We can do it,\" Desai said. \"When you're transporting ice cream, where every mom and pop believes they can make ice cream too, it's quite a margin-sensitive game, and so the cost of the technology is what needs to come [down].\"\n\nFleet management remains \"the trickiest aspect\" of integrating AI capabilities into supply chains, according to Desai. Implementing real-time monitoring across all trucks hauling Unilever's ice cream means collaborating with a fragmented mix of both large trucking carriers and owner-operators, he noted.\n\n\"If you look at ocean freight today versus what it was a few years ago, significant strides have been made,\u201d Desai said, adding that the company hasn\u2019t seen the same in trucking.\n\nEven with cost and integration challenges, Desai said experimenting with and piloting new technology is important. Costs will fall as those initial programs progress and scale, the supply chain executive said, using Unilever's work with machine learning and AI for demand planning as an example.\n\n\"We've got to have faith in that process. We can't give up on piloting. We can't give up on scaling. And I think the key is partnerships,\" Desai said. \"You really need to find the right partner that also sees a longer-term vision. It's not a short-term game. It's about the long term.\"\n\nOne long-term priority for Unilever's ice cream business is more automation within its network of warehouses. Highly automated \"dark\" warehouses using technology like drones for stock management will become increasingly important in cold chain logistics, particularly to offset recruiting challenges tied to work in low-temperature environments, Desai said.\n\nWithin Unilever's ice cream business, about 10% of its warehouses are currently dark, and the company is pushing to grow that percentage in the next several years, he added.\n\n\"My vision is all warehouses should be 100% dark,\" Desai said.\n\nUnilever's ice cream business is slated to be spun off from the rest of the CPG giant by the end of this year, a move that could introduce supply chain efficiencies. In 2024, the segment's underlying sales grew 3.7% due to \"strong innovations and operational improvements,\" according to an earnings release.",

Unilever aims to streamline its focus on higher-growth segments such as beauty and health.\n\nThe ice cream business, including brands such as Magnum, Cornetto, and Wall\u2019s, has seen revenue increase primarily through price hikes, while volume sales have declined. Its operational demands, requiring extensive cold chain logistics, contrast with Unilever\u2019s core consumer goods businesses, making a spin-off strategically beneficial.\n\nUnilever\u2019s divestment strategy has been evident in recent years. In 2023, the company sold its Elida Beauty division and other non-core brands, part of a broader plan to simplify operations and concentrate resources on 30 key brands. The firm also announced its largest layoff in five years, cutting 7,500 jobs globally.\n\nMarket interest in the ice cream division has been strong, with private equity firms such as Advent International, Blackstone, and CVC Capital previously exploring bids before Unilever opted for a public offering. If the IPO proceeds as expected, it will be the largest-ever for an ice cream business, positioning the newly independent company to attract fresh investment and drive innovation.",

While the whole body deodorant is still an emerging category, 63% of men aren\u2019t even aware that these products exist.\n\nThe brand wanted to change all of that by creating a relevant conversation around the topic with a cultural icon. So the Unilever brand teamed up with former football star Marshawn Lynch. It all began with a cryptic message in which Lynch tweeted: \u201c_EASTM_DE\u201d, followed by a film, in which Lynch discusses the challenges of body odor and how he overcomes it.\n\n\u201cMarshawn Lynch is known for his authenticity, humor, and ability to connect with fans in a meaningful way,\u201d said Lindsey Lapin, associate director marketing, Dove Men+Care. \u201cHis BEASTMODE brand has become a cultural force, blending sports and streetwear with his signature personality. By dropping the B.O., EASTM_DE highlights the importance of whole body freshness and how Dove Men+Care helps eliminate odor, in a way that feels natural to Marshawn\u2019s style. The campaign was built entirely around him, from rebranding his BEASTMODE stores in Las Vegas and Seattle to launching exclusive, limited-edition merch kits.\u201d\n\nThe merch kits include co-branded hoodies, shorts and socks, along with the Dove product. \u201cLynch brings his signature intensity to a topic others tiptoe around,\u201d said Megan Skelly, EVP, executive creative director, at Edelman, the agency that worked on the campaign. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t just about starting a conversation, it\u2019s about giving men the tools they need to change their BO game.\u201d\n\nThe brand dropped the campaign leading into the Super Bowl, to garner some of the halo effect of marketing around the big game.\n\n\u201cThe Super Bowl is one of the biggest moments of the year when men are fully tuned into football\u2014and to the athletes they admire beyond the game. Marshawn Lynch isn\u2019t just a legendary football player,\u201d added Lapin. \u201cHe\u2019s a cultural icon whose influence extends into streetwear and lifestyle. Partnering with him during the Super Bowl allows Dove Men+Care to reach guys in a moment where they\u2019re paying attention, making Dove Men+Care Whole Body Deo impossible to miss.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to continue the conversation about conquering full body odor with Lynch at the helm, throughout the year.",

            "content": "Unilever is back in the DTC-buying business as it nears a takeover of sustainable deodorant brand Wild. Its last attempt at integrating a disruptor business didn\u2019t end so well \u2013 will it work this time?\n\nUnilever \u201cneutered [our] vibe \u2026 we just didn\u2019t fit in a vanilla corporate entity\u201d. That was Dollar Shave Club CEO Larry E Bodner\u2019s scathing assessment of its short-lived stint as part of the FMCG giant\u2019s portfolio. Unilever dropped $1bn to acquire the direct-to-consumer (DTC) company in 2016 in the hopes of replicating the model across its suite of brands. Just seven years later, though, Unilever drew a line under what it dubbed an \u201cunsuccessful attempt to move away from our core\u201d and sold it for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBodner\u2019s take on the disastrous takeover was that \u201crebellious\u201d and \u201cjester\u201d brands simply can\u2019t thrive in that corporate environment. Dollar Shave Club\u2019s previously bolshy, boundary-pushing marketing was stifled; it couldn\u2019t innovate the product, he said, and it certainly couldn\u2019t compete on price post-acquisition. As a result, it lost its hard-won consumer base.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a lot of focus on the commercial dynamics and how you execute,\u201d he told The Drum. \u201cIn larger companies, brands sometimes get lost. If it\u2019s just a brand in personal care and there are 20 brands in personal care, you just get lost.\u201d\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps a surprise then that Unilever is reported to be on the brink of another mega DTC-deal that will add to its personal care portfolio. This time, it\u2019s set to spend \u00a3230m on deodorant brand Wild. According to Sky News, citing industry sources, terms of the transaction have been agreed upon, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before it\u2019s formally announced. Neither Unilever nor Wild have confirmed.\n\nBut if it goes ahead, it will be one of Unilever\u2019s biggest acquisitions since the ill-fated Dollar Shave Club fiasco.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Charlie Bowes-Lyon and Freddy Ward, Wild is best known for its refillable natural deodorants though it has moved into other products including lip balms, bodywashes and handwashes. Its business flourished during Covid-19, and by 2023, on the back of a 77% year-on-year sales increase to \u00a347m, it reached its first year of profitable growth.\n\n\u201cThe personal care category is characterized by consumer inertia, and sustainable alternatives have often been perceived to be less effective,\u201d explains Annabel Engels, managing director at branding agency Mother Design. \u201cWild\u2019s breakthrough came from reframing sustainability not as a trade-off, but as an upgrade; leveraging strong messaging on product efficacy, social proof through customer reviews, and a bold, differentiated brand identity that stood apart from the category\u2019s typical \u2018clean and neutral\u2019 aesthetic.\u201d\n\nMarketing has played no small part in that meteoric rise. \u201cWe always wanted to live up to the brand name of Wild, to do something a little bit out there and be quirky and loud,\u201d marketing director Harry Symes-Thompson said in an interview with The Drum last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt relied heavily on influencer marketing before turning to above-the-line. Its first major brand campaign tested its resolve to be \u201cquirky and loud\u201d with an ad that showed a female masturbation scene. Subsequently, the Advertising Standards Authority banned it for being inappropriate for kids. Today, it spends marketing dollars on TV and podcasts and is experimenting on TikTok Shop, with around 5% of Wild\u2019s revenue coming through live shopping.\n\nSeeing the impact brands such as Wild were having in the category, Unilever tried replicating the model within its existing portfolio. It launched the Dove refillable deodorant in 2021, but little has since been said about how the product has performed in a market where shoppers are increasingly skeptical of corporate greenwashing. This buyout is perhaps the biggest hint at how it has been received.\n\nWith the backing of Unilever, Wild is expected to quickly expand into new markets and product areas. Emma Ellis, president of branding agency Interbrand London, says: \u201cUnilever has the muscle to expand Wild\u2019s offer beyond deodorant and at scale \u2013 taking it into new territory and driving deeper penetration of its sustainable skincare credentials.\u201d\n\nOn paper, then, it\u2019s a win-win for both companies. But the reality can be very different, as the Dollar Shave Club buyout showed us. Experts say it\u2019s wrong to compare the two. For one, Wild has already evolved from a pure DTC player to a retail brand. Leveraging both online and offline channels has given it a solid platform for continued growth even under a new parent company. That\u2019s where Unilever struggled with Dollar Shave Club.\n\n\u201cWhat made Dollar Shave Club different was the model \u2013 less so the product. When it was then introduced into the highly commoditized and competitive men\u2019s shaving category in a brick-and-mortar retail environment, the cracks started to show,\u201d says Engels.\n\nWild is a different proposition. Rather than being a disruptor brand built on a disruptive model, Jon Goulding, CEO at advertising agency Atomic London, says it\u2019s a fast-growing challenger brand built on fundamental global trends and clever marketing that resonates with the many, not just the few.\n\n\u201cWith the right nurturing and scaling from Unilever, Wild has the potential to become a global powerhouse brand, making the 5x revenue multiple look like a billion dollar better bet than the last one.\u201d\n\nStill, Unilever will have to tread carefully as it takes over a company with a loyal consumer base that has bought into an anti-establishment brand position. It must navigate the rising expectations consumers have around brand authenticity and corporate sustainability or face the very real risk that some of Wild\u2019s core audience will disengage post-acquisition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEngels says: \u201cCan sustainable brands scale without losing their soul? The reality is, consumers have become increasingly wary of large corporations acquiring once-independent brands. To avoid this pitfall, Unilever must ensure that Wild retains its independent voice, maintains transparency in its sustainability commitments, and resists the urge to over-commercialize its messaging.\n\n\u201cFor Wild to thrive under Unilever, the focus shouldn\u2019t be on simply increasing market share, it should be on elevating the category as a whole. The real test will be whether Unilever allows Wild to remain the progressive challenger brand it set out to be, rather than absorbing it into its broader portfolio at the expense of what made it resonate in the first place.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it needs to nurture, not kill, the outlandish marketing strategy that has helped make Wild a success. As Ellis points out, corporations such as Unilever know all too well how critical boundary-pushing creativity is to brands. She points to how Bodyform has tackled taboos around period products with bold advertising, despite being owned by Essity.\n\n\u201cBig corporate doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t challenge taboos and be bold with your creative,\u201d she says.\n\nDollar Shave Club might not have been a commercial success but an expensive lesson on what not to do when it comes to nurturing fast-growing businesses without, as Bodner puts it, \u201cneutering the vibe.\u201d Wild, then, will be the \u00a3230m test of whether Unilever has learned from the experience.",

Currently chair of Vodafone and previously CEO of Heineken, Jean Francois brings vast knowledge of the consumer goods industry, as well as considerable experience as a non-executive.\u201d\n\nUnilever has been saying since March 2024 the ice cream business, which accounts for approximately 16% of Unilever\u2019s global sales, will be demerged into a separate company. Peter ter Kulve apparently will remain president of CEO of the group.\n\nIn 2024, ice cream delivered 3.7% underlying sales growth, totaling \u20ac8.3 billion [$8.6 billion as of 12/31/24] with a return to volume growth at 1.6% and 2.1% from price.

A quick review of 2024 highlights Unilever's best-in-class volume growth (2.9%), organic sales growth (4.2%), gross margin improvement (280bp), operating margin improvement (170bp), increase in brand marketing investments (up by 120bp to 15.5% of sales) and 15% EPS growth,\" the broker said.\n\n\"While this performance is unlikely to be replicated in 2025, we remain constructive on Unilever, which we expect will continue to deliver above-average growth (in volume, organic sales and EPS) versus industry peers such as Nestl\u00e9 and P&G.\"\n\nBerenberg has pencilled in 3.9% organic sales growth in 2025 along with 6% EPS growth, but highlighted that any signs of a turnaround in Unilever's struggling businesses in India, Latin America and Indonesia provide upside risk to these forecasts.\n\nThe shares were down 0.7% at 4,367p by 1302 GMT.\n\nStock Chart | ULVR",

            "content": "Statement from Hein Schumacher, CEO\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s results reflect a year of significant activity as we focused on transforming Unilever into a consistently higher performing business.\n\n\u201cUnder the Growth Action Plan, we committed to doing fewer things, better and with greater impact. We executed the plan at pace and made progress in 2024. Underlying sales grew 4.2% with volumes up 2.9%, led by our Power Brands, with particularly strong performances from Dove, Comfort, Vaseline and Liquid I.V. Fewer, bigger innovations helped to deliver volume growth consistently above 2% in each quarter. All Business Groups delivered positive volume growth for the year. Growth was underpinned by gross margin expansion of 280bps, fuelling increases in brand investment and profitability.\n\n\u201cWe continue to sharpen our portfolio, allocating capital to premium segments by acquiring scalable brands in attractive markets, such as K18 and Minimalist, and announcing the divestment of local food brands such as Unox and Conimex, as we focus our Foods portfolio on cooking aids and condiments categories.\n\n\u201cThe comprehensive productivity programme we announced in March is being implemented at pace and we are ahead of plan in helping to create a leaner and more accountable organisation. We are taking decisive actions in Indonesia, where long-standing challenges required a reset of the business, and China, where we are transforming our go-to-market approach during a market slowdown. We expect to see the benefits of these actions from the second half of 2025.\n\n\u201cThe separation of Ice Cream remains on track and we are making good progress on the key workstreams. We announce today the appointment of the Chair Designate for the demerged Ice Cream business and details of the listing structure.\n\n\u201cMarket growth, which slowed throughout 2024, is expected to remain soft in the first half of 2025. The steps we have taken in 2024, including the launch of our refreshed GAP2030 strategy, further reinvestment in our brands and strong innovation pipelines leave us better positioned to deliver on our ambitions in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nOutlook\n\nWe expect underlying sales growth (USG) for full year 2025 to be within our multi-year range of 3% to 5%. Market growth slowed throughout 2024. We anticipate a slower start to 2025 with subdued market growth in the near term. We expect the market and our growth to improve during the year as price increases, reflecting higher commodity costs in 2025. We expect a more balanced split between volume and price.\n\nWe anticipate a modest improvement in underlying operating margin for the full year versus 18.4% in 2024. We expect this improvement to be realised in the second half given the very strong first half comparator of 19.6%, which benefitted strongly from the combination of carry-over pricing and input cost deflation.\n\nFull year review: Unilever Group\n\nPerformance\n\nUnderlying sales growth for the full year was 4.2%, led by volume of 2.9% and price of 1.3%. We delivered four consecutive quarters of underlying volume growth above 2%, with all Business Groups driving positive volume growth for the year. As expected, underlying price growth moderated to 1.3%. Turnover was \u20ac60.8 billion, up 1.9% versus the prior year, with underlying sales growth of 4.2% more than offsetting the -0.7% impact from currency and -1.5% from disposals net of acquisitions.\n\nThe Power Brands contributed >75% of turnover and performed strongly with 5.3% underlying sales growth, driven by volume growth of 3.8%. The rest of the business also delivered improved volumes with volume growth of 0.7% in the second half, up from -1.6% in the first half of 2024.\n\nAs guided with our first half 2024 results, our turnover-weighted market share movement, which measures our competitive performance on a rolling 12 month-basis, sequentially improved in the second half reflecting the increasing benefits from the Growth Action Plan.\n\nBeauty & Wellbeing grew underlying sales by 6.5%, with volume growth of 5.1% driven by strong growth across its Power Brands. Personal Care grew 5.2% with 3.1% volume growth, led by strong, innovation-led sales growth of Deodorants. Home Care underlying sales increased 2.9%, with 4.0% volume growth more than offsetting the price decline linked to commodity cost deflation.\n\nFoods grew underlying sales 2.6%, with muted volume growth of 0.2% amidst a market slowdown and moderating prices. Ice Cream grew 3.7%, with a return to positive volume growth of 1.6%. This reflected an improved performance in the second half supported by bigger innovations and operational improvements.\n\nDeveloped markets (42% of Group turnover) grew underlying sales 4.4%. Underlying volume growth of 3.3% reflected a strong performance in North America, led by Beauty & Wellbeing, and a big improvement in Europe, driven by Home Care and Personal Care. As expected, price growth moderated to 1.1%.\n\nEmerging markets (58% of Group turnover) grew underlying sales 4.1%, with 2.5% from volume and 1.5% from price. India grew 1.8% with 2.4% underlying volume growth. Tonnage volume grew mid-single digit, which was partially offset by adverse mix due to the strong growth in Home Care. The business continued to increase market share during a period of modest market growth.\n\nUnderlying price returned to positive in the fourth quarter on the back of rising input cost inflation. Latin America grew 6.0% with positive volume growth across Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Growth slowed in the second half, reflecting a deterioration of economic conditions in the region. Africa and Turkey delivered double-digit growth with positive volumes and price in each quarter.\n\nChina declined mid-single digit with market weakness across all categories apart from Foods. In the context of softer markets, we are accelerating our portfolio premiumisation and transforming our go-to-market approach to effectively serve fast-growing e-commerce channels and smaller format stores in lower tier cities.\n\nIn South East Asia, volume-led growth in the Philippines and Thailand was offset by an 8.7% decline in Indonesia. In the second half, we took decisive actions by correcting misaligned pricing across channels and resetting stock levels in retail, while also addressing our long-standing issues of portfolio, brand, and competitiveness. This will take several quarters. As we have said previously, we expect to see the benefits of the changes in Indonesia and China from the second half of 2025.\n\nProfitability\n\nUnderlying operating profit was \u20ac11.2 billion, up 12.6% versus the prior year. Underlying operating margin increased 170bps to 18.4%. This step-up in profitability contributed to a 190bps increase in underlying ROIC to 18.1%.\n\nWe expanded gross margin by 280bps to 45.0%, the highest it has been in a decade. Continuing to improve gross margin remains a key focus for the business. Our gross margin improvement in 2024 reflects positive contributions from volume leverage, mix and net productivity gains in material, production and logistics costs. It was also helped by input cost deflation in the first half, which turned into slight inflation in the second half.\n\nImproved gross margin fuelled further increases in brand and marketing investment behind a strong and focused innovation programme. Investment was up 120bps to 15.5% of turnover, an increase of \u20ac0.9 billion. Overheads reduced by 10bps, as a result of tighter cost control and savings in the second half from the productivity programme.\n\nOperating profit of \u20ac9.4 billion decreased 3.7% versus the prior year. This reduction was driven by higher non-underlying charges, most notably a loss on disposals and higher restructuring costs as a result of accelerating the productivity programme.\n\nProductivity programme\n\nIn March 2024, we announced the launch of a major productivity programme to simplify the business and further evolve our category-focused model. The programme is targeted to deliver \u20ac800 million of savings, with a reduction of 7,500 mainly office-based roles, creating a leaner and more accountable organisation. Including this programme, we expect average restructuring costs to be around 1.2% of Group turnover over the three-year period from 2024 to 2026.\n\nFollowing thorough consultation processes, the programme is ahead of plan with a reduction of 4,300 FTEs by the end of 2024 and in-year savings close to \u20ac200 million. Restructuring costs, including the accelerated productivity programme, increased to \u20ac850 million, equivalent to 1.4% of Group turnover in 2024. We anticipate a similar restructuring cost of approximately 1.4% of Group turnover in 2025 with a lower spend in 2026.\n\nThe new organisation structure went live on 1 January 2025. This enables the Business Groups to focus on the top 24 markets, which represent approximately 85% of Group turnover, and the 30 Power Brands. The remaining smaller markets are now run on a 'One Unilever' basis to benefit from scale and simplicity, further enhancing our portfolio prioritisation and focus.\n\nIce Cream separation\n\nThe separation of Ice Cream is on track to complete by the end of 2025. We are making progress on the key workstreams, including the legal entities set up, implementing the standalone operating model and preparing the carve-out financials.\n\nJean-Francois van Boxmeer has been appointed as Chair Designate for the separated Ice Cream business. Jean-Francois brings a wealth of experience both as a non-executive and as an executive operating within the consumer goods industry. Jean-Francois is currently Chair of Vodafone Group Plc and non-executive director of Heineken Holding N.V. having been Chief Executive of Heineken for 15 years.\n\nIce Cream will be separated by way of demerger, through listing of the business in Amsterdam, London and New York, the same three exchanges on which Unilever PLC shares are currently traded. The Ice Cream business will be incorporated in the Netherlands and will continue to be headquartered in Amsterdam. This decision follows a full review by the Board of separation options, focused on maximising returns for shareholders, setting the Ice Cream business up for success and execution certainty by the end of 2025.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nWe continued to reshape our portfolio, allocating capital to premium segments through bolt-on acquisitions and divesting lower-growth businesses. In February 2024, we acquired K18, a premium biotech hair care brand. We completed several disposals during the year. These included Elida Beauty, our stake in Qinyuan Group (known as \u201cTruliva\u201d), a water purification business in China, and Pureit, a water purification business in Asia and Mexico.\n\nIn October, we completed the sale of our Russian subsidiary to Arnest Group. The sale included all of Unilever\u2019s business in Russia and its four factories, as well as our business in Belarus. In addition, we announced several disposals that we expect to complete during 2025, including the sale of the Foods brands Unox, Conimex and Zwan, as well as the disposal of our laundry business in Central America.\n\nIn January 2025, Hindustan Unilever Limited announced it has signed an agreement to acquire the premium actives-led beauty brand Minimalist, as we continue to evolve our Beauty & Wellbeing portfolio towards higher growth and demand spaces in India.\n\nIn 2024, we returned \u20ac5.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The quarterly interim dividend for the fourth quarter is raised to \u20ac0.4528, up 6.1% vs Q4 2023.\n\nFollowing the completion of a \u20ac1.5 billion share buyback programme in November, we announce a new share buyback of up to \u20ac1.5 billion starting today and to be completed in the first half, well ahead of the separation of Ice Cream.\n\nBusiness Groups\n\nBeauty & Wellbeing (22% of Group turnover)\n\nIn Beauty & Wellbeing, we focus on three key priorities: premiumising our core Hair and Skin Care portfolio by emphasising brand superiority; fuelling the growth of our Prestige Beauty and Wellbeing portfolios with selective international expansion; and, continuing to strengthen our competitiveness through innovation and a social-first approach to consumer engagement.\n\nBeauty & Wellbeing delivered a strong full year performance, with underlying sales up 6.5%, driven by volume at 5.1% and price at 1.3%. Volume growth was broad-based with strong performances from its Power Brands including Sunsilk, Dove, Vaseline, Pond\u2019s, Liquid I.V. and Nutrafol. In Q4, Beauty & Wellbeing grew 5.2% with 3.9% volume.\n\nThe full year performance reflects the ongoing premiumisation of our core Hair Care and Skin Care portfolio and the continued strength of our Prestige Beauty and Wellbeing portfolio, which combined accounted for c. 30% of Beauty & Wellbeing\u2019s turnover.\n\nHair Care grew mid-single digit with balanced volume and price growth. Our largest hair care brand, Sunsilk, grew high-single digit reflecting the continued success of its 2023 relaunch and introduction of new formats. Dove delivered high-single digit volume-led growth following the launch of Scalp + Hair Therapy, designed for improved scalp health and hair density. TRESemm\u00e9 grew mid-single digit following the launch of the Lamellar Shine collection. Clear grew low-single digit amidst low market growth in its primary market China.\n\nCore Skin Care grew mid-single digit led by low-single digit volume and positive price. Vaseline grew double-digit with the expansion of its premium Gluta-Hya range to new markets and new formats. Gluta-Hya is now in over 22 markets and has introduced a new serum based suncare range. Dove skin care delivered double-digit growth, with the launch of its body serums and 3-in-1 face care treatments in Brazil, Mexico, and most recently in the US. Pond\u2019s grew double-digit led by volume following its successful relaunch in 2023.\n\nWellbeing grew strong double-digit led by Liquid I.V., Nutrafol, and Olly. Liquid I.V. saw continued success of its sugar-free variant and ongoing international expansion, entering seven new markets during the year. Nutrafol extended into skin care with a daily supplement designed to address acne, while Olly saw strong growth in China led by its female health supplements. Prestige Beauty grew mid-single digit reflecting a slowdown in the US beauty market. Hourglass and Tatcha grew double-digit while other brands including Paula\u2019s Choice delivered low growth. During the year, we completed the acquisition of K18, a premium biotech hair care brand, which grew double-digit and will be included in underlying sales growth from February 2025.\n\nUnderlying operating margin improved 70bps with strong gross margin improvement partially reinvested in increased brand and marketing investment.\n\nPersonal Care (22% of Group turnover)\n\nIn Personal Care, we focus on winning with science-led brands that deliver unmissable superiority to our consumers across Deodorants, Skin Cleansing, and Oral Care. Our priorities include developing superior technology and multi-year innovation platforms, leveraging partnerships with our customers, and expanding into premium areas and digital channels.\n\nPersonal Care grew underlying sales 5.2% for the year with volume growth of 3.1%. This growth was led by continued strength in Deodorants. In the fourth quarter, Personal Care grew 5.3% with Deodorants, Skin Cleansing, and Oral Care all delivering volume growth.\n\nPersonal Care\u2019s full year performance was led by its Power Brands and science-backed innovations. These innovations were supported by a step-up in marketing investment, including our five-year sponsorship deal with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), and our sponsorship of several major football tournaments worldwide, including UEFA EURO 2024 and the CONMEBOL Copa America USA 2024.\n\nDove, which represents c. 40% of Personal Care\u2019s turnover, grew high-single digit with the successful launches of a new range of whole-body deodorants and a serum shower collection, using active face care ingredients in body wash formats.\n\nDeodorants grew double-digit led by mid-single digit volume growth. This included Rexona and Axe which grew high-single digit, driven by ongoing success from multi-year innovations, including our body heat-activated technology and our Fine Fragrance collection.\n\nSkin Cleansing grew low-single digit with positive volume and price. Good growth in Dove was partially offset by declines in Lifebuoy and Lux, driven by challenges in Indonesia, China, and India.\n\nOral Care grew mid-single digit led by price. Our Power Brands, Closeup and Pepsodent, grew mid-single digit with positive price and volume. Pepsodent launched its therapeutics range specifically formulated for sensitive teeth.\n\nUnderlying operating margin increased by 190bps, driven by a very strong gross margin improvement fuelling increased brand and marketing investment.\n\nHome Care (20% of Group turnover)\n\nIn Home Care, we focus on delivering for consumers who want superior products that are sustainable and great value. We drive growth through unmissable superiority in our biggest brands, in our key markets and across channels. We have a resilient business that spans price points and grows the market by premiumising and trading consumers up to additional benefits.\n\nHome Care grew underlying sales 2.9%, with 4.0% from volume and -1.1% from price. Home Care faced the highest commodity cost deflation across Unilever which impacted laundry powders in several emerging markets.\n\nIn Home Care, we stepped up multi-year, scalable innovations with several key launches as well as extending successful 2023 launches. These Power Brand focused innovations drove a return to strong growth in Europe and were supported by increased investments in brand and marketing and R&D to drive unmissable brand superiority.\n\nFabric Cleaning was flat with low-single digit volume growth fully offset by negative price. Volume growth was supported by the launch of Persil Wonder Wash, the first liquid detergent designed for short cycle washes. Wonder Wash, powered by our patented Pro-S technology, has been launched in eight markets and is on track to be in 20 markets by the end of 2025. Europe grew double-digit with strong volumes. Brazil experienced the most significant price declines among our key markets reflecting commodity deflation, notably in our powders portfolio.\n\nHome & Hygiene grew high-single digit with strong volume and positive price. Both Domestos and Cif grew double-digit led by volume, with contributions from the Power Foam, cream and sprays portfolio.\n\nFabric Enhancers grew high-single digit driven by strong volumes, slightly offset by negative price. The successful launch of our new Botanicals and Elixir ranges, utilising our patented CrystalFresh technology drove a good Comfort performance.\n\nUnderlying operating margin increased by 220bps, driven by strong gross margin improvement which was slightly offset by a step-up in brand and marketing investment.\n\nFoods (22% of Group turnover)\n\nIn Foods (formerly known as Nutrition), our strategy is to deliver consistent, competitive growth by offering unmissably superior products through our biggest brands. We do this by reaching more consumers and focusing on top dishes and high consumption seasons to satisfy consumer\u2019s preferences on taste, health and sustainability; while delivering productivity and resilience in our supply chain.\n\nFoods grew underlying sales 2.6% for the year, with 2.4% from price and 0.2% from volume. Our two largest brands, Hellmann\u2019s and Knorr, which accounted for c. 60% of the Business Group, continued to grow ahead of the Foods average. In the fourth quarter, Foods grew 2.6% while market growth remained muted.\n\nIn Foods we are creating a more focused and simplified business concentrated on Cooking Aids, Condiments, Mini Meals, Unilever Food Solutions, and our India local Foods portfolio. These categories are where we will lead and where we can best concentrate our investment behind our global Power Brands, Knorr and Hellmann\u2019s.\n\nCooking Aids grew mid-single digit with positive price and volume. Knorr performed well with mid-single digit growth driven by its leadership in bouillon and seasonings and its expansion of premium ready-to-eat pots ranges. Knorr grew double-digit in Latin America through its focus on local dishes and next generation bouillon and seasoning ranges with enhanced flavours and micronutrients.\n\nCondiments grew low-single digit with balanced volume and price growth. Hellmann\u2019s grew low-single digit led by volume growth as it continued to expand its Flavoured Mayo range, now in 30 countries, and grow its premium format variants, including new squeeze bottles.\n\nUnilever Food Solutions grew high-single digit led by volume with positive price. This growth was supported by the rollout of our operator solutions including the latest edition of our Future Menu\u2019s Trend Report, now utilised in over 50 countries, and expansion of our digital selling programme, which improved product availability and reach. Growth also benefited from the launch of Hellmann\u2019s Professional Mayo in Europe and Brazil, tailored for professional kitchens. China grew high-single digit following a strong Chinese New Year in the first half of the year.\n\nIndia Foods was flat, as tea and functional drinks maintained market leadership in subdued markets.\n\nUnderlying operating margin increased significantly, up 270bps, driven by strong gross margin improvement which funded an increase in brand and marketing investment.\n\nIce Cream (14% of Group turnover)\n\nIn Ice Cream, we are focused on continuing to strengthen the business in preparation for Ice Cream\u2019s separation by the end of 2025. We are doing this by developing an exciting product pipeline, designing more efficient go-to-market strategies, optimising our supply chain, and building a dedicated sales team globally. The separation will create a world-leading business, operating in a highly attractive category with five of the top ten selling global ice cream brands.\n\nIce Cream grew underlying sales 3.7%, with 1.6% from volume and 2.1% from price, marking a return to positive volume growth. In the fourth quarter, Ice Cream grew by 4.3%, driven by 2.2% volume growth and 2.0% price growth.\n\nThe improving performance in 2024 was fuelled by strong innovations and operational improvements. These ongoing improvements included a more efficient go-to-market strategy, improved distribution, and optimised promotional activities. Share performance improved throughout the year and we sharpened our focus on net productivity, which supported gross margin expansion and reinvestment in our brands.\n\nIn-home Ice Cream (c. 60% of Ice Cream turnover) grew low-single digit led by volume growth. This was supported by several snacking innovations with smaller portions. Magnum launched premium, bite-sized Bon Bons, designed to meet evolving snacking habits. The range is performing well and is now in 12 markets with further rollout planned for next year. Joining the small indulgence format, Yasso introduced Poppables, a Greek yogurt-based snack, while Ben & Jerry\u2019s expanded its Peaces range with new flavours like Salted Caramel Brownie.\n\nOut-of-home Ice Cream (c. 40% of Ice Cream turnover) grew mid-single digit fully led by price. We launched several premium innovations this year including Magnum\u2019s Pleasure Express featuring flavour filled cores and Ben & Jerry\u2019s new oat base for its non-dairy ice creams. Cornetto celebrated its 60th anniversary with its first global relaunch featuring enhanced formulation and new packaging.\n\nUnderlying operating margin increased by 100bps, driven by improved gross margins which supported an increase in brand and marketing investment. This margin improvement was realised despite higher commodity costs in cocoa and dairy. We expect rising inflation in cocoa and dairy costs to put pressure on margins in 2025.\n\nRelated Links",

            "content": "Unilever reported mixed Q4 2024 results, with solid underlying EPS but weaker-than-expected revenue.\n\nConsumer goods manufacturing giant Unilever (UL 0.14%) reported mixed fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings on Thursday, Feb. 13. Its underlying earnings per share (EPS) of 2.98 British pounds narrowly exceeded analyst consensus expectations of 2.965 pounds thanks to solid operational efficiency. Q4 revenue hit 14.2 billion pounds, missing the anticipated 15 billion pounds due to foreign currency headwinds.\n\nThe quarter was a mixed bag, with clear progress in margins, yet challenges in revenue realization. In its report the company provided an update on the spin-off of its ice cream business, which includes brands like Ben and Jerry\u2019s and Magnum, saying it would be spun-off through a listing on three stock exchanges by the end of 2025.\n\nMetric Q4 2024 Analysts' Estimate Q4 2023 Change (YOY) EPS (underlying) 2.98 pounds 2.965 pounds 2.60 pounds 14.7% Revenue 14.2 billion pounds 15 billion pounds 14.2 billion pounds (0.1%) Operating Margin (Underlying) 18.4% N/A 16.7% 1.7 pps Free cash flow 6.9 billion pounds N/A 7.1 billion pounds (2.8%)\n\nUnilever's Business Overview\n\nUnilever is a global consumer goods company with a portfolio comprising foods, beauty products, and home care items. It operates through diversified segments namely Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care, Nutrition, and Ice Cream. Unilever's business thrives on a strong brand portfolio packed with high-profile names such as Knorr and Dove. The company focuses heavily on brand management and innovation which are critical to its market positioning and long-term success.\n\nIn recent quarters, Unilever concentrated efforts on enhancing operational efficiencies and driving growth through its Power Brands. The emphasis on fewer, larger innovations remains a strategic priority, targeting sustainable volume growth across the board. This focus is pivotal to Unilever's strategic goal of increasing market share and enhancing customer loyalty in a competitive marketplace.\n\nQuarterly Highlights and Achievements\n\nIn Q4 2024, Unilever's revenue miss was mainly due to adverse currency exchange effects and certain market challenges reflecting a 5.6% deviation from anticipated figures. Still, significant growth was seen across Unilever's core brands, where its Power Brands collectively posted a 5.3% increase in underlying sales. The Beauty & Wellbeing segment displayed robust growth, reaching a 6.5% increase, powered by brands like Sunsilk and Vaseline. This growth is attributed to efforts in premiumization and expanding international reach. The Personal Care segment also reflected a 5.2% uptick due to novel innovations in its deodorants line.\n\nUnilever managed a 2.9% rise in the Home Care sector, primarily through higher volumes despite pressure on prices from commodity deflation. Ice Cream showed a noteworthy 3.7% growth, buoyed by market strategies that aim to separate the segment as an independent business by the end of 2025. These changes coincide with a broad focus on brand innovation and a keen emphasis on sustainability initiatives across multiple segments.\n\nThe company continued strategic acquisitions in Q4. Acquiring premium brands bolstered segment completions, with K18 and Minimalist now in its portfolio. These acquisitions support Unilever's drive towards premium product offerings and set the stage for longer-term growth potential.\n\nDespite growing positively, Unilever faced regional challenges, particularly in Indonesia and China. There, sales saw notable drops, posing barriers that demand persistent adaptation in pricing and market strategies. These regional hurdles signaled the need to uphold competitive pricing to maintain market share.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nFor the fiscal year 2025, Unilever projects sales growth of 3% to 5%, aided by investments in brand strength and ongoing enhancements in operational efficiencies. Management emphasizes volume-led growth, seeking to capitalize on innovative product extensions to capture emerging market trends. The firm remains optimistic about overcoming headwinds, albeit with cautious consideration of global market revival conditions.\n\nUnilever's forward guidance reflects an intention to fortify operational resilience and market competitiveness. These strategies entail both the continuation of strategic acquisitions and a clear focus on sustainability initiatives to maintain relevance in the ever-evolving consumer landscape.",

Are you comfortable with the 2025 organic growth consensus? A: Hein Schumacher, CEO, explained that market growth slowed in Q4 and is expected to continue in Q1. Beauty and Wellbeing and Personal Care are seeing decent growth, while Home Care and Nutrition are softer. Ice Cream faces pressure due to commodity costs. The growth is expected to be back-weighted, with pricing adjustments taking time. The company remains competitive and aims to stay ahead of the market.\n\nQ: Can you comment on margin phasing and expectations for gross margin and operating profit margin in 2025? A: Schumacher stated that the goal was to achieve a gross margin above pre-COVID levels, which has been reached at 45%. The focus will be on net productivity and premiumizing the portfolio. Fernando Fernandez, CFO, added that material inflation is expected to be around EUR0.78 billion, with pricing adjustments anticipated from Q2 onwards.\n\nQ: How do you plan to maintain volume growth despite potential pricing impacts on elasticity? A: Schumacher emphasized the focus on fewer, bigger, and better innovations, with 12 big bets identified for 2025. The company aims to maintain a healthy balance between volume and price, with continued investment in innovation and market share improvements, particularly in Europe.\n\nQ: What is the outlook for the Ice Cream business and its separation? A: Schumacher confirmed that Ice Cream will be separated by the end of 2025, with listings in Amsterdam, London, and New York. The primary listing will be in Amsterdam. The separation is expected to have a technical effect on margins, but the guidance for 2025 includes Ice Cream as part of the group.\n\nQ: Can you provide more details on cost inflation and its impact on different divisions? A: Fernandez explained that inflation is concentrated in palm oil, surfactants, and cocoa, affecting Beauty and Personal Care, Home Care, and Ice Cream. The impact is more significant in Ice Cream due to cocoa costs. The company is committed to protecting the P&L shape and investing behind brands to offset inflation.\n\nQ: How is the US Personal Care segment performing, particularly deodorants? A: Schumacher noted positive developments in deodorants and skin cleansing, with innovations like whole body deodorants and premium Dove products. The company is seeing improved momentum in the US Personal Care business and expects it to continue.\n\nQ: What are the competitive metrics for Unilever in 2024, and how is the China business performing? A: Schumacher stated that Unilever's market shares improved in the second half of 2024, with a neutral market share situation in the last quarter. The company is gaining share in Well-being, Prestige, and out-of-home Ice Cream. In China, the focus is on resetting the business and adapting to consumer shifts, with positive effects expected in the second half of 2025.\n\nQ: How is the North American market performing, and what is the impact of the Sky program? A: Schumacher highlighted strong performance in North America, driven by Well-being and Personal Care. The Sky program, which uses AI for planning and forecasting, is being rolled out globally and is contributing to improved service and forecasting accuracy.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Updated 5:57 p.m. GMT Feb. 13\n\nLONDON \u2014 Unilever is expecting a \u201csoft\u201d start to the new year after reporting a 1.9 percent uptick in turnover to 60.8 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThe consumer giant, parent of brands including Dove, Vaseline and Paula\u2019s Choice, reported underlying sales growth of 4.2 percent in the 12-month period, and a 10.8 percent drop in net profit to 6.4 billion euros.\n\nThe company said the decline in profit for the year was due to a loss on disposals and higher restructuring costs as a result of accelerating its productivity program.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nUnilever has been looking to slim down, sharpen its focus and streamline its operating structure. Hein Schumacher, chief executive officer, said the new strategy was beginning to bear fruit.\n\n\u201cWe committed to doing fewer things, better and with greater impact. We executed the plan at pace and made progress in 2024,\u201d Schumacher said.\n\n\u201cFewer, bigger innovations helped to deliver volume growth consistently above 2 percent in each quarter. All business groups delivered positive volume growth for the year,\u201d he added.\n\nUnilever \u2019s international headquarters overlooking the Thames in London\n\nSchumacher said Unilver\u2019s \u201cpower brands,\u201d which account for more than 75 percent of turnover, led the growth, with particularly strong performances from Dove, Comfort, Vaseline and Liquid I.V.\n\nHe added that the separation of Unilever\u2019s ice cream division, announced last year, was on track. On Thursday, Unilever named Jean-Francois van Boxmeer as chair designate for the demerged ice cream business.\n\nVan Boxmeer is currently chair of Vodafone Group and non-executive director of Heineken Holding, having served as CEO of Heineken for 15 years.\n\nIce cream will be separated by way of a demerger, and the business will be listed in Amsterdam, London and New York, the same three exchanges on which Unilever shares are currently traded. The demerger is set to take place by the end of the year.\n\nLooking ahead, Schumacher said that market growth, which slowed throughout 2024, is expected to remain soft in the first half of 2025.\n\nUnilever acquired K18 last year, and it has since been outperforming.\n\n\u201cThe steps we have taken in 2024, further reinvestment in our brands and strong innovation pipelines leave us better positioned to deliver on our ambitions in the years ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nUnderlying sales growth for 2025 is set to land within Unilever\u2019s multiyear range of 3 to 5 percent.\n\nThe company said it expects the market \u2014 and its own growth \u2014 to improve during the year as prices increase, reflecting higher commodity costs in 2025. The company said it\u2019s expecting a more balanced split between volume and price.\n\nIn 2024, Unilever\u2019s Beauty and Wellbeing division outperformed the company as a whole, with underlying sales up 6.5 percent in the 12 months, driven mainly by volume growth.\n\nUnilever said growth in beauty and well-being reflected the \u201congoing premiumization\u201d of its core hair care and skin care portfolio and the continued strength of its prestige beauty and well-being portfolio, which together accounted for around 30 percent of turnover in the Beauty and Wellbeing division.\n\nThe company said it saw \u201cstrong performances\u201d from power brands including Sunsilk, Dove, Vaseline, Ponds, Liquid I.V. and Nutrafol.\n\nDove accounted for the bulk of sales in the personal care division.\n\nDove, which represents around 40 percent of turnover in the personal care division, grew in the high-single digits with the successful launch of a new range of whole-body deodorants and a serum shower collection, using active face care ingredients in body wash formats.\n\nPrestige beauty grew by a midsingle digit reflecting a slowdown in the U.S. beauty market. Hourglass and Tatcha grew in the double digits, while other brands, including Paula\u2019s Choice, delivered low-single-digit growth.\n\nUnilever said that one of its newest brands, K18, a premium biotech hair care brand, grew in the double digits and will be included in underlying sales growth from this month.\n\nWellbeing sales saw strong double-digit growth led by Liquid I.V., Nutrafol and Olly. Unilever said Liquid I.V. saw the continued success of its sugar-free variant and ongoing international expansion, entering seven new markets during 2024.\n\nNutrafol extended into skin care with a daily supplement designed to address acne, while Olly saw strong growth in China led by its female health supplements.\n\nTatcha was one of the top-performing Unilever brands in 2024, delivering double-digit growth. Courtesy of Tatcha\n\nAnalysts described the results as \u201csolid,\u201d although the markets weren\u2019t as upbeat. The shares closed down 5.6 percent at 44.86 pounds due to the cautious outlook for the first half of 2025.\n\nDanny Yeo Sze Wai, an analyst at CFRA Research, maintained his \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation on the shares.\n\n\u201cWe see evidence of strategic transformation, supported by Unilever\u2019s focused investments in its power brands. We also see encouraging growth across all business units, reflecting strong internal controls over its winning portfolios,\u201d he said.\n\nYeo warned, however, that Unilever\u2019s comments on a softer first half \u201cwill likely unsettle sentiment,\u201d despite a clear underlying sales growth target of 3 to 5 percent for full-year 2025.\n\nCallum Elliott of Bernstein and James Edwardes Jones at RBC Capital Markets both described the results as \u201csolid,\u201d and in line with consensus estimates.",

Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer, the current chair of Vodafone Group Plc and non-executive director of Heineken Holding N.V. has been revealed as the chair designate for the separated ice cream business.\n\nUnilever, which is headquartered in London, also owns a vast range of other brands including, Dove, Sunsilk, Knorr, Hourglass, Vaseline, Living Proof and more.\n\nThe decision to choose Amsterdam as the primary listing for the ice cream business comes as a new blow to London\u2019s struggling stock market, especially given UK chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 ongoing efforts to bring more listings to the capital.\n\nJonathan Reynolds, the UK business secretary said as reported by the Financial Times: \u201cI would have liked Unilever to have listed in the UK.

The Wall\u2019s ice cream factory, based in Gloucester, will also operate as normal.\n\nUnilever said in the full year 2024 earnings press release on the company\u2019s website: \u201cThe separation of Ice Cream is on track to complete by the end of 2025. We are making progress on the key workstreams, including the legal entities set up, implementing the standalone operating model and preparing the carve-out financials.\n\n\u201cThis decision follows a full review by the Board of separation options, focused on maximising returns for shareholders, setting the Ice Cream business up for success and execution certainty by the end of 2025.\u201d\n\nUnilever sees higher turnover and sales growth in 2024\n\nUnilever released its full year 2024 results on Thursday, revealing an underlying sales increase of 4.2%. This was mainly due to a 2.9% rise in volume. Turnover inched up 1.9% last year, hitting \u20ac60.8 billion.\n\nUnderlying operating margin soared 170 basis points in 2024 to 18.4%, with gross margin also advancing 280 basis points.\n\nSchumacher said in the full year 2024 earnings statement: \u201cWe continue to sharpen our portfolio, allocating capital to premium segments by acquiring scalable brands in attractive markets, such as K18 and Minimalist, and announcing the divestment of local food brands such as Unox and Conimex, as we focus our foods portfolio on cooking aids and condiments categories.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe comprehensive productivity programme we announced in March is being implemented at pace and we are ahead of plan in helping to create a leaner and more accountable organisation. We are taking decisive actions in Indonesia, where long-standing challenges required a reset of the business, and China, where we are transforming our go-to-market approach during a market slowdown. We expect to see the benefits of these actions from the second half of 2025.\u201d\n\nSchumacher also highlighted that market growth is likely to stay weaker in the first half of this year, following a slowdown last year.",

The company also provided an update on the spin-off of its ice cream business, which houses brands including Ben and Jerry's and Magnum, saying it would be demerged through a triple listing. The maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise posted a 4% rise in fourth-quarter underlying sales, slightly missing the 4.1% rise forecast in a company-compiled estimate. Full-year underlying sales grew 4.2% versus a company-compiled analyst consensus of 4.3%. That was led by 2.9% volume growth. Underlying operating margins came in at 18.4% versus 18.3% estimated. Both figures were in line with the company's full-year forecasts. Shares of Unilever fell 7% early in the trading session before closing 5.6% lower. CEO Hein Schumacher told CNBC Thursday that the growth was led by the company's 30 so-called power brands \u2014 which include Dove, Comfort, Vaseline and Liquid I.V. \u2014 and were named as a key focus of the company's growth action plan announced in November. \"The 30 power brands were actually growing ahead of the company average again in quarter four, 5.3%,\" Schumacher told Julianna Tatelbaum.\n\nwatch now\n\nSharing its 2025 outlook, the British firm said it expected full-year sales growth in line with its multi-year range of 3% to 5%. It also said it anticipated a \"modest improvement\" in underlying operating margin, which would be realized in the second half of the year. \"We're seeing markets slow. We see that continuing in quarter one. Despite markets ... we aim to grow ahead of the competition. I feel that was what was done in 2024 and we want to do that again in quarter one, but we see more challenging circumstances overall,\" Schumacher said. Consumer goods companies have been under pressure over recent quarters as rising input costs have pushed prices higher and led consumers to switch to lower cost, private label alternatives. Speaking to CNBC Wednesday, however, Jon Cox, head of European consumer equities at Kepler Cheuvreux, said it now looked as though the outlook for the sector may be looking up. \"Maybe the corner has turned after what has been a pretty dramatic couple of years in the consumer space,\" Cox told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" on Wednesday. \"Going into this year, we should see a more normalized pricing environment but in addition, a lot of these guys are now investing more in new product development, bigger bolder innovations and at the same time marketing more extensively than they have.\" Cox added that these developments could reverse some of the share losses against private label goods and further accelerate volume growth.\n\nGet the CNBC Daily Open report in your inbox every morning and keep up to date with the markets wherever you are.

We see that continuing in quarter one. Despite markets ... we aim to grow ahead of the competition. I feel that was what was done in 2024 and we want to do that again in quarter one, but we see more challenging circumstances overall,\" Schumacher said.\n\nConsumer goods companies have been under pressure over recent quarters as rising input costs have pushed prices higher and led consumers to switch to lower cost, private label alternatives.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC Wednesday, however, Jon Cox, head of European consumer equities at Kepler Cheuvreux, said it now looked as though the outlook for the sector may be looking up.\n\n\"Maybe the corner has turned after what has been a pretty dramatic couple of years in the consumer space,\" Cox told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"Going into this year, we should see a more normalized pricing environment but in addition, a lot of these guys are now investing more in new product development, bigger bolder innovations and at the same time marketing more extensively than they have.\"\n\nCox added that these developments could reverse some of the share losses against private label goods and further accelerate volume growth.\n\nNestle, the world's largest packaged food company, on Thursday posted full-year sales growth which was in-line with expectations while nevertheless down on the previous year. The Swiss company also pointed to an uptick in 2025 sales, barring any significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nUnilever's Schumacher acknowledged a \"bifurcation\" of the consumer market, but said the firm was hopeful of regaining further share of pocket, particularly within its premium products line.\n\n\"Consumers, yes, they buy value but they also tend to buy more premiumized products,\" he said\n\nBen & Jerry's spin-off\n\nUnilever, which is home to about 400 brands, is looking to sell several food lines with combined sales of around 1 billion euros ($1.04 billion), Schumacher told Dutch financial daily FD in December.\n\nSchumacher did not name the specific brands, but it follows an announcement in March that Unilever in was spinning off its ice cream unit.\n\nIn an update Thursday, the company said the unit would be separated via a demerger, with listings in Amsterdam, London and New York \u2014 the same three exchanges on which Unilever shares are currently traded \u2014 and that it was on track to complete by the end of 2025.\n\n\"The de-merger is on track,\" Schumacher said, adding that Amsterdam would be the business' primary listing.\n\nAsked whether Unilever was still considering a possible sale of its ice cream unit, Schumacher said the company was \"absolutely focused on getting the demerger done in a successful manner. That's what all our actions are about.\"",

            "content": "By Yadarisa Shabong and Richa Naidu\n\n(Reuters) -Ben & Jerry's maker Unilever has chosen Amsterdam over London and New York as the primary listing for its ice cream business, it said on Thursday after announcing full-year earnings which underwhelmed investors.\n\nUnilever, whose other brands include Hellman's mayonnaise and Dove soap, also said that it expected a slower start to 2025 due to subdued market growth in the near term. The warning led to a near 7% drop in its shares, wiping around 8.5 billion pounds off its market value.\n\nTineke Frikkee, a portfolio manager at Waverton Investment Management, a Unilever investor, said Thursday's decline in shares was down to a lack of positive momentum for the first half of 2025 and a risk quarterly forecasts will not be met.\n\nUnilever reported fourth-quarter underlying sales growth of 4% on Thursday, compared with a 4.1% forecast by analysts in a company-compiled poll. It also forecast 2025 underlying sales growth to be within its multi-year range of 3% to 5%.\n\nChief Executive Hein Schumacher had laid out cost cuts at the company last year, including separating the ice cream division through a demerger and cutting thousands of jobs to address years of underperformance.\n\nThe ice cream business, which includes five of the world's top 10 brands including Magnum and Wall's, will have secondary listings in London and New York. It generated turnover of 8.3 billion euros ($8.6 billion) in 2024.\n\nThe decision to list in Amsterdam will likely be a blow to British finance minister Rachel Reeves, who met executives from Unilever last September. The official register of meetings described it as a discussion on investment in the United Kingdom and capital markets and reforms.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Dirk Beljaarts, the minister of economic affairs, said the decision by Unilever confirmed the company's \"confidence in the Netherlands and underscores the competitiveness and attractiveness of our business climate\".\n\nIt would have been difficult for Reeves to woo Unilever given it had made commitments to the Dutch government back in 2020 that it would choose the Netherlands if it ever planned to spin off its food and refreshment business. Unilever had picked London as its main stock listing and tax venue when it simplified its dual legal structure.\n\nBEN & JERRY'S\n\nThe listing might be complicated by Unilever's increasingly contentious relationship with the independent board of Ben & Jerry's, which ratcheted up a censorship lawsuit against Unilever last month.\n\nIt accused its parent company of suppressing a social policy statement the U.S. ice cream maker wanted to release because it mentioned President Donald Trump.\n\nThe brand and Unilever have been publicly at odds since 2021 when Ben & Jerry's decided to stop selling Cherry Garcia, Chubby Hubby and other ice cream flavours in the Israeli-occupied West Bank because it said it was inconsistent with the company's values.\n\nSponsored Bank Accounts\n\nSchumacher said he did not believe the Ben & Jerry's litigation would stand in the way of the Amsterdam IPO.\n\nA demerger of the business had been the most likely option, Barclays analysts said, as such assets in consumer staples often perform well because they are pure plays.\n\nConsumer health firm Haleon, spun out from drugmaker GSK in 2022, has seen its market value grow by about 5 billion pounds to 35.4 billion pounds since its listing.\n\nJean-Francois van Boxmeer has been appointed chair designate for the separated ice cream business, Unilever said.\n\nMORE WORK TO DO\n\nBritain's business minister Jonathan Reynolds told reporters that the government had more work to do to attract stock market listings in addition to reforms last year and other measures taken by the London Stock Exchange.\n\nIt is still hoping to attract online fast-fashion retailer Shein, which Reuters has reported is expected to list in London for $50 billion.\n\nUK officials implemented listing reforms last year aimed at helping London compete with New York and the European Union following Brexit, but the changes have yet to yield a noticeable turnaround in initial public offerings amid a long spell of outflows from UK funds.\n\nEquipment rental firm Ashtead Group, for instance, announced plans in December to shift its listing to New York, where many companies believe they can get a higher valuation.\n\n($1 = 0.9584 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Yadarisa Shabong in Bengaluru and Richa Naidu in London; Additional reporting by Toby Sterling in Amsterdam, and Paul Sandle and Kate Holton in London; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips, Bernadette Baum and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

For the fourth quarter USG increased 4% while turnover dipped 0.1% to \u20ac14.2 billion.\n\n\n\nThe news comes as it has also emerged that the company is close to announcing the purchase of plastics-free premium cosmetics brand Wild.\n\nThe six-year-old brand could be acquired from its founders and early-stage investors in a \u00a3230 million deal, which would be one of the firm\u2019s most significant acquisitions for a while.\n\n\n\nWild sells refillable personal care products on a DTC basis with its most recent account (for 2023) showing sales up 77% at almost \u00a347 million.\n\n\n\nBack with Unilever\u2019s results, the underlying and reported figures differ as the company continues to reshape its business, most particularly it\u2019s demerging its giant Ice Cream operations with a separate stock exchange listing for them.\n\n\n\nLooking specifically at the two divisions relevant to us \u2014 Beauty & Wellbeing and Personal Care \u2014 the former saw USG up 6.5% with reported turnover up 5.5% at \u20ac13.2 billion. The latter increased USG by 5.2%, but fell 1.5% on a reported basis to \u20ac13.6 billion. The two divisions account for 22% of group turnover each.\n\n\n\nBeauty & Wellbeing delivered a strong full-year performance, with the underlying sales rise divided into a volume increase of 5.1% and price rises accounting for 1.3%. Volume growth was broad-based with strong performances from its Power Brands including Sunsilk, , Vaseline, Ponds, Liquid I.V. and Nutrafol.\n\n\n\nIn Q4, Beauty & Wellbeing grew 5.2% with a 3.9% volume uplift.\n\n\n\nThe full-year performance reflects the ongoing premiumisation of its core Hair Care and Skin Care portfolio and the continued strength of its Prestige Beauty and Wellbeing portfolio, which combined, accounted for around 30% of Beauty & Wellbeing's turnover.\n\n\n\nThat said, Prestige Beauty grew in \u2018only\u2019 mid-single-digits reflecting a slowdown in the US beauty market. Hourglass and Tatcha grew in double-digits while other brands including Paula's Choice delivered low growth.\n\n\n\nDuring the year, it completed the acquisition of K18, a premium biotech hair care brand, which grew in double-digits and will be included in underlying sales growth from February 2025.\n\n\n\nUnderlying operating margin improved 70bps with strong gross margin improvement partially reinvested in increased brand and marketing investment.\n\n\n\nIn Personal Care, Dove, which makes up 40% of the division\u2019s turnover, grew in high-single-digits with the successful launches of a new range of whole-body deodorants and a serum shower collection, using active face care ingredients in body wash formats.\n\n\n\nSkin Cleansing grew in low-single-digits with volume and price rises. Good growth in Dove was partially offset by declines in Lifebuoy and Lux, driven by challenges in Indonesia, China, and India.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks in the UK. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) stands against other safest dividend stocks in the UK.\n\nIn recent years, investors have increasingly shifted away from UK equities, favoring global stocks, particularly high-growth sectors like US technology. The UK stock market is shrinking at its fastest pace in over a decade, largely due to a wave of takeovers involving London-listed companies. Bloomberg data showed that around 45 firms have been delisted from the London market in 2024 through mergers and acquisitions, reflecting a 10% rise from last year\u2019s total. This marks the highest level of delistings since 2010. At the same time, the value of deals involving UK companies has climbed 81% this year, surpassing $160 billion.\n\nOver the last ten years, the British index has delivered an annual total return of 6%, significantly lagging behind the 13% return of the broader US market. Analysts attribute this weaker performance to sluggish earnings growth, political uncertainty within the UK, and the lack of a dominant technology sector. However, a key factor has been the sharp drop in valuations as investors have increasingly moved away from UK stocks. According to Goldman Sachs, the issue is not a lack of foreign investor interest\u2014who currently account for roughly two-thirds of the UK market capitalization\u2014but rather the low engagement of domestic investors in UK equities.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nThat said, several factors seem to be contributing to a shift in investor sentiment. In November 2024, UK equity funds saw inflows after more than three years of continuous monthly withdrawals and a large sell-off leading up to the Budget. According to data from Calastone, retail investors invested a net \u00a3317 million into UK-focused stock funds that month. This marks a significant change, halting a streak of 41 months of net outflows, during which over \u00a325 billion had been pulled from these funds since May 2021.\n\nAnalysts also believe that the UK stock market may be on the verge of recovery, although the exact timing and pace of this shift are unclear. In this context, dividend stocks are crucial. Focusing on stocks with growing dividends can offer stability and consistency across different market conditions. These stocks also provide long-term growth potential, compounding returns as share prices recover. The UK market offers some of the highest dividend yields among major markets, with the \u201cFootsie\u201d yielding 3.46%, and the FTSE 250 offering slightly lower but still attractive yields. This setup enables investors to focus on high-growth areas, like smaller companies, while enjoying the benefit of increasing dividends. According to BlackRock, UK market dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term inflation. Companies with growing dividends typically have strong cash flows, allowing them to increase payouts over time.",

Here is Morningstar\u2019s take on what to look for in Unilever\u2019s earnings and stock.\n\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Unilever ULVR\n\nAnalyst: Diana Radu, CFA\n\nWhat to Watch for in Unilever\u2019s Q4 Earnings\n\nWhether Unilever will manage to maintain its volume growth improvement streak for a fifth consecutive quarter.\n\nThe level of pricing growth\u2014expected to be muted in the fourth quarter of 2024 and over the coming quarters.\n\nWe expect the 2025 guidance to be aligned with the midterm guidance communicated in the November 2024 investor day. This assumes mid-single-digit organic sales growth (with a volume growth contribution of at least 2%) and a modest margin improvement fueled by gross margin. The ongoing productivity program should support the gross margin improvement.\n\nWe\u2019ll be looking out for potential updates on the ice cream separation plans. During the investor day, the company hinted at a detailed separation update to be communicated in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nFair Value Estimate for Unilever stock\n\nWe have increased our fair value estimate for Unilever\u2019s London-traded shares to GBX 4,750 from GBX 4,380 after reflecting in our model the latest results and a time value of money adjustment. This implies a euro/pound rate of 0.83, 2024 multiples of 20 times earnings and 13 times enterprise value/EBITDA, a free cash flow yield of 3.5%, and a dividend yield of 3%. These valuation multiples are broadly in line with Unilever\u2019s own recent historical valuation range.\n\nOver the last few years, Unilever has been successful in leading pricing while at the same time minimizing volume impact, a function of good demand elasticities and strong brand positioning. We expect 2024 to be a normalization year with pricing contribution to organic growth closer to the long-term average and volume rebounding by around 3%. Although organic growth and its components of volume/mix and price have been in structural decline since 2013, we expect the trend to slightly reverse with our midcycle assumptions at 3.8% versus a long-term average of 3.4% before the pandemic boost (2013-20).\n\nMedium-term EBIT margin is another important valuation driver. Unilever\u2019s underlying EBIT margin peaked in fiscal 2019 at 19.1% as the company actively prioritized profitability over growth through declining investment levels in capital expenditure, R&D, and marketing. With signs of a changing attitude toward investment levels (especially capital expenditure and marketing) and a still significant impact from inflationary pressures, we don\u2019t expect Unilever to reach and surpass previous margin peaks, with our midcycle margin assumption at the 18.6% mark.\n\nEconomic Moat Rating for Unilever stock\n\nWe think Unilever has a wide economic moat derived from three sources: its entrenchment in the supply chain of retailers (an intangible asset), brand power in certain categories, and a cost advantage. The firm\u2019s broad portfolio of products across multiple categories and supermarket aisles creates a virtuous cycle of competitive advantages comprising intangible assets and cost advantages that new entrants cannot easily replicate. Unilever\u2019s portfolio spans multiple household and personal care product categories as well as food and to a lesser extent beverages, and the firm generates over EUR 60 billion in revenue. This makes Unilever one of the most important suppliers to retailers globally and differentiates it from narrow-moat competitors with smaller product portfolios.\n\nWe view the company\u2019s relationships with retailers as an essential part of its wide moat. Since one of the most significant challenges facing consumer goods manufacturers is limited shelf space and distribution capacity in the traditional grocery segment, owners of leading brands can gain and retain points of distribution relative to large peers and smaller competitors by deploying category captains to share local and category-level data with retailers. The category captain recommends the optimal product mix, promotional strategies, and product placement, and both parties share data and analysis. This is a critical competitive advantage for large manufacturers, not only over new entrants and small players, but also in intracategory competition among the leading three or four brands, as it helps the category leader retain prime real estate in the store.\n\nRisk and Uncertainty\n\nWe assign Unilever a Low Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. Its portfolio diversity ensures that no single brand can materially affect its excess returns.\n\nThe company\u2019s vast financial flexibility and balance sheet strength may lead to value-destructive acquisitions, such as expensive transactions executed in an already pricey market environment. We see this as the most significant risk to Unilever\u2019s value-creation model. Evidence to date has been promising, with Unilever making portfolio adjustments, divesting noncore, low-growth businesses (tea business Ekaterra in 2022, spreads business in 2017) and acquiring high-growth, high-quality brands that complement its current categories/exposures (Paula\u2019s Choice, Liquid I.V., Horlicks, Garancia, and The Vegetarian Butcher).\n\nHistorically, the consumption of packaged food has not been significantly affected by economic downturns. However, volume in discretionary and premium categories such as ice cream and homecare has sometimes experienced moderate declines during economic contractions, and consumers usually become more price-sensitive and channel-sensitive.\n\nBulls say about Unilever Stock\n\n\u2022 Unilever has always been focused on the need to reduce costs to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive environment.\n\n\u2022 With about 60% of reported sales derived from emerging markets, Unilever has one of the largest footprints in the developing world of all the global consumer staples manufacturers, which should be a long-term volume driver for the business.\n\n\u2022 Unilever possesses one of the highest numbers of category captaincies among global consumer staples companies, cementing its place in customer supply chains.\n\nBears say about Unilever Stock\n\n\u2022 Unilever operates in some of the most competitive categories in consumer staples, where new entrants are filling niche gaps in the market and have proved to be better innovators.\n\n\u2022 Middle-market grocers have lost share to e-commerce and hard discounters, which are disruptive forces in the industry because they lower the barriers to entry for niche upstarts.\n\n\u2022 The strategy of repositioning the portfolio could lead to value leakage, depending on transaction valuations.\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnilever is on the brink of acquiring Wild , a high-end producer of refillable personal care products, in a deal valued at approximately \u00a3230 million. Backed by the founders of Innocent Drinks, Wild has made a name for itself in the sustainability-driven beauty market, and Unilever\u2019s impending acquisition signals a strategic move to expand its eco-conscious portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry insiders reveal that Unilever has finalized terms with Wild\u2019s founders and early-stage investors, with a formal announcement expected within weeks. If confirmed, this would mark one of Unilever\u2019s most significant personal care acquisitions in recent years, reflecting CEO Hein Schumacher\u2019s ongoing efforts to revitalize the company\u2019s product lineup. The multinational conglomerate, known for powerhouse brands like Dove and Lynx (marketed as Axe in most regions), sees Wild as a premium, sustainability-focused brand that aligns with shifting consumer preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rise of Wild: A Start-Up Success Story\n\n\n\n\n\nFounded just six years ago by entrepreneurs Charlie Bowes-Lyon and Freddy Ward, Wild has swiftly carved out a niche in the personal care sector. The brand specializes in refillable natural deodorants, lip balms, body washes, and handwashes. Its direct-to-consumer model and commitment to reducing single-use plastic have earned it a devoted customer base.\n\n\n\n\n\nWild\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without hurdles. In 2023, Ward disclosed in an interview with The Grocer that their initial attempts at product development fell short of expectations. However, a strategic revamp\u2014coinciding with the e-commerce boom fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014propelled the brand\u2019s rapid growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We learned that we weren't very good at making deodorant, but there was demand for the product if we could get it right,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It just didn't really work, was the problem. \"The formulation wasn't very good.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its inception, Wild has secured roughly \u00a310 million in funding from high-profile investors, including Jamjar Ventures (the investment arm of Innocent Drinks\u2019 founders), Redbus Ventures, and Slingshot Ventures. In 2023 alone, the company reported nearly \u00a347 million in sales\u2014a staggering 77% year-on-year increase\u2014while also turning an operating profit of \u00a3560,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"2023 represented a watershed moment in Wild's short history as we delivered our first year of profitable growth across the business,\" the accounts - signed off last July - said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Unilever, the Wild acquisition represents more than just an expansion of its product lineup. It underscores a broader push toward sustainable and refillable packaging, an area that has gained immense traction among environmentally conscious consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Unilever itself is undergoing a period of transformation. The multinational is currently weighing the possibility of spinning off its massive ice cream division, which includes iconic brands like Ben & Jerry\u2019s. A potential demerger has sparked interest from stock exchanges in London, Amsterdam, and New York, with discussions actively underway.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of Monday, Unilever\u2019s shares were trading at approximately \u00a347.26, giving the consumer goods giant a market capitalization of nearly \u00a3116 billion.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Unilever is running refill pilot projects globally to reduce virgin plastic use and tackle plastic sachet waste. Since 2018, Unilever has conducted over 50 refill and reuse pilots, incorporating insights from markets like Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka to shape its strategies.\n\nThe long-term goal for Unilever is to have 100 per cent of plastic packaging be reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2030 for rigid plastics and by 2035 for flexible plastics. These pilots are crucial to achieving that transformation.\n\nRefill solutions in Indonesia\n\nIn Indonesia, Unilever began testing refill solutions in 2020 by piloting a refill machine in a packaging-free store in Jakarta. This machine sold home and personal care products like Dove and TRESemm\u00e9. Two additional machines were introduced in an apartment building and a general trade kiosk. However, it was a door-to-door refill model, using motorcycle drivers to sell from large jerrycans, that proved most popular, despite its high operational costs.\n\nPartnering with local businesses, Unilever expanded its efforts by introducing scalable manual refill stations in stores (warungs) and waste bank locations. To date, the programme serves around 6000 customers at 1000 refill stations, saving approximately 6 tonnes of plastic annually.\n\nTailored refill solutions for Sri Lanka\n\nUnilever\u2019s pilot in Sri Lanka started in 2019 with high-tech refill machines installed in modern trade outlets. However, to increase accessibility, especially for low-income consumers, the company redesigned the machines to allow for flexible quantities, based on individual customer needs. These machines were also relocated to more convenient spots, including railway stations and apartment buildings. Offering savings of up to 20 per cent compared to prepackaged products, the refill stations have gained traction among local consumers.\n\nInnovations in Bangladesh\n\nIn Bangladesh, Unilever initially tested advanced refill machines in 2021, but the machines proved difficult to service. In response, the company developed a more cost-effective, user-friendly solution with the help of Bopinc, a TRANSFORM-funded organisation. The new machines, designed for store counters, dispense multiple products such as Dove and Lifebuoy. Real-time sales data from the machines helps Unilever understand consumer preferences and price points, contributing to the refinement of product offers. Approximately 43 per cent of users have become repeat customers.\n\nScaling refill solutions\n\nUnilever\u2019s goal to eliminate single-use plastics relies on the development of refill solutions. Unilever stresses the importance of regulatory support and collaboration across industries. Through the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, it advocate for enabling policies and collaborate with organisations like the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to establish common reuse definitions and metrics.\n\n\"Supportive regulations will be essential for reuse solutions to grow at scale,\" Unilever said in a statement. These efforts showcase Unilever\u2019s commitment to sustainable packaging and reducing plastic waste.",

At the end of the spots, viewers will be encouraged to shop for the ingredients via Walmart.\n\nThe Roku integration will also include a simulated Katz\u2019s Deli with Hellmann\u2019s branding inside Roku\u2019s digital cityscape screensaver and a marquee ad on the Roku home screen that greets viewers as they start up the streaming platform.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs a multi-year Super Bowl advertiser, Hellmann\u2019s knows that the real value of a big game ad extends well beyond the Sunday night broadcast. There\u2019s the buzz before the game, when news outlets speculate on the commercials \u2014 Hellmann\u2019s released its spot nearly two weeks ahead of kick off \u2014 and then there\u2019s the time after, when the conversation is still about the action on and off the field.\n\nHellmann\u2019s Super Bowl commercial reunites Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan from \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and recreates the iconic deli scene from the rom-com in which Ryan depicts how women can fake their pleasure in bed. In the ad, Crystal asserts \u201cthis one is real\u201d because of the mayonnaise, with Sydney Sweeney delivering the scene-ending line, \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having\u201d (originally uttered by director Rob Reiner\u2019s mother).\n\nThe Roku activation is the first use of shoppable custom recipes on the platform, according to press details. Throughout the campaign, Roku and Walmart Connect, the retailer\u2019s media business, will measure user exposure using first-party data to assess purchase behavior for campaign evaluation. Such convergence of connected TV and retail media is expected to be a key area of marketer activity this year.\n\nWalmart and Roku have partnered on shoppable ads for years, looking to move beyond QR codes and take advantage of Roku\u2019s streaming capabilities. Such ads received at least three-times higher click-through rates than average video campaigns powered by the Walmart DSP during a pilot that ran from November 2022 to February 2023.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Sharpening the picture on connected TV marketing, from the editorial team at Marketing Dive.

            "content": "American consumers are rightfully skeptical about the future, wondering if President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could lead to a trade war. Trump said he would impose 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% on imported goods from China. He also signaled that potential tariffs on items imported from the European Union may be next. According to CNBC, Trump agreed to halt tariffs against Mexico for a month and delay those against Canada for at least 30 days. However, China has already responded with additional tariffs of up to 15% on goods imported from the United States.\n\nAnother report by Mordor Intelligence shows similar trends in the hair care products market. It has a size of $94.10 billion as of 2025 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.39% between 2025 and 2030. This translates to an anticipated market size of around $111.16 billion by 2030. Specialized concerns such as hair and scalp problems are driving this growth. In addition, consumers are inclined towards hair care products recommended by professionals, further driving the market.\n\nAnother prominent driver of market growth in the global hair care industry is the rising prevalence of hair concerns. These include hair fall, dandruff, heat damage from styling tools, and other conditions. Around 50 million men and 30 million women in the United States were affected by androgenetic alopecia in 2023 alone. Androgenetic alopecia is commonly known as male-pattern baldness in men and female-pattern hair loss in women. The rise of such concerns is ballooning the demand for specialized hair care products. The hair loss treatment segment is thus anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% between 2024 and 2029.\n\nThe steady growth in the global hair care industry can be attributed to various factors, including consumers\u2019 evolving preferences and increasing technological advancements. In addition, macro trends such as a growing focus on personal wellness, inclination towards top luxury and premium hair care brands, and growing disposable incomes are further supporting growth in the global hair care industry. The demand for eco-friendly and sustainable solutions is also growing, as consumers are inclined towards organic, natural, and vegan hair care solutions and products.\n\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global hair care industry is valued at $93.89 billion as of 2025. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% between 2025 and 2030 and reach $110.97 billion by 2030. The Asia-Pacific region is the largest market for the hair care industry worldwide. However, South America takes the top spot as the fastest growing.\n\nWe recently published a list of the 12 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Unilever PLC (NYSE: UL ) stands against other best hair care stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerican consumers expect these tariffs to directly impact their wallets. A recent consumer survey conducted by BOE on the potential effects of tariffs on consumers found that nearly 86% of Americans believed their wallets would be affected by the scenario. 12% are already stockpiling items, with a majority of others changing their shopping habits to accommodate the effects of these tariffs on their bank accounts.\n\nEconomists corroborate this view and say that many businesses will likely pass down the additional expenses to customers, indirectly or directly. This is why tariffs typically trigger increased prices for consumers. Higher tariffs on items traded between the US and China may result in inflated prices on appliances, apparel, electronics, and toys. Similarly, tariffs against Canada and Mexico may increase the already existing pressure on grocery prices.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grocery prices are up 28% over the last five years. These conditions are materializing when consumer spending is already stretched, with many households feeling financial strain. The US economy has noted steady progress overall in bringing inflation down. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index, a significant inflation measure, increased 2.9% in December 2024 compared to a year earlier, down from a June 2022 pandemic-era high of 9.1%. However, most cases show a slowing in price increases instead of a significant fall.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 25 hair care stocks. We then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n11 Dry Shampoo Alternatives for Every Hair Color and Type\n\nSubbotina Anna/Shutterstock.com\n\nUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\n\nUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company that operates through five segments: Personal Care, Nutrition, Beauty and Well-Being, Home Care, and Ice Cream. The Beauty and Well-Being segment sells hair care products, including conditioner, shampoo, styling products, and more. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) offers over 400 brands worldwide.\n\nUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL) saw underlying sales growth of 4.5% in fiscal Q3 2024, with volume growth rising to 3.6%. All of its business segments achieved positive volume growth in the quarter, with Beauty & Well-being up by 6.7% in sales growth, Personal Care by 4.4%, and Ice Cream by 9.8%, primarily due to operational improvements and strong demand. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) also reported a strong position in its cash segment. Its free cash flow for the period came in at \u20ac2.2 billion. The company ended the first half of fiscal 2024 with \u20ac4.97 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with \u20ac4.1 billion at the end of December 2023.\n\nThe company\u2019s productivity program is thus on track, and so is the separation of its Ice Cream business. The separation activity is expected to be completed by 2025 end and is anticipated to result in a more focused Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) with a concentrated portfolio. The company ranks tenth on our list of the 12 best hair care stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On February 5, Callum Elliott from Bernstein maintained a Buy rating on Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) with a price target of \u00a352.00.\n\nHotchkis & Wiley Funds highlighted Unilever PLC\u2019s (NYSE:UL) strong performance in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:\n\n\u201cUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is one of the world\u2019s leading suppliers of consumer goods in the food, home care, and personal care categories, maintaining #1 or #2 market share over 75% of its business. With a new CEO and the involvement of an activist investor (Trian), Unilever is focused on execution and consistency, expecting low to mid-single digit volume-driven top line growth over the medium term, profit growth ahead of sales growth due to operating leverage and mix, and consistent return of cash to shareholders. Additionally, the company has announced plans to separate the Ice Cream business (13% of 2023 sales), which is expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and increase organic sales growth to 4-6% annually. Over the last quarter, the stock price reached a five-year high, as the company has continued to execute the plans laid out above. Unilever has not yet released their official third-quarter results but has reiterated their confidence in achieving 3-5% organic sales growth for the full year, with the majority of this growth being driven by volume.\u201d\n\nOverall, UL ranks 10th on our list of best hair care stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of UL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Unilever is UK\u00a353.71 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\nWith UK\u00a346.98 share price, Unilever appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\n\nOur fair value estimate is 6.8% higher than\n\nHow far off is Unilever PLC ( ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (\u20ac, Millions) \u20ac7.54b \u20ac7.91b \u20ac7.67b \u20ac8.21b \u20ac8.94b \u20ac9.27b \u20ac9.57b \u20ac9.85b \u20ac10.1b \u20ac10.4b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x8 Analyst x7 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 3.72% Est @ 3.24% Est @ 2.90% Est @ 2.66% Est @ 2.50% Present Value (\u20ac, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% \u20ac7.0k \u20ac6.9k \u20ac6.2k \u20ac6.2k \u20ac6.3k \u20ac6.1k \u20ac5.8k \u20ac5.6k \u20ac5.3k \u20ac5.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = \u20ac60b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = \u20ac10b\u00d7 (1 + 2.1%) \u00f7 (7.4%\u2013 2.1%) = \u20ac202b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= \u20ac202b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.4%)10= \u20ac99b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is \u20ac160b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of UK\u00a347.0, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Unilever as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.081. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Unilever\n\nStrength Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Personal Products market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the British market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

But some of the most memorable ones are the ones that tug on our heartstrings.\n\nBudweiser\u2019s puppies and horses; that tear-jerker from The Farmer\u2019s Dog (at least for dog owners); or Toyota\u2019s 2021 spot starring Paralympic swimmer Jessica Long, for example.\n\nWhile the ads that ran during Super Bowl 2025 mostly went for laughs, there were a few designed to get some deeper feelings stirring in the hearts of viewers.\n\nHere are all the tear-jerkers\u2014or at least those that tried to be\u2014from Super Bowl 59.\n\nDove: \u201cKeep Her Confident\u201d\n\nThe ad: Dove\u2019s Super Bowl spot continues a theme that the Unilever-owned personal care brand kicked off back in 2004 with its \u201cCampaign for Real Beauty.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cKeep Her Confident,\u201d a young girl smiling hugely runs down the sidewalk. \u201cAt 3, these legs are unstoppable,\u201d flashes across the screen, followed by the looming, \u201cAt 14, she\u2019ll think they\u2019re unbearable.\u201d\n\nHow it aimed to touch hearts: Half of girls who drop out of sports say it\u2019s because of low body confidence, according to Dove. The call to action is for everyone to \u201cchange the way we talk to girls.\u201d\n\nLay\u2019s: \u201cThe Little Farmer\u201d\n\nThe ad: A young girl lives on a potato farm. When a potato falls off a truck, she plants it in the ground, waters it, and protects it from storms until it becomes a potato plant. She then harvests her potato, and contributes it to the next big potato harvest.\n\nHow it aimed to touch hearts: It\u2019s a play for American-grown agriculture\u2014but it wasn\u2019t the original plan.\n\nLay\u2019s originally intended to air an ad highlighting the Canadian favorite All Dressed flavor, but swapped it out for a more U.S.-centric message. The brand claimed it didn\u2019t have anything to do with declining U.S.-Canadian relations after President Donald Trump announced tariffs against the country\u2019s northern neighbor.\n\nCome Near\u2019s \u201cHe Gets Us\u201d campaign: \u201cWhat Is Greatness?\u201d\n\nThe ad: \u201cHe Gets Us,\u201d a campaign run by Christian nonprofit Come Near, debuted at the Super Bowl in 2023. For its third year in a row, the group dropped down from two ads to just one. This year\u2019s ad starred some of the people that Come Near has been working with in New Orleans since it began meeting with local groups two months ago.\n\nThe format of the 60-second \u201cWhat Is Greatness?\u201d ad was familiar to those who\u2019ve seen previous ads from \u201cHe Gets Us.\u201d First, it poses a question, and then flashes through a series of still images that demonstrate the response they want people to ruminate on.\n\nHow it aimed to touch hearts: The Super Bowl 59 ad aimed to equate simple, quiet acts of kindness with Jesus\u2019 example of greatness. That includes things like donating organs, caring for strangers, supporting immigrants, or caring for people experiencing homelessness. The soundtrack, a Johnny Cash cover of Depeche Mode\u2019s \u201cPersonal Jesus,\u201d added to the emotive vibe.\n\nGoogle Pixel: \u201cDream Job\u201d\n\nThe ad: Google\u2019s first Super Bowl ad of the 2025 game starred its Pixel smartphone. In it, a man seems to be answering mock interview questions for a potential job. After initially hesitating over a question about his most significant job, he describes his experience as a father\u2014but using corporate language. At the end, he begins a real job interview, thanks in part to Google Pixel\u2019s Gemini AI features.\n\nHow it aimed to touch hearts: Playing on parenthood-related themes is a pretty safe bet given there are about 63 million parents in the U.S., according to the last census, though that number is going down (it was 66 million in 2010).\n\nAnd while Google\u2019s no stranger to heartwarming spots, this one probably worked better on parents than it did on everybody else.\n\nRocket: \u201cOwn the Dream\u201d\n\nThe ad: The mortgage company Rocket has gone for laughs in the past, but this year took a more serious tone. It shows scene after scene of families enjoying intimate moments in their homes or moving into them. A cover of \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads\u201d plays in the background, and the spot ends with a play for unity, saying that \u201ceveryone deserves their shot at the American dream.\u201d\n\nHow it aimed to touch hearts: Given the divisiveness of the political and cultural moment, anything that sounds like a call for unity has an emotional tinge to it. The brand told ADWEEK that it was a \u201ccomplete departure\u201d from its previous work. The Super Bowl ad also included an IRL singalong moment: After the ad aired, Rocket organized a singalong to \u201cCountry Roads\u201d inside the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.\n\nFoundation to Combat Antisemitism: \u201cNo Reason to Hate\u201d\n\nThe ad: Robert Kraft\u2019s Foundation to Combat Antisemitism aired its first Super Bowl ad last year, with a more pointed message about standing up to hate. This year\u2019s ad went more vague, with Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady trading insults until they agree that things are \u201cso bad, that we have to do a commercial about it.\u201d\n\nHow it aimed to touch hearts: Similar to Rocket\u2019s spot, FCAS aimed to address the divisiveness of the political and cultural moment we\u2019re living through. And while that\u2019s likely to touch the hearts of many Americans who\u2019ve faced the challenge of trying to relate to a family member or neighbor with differing views, some argued that FCAS chose the wrong ambassadors for the message.",

A pivotal gathering aimed at addressing the country\u2019s preparedness and response to the escalating impacts of climate change.\n\nSpeaking at the launch ceremony, Romina Khurshid Alam, Coordinator to PM on Climate Change, highlighted Pakistan\u2019s increasing dependence on glaciers and rivers for its water supply, emphasizing that the country is facing acute water shortages that exacerbate the challenges for agriculture, a crucial sector of the national economy and survival.\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is significantly threatened by water scarcity, and we need invest in long-term solutions to tackle these challenges\u201d she stated. She termed the Seed Security Prototype as vital innovation that can pave way for climate resilient agricultural practices. The report findings indicate that farmers in Pakistan are grappling with dwindling quality and availability of seed stocks, and the harsh impacts of unpredictable and extreme weather conditions make it worse. These issues have not only disrupted the agricultural cycle but have also led to severe economic consequences, pushing many farmers further into a vicious cycle of debt and poverty. Waqas Dar, Country Director International Rescue Committee, Pakistan, noted that \u201cAchieving sustained growth in agricultural production and productivity heavily depends on developing improved crop varieties and establishing an efficient system to ensure the timely availability of high-quality seeds to farmers\u201d\n\nThe Seed Security prototype is designed to support farmers to identify and multiply climate resilient seed varieties, systematize and incentivize the exchange of services, skills and seeds among participating farmers, community-based organizations (CBOs) and other stakeholders. To build climate resilient livelihoods by ensuring availability and improving sustainable and affordable access to quality seeds lie at the core of our joint vision.\n\nFatima Arshad, Head of Sustainability and Corporate Communications Unilever, said, \u201cNature has emerged as a key pillar of Unilever\u2019s sustainability strategy. We are committed to promoting climate resilient agricultural practices in Pakistan to improve seed security, improve farmer livelihoods, and support regenerative agriculture in the country through strong partnerships with key stakeholders.\u201d\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the National Seed Policy 2024 states that seeds are very important in shaping food crop production and stresses that it is vital to have seeds with suitable traits to adapt to diverse climatic conditions and intensive cropping systems, while also addressing the varying needs of consumers.",

He urged tech companies to advance early warning systems, disaster mitigation, and post-disaster response efforts.\n\nThe CEO of Sindh People\u2019s Housing for Flood Affectees, while shedding light on post-flood rehabilitation in the province, said that against a target of reconstructing 2.1m houses, the government had rebuilt \u201c900,000 houses, while 50,000 are being constructed every month\u201d.\n\nSobiah Becker of Deutsche Gesel\u00adls\u00adchaft F\u00fcr Internationale Zusam\u00admenarbeit (GIZ) GMBH called for compliance-driven adaptation, stating, \u201cWe must move away from the idea that sustainability is something that is being forced upon us and instead focus on the fact that sustainable, climate-resilient industries open up new markets.\u201d\n\nBritish High Commission Islam\u00adabad Development Director Jo Moir stressed the need to assess the cost of inaction on climate adaptation. \u201cWhen you know the cost, you can start prioritising what to do first,\u201d she said.\n\nAdding to the discussion, Zeeshan Sheikh, Country Manager at the International Finance Corporation, pointed out the risks of climate change to a country like Pakistan. \u201cIt is arguably one of the most important areas of engagement,\u201d he said.\n\nAasim Wajid Jawad of Bank Alfal\u00ad\u00adah emphasised corporate social res\u00adponsibility. \u201cWe invested a lot in getting people sustainable housing as we are very conscious about the environment,\u201d he said.\n\nNabila Yazdani, Head of Strategy, Com\u00adm\u00adu\u00adnication and Sustainability at Zong CMPAK, said her company\u2019s fo\u00ad\u00adcus was on how \u201cwe invest in our in\u00ad\u00adf\u00adrastructure which is energy-suffic\u00adient and sustainable in the long run\u201d.\n\nKate Wilson, DAI UK Climate and Environment Director, outlined key ways the private sector can address climate finance challenges: improving the environment for investment, developing quality bankable projects, and removing barriers for marginalised groups.\n\nEBM Executive Director Shahzain Munir said: \u201cClimate change is not everyone\u2019s problem; it\u2019s predominantly a problem for the poor. And we have to face the facts.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised that while the private sector must lead, \u201cthe time for awareness and projects is over, and action is needed now\u201d.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 8th, 2025",

Through determination and foresight, he progressed from minimal circumstances to establishing himself as a leading business leader in Dubai. Even after death Gandhi\u2019s heart stayed with Dubai where he lived his 63-year-long residence.\n\nGandhi\u2018s Journey of resilience and vision\n\nGandhi started his Dubai journey from erstwhile Bombay by boat which traveled through Oman in 1962. Upon his arrival in Dubai, he only carried his matriculation certificate combined with Rs300 in his belongings.\n\nGandhi demonstrated intense ambition by starting his professional journey as a radio mechanic until he obtained employment at the British Bank of the Middle East through his outstanding typing skills.\n\nHowever, his ambitions went further than securing employment. Upon noticing immense potential within Dubai\u2019s developing trading industry, Gandhi ventured into a part-time foodstuff business after the bank\u2019s closing hours after noticing immense potential within Dubai\u2019s developing trading industry.\n\nAfter 18 years of dedication in the banking sector, Gandhi took a bold step and left his job to pursue the business full-time.\n\nBuilding an empire\n\nGandhi launched MH Enterprises in 1978 and converted it into a dominant food distribution company that expanded across the UAE as well as international markets.\n\nAs a part of early business operations Gandhi spent his own time driving trucks between suppliers and customers to distribute food supplies.\n\nHe pursued his tireless work ethic to establish a shop at Al Ras in 1986 where the business conducted wholesale activities and exported to MENA nations. In 1992 he introduced the chemical sector through the establishment of a large warehouse for prompt food and industrial chemical distribution services.\n\nHis company expanded across multiple business sectors through the years while becoming the distributor of international brands including Nestl\u00e9 and Unilever.\n\nAlso Read Kashmiri engineer jailed in Saudi Arabia: Indian govt initiates formal dialogues\n\nUnder his guidance, the MH Group transformed into a business empire which currently has more than 2,500 employees providing services across the UAE and Oman as well as Maldives and Seychelles.\n\nThe group started operating in the duty-free sector in India and later formed a partnership with Adani Industries when the company acquired a significant business stake.\n\nA legacy of dedication\n\nThrough his ceaseless dedication along with business knowledge Gandhi achieved financial success which earned him profound respect from both his community and officials in UAE.

Learnings from these trials are helping to shape our strategies for reducing single-use plastic packaging, including flexible plastic sachets.\n\nWe spoke to our teams in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to find out how they are evolving refill solutions within their respective markets.\n\nBuilding on our waste bank network in Indonesia\n\nIn 2020, we piloted a refill machine, selling home and personal care brands like Dove, Rinso and TRESemm\u00e9, in a packaging-free store in Jakarta. We also introduced two digital machines in an apartment building and a general trade kiosk. These trials taught us that affordability, convenience and dosage control matter most to our Indonesian consumers.\n\nWe then tested an even more convenient refill model, with motorcycle drivers selling door-to-door from large jerrycans. This was more popular than either machine, but high operational costs made scaling this model challenging. However, the simple pouring system worked well.\n\nTo build on this, we began working with local partners like Alner, a TRANSFORM enterprise, introducing scalable manual refill stations to local stores (warungs) and our growing network of waste banks across Indonesia. Today, we serve an estimated 6,000 customers at 1,000 refill stations, saving approximately 6 tonnes of plastic per year.",

These formulations rely on oils, butters, waxes, and powders to deliver hydration, nourishment, and cosmetic benefits without the need for preservatives typically used to inhibit microbial growth in water-based products. By excluding water, these products often boast longer shelf lives and can be more concentrated with active ingredients, potentially enhancing their effectiveness. In today's society, those who prioritize aesthetics are actively seeking for alternative options that are more beneficial for their well-being, especially in the realm of beauty products. The waterless beauty trend is rapidly gaining popularity due to the high potency of skincare and cosmetics products. It is a significant factor that contributes to the growing demand for waterless makeup. The demand for waterless cosmetics is rapidly growing as consumers increasingly seek environmentally sustainable beauty products. Water-free cosmetics offer several benefits, such as highly concentrated formulas, longer product durability, and reduced environmental impact. Consumers are increasingly favoring alternatives that cut pollution and minimize water consumption.List of Prominent Players in the Waterless Cosmetics Market:\u2022 Unilever Plc\u2022 The Waterless Beauty Company\u2022 L'Oreal SA\u2022 Kao Corporation\u2022 The Procter & Gamble Company\u2022 Loli\u2022 Clensta\u2022 Ruby's Organics\u2022 Carter + Jane\u2022 Taiki USA\u2022 Ktein\u2022 Niconi\u2022 True Botanicals\u2022 Allies Group Pte.

KgAAExpert Knowledge, Just a Click Away:Market Dynamics:Drivers-Growing environmental concerns and sustainability initiatives are considered prime drivers. The waterless cosmetics market is being driven by increasing environmental consciousness and sustainability efforts. With increasing awareness among consumers of the environmental impact of traditional cosmetics, there is a growing demand for eco-friendly alternatives. The cosmetics industry is one of the major contributors to water pollution due to the high water consumption in production and the release of chemical residues into water bodies. As a result, consumers are seeking waterless cosmetic products that minimize water usage and reduce pollution. Another driver for overall market growth is the rising demand for convenient and travel-friendly products. The demand for waterless cosmetics is also fuelled by the need for convenience and travel-friendly products. Waterless formulations often come in solid or powdered forms, making them lightweight and easy to carry. With increased global travel and hectic lifestyles, consumers prefer compact and portable cosmetic products that can be easily packed and used on the go. Waterless cosmetics such as solid shampoo bars, powder foundations, and dry shampoo powders cater to this demand, driving the market growth.Challenges:Limited consumer awareness and education are considered a prime challenge in the water cosmetics market. Despite the benefits of waterless cosmetics, a significant restraint in the market is the need for more awareness and education among consumers regarding these products. Many consumers still need to familiarize themselves with waterless beauty products and may be hesitant to switch from traditional formulations. However, the lack of effective awareness campaigns and marketing strategies also hinders market growth in this segment. Another restraint the waterless cosmetics market faces is the challenges in formulation and ensuring product efficacy. Formulating cosmetics without water requires innovative techniques and ingredients to maintain product stability and performance.Regional Trends:The North America Waterless Cosmetics Market is expected to have a major market share in terms of revenue, and it is due to the Growing population, rapid urbanization, and increasing industrialization that are factors expected to proliferate the growth of the Waterless Cosmetics Market in the region. Increasing awareness about waterless skin care products due to their environmentally friendly nature is expected to boost the market growth in this region. Besides, Asia-Pacific had a substantial share in the market because the region serves as a hub for innovation and manufacturing in the cosmetics industry. With a robust infrastructure and technological advancements, companies in this region can develop and produce a wide range of waterless cosmetic products to meet consumer demands efficiently.Unlock Your GTM Strategy:Recent Developments:\u2022 In March 2023, Vantage Personal Care introduced JEESPERSE\u00ae NoLo Self-Emulsifying Bases specifically designed for waterless hair care applications.

            "content": "Unilever, one of the largest employers in the Veliko Tarnovo region and the owner of the \"Denny\" ice cream brand, has relocated its ice cream production from Bulgaria as of August. Strashimir Grancharov, the company\u2019s regional manager for Bulgaria, cited a shortage of workers as a key reason for the move, stating that labor shortages have made operations increasingly difficult, Money.bg reports.\n\nThe production of Unilever\u2019s ice cream brands will now take place in Romania, Greece, and Turkey. Grancharov emphasized that this does not mean the company is shutting down operations in Bulgaria, but rather transferring production due to workforce challenges and the expectation of lower costs in these foreign markets.\n\nDespite the production shift, Unilever\u2019s ice cream factory in Debelets, Veliko Tarnovo, currently employs over 120 workers. The Bulgarian office of the British company assured that all employees affected by the closure will receive compensation. Meanwhile, Unilever\u2019s brands will continue to be sold on the Bulgarian market, and all other company employees in Bulgaria will retain their positions.\n\nUnilever entered Bulgaria\u2019s ice cream market in 2018 after acquiring \"Ice Cream Factory\" LLC, a company producing well-known brands such as Denny, Cornet, Cremona, and Favorite. Prior to the acquisition, Unilever had already been present in the Bulgarian market with brands like Eskimo and Algida. At the time, \"Ice Cream Factory\" held a market share of between 5-10% in terms of volume and 10-20% in value, similar to Unilever\u2019s existing market share.\n\nThe Debelets production plant, which opened in 2016, became Bulgaria\u2019s second-largest ice cream manufacturing facility. It remained operational even after Unilever took over the business, but now its production is set to move abroad as the company adapts to changing labor and economic conditions.\n\nSources:",

            "content": "In December Unilever Vietnam was awarded the Human Act Prize in the Sustainable Project category for pioneering a carbon-neutral journey in its operations, concluding a memorable year of positive contributions to the community.\n\nUnilever Vietnam\u2019s 30 years of creating a lasting mark\n\nThe initiative successfully met the criteria of improving production processes, integrating green technology, and establishing an environmental impact measurement system. Thanks to that, the company has eliminated almost 9,700 tonnes of CO2 per year since 2007, reduced 511kg of SOx gas by using biomass fuel per year, and eliminated cardboard waste for packaging transportation from Dynaplast.\n\nUnilever has also implemented and realised a circular economy model in managing waste, such as plastic waste, damaged pallets, and cardboard boxes \u2013 transforming waste into energy and fertilisers to support production activities.\n\nDuring its 30 years of presence in Vietnam, Unilever has continuously strived to improve people\u2019s lives and boost sustainable development. Its products such as Lifebuoy, OMO, Sunsilk, and P/S have become familiar companions, contributing to improving the quality of life for families.\n\nAccording to research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, climate change is projected to inflict damage equivalent to 17 per cent of the global GDP by 2050, with losses estimated at $38 trillion annually.\n\nIn the context that Vietnam is facing serious environmental and social challenges, Unilever Vietnam considers long-term development as a core factor, but also realises this commitment through actions and bringing long-term value.\n\nSince 2020, Unilever Vietnam has pioneered the construction of a plastic waste collection and recycling system, significantly contributing to reducing environmental pollution and shaping a waste-free future.\n\nIn 2022, Unilever Vietnam\u2019s OMO brand cooperated with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in the Action for a Green Vietnam programme, committing to plant one million trees by the end of 2025, focusing on protective forests, national forests, schools and urban areas. Over 690,000 trees have been planted to date.\n\nWith a business philosophy associated with social responsibility, Unilever Vietnam has taken part in schemes to improve livelihoods through a series of community projects, from personal hygiene education and providing clean water to supporting economic development for women in difficult areas. These efforts have touched millions of people, helping to change not only living conditions but also raising public awareness about sustainability.\n\nAlong with contributing to environmental initiatives, Unilever also pays special attention to improving communities, especially women. Through the \u201cWomen do business\u201d initiative in 2023, for example, the company has supported thousands of women across the country with startup training courses and practical capital sources, helping to promote gender equality.\n\nIn addition to social-oriented activities, Unilever Vietnam also promotes the working environment within the business with the philosophy of taking people as the core of business. In November 2024, the enterprise was named number one in the Top 100 Best Places to Work in Vietnam, according to Anphabe.\n\nLooking to the future, Unilever Vietnam continues with its mission to lead the sustainable development journey with ambitious strategic priorities, demonstrating a strong commitment to climate, nature, and livelihoods.\n\nOn climate, Unilever is committed to achieving net-zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2039. To realise this goal, the company has been transitioning to using 100 per cent renewable energy in all production activities. In addition, Unilever is constantly looking for solutions to minimise water consumption, aiming to build more environmentally friendly factories. This is a commitment that does not stop at words but is implemented in practical actions, creating a lasting impact on the fight against climate change.\n\nIn the field of nature protection, Unilever clearly defines its role in regenerating and preserving agricultural and natural ecosystems. The company is committed to maintaining a sustainable supply source that meets production needs and supports local communities. Collaborative drives help increase economic value while protecting land and natural resources, building a future of harmony between people and the environment.\n\nThe plastic issue is also at the heart of Unilever\u2019s strategy. Collecting and recycling more plastic than a company produces helps reduce the impact of plastic waste on the environment and contributes to building a circular economy, where resources are maximally reused.\n\nThrough intensive skills training programmes and comprehensive welfare policies, Unilever not only brings stability, but also inspires and strongly motivates the workforce.\n\nUnilever\u2019s efforts strengthen its pioneering role and inspire other businesses in combining economic development and environmental protection. These are important steps, demonstrating Unilever\u2019s determination and deep responsibility on the journey to building a better future for everyone.\n\nUnilever consistent in sustainability in Vietnam Unilever\u2019s journey of more than 100 years of global development and nearly 30 years in the Vietnamese market has left impressive achievements in sustainable business, worthy of the position of top global sustainable development enterprise.\n\nUnilever Vietnam striving to implement sustainable EPR The active cooperation between Unilever and various recyclers and collectors regarding extended producer responsibility regulations has cemented its determination to promote the plastic economy and accelerate sustainable development.",

            "content": "India innovations for the world\n\nDigital\u2019s becoming heart of R&D\n\nNiacinamide is a vitamin B3 based medication. It was discovered in the 1930s. Around 1970, Unilever became the first company to use niacinamide in a cream. This was in its Fair & Lovely (now called Glow & Lovely) brand. It helped address pigmentation, it gave an even tone to the skin. Unilever patented it, and the product became hugely successful. As soon as the patent expired, hundreds of brands around the world started using it. And it continues to be an integral part of many skincare brands.Guess where that niacinamide innovation happened! In Unilever\u2019s Mumbai lab. \u201cWe were the first ones to combine niacinamide with UV sunscreens. Even today this is one of the hottest molecules in sk incare,\u201d says Vibhav R Sanzgiri, executive director of R&D at Hindustan Unilever .That Mumbai lab, and the ones Unilever have in Bengaluru and Gurgaon, have today made India the British FMCG company\u2019s second largest R&D hub. More than 800 of its 5,000 scientists sit here. And these scientists are at the forefront of Unilever\u2019s most cutting-edge work, especially as it now shifts from chemistry-based work to more sustainable bioscience-based research, and as it uses digital methods to fast-track both research and its go-to-market.\u201cSo much of the work that our teams do here is powering innovation across our brands globally, as well as here in HUL,\u201d Richard Slater, chief research & development officer at Unilever, says.We met Richard recently on one of his visits to India during which he elaborated on a number of innovations from the India labs that are having far-reaching impact.One of these has gone into the liquid Lux sold in China. \u201cThis is a fragrance that we\u2019ve proven clinically \u2013 using digital mapping of the brain \u2013 that it instantly boosts confidence and mood, believe it or not. This is at the cutting-edge of innovation,\u201d he says.Vibhav calls it one of their biggest inventions. This was done about a year and a half back.Another major recent innovation is around bringing skincare benefits to cleansing bars like Lux and Lifebuoy. \u201cSo, they don\u2019t just clean, they also bring an even tone on the skin, glow \u2013 things which you normally associate with a premium skin cream. We\u2019ve done an enormous amount of consumer testing worldwide with this technology that was invented here in our labs \u2013 some 80,000 consumers. And we\u2019re seeing absolutely amazing results for liking, fragrance, clinical benefits on tone and glow,\u201d Richard says.Scientists here recently combined bioscience and materials science to launch what Richard describes as their best ever Surf Excel \u2013 a product that gives higher performance with less chemicals, and much better fragrance. Fragrance, Richard says, is a very important factor now for consumers, and a great deal of investment now goes into that, including to get top-class perfumers.Bioscience and fragrance are also part of a new floor cleaner that Richard and Vibhav say takes hygiene to a new level. Vibhav says they used next-generation surface modifying polymers from biological sources. \u201cThey help to continuously work in terms of cleaning your surface, so they have a long-lasting effect. We tested it on toilets on Vande Bharat trains by installing malodour detectors, and the railway authorities were blown away by it,\u201d he says.Digital capabilities is the other big new investment that Unilever is making in its India labs. \u201cWe have far more data scientists today. We have one of our biggest hubs for digital R&D in Bengaluru. These teams are becoming the heart of R&D. We have fully digitally integrated laboratories, pilot plants, manufacturing centres. So we can monitor what\u2019s going on in the factories. We also have smaller-scale versions of what we have in our factories here, and it\u2019s digitally twinned. So when we\u2019re trying to introduce a new technology or innovation, instead of going and running thousands of trials everywhere, we predict and mimic those conditions, we optimise the processing and then we go very quickly into our rollout and make sure it\u2019s high quality from the start,\u201d Richard says.",

From reimagining everyday essentials to making consumer aspirations accessible, HUL\u2019s impact resonates across millions of Indian homes. At the heart of our success lies a deep commitment to innovation, driven by consumer insights and rigorous science.\n\nAmong HUL\u2019s recent strides in the Beauty & Wellbeing category is a game-changing approach to an often-overlooked aspect of personal care: scalp health. With a focus on addressing real concerns, we continue to redefine what effective, meaningful innovation looks like.\n\nThe challenge beneath the surface: why scalp health matters\n\nThe real story of haircare begins at the scalp. Environmental stressors like heat and humidity compromise the delicate scalp barrier, weakening hair roots and leading to dryness, itchiness, and hair fall. For many, this is more than a cosmetic issue\u2014it\u2019s a daily frustration that impacts confidence and well-being.\n\nDid you know? Studies reveal that 80% of hair loss originates at the root, not the fibre. This underscores the critical need for products that work at the source.\n\nRecognising this gap, HUL prioritised scalp care and with the new Dove scalp care range, we are setting the stage for a solution that transforms the way we approach hair health.\n\nA new era in haircare: Dove Scalp+Hair Therapy Density Boost\n\nDove\u2019s latest offering is the result of advanced scientific research and a deep understanding of consumer needs. The Scalp+Hair Therapy Density Boost range, with its hero product, the Revitalizing Scalp Serum, addresses scalp health as the foundation for denser, stronger hair.\n\nWhat makes it stand out?\n\nPowerful formulation The serum combines 2.5% Niacinamide and 1.5% Zinc-Peptides, ingredients clinically proven to penetrate 15 layers deep, strengthening the scalp barrier and promoting hair follicle health. Visible results In just eight weeks, users experienced up to 10,000 more strands, alongside noticeably fuller and thicker hair. Clean beauty, done right Sulphate-free, paraben-free, dye-free, and PETA-certified, the serum reflects Dove\u2019s commitment to clean beauty and sustainability. Designed for ease With a soothing fragrance and a no-pillow-transfer formula, it\u2019s crafted for effortless overnight use, ensuring scalp care fits seamlessly into daily routines.\n\nDid you know? An independent clinical study revealed that 99% of Indian women reported visibly denser hair and improved scalp health after consistent use for eight weeks.\n\nDriving consumer-centric innovation at HUL\n\nDove\u2019s Scalp+Hair Therapy Density Boost is a microcosm of HUL\u2019s broader strategy: delivering value through meaningful innovation. This focus also reflects a larger trend within HUL\u2019s strategy\u2014premiumisation. By offering advanced, science-backed solutions, HUL elevates everyday routines into experiences of care and quality.",

The London-listed group put to bed speculation in November that it might pursue a sale of the ice-cream division to private investors as it cemented its plans for a spin-off via a separate listing by the end of 2025.\n\nThe Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Magnum owner also confirmed in November that it would separate its ice-cream business unit in India from the Hindustan Unilever subsidiary and pursue a local listing.\n\nSimilarly in Indonesia, Unilever said it had entered a \u201cbusiness transfer agreement\u201d with PT The Magnum Ice Cream Indonesia, effectively a local holding company that will house the ice-cream unit and assets.\n\nUnilever declined to comment on the impact on jobs from the closure of the factory in Bulgaria.\n\nThe spokesperson said: \u201cUnilever decided to relocate the ice-cream production from Veliko Tarnovo in Bulgaria to other factories within the group network, which also includes Betty Ice in Suceava, Romania, by April 2025.\n\n\u201cThis move aims to facilitate production synergies and ensure sustainable development for the long term. The variety of products for Bulgarian consumers will remain unchanged, and Unilever will continue to invest in the region, providing favourite products and making a positive societal impact.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported on Friday (31 January) Unilever was mulling a New York listing for its ice-cream division, once separated.\n\nHowever, the report from Bloomberg, quoting unnamed sources, also suggested the FMCG major may consider a dual listing in the US and Europe, perhaps London or Amsterdam.\n\nIn a separate response, Unilever said it had no comment to make on the report. A spokesperson said: \u201cNo decision has been made and therefore we\u2019re not commenting.\u201d\n\nThe report sparked a commentary from the European consumer staples team at Barclays, led by Warren Ackerman, assessing the implications for such listings in the US and Europe.\n\n\u201cWe would prefer a clean sale or JV of ice cream, with proceeds returned in a sizeable buyback,\u201d the team wrote in a research note yesterday (3 February).\n\nThey suggested a listing in Amsterdam could have tax implications, amounting to a \u201cpotential liability\u201d of \u20ac2bn ($2.1bn), which Barclays estimated would push up the valuation multiple to around 15 times EBITDA \u201cto compensate for tax leakage\u201d.\n\nThe team added: \u201cWe would favour a joint UK/US listing because in our view it would reduce the flow-back risk given the UK is Unilever\u2019s primary listing and an estimated 70% of its shareholders are US/UK domiciled.\n\n\u201cThere would be inevitable pushback from the Dutch government given there have [been] some assurances from Unilever management around the listing domicile.\n\n\u201cListing only in the US might result eventually into a higher valuation (although not a given due to current GLP-1 concern on food stocks in the US) but the flow-back risk would likely be more significant as some UK and European shareholders might be forced sellers.\u201d\n\nIce cream is a sizeable business for Unilever. The division generated \u20ac7bn in revenue over the first nine months of 2024, generating underlying sales growth (USG) of 3.6%.\n\nThe nutrition unit, which houses the remaining parts of Unilever\u2019s food portfolio such as the Marmite and Knorr\u2019s brands, posted \u20ac9.9bn in sales, corresponding to a USG of 2.6%.\n\nGroup revenue was \u20ac46.4bn, with USG standing at 1.3%.",

Acne and scars are common skin issues for consumers, requiring effective solutions like creams and scrubs. Avon and Unilever dominate the market, but smaller brands like Natuurium and Biologi offer innovative, natural, and organic alternatives. Raw material supplies for vegan ingredients can be a concern, as can advertising activities for affordable skincare products. Environmental conditions, such as pollution and UV rays, harm skin, driving demand for sunscreens and anti-pollution serums. Rapid urbanization and rising population increase sensitivity to skin issues, leading to a propensity for self-caring products like face masks, toners, and eye creams. Protecting skin from harmful effects of blue light, tanning, and desert conditions is also important. Companies must ensure their products offer hydrating properties, radiance, and shield against environmental stressors. Innovative, bounce-back products like hyaluronic acid creams and vitamin C serums are in high demand. Shopping malls and beauty retail stores provide easy access, but e-commerce and beauty salons offer personalized treatments. Overall, the market requires a focus on skin nourishment, skin brightening, and sun protection, as well as addressing consumer concerns about plastic pollution and synthetic products.\n\nCosmetic skin care products, including anti-aging creams and serums, carry higher price tags due to the inclusion of expensive ingredients and manufacturing costs. Ingredients like diamonds, gold, caviar extract, saffron, rose, jasmine essential oils, and arginine elevate the product's value. Additionally, companies invest in innovative, advanced, and efficient formulations using antioxidants, peptides, and retinol. These expensive ingredients contribute to the removal of fine lines and wrinkles, enhancing the final product's price. The cost also covers packaging and advertising expenses.\n\nDiscover how AI is revolutionizing market trends- Get your access now!\n\nSegment Overview\n\nThis cosmetic skin care market report extensively covers market segmentation by\n\nProduct\n\nDistribution Channel\n\nGeography\n\nEnd User\n\nPrice Point\n\n1.1 Face skincare products- The face skincare segment dominated the cosmetic skin care market in 2024, accounting for a significant market share.

Of those who drop out, 48% have been told they don\u2019t have the \u201cright body type\u201d to play.\n\nDove\u2019s 30-second spot from Ogilvy U.K. will air during the fourth quarter of the Big Game, delivering an important message about boosting body confidence in young athletes.\n\nSet to a cover of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Grammy-award-winning artist H.E.R., the ad forgoes dialogue to deliver a simple message: \u201cI in 2 girls who quit sports are criticized for their body type. Let\u2019s change the way we talk to our girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep Her Confident,\u201d holds up Dove\u2019s legacy of challenging societal beauty standards, a cause it\u2019s been championing since 2004 through its commercially successful \u201cCampaign for Real Beauty.\u201d\n\nFounded in the same year, the brand\u2019s \u201cSelf Esteem Project\u201d education initiative has reached more than 114 million young people across 153 countries since 2004.\n\nIn recent years, the Unilever-owned brand has built upon this history through its \u201cBody Confident Sport\u201d program which offers 11 to 17-year-old girls coaching tools to build body confidence and encourage them to stay in sports.\n\nThe personal care brand\u2019s Super Bowl 59 campaign spotlights this initiative while encouraging others to think about the language they use around young people.\n\n\u201cAs a global leader in self-esteem education, Dove is dedicated to helping girls feel confident in sports and beyond,\u201d said Marcela Melero, chief growth officer for Dove in North America.\n\n\u201cBut this focus on appearance over ability is shattering girls\u2019 confidence and preventing them from thriving in the sports they love. That\u2019s why Dove is proud to return to the Big Game to inspire coaches and communities with our Body Confident Sport program. Together, we can help keep her confident\u2014both on and off the field.\u201d\n\nAhead of Super Bowl Sunday, the brand worked with Edelman and Sports Illustrated to debut a limited edition magazine, Sports ReIllustrated, which features the stories of young women athletes and rising stars.\n\nA rally to mark the launch of the magazine and Dove\u2019s Super Bowl campaign will take place in New Orleans, LA., ahead of the Big Game, featuring appearances from Dove ambassadors, including tennis legends Venus Williams and Billie-Jean King and Olympic long jump gold medalist Tara Davis-Woodhall.\n\nIn 2024, Dove\u2019s Super Bowl campaign showed girls practicing sports to the tune of \u201cIt\u2019s a Hard-Knock Life,\u201d from the musical Annie.",

            "content": "By Aimee Donnellan\n\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) \u2013 Think of Unilever, and the first products that come to mind are likely to be ones you eat \u2013 Marmite, Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream and Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise. Yet the $143-billion company is increasingly investing in other parts of its business, like beauty and wellbeing, and not spending any of its M&A budget on growing its food empire. There\u2019s a strong valuation case for doing so.\n\nFood was once an exciting revenue stream for the likes of Nestl\u00e9, Kraft Heinz and Unilever. The latter spent decades splurging on deals and expanding into new territories like Indonesia and India to gain market share. Shoppers, seduced by big marketing campaigns, were happy to pay over the odds for branded cereals like Cheerios and Heinz tomato ketchup. Yet ever since inflation soared in 2022, consumers have shopped around for the lowest prices, complicating the delivery of consistent revenue and stable margins.\n\nIn November, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s new CEO Laurent Freixe revealed how these forces have afflicted the world\u2019s largest food manufacturer. Over the medium term, he is only aiming to deliver 4% revenue growth, excluding the effects of M&A and currency swings. That\u2019s closer to the lower end of the $227 billion group\u2019s previous target of mid-single-digit growth. Freixe is only aiming to keep operating margins steady at 17% over the coming years.\n\nConsumer goods more generally are under pressure. In October, Kraft Heinz trimmed its sales and profit outlook for the year. The $36 billion maker of Jell-O also posted a larger than expected hit to its third-quarter sales. Compare that to the business of selling luxury beauty products. Swiss skincare firm Galderma expected to grow revenue between 8.8% and 9.5% in 2024, having delivered 9.2% in the first nine months of the year. And $204-billion French cosmetics giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al is expected to boost sales by around 5% annually over the next three years, more than double the rate of food giants like Nestl\u00e9 and Kraft Heinz during the same period, as per LSEG estimates.\n\nInvestors have noticed. Kraft Heinz and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s enterprise values are roughly 10 times and 17 times the respective operating profit they\u2019re forecast to deliver in 2025, using LSEG Datastream figures, which represents a sharp decline from their equivalent 12-month forward multiples of 14 times and 20 times at the start of 2023. Galderma and L\u2019Or\u00e9al trade at an average of 28 times 2025 operating profit. Two other food-heavy players, Danone and Unilever, trade on multiples of 15 and 14 respectively.\n\nThese diverging fortunes are why Hein Schumacher is drawing a line in the sand. The Unilever boss has already committed to flogging the company\u2019s ice cream business, leaving a slimmed-down nutrition unit that includes brands like Knorr stock cubes and Hellmann\u2019s. He plans to spend a large share of the company\u2019s $9-billion marketing budget, equivalent to 15% of revenue, bulking up the beauty and wellness business, which delivered nearly $14-billion of sales in 2023. According to a person with knowledge of his plans, only two food brands, Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Knorr stock cubes, will get a decent slab of this budget. The rest of the food business will be gradually pruned and trimmed. As it stands, beauty and wellness will make up just over a quarter of the operating profit Unilever will deliver in 2025, using analyst estimates gathered by Visible Alpha and excluding the ice cream unit. Meanwhile, nutrition will make up another quarter, home care almost a fifth and personal care close to 30%. Imagine a hypothetical world where Schumacher could in one stroke boost the percentage coming from beauty and wellness to, say, 40% \u2013 perhaps via buying up some small brands and luring in more customers with a bigger marketing spend on the division. If the other divisions stayed the same, the nutrition business\u2019s contribution would shrink to 12%. This could pay dividends in valuation terms. If Schumacher pulls it off, the enlarged beauty and wellness division would deliver 4.3 billion euros of operating profit. Value that at L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Galderma\u2019s average 28 times operating profit multiple for 2025, and the division would alone be worth 119 billion euros including debt. If the slimmer nutrition unit is valued on the 16 times average multiple of Nestl\u00e9 and Danone, it would fetch 21 billion euros. Also putting personal care on 16 times, like Sensodyne toothpaste maker Haleon, would imply a valuation of 51 billion euros. Value Unilever\u2019s home care arm like Reckitt Benckiser, on 12 times, and it would be worth 24 billion euros. In total, Unilever would be worth 216 billion euros, before factoring in ice cream, a 25% uplift on the group\u2019s current enterprise value. The catch for Nestl\u00e9 and Kraft Heinz is that their path to redemption is much fuzzier. After all, with the lion\u2019s share of their sales stemming from edible brands, it\u2019s much harder to pivot to something else. Without a plan B, consumer giants will increasingly split into the haves and the have-nots.\n\nEditing by George Hay and Streisand Neto",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Imagine creating a drama series for an international audience \u2014 with an all-star cast and content at par with K-drama blockbusters \u2014 without worrying about the expenses, as the tab will be picked up by consumer brands that are adroitly woven into the storyline.\n\nFilipina filmmaker Corinna Vistan, formerly based in Hollywood as a content producer at Marvel, did just that and more when she created the 2024 TV miniseries \u201cSecret Ingredient,\u201d a landmark partnership between Hong Kong-based streaming platform Viu and consumer giant Unilever.\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\nCannes Corporate Media & TV Awards (and later on Asian Academy Awards) feted this project as it became a shining example of how filmmakers and marketers can come together to craft stories that both enhance the narrative and align with brand values, without feeling forced or out of place.\n\nREAD: Julia Barretto inspired by her \u2018Secret Ingredient\u2019 character to leave comfort zone\n\nAside from the series winning \u201cBest Branded Content\u201d and \u201cBest Ensemble Cast,\u201d Cannes summoned Vistan in September last year to deliver a lecture on the innovative funding structure of \u201cSecret Ingredient.\u201d\n\nThe six-part miniseries tells a love story between a South Korean chaebol heir Ha Joon, played by Sang Heon Lee (star of Gran Turismo and XO, Kitty), and Maya, a talented Filipina chef played by Julia Barretto, a subordinate of famous Indonesian chef Arif, played by Nicholas Saputra.\n\nHa Joon gives up his entire luxurious life in Seoul to pursue Maya, a childhood friend he had lost touch with but who no longer recognizes him in the present day.\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\nAs many of the scenes are set in the kitchen of Chef Arif\u2019s restaurant in Jakarta, the series involves a lot of cooking and is thus able to imbed Unilever products.\n\n\u201cTraditional models of financing are changing, and brands are stepping up as key partners in the development of new media,\u201d says Vistan, sharing with Sunday Biz excerpts from the lecture.\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\n\u201cThe rise of streaming services, changes in advertising consumption and the explosion of branded content have opened new opportunities for brands to become direct financiers of creative projects,\u201d she says. \u201cThis makes filmmakers an attractive partner for brands wanting to reach audiences in a more engaging, organic way.\u201d\n\nBrands now understand that viewers are skipping ads or avoiding them altogether, especially with the proliferation of on-demand content, she adds.\n\n\u201cIt was a monumental project for Viu in partnership with Unilever because it was the first case study we\u2019ve done that showcased how content can marry branded integration as long as you have great storytelling at its core,\u201d Viu Philippines head of content Garlic Garcia says in an email interview.\n\n\u201cThis major international recognition from Cannes affirms the success of this groundbreaking brand collaboration between Viu and Unilever, that reinforces how you can always find a way for a brand to shine without letting it disrupt the viewer experience and this is what we want to show to potential brands that are looking for alternative ways to promote their products and services,\u201d Garcia adds.\n\nGarcia says one success factor here is that the show highlights the best of the Philippines and Indonesia, two of the most populous countries in the region. \u201cWe tapped A-list celebrities that were homegrown to add to the star factor of the show,\u201d she notes.\n\nSaputra, for instance, is said to be Indonesia\u2019s version of Piolo Pascual.\n\n\u201cSecond, we capitalized on the K-wave influence and tapped a South Korean director and writer to helm the show with breakout star Sang Heon Lee also to lead it,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhat makes it work\n\nSubtle advertising in films or TV series isn\u2019t really something new. Think Mattel\u2019s Barbie film (2023). Closer to home, tycoon Henry \u201cBig Boy\u201d Sy Jr. produced in 2011 the comedy flick \u201cWho\u2019s that girl?\u201d starring Anne Curtis as a way to advertise residential condominium developer SM Development Corp. Other brands were likewise showcased in the movie.\n\nBut Secret Ingredient is the first time that a fast-moving consumer goods company like Unilever came in to support an entire series to imbed multiple brands in a multinational production led by a Filipino showrunner.\n\nIt opens the doors for creators to bring their visions to life without relying solely on studios, networks, or streaming platforms.\n\nBut how can marketers, filmmakers or storytellers seamlessly integrate brands into these narratives without interrupting the flow, disrupting authenticity, or most importantly, alienating the audience?\n\nVistan shares a few tips:\n\n1. Start with the story: The narrative comes first. Always.\n\nIt all begins with a concept: what the movie will be about that the creator can pitch to financiers.\n\nSecret Ingredient is about childhood friends who found each other through food and became hotel chefs as adults.\n\n\u201cSo when you see them cook using the (Unilever) products, hindi pilit (it isn\u2019t something forced into you),\u201d says Vistan.\n\n2. Know your audience: Understand what resonates with them emotionally and align the brand with those elements.\n\nHere, the main target demographic base is that segment of women, including mothers, who love K-dramas. But it has to come with a Southeast Asian element. The story takes place in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Manila, but everything was filmed in Manila. Ayala Tower 2 was used as the shooting location for the fictional chaebol office.\n\n\u201cThe pull is the Korean element; that\u2019s the anchor,\u201d Vistan says.\n\n3. Subtle but visible: Strike a balance between making the brand noticeable but not intrusive.\n\n\u201cIn striking a balance between subtlety and visibility, and ensuring the brand enhances rather than detracts from the story, we can create compelling, immersive content that resonates with viewers while serving the brand\u2019s objectives,\u201d Vistan says.\n\n\u201cStorytelling is about connection\u2014between the creator and the audience, between characters and their world.\u201d\n\nAs a partner, Unilever gave Vistan\u2019s team the freedom to execute their creative vision.\n\n\u201cThey trusted us, gave us creative freedom, and just said we have to work with a Korean writer and director,\u201d Vistan recalls.\n\nThe team would send the script to Unilever but only offered their inputs when their brands appeared.\n\n4. Create a world where the brand belongs: The brand should feel like a natural part of the environment, characters and plot.\n\n\u201cUnilever had recipes they wanted to highlight. The goal was to show those recipes so when viewer watches it, they will get hungry and want to cook,\u201d Vistan says.\n\nVistan\u2019s team worked with six Unilever brands , including two that are known in the Philippines: Lady\u2019s Choice and Knorr (four are Indonesian brands).\n\n\u201cAt the time the show went out, sales went up for those types of products,\u201d she says.\n\nIn the Philippines, the show ranked No. 1 on Viu\u2019s platform on its fifth and sixth week, and also topped the ranking in Indonesia.\n\nYour subscription could not be saved.

            "content": "Peter ter Kulve made a beeline for Piccadilly Circus when he visited London last spring. The Dutch boss of Unilever\u2019s ice cream division craned his neck upwards to watch Magnum ice creams appear to leap out of the huge digital screen, in what was the first airing of Europe\u2019s largest 3D advertising campaign.\n\nNow plenty of politicians and City investors hope that Magnums and other ice creams will soon appear at another London landmark.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange is vying to land the \u00a313 billion float of Unilever\u2019s ice cream division, which produces everything from tubs of Ben & Jerry\u2019s to blocks of Viennetta. Unilever, the consumer goods giant behind Dove soap and Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, plans to spin off the division by the end of the year, with a demerger the most likely mode of separation.\n\n\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is so determined to land the float that she personally met Unilever chief executive, Hein Schumacher, and the head of its UK and Ireland business, Marc Woodward, as far back as September to urge them to list the ice cream business in London. The official list of ministerial meetings shows Reeves met Unilever \u201cto discuss investment in the UK and capital markets and reforms\u201d.\n\nSince then, sources said, officials have been keeping the pressure up on the company to stick with UK listing.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s is one of the brands in Unilever\u2019s ice cream business CHRIS RATCLIFFE/GETTY IMAGES\n\nLondon v Amsterdam \u2026 or New York\n\nThree of Unilever\u2019s major UK shareholders have told The Sunday Times they also want the ice cream business to be spun off in London.\n\n\n\nHowever, Nelson Peltz, the fearsome activist investor who has muscled his way on to Unilever\u2019s board, is pushing the company to demerge its ice cream business on to the New York stock exchange in the belief that it will command a higher valuation.\n\n\n\nAmsterdam has a strong claim to land the float, too. In 2020, after Unilever caused uproar by U-turning on a plan to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam, in the face of stiff opposition from UK shareholders, its bosses pledged to the Dutch government that if they were to spin off its food and refreshments division \u2014 which then included ice cream \u2014 it would do so in Amsterdam. Unilever will reveal how the ice cream business will be separated by the end of next month.\n\n\n\nUnilever\u2019s board now must choose whether to side with the Brits, the Dutch or the Americans. The decision will be loaded with political and financial significance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnilever needs to find a way to keep the politicians happy and keep its shareholders happy,\u201d said Warren Ackerman, a Barclays analyst. \u201cThey are walking a narrow path.\u201d\n\nUnilever was formed in 1930 through the merger of a Dutch margarine group, Margarine Unie, and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. Today, from its monolithic headquarters overlooking the River Thames, it sells everything from deodorant to stock cubes to retailers in more than 190 countries. With a market value of \u00a3115 billion, it is the fourth-largest company on the FTSE 100.\n\nUnilever\u2019s headquarters in London and, below, its offices in Rotterdam ALAMY\n\nALAMY\n\nAfter Unilever fended off a hostile $143 billion (\u00a3115 billion) takeover from Kraft Heinz in 2017, then-boss Paul Polman moved to shift its domicile from London to Rotterdam, to benefit from the country\u2019s more robust takeover protections. Controversially, Unilever ended up unifying its corporate structure in Britain in a U-turn that caused considerable embarrassment for the Dutch prime minister at the time, Mark Rutte, a former human resources manager at the company.\n\nHistorical promises\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Alan Jope, Polman\u2019s successor as chief executive, and chairman Nils Andersen moved to smooth things over with a series of commitments \u2014 including the pledge to list and incorporate its food and refreshments division in the Netherlands, should it ever be spun off.\n\nSince then, Rutte\u2019s government has been voted out of office, and both Jope and Andersen have left in the wake of a botched attempt in 2022 to buy GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s consumer goods business for \u00a350 billion. Some shareholders are hopeful those commitments might now fall by the wayside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf there is an economic reason that it should be listed in the UK rather than Amsterdam, then it should be listed in the UK,\u201d said one institutional shareholder. \u201cThere is [a bit of] \u2018my word is my bond\u2019, but I would love it to be listed here [in London]\u201d.\n\n\n\nPeltz sees things differently. The billionaire, whose hedge fund, Trian, has amassed a \u00a31.1 billion stake in Unilever, is trying to steer the ice cream float to New York. Trian has form in this regard. In 2022 Ferguson, the plumbing and heating equipment supplier, switched its listing from London to New York after Trian agitated for the board to focus on its North American business.\n\n\n\nPeltz, 82, has amassed a fortune by clamouring for cost cuts and asset sales at bloated consumer goods giants including Cadbury, Heinz and Mondelez.\n\nHe will no doubt have approved of Schumacher\u2019s early efforts. Since arriving in the summer of 2023, Schumacher announced that 7,500 jobs would go as part of an \u20ac800 million (\u00a3670 million) cost-cutting drive, and that Unilever\u2019s ice cream business, which has dragged on its profit margins, would be separated. The division made operating profits of \u20ac760 million on sales of \u20ac7.9 billion in 2023.\n\nSchumacher\u2019s rationale was that the business of selling ice cream bore little resemblance to selling soap and stock cubes. Managing a supply chain that requires you to store and move products at temperatures of 18C below freezing, and to ramp up supply dramatically whenever the sun comes out, is a complex and costly endeavour.\n\nSchumacher has indicated his preference is to demerge the ice cream business. The prospects of a sale to private equity \u2014 an option explored by Unilever last year \u2014 are diminished by a tax liability that could reach \u20ac2 billion.\n\nUnilever chief executive Hein Schumacher has said Amsterdam had \u201ca good chance\u201d of winning the listing VIVIAN WAN/GETTY IMAGES\n\nLast March, Schumacher told an interviewer on Dutch television that Amsterdam had \u201ca good chance\u201d of landing the listing. Early preparations suggest that the Dutch capital is in a strong position.\n\n\n\nUnilever is moving the ice cream unit\u2019s head office from Rotterdam to Amsterdam to help it attract a higher-calibre, more digitally savvy workforce. Ter Kulve, the division\u2019s boss, who has run more than 40 marathons, appointed Abhijit Bhattacharya \u2014 who oversaw a project to separate the lighting and healthcare divisions of Philips, one of the Netherlands\u2019 biggest conglomerates \u2014 as his finance director late last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy a London listing matters\n\nLosing a chunk of Unilever to Amsterdam or New York would be another blow for the dwindling London stock market, which has had a series of companies defect to New York or succumb to takeovers.\n\nAmsterdam scored some notable floats last year, including the \u20ac14 billion listing of London-based private equity business CVC. But for all its troubles, London remains a much larger market. The total value of shares listed in London is \u00a34.6 trillion compared with \u00a31.2 trillion in Amsterdam, according to the LSE.\n\nThere is recent evidence that London is still a good home for consumer goods companies, too. Shares in Haleon \u2014 owner of Panadol painkillers and Sensodyne toothpaste \u2014 have risen by 18 per cent since it was demerged from GSK in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe familiarity with these consumer businesses is in London and that\u2019s important\u201d, said one of Unilever\u2019s top 20 shareholders, who wants the ice cream business to be spun off in Britain. \u201cWe would be interested in investing in ice cream \u2026 but if you are a UK fund, there is a restriction on the amount you can own of non-UK-listed companies. Clearly, that makes Amsterdam less attractive.\u201d\n\nAnother top 20 shareholder said demergers had a \u201cvery good\u201d record of creating value, provided that shareholders hang on to their new shares. \u201cSo it does often make sense for the listing to be in the same venue as the parent listing,\u201d they said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA demerger would result in Unilever\u2019s shareholders receiving a stake in the ice cream business proportionate to their stake in the broader group. If the division were to be listed in Amsterdam or New York, the vast majority of Unilever\u2019s UK-based shareholders, which own about 30 per cent of the company, would be forced to sell down their stake in the ice cream business because of restrictions on the amount they can hold in overseas companies.\n\nThis selling pressure, known in corporate finance circles as \u201cflowback\u201d, would be less severe if the ice cream unit was listed in London.\n\n\u201cFlowback can depress the share price for six to 12 months and Unilever will not want that to be the starting story for the new ice cream business,\u201d said the head of European M&A at one law firm.\n\nPrivate sale v float\n\nBarclays analyst Ackerman, fresh from a round of meetings with Unilever investors in the US, said they would prefer a private sale of the ice cream division \u2014 which Ackerman believes could still happen via a joint venture with a private equity firm \u2014 or for it to be floated in New York. US shareholders, including Peltz, own about 40 per cent of Unilever.\n\nWhile Unilever\u2019s ice cream operation boasts an enviable stable of brands, it will be made to stand on its own feet at a time when the ground is shifting beneath the food and drinks industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rapid adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, for example, could depress its valuation. Unilever is trying to protect itself against the effect of the diminished appetites of Ozempic and Wegovy users by developing bite-sized ice cream treats, such as Magnum Bon Bon.\n\nAnd then there is the public concern over the prevalence of ultra processed foods \u2014 a definition that would cover most of Unilever\u2019s ice cream brands. To reduce costs, Unilever substitutes cream with reconstituted milk powder and vegetable fat in many of its ice creams, and swaps out sugar for syrup.\n\nFor Schumacher, however, the more pressing concern is getting the separation done while upsetting as few people as possible. It will not be an easy task.\n\nInvestors don\u2019t want Unilever to bring us tax from Amsterdam\n\nUnilever is the sixth-most valuable holding in my investment \u201cforever fund\u201d and an important source of income. So I would be sad to see any of these dividends subject to Dutch withholding tax, which is difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to reclaim, Ian Cowie writes.\n\nUnlike in America, which makes it easy for British investors to avoid tax by filling in a single-sheet W-8BEN form, none of the European countries offers any equivalent facility for equity income. So I already suffer 15 per cent tax on the dividends from my Heineken shares, which are listed in Amsterdam, and have no wish to see something similar happen to a substantial part of Unilever\u2019s returns.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t yet know what the distribution policy of the ice cream business might be, Unilever shares currently yield 3.2 per cent income. Better still, it has increased dividends every year since 1995 without fail.\n\nThat makes these shares attractive to investors like me, whose main aim is to generate enough income for an enjoyable retirement.\n\nOn the other hand, Holland imposes no tax on share purchases. By contrast, Britain is unusual, because it levies 0.5 per cent stamp duty on stock market investments. If chancellor Rachel Reeves is serious about making the City of London more competitive internationally, she should scrap stamp duty.\n\nBut it is often a mistake to let tax worries overshadow the fundamental attractions of a business. I invested 2 per cent of my life savings in Unilever in September 2013, when I paid \u00a325.45 a share. They closed at \u00a346.32 on Friday.",

Agro-pastoral communities in Pakistan continue to confront the effects of climate crisis, economic deterioration and high prices for essential items including food and agricultural supplies.\n\nInternational Rescue Committee and Unilever jointly collaborated to develop \u201cPakistan Seed Security Prototype\u201d which is aimed at building resilience of the farming communities through green entrepreneurship to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn this report, Unilever and IRC pledge to enhance climate resilience through initiatives focused on strengthening seed systems, reducing disaster risks and transitioning livelihoods over the next five years. The report was launched at \u201cPakistan\u2019s Humanitarian Future Event 2025\u201d. A pivotal gathering aimed at addressing the country\u2019s preparedness and response to the escalating impacts of climate change.\n\nSpeaking at the launch ceremony, Romina Khursid Alam (Coordinator to PM on Climate Change) highlighted Pakistan\u2019s increasing dependence on glaciers and rivers for its water supply, emphasizing that the country is facing acute water shortages that exacerbate the challenges for agriculture, a crucial sector of the national economy and survival.\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is significantly threatened by water scarcity, and we need invest in long-term solutions to tackle these challenges\u201d she stated. She termed the Seed Security Prototype as vital innovation that can pave way for climate resilient agricultural practices.\n\nThe report finding indicate that farmers in Pakistan are grappling with dwindling quality and availability of seed stocks, and the harsh impacts of unpredictable and extreme weather conditions make it worse. These issues have not only disrupted the agricultural cycle but have also led to severe economic consequences, pushing many farmers further into a vicious cycle of debt and poverty.\n\nWaqas Dar Country Director International Rescue Committee- Pakistan noted that \u201cAchieving sustained growth in agricultural production and productivity heavily depends on developing improved crop varieties and establishing an efficient system to ensure the timely availability of high-quality seeds to farmers\u201d",

This decision also follows the division\u2019s underwhelming performance.\n\nUnilever has five main divisions - Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care, Nutrition, and Ice Cream. The Ice Cream division, which is expected to be separated by 2025, generates nearly EUR 8 billion in annual sales.\n\nThe closest Unilever ice cream factory to Veliko Tarnovo is in Suceava, Romania.\n\n\"The production relocation process started a year and a half ago when the decision was made to close the factory. In April 2025, the Veliko Tarnovo unit will be permanently shut down,\" a market source stated for Ziarul Financiar. The same source noted that the Bulgarian unit lacked modern technology and struggled with staffing.\n\n\"The volumes produced in Bulgaria will be redistributed within this network, which also includes the Betty Ice factory in Suceava,\" company officials said. \"The Suceava factory is the only one in Romania that is part of Unilever's ice cream production network.\"\n\nThe group also has a spice factory locally, in Prahova, where it recently invested several tens of millions of euros.\n\nThe Romanian factory in Suceava is significantly larger and more technologically advanced.\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, the Anglo-Dutch giant acquired Betty Ice, the Suceava-based ice cream business, from entrepreneur Vasile Armenean for approximately EUR 80 million, according to ZF data at the time. At that moment, Unilever had no ice cream production in Romania - only import and distribution.\n\nLast year, company officials announced that they had invested EUR 12 million in the Suceava factory over the past four years. Furthermore, the group plans additional investments of around EUR 4 million for the 2024-2025 period. Unilever also has ice cream production facilities in Hungary and Poland.\n\nUnilever\u2019s move from Bulgaria to Romania was also commended by Romanian prime minister Marcel Ciolacu.\n\n\"Attracting significant foreign investments is a priority for this year. I am happy that yesterday, a foreign company announced the relocation of its factory from Bulgaria to Romania. Every investor we win is essential for the economy,\" said Ciolacu.\n\n\"Next week, I will discuss with the heads of major American investment funds interested in our country. There are clear signals that the strategic partnership with the United States is entering the new economic dimension agreed with President Trump at the end of last year,\" he continued.\n\nradu@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: J P | Dreamstime.com)",

Thanks to these technology upgrades, their newest BWPC factory has increased efficiency and reduced machinery by approximately 40%.\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Unilever is further developing its local manufacturing capabilities and supply chain strategies to meet the needs of its significant Filipino market.\n\nPresent in about 9 out of 10 homes in the country, the multinational FMCG\u2019s products are household names where supply must meet constant consumer demand.\n\nOver 90% of Unilever products sold in the market are locally manufactured. They are produced in factories in Pasig City, General Trias, Cavite and a collaborative facility in Cabuyao, Laguna.\n\nSince the inauguration of its newest facility for its Beauty & Wellbeing and Personal Care (BWPC) factory in late 2023, production capacity for the portfolio has since increased by 60%.\n\nThese locally made products are even exported to Unilever\u2019s markets in the US, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia and the Middle East, spotlighting the company\u2019s trust in the Philippines as a global manufacturer of its well-known offerings.\n\n\u201cSupply chain is the operational backbone of Unilever,\u201d says Fredy Ong, the company\u2019s chairman and CEO.\n\n\u201cWe live in a world where consumers increasingly want faster, customized, and personalized products. With brands like Rexona, Sunsilk, Selecta, Breeze and Knorr under our belts, we must always have a reliable stock of high-quality products and a supply chain that will deliver superior products and services at an excellent value,\" Ong added.\n\nA future-fit supply chain\n\nUnilever\u2019s supply chain strategy leverages cutting-edge technology and 4th industrial revolution tools to optimize processes across its end-to-end value chain. Thanks to these technology upgrades, their newest BWPC factory has increased efficiency and reduced machinery by approximately 40%.\n\nA few principles they abide by include listening for signals and making timely actions where needed, prioritizing cost and asset base to create competitive growth, and building partner ecosystems that drive innovation and sustainability.\n\nIn terms of technology, Unilever\u2019s factories in the Philippines and across the world are powered by renewable grid electricity. Its Foods (formerly Nutrition) factory has recently signed a 15-year Power Purchase Agreement with a global company to supply solar-powered electricity for factory operations.\n\nUnilever\u2019s facilities are also built in strategic locations to minimize fuel usage and reduce carbon footprint\u2014all integral steps to its ambition of achieving net zero emissions by 2039.\n\nThe FMCG\u2019s use of technology also extends to analytics and data access. It harnesses AI-driven insights to accurately monitor and respond to market, customer and operational trends, and automates routine tasks to increase efficiency while freeing up employees\u2019 time to promote a balanced work culture.\n\nSupplementing these are the adoption of data visibility and accessibility through cloud computing and machine learning, and training sessions to ensure that employees are empowered to make informed decisions regarding supply and production.\n\nAnother key feature of Unilever\u2019s technological transformation is its integrated operations program, positioning the company as one of the most digitized end-to-end supply chain leaders in the industry.\n\nThrough closed-loop planning systems that connect suppliers, customers and internal operations, the company optimizes its ecosystem for higher agility and optimized costs.\n\n\u201cUnilever has been in the Philippines for almost a century, and we\u2019re optimistic about the next hundred years. By empowering our operations, harnessing advanced technologies, and investing in our people, we position ourselves at the forefront of innovation. This ensures that consumers, both locally and globally, have seamless access to the high-quality products and services they rely on,\u201d Ong said.\n\nThe ASEAN region and the Philippines in particular is a key growth area for Unilever, contributing to over half of its global turnover. As the company enhances its local supply chain processes and strategies, it is poised to sustain business growth from the country, solidifying its importance as a key driver of Unilever\u2019s global growth.\n\nFor more information about Unilever, visit unilever.com.ph.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This press release is sponsored by Unilever.

Knorr Mini Meals tick all the boxes which is why they are often an entry-level product for new consumers.\u201d\n\nTapping into the mini meal trend\n\nCreating instant meals that are full of taste and nutrition is Knorr\u2019s area of expertise.\n\nThe brand has been drying herbs and vegetables to preserve nutrition and flavour and to create convenient meals for busy people since 1873 when it launched its first dried soup.\n\n\u201cThe same principles apply today,\u201d says Marcelo, explaining that what he believes differentiates Knorr products from other mini meals is not only superior taste and texture but also a nutrition profile that includes carbs, protein and vegetables.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, by being convenient and effortless to prepare, Knorr Mini Meals are perfectly in tune with the demands of this growing market,\u201d he adds.\n\nMarket growth: adapting to changing lifestyles\n\nAnd while the whole sector is growing, the ambient ready-to-heat segment is doing so at an exceptional pace in Europe.\n\nIn the last five years, instant noodle block sales have increased by 7% in Europe while noodle pots have grown by 4.9%, according to Euromonitor.\n\nBut mini meals are not new, so what is making them so popular now?\n\nEuromonitor research suggests their popularity surge in Europe is all about lifestyle.\n\n20% of people asked said they don\u2019t have time to cook. 16% said that they don\u2019t know how to cook well and 15% said they would rather spend their time doing something else.\n\nFeeding into the ready-to-heat revolution\n\nUnilever is tapping into this demand through Power Brands like Knorr, as well as with more local brands like Pot Noodle, the UK\u2019s top-selling instant hot snacks brand, and Amino in Poland. Both have a strong track record and are well placed to win local consumers.\n\nThe results are promising, with strong mid-single digit growth in markets where Unilever has launched mini meals, most notably Germany, Poland, Pakistan, the US and India.\n\nPart of this success can be linked to Knorr successfully marketing products that match local tastes and trends.\n\nIn India, for example, the Spicy Kimchi and Black Bean K-Pot varieties tapped into the recent growing trend for all things Korean with impressive results, seeing sales more than double in India between 2023 and 2024.\n\nSimilarly, the brand innovation team has been sensitive to preferred cooking methods, using the microwave prep method cooks prefer in the US but opting for the boiling water method to align with cooking preferences in other countries like India.\n\nA taste of the future\n\nGoing forward, Knorr will continue to serve consumer needs by expanding and enhancing its Mini Meal portfolio from the first point of contact on shelf to the moment of consumption.\n\n\u201cMini meals offer us an exciting opportunity for growth,\u201d says Marcelo. \u201cAnd with technology allowing us to speed up the development of new products, we are looking forward to rolling out more flavours to more markets.\u201d",

While the relevant market definition has been left open.While both companies operate in overlapping segments, the transaction is unlikely to alter competitive dynamics significantly, HUL said. The companies have identified key markets relevant to the deal, including the manufacturing and sale of beauty and personal care, skincare, and haircare products in India.Additionally, the parties (Hindustan Unilever and Uprising Science) have outlined potential vertical linkages and complementarities arising from the deal. These include synergies between the manufacturing and sale of beauty and personal care products and their distribution through beauty salons across India.The CCI will assess the transaction to determine its impact on competition before granting approval to the deal. The regulatory body examines such deals to ensure they do not harm consumer interests or restrict competition.Last week, HUL announced that it has signed and executed share purchase and subscription agreement for acquisition of 90.5 per cent of shareholding of Uprising Science Pvt Ltd -- the firm behind Minimalist -- comprising secondary buyout for a cash consideration of Rs 2,670 crore at a pre-money enterprise valuation of Rs 2,955 crore.The company will also make a primary infusion of Rs 45 crore with an eventual acquisition of the remaining 9.5 per cent of Uprising's shareholding.",

Unilever resisted and, rather than an outright reversal, sold Ben & Jerry\u2019s intellectual property in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory to a distributor who would continue sales in the settlements.\n\nA December 2022 agreement seemed to settle the matter, but Unilever also allegedly silenced B&J\u2019s subsequent statements of support for Palestinian refugees and an end to military aid to Israel, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI expressed concerns about the continued perception of antisemitism that is a persistent issue, the lawsuit quotes ter Kulve as explaining his motives.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s reasonable attorney's fees and costs; and any and all other relief that this Court deems just and proper.\u201d\n\nHowever this plays out, Unilever is in the process of spinning off all its ice cream businesses around the globe into a standalone company \u2026 apparently under the leadership of Peter ter Kulve.",

This discussion marked the fifth installment of the series under the theme, 'How to Cope with Performance Pressure.'\n\nSpeakers shared their diverse experiences to guide participants on tackling workplace challenges and encouraged them to drive positive changes in both economic and social domains. The programme also focused on promoting self-reliance and inspiring action toward sustainable development.\n\nThe session was hosted by Adil Hussain, General Manager of Beauty and Wellbeing at Unilever, who emphasised the importance of learning tools to manage stress in today\u2019s fast-paced world. Addressing the audience, he advised, \u201cChoose a profession you\u2019re passionate about to handle work pressures effectively. Self-awareness and honesty in one\u2019s work are essential for maximising potential. Regular self-assessment fosters mental peace.\u201d\n\nContent creators Amtul Baweja and Fahad Tariq of Patangeer shared their perspective on handling stress while working in the social media domain. \u201cNever let pressure consume you. As independent creators, we don\u2019t have bosses, which reduces stress. While our field constantly evolves with new challenges, we stay resilient by keeping our work unique and purposeful,\u201d they remarked.\n\nHighlighting the importance of self-care, they added, \u201cWe don\u2019t force ourselves to create content daily. Taking breaks and resting is crucial. We strive to produce quality content rather than quantity. Keeping personal and professional lives separate helps maintain focus and eliminates unnecessary stress.\u201d\n\nUnilever\u2019s Director of Transformation and Customer Development, Azka Waqar, advised the youth to build a strong support system and openly discuss issues. \u201cAvoid bottling up concerns. Talk about problems instead of internalizing them, whether at home or the workplace. Additionally, physical exercise is vital for mental peace and energy.\u201d\n\nHafsa Shamsi, Managing Director of Roche Pharma, underscored the significance of self-acceptance. \u201cAccepting ourselves truthfully fosters physical, psychological, and spiritual growth. While life is busy, prioritizing oneself and finding time for personal growth is essential,\u201d she stated.\n\nParticipants expressed gratitude for the programme, acknowledging its role in addressing critical issues faced by the youth. They highlighted how the session taught them to stay focused on their goals and handle challenges with determination. Students were also guided on balancing personal and professional life effectively.\n\nUnilever representatives pledged to continue supporting the youth through similar programs, aiming to empower them to drive socio-economic transformation. The session raised awareness about current challenges and offered practical solutions to build a sustainable and positive future.\n\nThe panel concluded with a resounding message: passion, perseverance, and self-care are essential for a successful and balanced life.",

            "content": "In another phase of its ongoing censorship lawsuit, Ben & Jerry\u2019s went after the head of ice cream at its parent company, Unilever, alleging the executive barred a post about President Donald Trump two days before his inauguration. The suit mentions activist investor Nelson Peltz and world\u2019s richest man Elon Musk.\n\nIn an amended complaint in an ongoing censorship lawsuit, Ben & Jerry\u2019s accused its parent company, Unilever, of blocking a post about the president, calling out the company\u2019s ice cream chief, Peter ter Kulve.\n\nIn the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s victory, the management team at Ben & Jerry\u2019s worked with an independent board to create a post for his inauguration that touched on a number of issues the outspoken ice cream maker believed would be challenged during a second Trump administration, according to the complaint. Those issues included minimum wage, universal health care, abortion, and climate change. Ben & Jerry\u2019s claimed to have worked on the post for weeks and received feedback from the global head of litigation at Unilever.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, two days before the inauguration, per the lawsuit, \u201cPeter ter Kelve unilaterally barred Ben & Jerry\u2019s from issuing the post because it specifically mentioned \u2018Donald Trump.\u2019\u201d\n\nBen & Jerry's amend... by alena.botros\n\nThe suit pointed to a board member: Nelson Peltz. \u201cUnilever\u2019s springing objection to mentioning \u2018Trump\u2019 coincides with its prominent board member, Nelson Peltz, publicly supporting Mr. Trump,\u201d it read. And during an ice cream town hall soon after the inauguration, ter Kelve, who the lawsuit claims made the decision based on his intuition rather than evidence, \u201ctouted that Mr. Peltz had been the one to introduce Elon Musk to Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFor some context, Peltz is a billionaire activist investor who recently credited himself with connecting the richest man in the world with the president, calling himself \u201ca matchmaker.\u201d Musk later became Trump\u2019s billionaire backer throughout the election, was tapped to lead a special commission, and appears to have a continuing relationship with the president since the win. Nevertheless, the ice cream maker has been critical of Trump before, if you remember its \u201cPecan Resist\u201d flavor.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAccording to Mr. ter Kelve, despite four decades of progressive social activism\u2014and years of challenging the Trump administration\u2019s policies specifically\u2014criticizing Trump was now too taboo for the brand synonymous with \u2018Peace, Love, and Ice Cream,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit reads.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s and representatives for Peltz did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn a statement, Unilever said it \u201ccontinues to deny the meritless allegations in the amended complaint, which adds very little to the initial version\u2014and looks forward to presenting the facts in court. Those facts will show that Unilever has worked constructively with the Independent Social Mission Board over the past 24 years, and that we remain committed to Ben & Jerry\u2019s having a social mission.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cThe record will demonstrate that Unilever took reasonable steps and made concerted efforts to resolve issues with the Independent Social Mission Board. Unilever will continue working with the Independent Social Mission Board to find common ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is only one part of a yearslong battle. Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Unilever have been at odds since 2021 when Ben & Jerry\u2019s chose to stop selling its ice cream in occupied Palestinian territories. Unilever investors weren\u2019t happy, but the parent company eventually sold its ice cream segment there. Then, late last year, the independent board of Ben & Jerry\u2019s sued Unilever, accusing the company of silencing its support for Palestinians. That was the initial lawsuit, before this amended complaint.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The original lawsuit, filed in November , accused Unilever of stifling Ben & Jerry\u2019s efforts to advocate for Palestinian Arabs and criticize US military aid to Israel. The ice cream maker also claimed in the lawsuit that Unilever threatened the autonomy of its independent board.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s is seeking a court order to secure its board's ability to oversee its social mission and to compel Unilever to fulfill a commitment to make $25 million in payments to organizations selected by the ice cream company.\n\nThis dispute highlights ongoing friction between the Vermont-based ice cream brand and Unilever.\n\nThe conflict traces back to 2021, when Ben & Jerry's announced it would stop sales in Judea and Samaria and parts of eastern Jerusalem.\n\nThe announcement led to months of controversy and criticism, including multiple American states divesting from the firm, and Australia\u2019s kosher authority delisting the ice cream maker.\n\nIn July of 2022, Unilever announced that it had reached a new arrangement for Ben & Jerry\u2019s in Israel, selling its Ben & Jerry\u2019s business interests in Israel to Avi Zinger, the owner of American Quality Products Ltd (AQP), the current Israel-based licensee.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s then sued Unilever in a bid to block the sale of the Israeli business to Zinger. That lawsuit was settled in December of 2022.\n\nThe new lawsuit alleges Unilever violated the 2022 settlement terms, which remain private. According to the November filing, the agreement required Unilever to \"respect and acknowledge the Ben & Jerry's independent board's primary responsibility over Ben & Jerry's social mission.\"\n\nIn its amended complaint, Ben & Jerry\u2019s detailed how its management and board, with input from Unilever\u2019s global head of litigation, collaborated after Trump\u2019s election on a social media post intended for release on Inauguration Day. The post addressed contentious issues such as abortion, climate change, minimum wages, and universal healthcare. However, on January 18, two days before the inauguration, Unilever\u2019s ice cream chief, Peter ter Kulve, \u201cunilaterally barred Ben & Jerry\u2019s from issuing the post because it specifically mentioned \u2018Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d the complaint alleged.\n\nThe complaint further claimed that ter Kulve\u2019s decision appeared to be based on personal intuition rather than any company policy and disregarded Ben & Jerry\u2019s history of criticizing the Trump administration. Additionally, it noted that ter Kulve later hosted a town hall meeting where he highlighted how Unilever board member and activist investor Nelson Peltz, a Trump supporter, had introduced the president to Elon Musk.\n\nAccording to the complaint, ter Kulve argued that despite Ben & Jerry\u2019s decades of progressive activism, criticizing Trump had become \u201ctoo taboo for the brand synonymous with \u2018Peace, Love, and Ice Cream.\u2019\u201d",

It's gearing up to explore a similar path.\n\nAbout HUL\n\nHUL one of India's top FMCG companies, has been a driving force in shaping consumer lifestyles since its founding in 1933. Based in Mumbai, HUL operates as a subsidiary of Unilever PLC, which holds a 52.5% stake in the company.\n\nWith a presence in over 190 countries, HUL offers a wide range of trusted products under iconic brands such as Lux, Lifebuoy, and Dove. Known for its continuous focus on innovation, HUL has cemented its position as a household name in India and beyond.\n\nThe company operates across four key segments: Home Care, Personal Care, Foods and Refreshments, and Frozen Desserts.\n\nHUL Demerger\n\n#1 Demerger Approval\n\nHindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) has officially approved the demerger of its ice cream business into a separate listed entity, Kwality Wall's (India) Limited (KWIL).\n\nThis decision announced on 22 January 2025, marks a significant milestone in HUL's journey to streamline operations and unlock shareholder value.\n\nThe demerger had been under evaluation since September 2024, when HUL formed an Independent Committee to assess its feasibility. Based on the committee's recommendations, HUL's board gave its in-principle approval on 25 November 2024, setting the stage for this strategic move.\n\nOn 10 January 2025, HUL incorporated Kwality Wall's (India) Limited as a wholly owned subsidiary to facilitate the transition.\n\nThe announcement of the demerger coincided with HUL's Q3 FY25 results, signalling its commitment to delivering focused growth in its high-potential ice cream business.\n\n#2 Demerger Ratio\n\nThe company has proposed a 1:1 share allocation ratio, meaning that for every share held in HUL, shareholders will receive an equivalent share in Kwality Wall's (India) Limited.\n\nThis structure ensures proportional representation in the new entity and allows investors to participate in its growth journey as a standalone listed company.\n\n#3 Demerger Rationale\n\nThe rationale behind this strategic demerger lies in the distinct operational requirements of HUL's ice cream business. Unlike its core FMCG operations, the ice cream segment relies heavily on cold chain infrastructure and a unique distribution network.\n\nThese factors, combined with the global separation of Unilever's ice cream division, made the case for creating an independent entity.\n\nHUL's ice cream business, featuring renowned brands like Kwality Wall's, Cornetto, and Magnum, recorded a turnover of Rs 15.95 billion (bn) in FY24, contributing 2.7% to the company's total standalone revenue.\n\nBy demerging, HUL aims to unlock the full potential of this high-growth segment, enabling KWIL to focus on tailored strategies and capitalise on opportunities in the frozen desserts market.\n\nHUL CEO and MD Rohit Jawa emphasised that the move would unlock fair value for shareholders and ensure flexibility to stay invested in the ice cream business's growth journey.\n\n#4 Listing Plan\n\nHUL has confirmed that Kwality Wall's (India) Limited will be listed on both the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The listing is subject to requisite approvals from statutory and regulatory authorities.\n\nKWIL's primary focus will include the manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of ice creams, frozen desserts, and other frozen products, setting the stage for an independent operational and strategic roadmap.\n\n#5 What Does This Demerger Mean for Shareholders?\n\nHindustan Unilever's (HUL) decision to demerge its ice cream business into a standalone listed entity, Kwality Wall's (India) Limited (KWIL), is poised to unlock significant value for shareholders.\n\nThrough the demerger, the shareholders will receive a 1:1 share allocation in the new entity, ensuring proportional participation in the growth of Kwality Wall's (India) Limited.\n\nThe ice cream business, operating in a high-growth category with iconic brands, holds significant potential to generate value independently.\n\nA Close Look at the Financials\n\nFor December 2024 quarter, HUL reported a consolidated total income of Rs 160.5 billion (bn), 1.7% YoY high, compared to Rs 157.8 bn a year back.\n\nMeanwhile the net profit rose 19% YoY to Rs 29.8 bn, up from Rs 25.1 bn a year back.\n\nHUL's home care business grew by 5.3% during the quarter, while its food business posted a marginal growth of 0.5% YoY.\n\nHowever, the beauty segment recorded a 1.5% growth, while the personal care segment saw a 3% decline compared to the year-ago period.\n\nThe company, which derives approximately 60% of its overall sales from urban markets, noted a subdued urban demand despite some revival in rural demand.\n\nFor the FY24 the company reported revenue at Rs 4618,960 million (m), up 2.2% YoY. Meanwhile it reported marginal growth in net profit to Rs 102,820 m.\n\nHUL's Financial Snapshot (FY22-24)\n\n(Rs m, Consolidated) FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 Revenue 397,830 470,280 524,460 605,800 618,960 Revenue Growth (%) 1.2 18.2 11.5 15.5 2.2 Net Profit 67,640 80,000 88,870 101,430 102,820 Net Profit Margin (%) 17 17 16.9 16.7 16.6 Return on Equity (%) 82.3 16.8 18.11 20.2 20.1 Return on Capital Employed (%) 113.1 22.5 24.4 26.8 27.8\n\nSource: Equitymaster\n\nBetween 2020 to 2024, HUL's net sales have grown 9.5%, while the net profit has grown tremendously at a CAGR of 11.2%.\n\nThe average RoE and RoCE for the past five-year period have stood at 31.5% and 42.9%, respectively.\n\nRecent Development\n\n# Minimalist Acquisition\n\nAlongside the demerger, HUL has expanded its portfolio with the acquisition of a 90% stake in Minimalist, a beauty brand founded in 2020, for an enterprise value of Rs 29.6 bn.\n\nHUL plans to acquire the remaining stake within two years. Minimalist's annual revenue run rate exceeds Rs 5 bn.

You saw it with the audit firms that exited, local partners took over the practice. I was very pleased with that.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, Deloitte exited Zimbabwe, and its operations were taken over by Axcentium, a firm led by former Deloitte partners who cited the need for \u201cflexibility and agility\u201d in Zimbabwe\u2019s evolving market.\n\nPwC also left the market last year, with Vista Chartered Accountants taking its place.\n\nNot everyone shares Ncube\u2019s optimism about the exit of global accounting firms.\n\n\u201cWhen such a globally recognised institution exits a market, the ramifications are not just symbolic\u2014they are structural. It reflects systemic economic and governance issues and sends a loud message to both local and international stakeholders about the country\u2019s operating environment,\u201d says Brighton Musonza, an accountant and business commentator.\n\nRetailer Choppies announced its departure from Zimbabwe in December, citing the impact of Ncube\u2019s exchange rate policies which have decimated formal retail and boosted informal traders. Choppies sold its business Sai Mart, owned by Deputy Minister Raj Modi.\n\nNcube insists: \u201cIf you look at Choppies, a local investor is taking over the asset. We are not short of local investors who are ready to step in to replace some of these foreign investors.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ll make sure we step in to address some of the challenges that businesses face. We\u2019ll work on that to attract new investment and encourage expansion by those who are already on the ground.\u201d\n\nLast year, Unilever announced it would exit the country and use local distributors instead to sell its brands in Zimbabwe. This added to a list of other multinationals who have left the country.\n\nStandard Chartered last year sold its business to FBC Holdings for $24 million as it left Zimbabwe and several other markets around the world.\n\nHolcim disposed of its cement plant in Zimbabwe to Fossil in 2022 for $29.7 million. Nampak is currently in the process of selling its 51% stake in the country\u2019s biggest packaging business to TSL for $25 million.",

This large corporation is tackling plastic pollution head-on, using innovative technology to shift the culture of single-use plastic products.\n\n\"We have been collecting and processing more plastic than we sell in Bangladesh since 2022,\" Sabera Haque, category head at Unilever, said, per The Business Standard.\n\nProducts are routinely packaged in plastic that gets thrown out without a second thought when the product is finished.\n\nGlobally, only 9% of plastic waste gets recycled. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development found: \"50% ends up in landfill and 22% evade waste management systems and goes into uncontrolled dumpsites, is burned in open pits or ends up in terrestrial or aquatic environments.\"\n\nThough plastic is cheap to produce, we pay the price at every step of its life cycle.\n\nPlastic is made from dirty raw materials, including natural gas, crude oil, and coal. The production process typically involves dangerous extraction (mining and fracking) and high-heat processes that release harmful gases (carbon dioxide) and toxic substances (volatile organic compounds, or VOCs) into the air.\n\nTiny plastic pellets from plastic plants often leach into waterways, where they are eaten by wildlife, the Center for Biological Diversity found.\n\nReducing and recycling plastic waste disrupts the plastic production demand, triggering a domino effect of human-, wildlife-, and planet-health protection effects.\n\nScientists in South Korea have found a way to decompose PET plastic, ensuring effective plastic recycling. German scientists have developed an innovative method to identify plastic among e-waste.\n\nUnilever Bangladesh aims to significantly reduce plastic waste by encouraging consumers to bring their own bottles to URefill machines to purchase products.\n\nEach refill, Unilever Bangladesh found, cuts consumers' carbon footprint by 90% while saving consumers at least 20% on the cost of goods, according to Yahoo Finance. Bangladeshi consumers are finding URefill machines to be an easy and attractive way to save money, with approximately 43% of the users so far being returning customers, The Business Standard reported.\n\n\"We are scaling up our initiative and rolling out more machines in the coming months to meet the growing interest of consumers and retail shops,\" Unilever Bangladesh Homecare marketing director Shadman Sadikin said, per Yahoo Finance.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

FILE PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s accuses Unilever of muzzling it because of Trump\n\nNEW YORK - Ben & Jerry\u2019s on Jan 24 ratcheted up its censorship lawsuit against Unilever, accusing its parent company of suppressing a social policy statement the US ice cream maker wanted to release because it mentioned President Donald Trump.\n\nThe allegation came in an amended complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, where Ben & Jerry\u2019s in November accused Unilever of silencing its attempts to express support for Palestinian refugees and end military aid to Israel, and threatening to dismantle its independent board.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s wants a court order freeing the board to continue oversight of its social mission, and requiring Unilever to honor its commitment to make US$25 million (S$34 million) of payments to groups chosen by the ice cream company.\n\nUnilever and Ben & Jerry\u2019s did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth companies have been publicly at odds since 2021 when Ben & Jerry\u2019s decided to stop selling Cherry Garcia, Chubby Hubby and other ice cream flavors in the Israeli-occupied West Bank because it was inconsistent with the company\u2019s values.\n\nThat led some investors to divest Unilever shares, and Ben & Jerry\u2019s to sue its parent for selling its Israeli business to a local licensee.\n\nA settlement in 2022 required Unilever to respect Ben & Jerry\u2019s independent board and social mission, as well as make the US$25 million of payments.\n\nLondon-based Unilever since then announced plans to spin out its ice cream business, including Ben & Jerry\u2019s, to simplify its product portfolio and cut costs. The lawsuit, however, could complicate those plans.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help it, because anytime you have a cloud over it, it makes it harder to either sell it or spin it out. It affects folks\u2019 interpretation of its value,\u201d said retired University of Delaware law professor Charles Elson who is also a corporate governance expert.\n\nDonald Trump, Nelson Peltz and Elon Musk\n\nIn the amended complaint, Ben & Jerry\u2019s said its management and board, with input from Unilever\u2019s global head of litigation, worked after Mr Trump\u2019s election on a post to be released on Inauguration Day, discussing hot-button issues such as abortion, climate change, minimum wages and universal healthcare.\n\nBut on Jan 18, two days before Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration, Unilever ice cream chief Peter ter Kulve \u201cunilaterally barred Ben & Jerry\u2019s from issuing the post because it specifically mentioned \u2018Donald Trump\u2019\u201d, the complaint said.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s said Mr ter Kulve appeared to base his decision on intuition, while ignoring the company\u2019s history of challenging the Trump administration.\n\nIt also said Mr ter Kulve soon held a town hall meeting where he touted how Unilever board member and activist investor Nelson Peltz, a Trump supporter, had introduced the president to Mr Elon Musk, the Tesla founder and close Trump adviser.\n\nThe complaint said that according to Mr ter Kulve, \u201cdespite four decades of progressive social activism \u2013 and years of challenging the Trump administration\u2019s policies specifically \u2013 criticising Trump was now too taboo for the brand synonymous with Peace, Love and Ice Cream\u201d.\n\nMany companies in retail, banking and other sectors have curtailed support in January for programs whose perceived social impact has drawn opposition from Mr Trump and his supporters.\n\nResistance to payments\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s was founded by Mr Ben Cohen and Mr Jerry Greenfield in a renovated gas station in 1978, and kept its socially-conscious mission after Unilever bought it in 2000.\n\nAccording to the amended complaint, Ben & Jerry\u2019s planned to direct US$5 million from Unilever to human rights groups, and US$20 million over 10 years to support Palestinian almond farmers and a fair trade almond supplier it had long used.\n\nIt said Unilever opposed the US$5 million of payments because it believed they would support \u201cPalestinian human rights\u201d, and has not made the second US$2.5 million installment.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s also said Mr ter Kulve resisted the US$20 million payment because he disliked the 2022 settlement and had not heard of the almond supplier.\n\nUnilever plans to spin out its ice cream business in 2025 to simplify its product portfolio and cut costs.\n\nIts dozens of other products include Dove soap, Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, Knorr bouillon cubes, Surf detergent and Vaseline petroleum jelly.

            "content": "As you might know, Hindustan Unilever Limited ( ) recently reported its third-quarter numbers. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of \u20b9158b and statutory earnings per share of \u20b943.74. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Hindustan Unilever after the latest results.\n\nAfter the latest results, the 24 analysts covering Hindustan Unilever are now predicting revenues of \u20b9662.0b in 2026. If met, this would reflect a satisfactory 5.6% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 5.5% to \u20b948.23. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of \u20b9694.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of \u20b950.60 in 2026. It's pretty clear that pessimism has reared its head after the latest results, leading to a weaker revenue outlook and a small dip in earnings per share estimates.\n\nIt'll come as no surprise then, to learn that the analysts have cut their price target 7.0% to \u20b92,640. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Hindustan Unilever analyst has a price target of \u20b93,225 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at \u20b91,924. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same are performing. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Hindustan Unilever's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2026 expected to display 4.5% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 10.0% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 7.6% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Hindustan Unilever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target fell measurably, with the analysts seemingly not reassured by the latest results, leading to a lower estimate of Hindustan Unilever's future valuation.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Hindustan Unilever analysts - going out to 2027, and you can\n\nWe don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find that you need to be mindful of.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

View past columns in the archives here.\n\n\u201cGet ready with me\u201d videos have become a social media staple and a frequent tactic of marketers spanning cosmetics, grooming and fashion brands, including the likes of E.l.f., True Religion and Dr. Squatch. But what about the night after getting ready, when the makeup goes down the drain, the clothes go in the laundry and all that\u2019s left are memories of the evening?\n\nThat is the focus of Dove\u2019s new global campaign, \u201cUnready for Anything,\u201d in support of its Beauty Bar product. Created by Ogilvy New York and Ogilvy UK, the effort is the latest output from a decades-long relationship between agency and brand dating back to David Ogilvy\u2019s original work on the Beauty Bar for its 1957 launch.\n\n\u201cUnready for Anything,\u201d which will run as out-of-home activations and in digital, social media and print channels, comes to life as a single close-up image of the Dove Beauty Bar on a bathroom tile, covered in suds and detritus related to specific holidays.\n\nWhile the Unilever brand has been an Ogilvy client for many years, the agency has usually focused on brand work like the \u201cReal Beauty Sketches\u201d and \u201cDove Evolution\u201d campaigns, not product work like this time around. The process kicked off from a simple brief from the brand: How can you make the Dove Beauty Bar iconic?\n\nBorderless creativity\n\nFor Ogilvy, which seeks \u201cborderless creativity\u201d from across its global network, the brief led to more than 600 ideas from around the world. The regional leads whittled down a list of 200 finalists to the winning idea, which was submitted by the New York office and selected because of its simplicity.\n\nBehind the scenes at the \u201cUnready for Anything\u201d shoot Courtesy of Dove\n\nTo capture the bar\u2019s iconicity, Ogilvy set rules for the campaign: it would shoot the bar as a portrait \u2014 not a product \u2014 and do it practically, no matter how \u201ctempting\u201d it would be to use artificial intelligence (AI) and other computer-generated imagery.\n\n\u201cAn idea is only great if it looks great,\u201d said Rafael Rizuto, Ogilvy\u2019s chief creative officer for North America and an art director by trade.\n\nThe campaign launched at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve with a Beauty Bar surrounded by the glittery decorations of New Year's celebrations, with a 3:22 a.m. time stamp. The yearlong campaign includes a suite of executions, including ones around St. Patrick\u2019s Day, Cinco de Mayo and Pride Month.\n\nBy focusing on the bar, the campaign trusts customers to use their imagination about what transpired on each holiday. As an explanation, Rizuto paraphrased a famous quote by David Ogilvy: \u201cDon't treat the consumer as an idiot. [They\u2019re] your wife or your husband.\u201d\n\nInfluencers and inclusivity\n\nAlong with the portraits in print and OOH, \u201cUnready for Anything\u201d includes a social campaign that features influencers showing off their \u201cget unready with me\u201d routines by posting their own Beauty Bar photos. In that way, the creative and the influencer content are more connected than other campaigns where influencer elements often feel tacked on, even if the content doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like \u201cmatching luggage\u201d across channels.\n\n\u201cWe need to think about the right creative for the right mediums,\u201d Rizuto said. \u201cOur social is how we interact with the influencers and now how they shoot. We are not retouching it. We are using the way they do it.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Dove\n\nThe product focus is also a shift for Dove, which has become known for leading the way on purpose-driven brand work, like its long-running \u201cReal Beauty\u201d platform. But by making the bar the hero of the creative and not a person, the ad is in some ways more inclusive: The Beauty Bar is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n\u201cIt tells a story without showing any person,\u201d Rizuto said. \u201cIt\u2019s putting the bar at the center of everything, so you can tell an entire story \u2014 what that woman did the night before \u2014 by just showing the soap.\u201d",

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 71% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Unilever.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Unilever\n\nLSE:ULVR Ownership Breakdown January 23rd 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Unilever?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Unilever. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Unilever's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nLSE:ULVR Earnings and Revenue Growth January 23rd 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Unilever. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.3% and 2.5% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Unilever Plc is cutting the fat \u2014 in every sense. Chief Executive Officer Hein Schumacher plans to spin off its ice-cream business, including the Magnum and Ben & Jerry\u2019s brands, to focus on higher growth categories such as premium beauty.\n\nIt\u2019s the right thing to do. But Schumacher, who\u2019s been in charge since July, shouldn\u2019t end his restructuring there, nor can he afford any slip-ups in the underlying performance of the consumer giant.\n\nAfter underwhelming investors with his strategic vision last October, Schumacher has quietly set about streamlining the portfolio. In December, he sold a collection of brands including Q-Tips and Timotei shampoo for an undisclosed sum.\n\nOn Tuesday, Schumacher said the company would separate its ice-cream division, which generated sales of \u20ac7.9 billion ($8.5 billion) last year. While the unit has some muscular brands, it\u2019s struggled since the pandemic disrupted restaurant visits and holidays, and is also suffering amid unpredictable weather. The business expanded sales by 2.3% last year, compared with more than 8% for beauty and well-being and personal care.\n\nA deal would also rid Unilever of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, which has become something of a headache in recent years because of its semi-independence from its parent.\n\nUnilever said a demerger was the most likely route to separation. But by announcing a spinoff, the company has in effect put the unit up for sale. Private equity is already involved in the category, so it would be a natural buyer. Rival Nestle SA\u2019s ice-cream business is owned through a joint venture with PAI Partners.\n\nUnilever\u2019s ice-cream operations would be a sizable bite, though. They\u2019re expected to generate underlying operating profit of \u20ac929.9 million this year, according to the Bloomberg consensus of analysts estimates, which could mean earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about \u20ac1.4 billion. Putting this on a peer multiple of 12 times would mean an enterprise value of about \u20ac17 billion.\n\nOne of the problems with separating Unilever\u2019s food businesses has been the extra costs involved, as benefits of scale are lost. But Schumacher is addressing this through a plan to save \u20ac800 million over the next three years, by cutting 7.500 jobs. This should help to solve the problem of so-called stranded costs.\n\nBut Schumacher shouldn\u2019t stop at ice cream. Unilever still has some food brands, including Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Knorr stock cubes, which look increasingly at odds with its beauty and personal care focus. Homecare is also slow growing, while even some parts of the personal care arm, such as toothpaste, may benefit from pruning. Some recent acquisitions, such as Smartypants vitamins and Murad skincare, are also not performing.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the CEO has upped his medium-term sales growth target, from 3% to 5% to mid-single digits, once the separation is complete. True, ice-cream is growing more slowly, so eliminating the unit will automatically elevate revenue expansion. Meanwhile, the cost-saving plan should help to make Unilever less cumbersome in the way it operates. He has also pledged to modestly boost margins.\n\nBut increasing the guidance risks making Schumacher a hostage to fortune. The previous target was roughly in line with peers and gave him scope to outperform. That wiggle room is now gone.\n\nAfter under-promising on the portfolio in October, Schumacher has already over-delivered. Now he must do the same when it comes to not just juggling the businesses Unilever owns, but how much Dove self-tan and Hourglass lipstick it can actually sell.\n\nMore from this writer at Bloomberg Opinion:\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nAndrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering consumer goods and the retail industry.

Speaking in a post-earnings call, Jawa emphasized that the company continues to see a trend toward premiumization, fueled by evolving consumer aspirations and needs, which has partially offset some of the negative effects of product mix shifts.\n\nCurrently, the affluent segment of the beauty market accounts for approximately 50 percent of total sales and is expanding at twice the rate of the broader beauty sector. Despite this, India\u2019s per capita expenditure on beauty remains significantly lower than in many other markets, signaling substantial potential for growth in premium categories, Jawa noted.\n\nIn line with this strategy, HUL has announced the acquisition of a 90.5 percent stake in the skincare brand Minimalist for Rs 2,955 crore. This acquisition, conducted through secondary transactions, sees HUL buying out the stake from existing investors, including Peak XV Partners. The remaining 9.5 percent will be acquired from the company\u2019s founders over the next two years, according to HUL\u2019s statement.\n\nFor the quarter ending December 31, 2024, HUL\u2019s beauty and wellness division experienced modest growth of 1 percent year-on-year, a result impacted by delayed winter weather. In contrast, haircare delivered mid-single-digit volume growth, driven by strong performance across sachets and emerging formats. \"Within the sachet segment, premium shampoo sachets are outpacing their mass-market counterparts, further highlighting the ongoing shift toward premiumization,\" Jawa explained.",

It\u2019s a critical factor.\n\nOur ice cream supply chain spans 60 countries and 35 factory production lines. In regions where ice cream sales are highly seasonable, consumer demand is significantly influenced by weather conditions. In a European summer month like June, even a 1\u00b0C rise in temperature can substantially impact sales forecasts.\n\nGiven this variability, Unilever\u2019s AI and supply chain systems have become more agile to address fluctuations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to ensure Ice Cream\u2019s end-to-end supply chain \u2013 from our factory production lines to our estimated 3 million ice cream freezer cabinets \u2013 is prepared to respond to fast-changing weather patterns,\u201d Elif says.\n\nEnhancing production planning to meet market needs\n\nTeams are using AI and digital tools to analyse data insights, including weather inputs, to provide more accurate volume forecasts. In Sweden, for example, forecast accuracy has improved by 10%.\n\nHaving a more precise understanding of the expected sales for our ice cream brands each month means production lines can be adjusted and costs reduced accordingly.\n\n\u201cUsing AI we understand where to sell; how much we are going to sell; in which cabinet we are going to sell; and when and where to send our orders in the most efficient way,\u201d Elif says.\n\n\u201cThanks to forecasting process improvement, our service has increased while costs have been optimised. All of which has contributed to our overall service level to consumers increasing to world-class levels. We\u2019re in the top tier in most of our markets,\u201d Elif adds.\n\nEnsuring an agile response to changing weather patterns\n\nIce Cream\u2019s production volumes depend on prebuilt forecasts developed at the beginning of the year. Now AI can provide the team with probabilities for temperature ranges that more accurately predict demand in key markets.\n\nThis ensures long-term plans and volumes are in place for any potential changes in weather conditions.\n\nIn the shorter term, if there is an unexpected heatwave in one of our markets, our inventory systems enable us to identify available stock locations and reallocate key products to meet any increase in demand.\n\nWe also optimise route plans to ensure our refrigerated fleet delivers our products in ways that reduce energy use too.",

The deal is expected to close in the June quarter, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe announcement confirms TechCrunch\u2019s report from earlier this month.\n\nThe deal gives Unilever\u2019s Indian unit a stronger foothold in the premium beauty segment, adding to its portfolio of brands like Dove, Pond\u2019s, and Lakm\u00e9. Minimalist, known for its actives-led skincare products, reported annual revenue run rate of over \u20b95 billion and has been profitable since inception.\n\nMinimalist has built a strong presence in e-commerce, which Hindustan Unilever plans to complement by expanding the brand\u2019s offline distribution using its extensive retail network.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mohit Yadav and Rahul Yadav, Jaipur-based Minimalist sells a range of products, from sunscreens to hair-repair serums. The startup had previously attracted investment from Unilever Ventures in its Series A round in 2021. Peak XV was its first institutional investor, leading the seed funding in the startup through its Surge platform in late 2019. Minimalist was one of the earliest startups in the Surge portfolio.\n\nThe acquisition follows Hindustan Unilever\u2019s expansion into health and well-being through acquisitions of Oziva and Wellbeing Nutrition last year.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition is another key step to grow our Beauty & Wellbeing portfolio in the high growth masstige beauty segment,\u201d Rohit Jawa, CEO of Hindustan Unilever, said in a statement.\n\nMinimalist\u2019s founders will continue to run the business for two years after the deal closes.\n\nThe deal values Minimalist higher than the roughly $300 million valuation it reportedly sought when attempting to raise venture capital in the second half of last year, according to previous media reports.",

            "content": "News\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s accuses Unilever of breaching merger agreement\n\nThere is a chill wind blowing through the ice-cream aisles after Ben & Jerry\u2019s sued its parent company Unilever, which also owns Wall\u2019s and Magnum.\n\nThe complaint, filed in November in federal court in New York, alleges that Unilever blocked Ben & Jerry\u2019s attempts to voice support for peace and a cease fire in Gaza, for student voices on campus supporting basic human rights, and for safe passage of refugees from Gaza, among other things.\n\n\u00a9 AdobeStock/Electric Egg Ltd\n\n\u201cUnilever has repeatedly failed to recognise and respect the Independent Board\u2019s primary responsibility over Ben & Jerry\u2019s social mission and brand integrity, including threatening Ben & Jerry\u2019s personnel should the company speak regarding issues which Unilever prefers to censor,\u201d reads the lawsuit filed by lawyers at Houston-based AZA.\n\nAZA lawyer Shahmeer Halepota said Unilever \u201chas blocked Ben & Jerry\u2019s statements, threatened to dismantle the board and sue its members, intimidated employees, and blocked charitable donations, including to organisations like Jewish Voice for Peace\u201d. The litigation has been initiated to \u201cprotect Ben & Jerry\u2019s three-part mission from Unilever\u2019s unilateral erosion and to safeguard the company from Unilever\u2019s repeated overreaches\u201d, reads the lawsuit.\n\nThe document also highlights that social justice and human rights have been \u201ccore\u201d to the Ben & Jerry\u2019s brand, which was bought by Unilever in 2000. The company has taken public progressive stances on issues such as migrant justice, LGBTQ+ rights, Black Lives Matter, GMO labelling and a variety of other economic and social causes affecting historically marginalized communities.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s long history of activism\n\nIn an interview with Harvard Business Review (HBR) in 2021 to explain its reaction to the murder of George Floyd by police in 2020 and the ensuing Black Lives Matter protests (\u201cWe must dismantle white supremacy\u201d was the statement\u2019s headline), the company\u2019s activism manager Christopher Miller explained that \u201cWe do make a great ice cream. But what drives the loyalty and love for this brand are the things that we believe.\u201d\n\nMiller added: \u201cWe have this ongoing body of activism and advocacy that are rooted in our values. We have a team of social mission folks with an NGO or policy background paired with a world-class marketing team that knows how to connect with our fans and sell ideas. So, when things happen, we have this privilege, power, and ability to communicate.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how much the parent company, Unilever, got involved, he said \u201cnot a lot\u201d, with the sales agreement having a certain level of independence \u201cbaked in\u201d, including through the independent board of directors that Miller sits on.\n\nThis seems to be eroding. During the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Ben & Jerry\u2019s has \u201con four occasions attempted to publicly speak out in support of peace and human rights\u201d, reads the November lawsuit. \u201cDespite its contractual commitment to \u2018[r]espect and acknowledge\u2019 the Independent Board\u2019s primary responsibility over Ben & Jerry\u2019s social mission and essential brand integrity, Unilever has silenced each of these efforts.\u201d\n\nScuffles between brand and parent company\n\nUnilever\u2019s spokespeople have rejected the claims being made and have said the company will \u201cdefend our case very strongly\u201d.\n\nThis is the latest legal spat between the two. The ice-cream maker for example sued its parent company in 2022, again for breaching their merger agreement. In July 2021 Ben & Jerry\u2019s announced it would be ending sales of its products in Israeli-only settlements on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. But a year later, Unilever announced that it had sold Ben & Jerry\u2019s intellectual property in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory to a distributor who would continue sales in the settlements; this was done without consultation with or consent from the Independent Board, according to litigation that was launched within days of the news breaking in June 2022.\n\nIn December 2022, Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Unilever ultimately entered into a settlement agreement, which was expressly conditioned on Unilever respecting the Independent Board\u2019s authority over Ben & Jerry\u2019s social mission and brand integrity. These are the contractual obligations that have been breached according to the new November 2024 lawsuit.\n\n\u201cUnilever\u2019s feigned neutrality is contradicted by its donations to other organisations as well as its partisan stances in conflicts such as Russia/Ukraine,\u201d said AZA\u2019s Halepota. Ben & Jerry\u2019s has asked the court to enforce the original 2020 merger agreement and the 2022 settlement.\n\nIce-cream sales go soft for Unilever\n\nThe legal challenge comes amid speculation over the future of Unilever\u2019s ice-cream business. Last year there were reports of approaches to private equity firms to gauge interest in brands including Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Magnum. These plans have, according to a November report in the Financial Times, been abandoned.\n\nThose familiar with the process told the FT that \u201cthe size and complexity of a potential deal was a major obstacle\u201d, as were factors such as performance, logistics, and the recent stance by Ben & Jerry\u2019s founders over the conflict in Gaza.\n\nIn its financial results for the first half of 2024, Unilever said performance in its ice-cream business \u201cremains below our ambition\u201d having been impacted by a \u201csoft start\u201d to the European key season and \u201cchallenging market dynamics\u201d in China. Volumes and prices for in-home ice-cream were flat, while out-of-home grew low single digit driven by price.\n\nWall\u2019s grew mid-single digit with positive volume and price; Ben & Jerry\u2019s was slightly up, while sales of Cornetto were adversely affected by the decline in China. Magnum launched its new \u2018Pleasure Express\u2019 range with three variants: Euphoria, Wonder and Chill.\n\nUnilever said: \u201cIce-cream continues to focus on operational improvements, including service and optimising promotions, while continuing to drive investment behind our brands and innovations.\u201d",

The announcement that the European Commission will bring forward an \u201comnibus\u201d initiative that could include revisiting existing legislation risks undermining both of these.\u201d\n\nThe signatories noted particular concern about potentially reopening the CSDDD regulation. Setting mandatory obligations for large companies to address their negative impacts on human rights and the environment across their value chains, the CSDDD was adopted in May 2024, after a long process that ultimately required revisions in the legislation that significantly scaled back the number of companies covered by the law, and extended the timeline to its full implementation.\n\nThe letter highlighted the potential for the new laws to \u201cdrive long term resilience and value for European businesses in support of competitive advantage,\u201d and the need for \u201cconsistency, clarity and confidence in their application,\u201d in order to meet these goal.\n\nThe letter concluded:",

In an exclusive interview with ETHRWorld Southeast Asia, Anser Aly , Head of Global Learning & Leadership Development Centre at Unilever, shared his vision for this transformation.Anser predicts a future where traditional roles and job titles give way to a dynamic, skills-based economy. Leaders will define their success through adaptability and purpose, thriving in a flexible gig environment while aligning employees\u2019 aspirations with organisational goals to drive motivation and impact.He emphasised that functional competence alone is no longer sufficient. Leadership will evolve into a teachable, measurable skill set, becoming central to succession, retention, and hiring decisions.For HR leaders, Anser stressed the importance of developing leadership skills alongside functional expertise, fostering purpose-driven work, and maintaining a balance between empathy and delivering results. This transformation shouldn\u2019t be about adapting but thriving in a world where skills and purpose are the new currency of success.Here are the excerpts from the interview:For younger leaders it\u2019s. Knowing that they will make it eventually, that nothing is beyond them provided they persist and progress with care. HR leaders can help by offering clarity on career path, career development and solid leadership development training opportunities.For senior leaders it\u2019s. Knowing the impact that they have. Realising how every small word, gesture or body language can impact many down the line. To combine empathy and compassion while driving business results. HR leaders can help by showing them the mirror, encouraging and facilitating a culture of 360 feedback and employer surveys, keeping them connected to the \u2018sounds from the ground\u2019 and ensuring opportunities to engage regularly with colleagues from across levels in the organisation.If you get the culture right, more than half the battle is won! That\u2019s because cultural nuances can vary, not only across geographies but also across genders, generations, functions and demographics. Recognising these could be a huge enabler or a challenge if ignored or missed.Have nomination invites for courses and trainings sent by Line Managers and Senior Leaders for better traction in cultures where personal development is not considered a personal priorityAdditionally, cultural differences in communication styles and conflict resolution can significantly impact leadership effectiveness. In Western cultures, open debate and constructive criticism are often encouraged as a means of fostering critical thinking, innovation, and growth. In contrast, many Asian cultures prioritise saving face and maintaining social harmony, which can lead to a more reserved and polite communication style.By being sensitive to these cultural differences and adapting their leadership style accordingly, we try to design leadership programmes that build stronger relationships, foster trust, and drive success in Asian cultures.That\u2019s precisely where we go wrong. As HR professionals we do not need to orchestrate every last move. Some things are best left to organically and naturally happen. The magic with helping employees find their personal purpose is that what follows is natural and happens organically.Once employees discover their purpose, they will automatically find an angle of the organisational goals that resonate and align with them. They will naturally gravitate to what holds meaning to them.In some cases where they realise a massive misalignment, they may want to distance themselves and in extreme cases decide to part ways after realising that they are in the wrong organisation. We should be ready for that because there is no point in forcing an unnatural alliance and also it may serve as a great way to weed out dead weight from the organisation, typically these are those people who may not be performing best and now we (and they!) know why.HR Leaders can help by being clear on the metrics for success & making them measurable. Single dimensional success, purely focussing on performance alone cannot be sustainable. It has to come along with (and not at the cost of) well-being and personal growth.The challenge with the latter is that it\u2019s not measurable and hence often gets side stepped, whereas performance typically is. What we need is the measurement of holistic performance that covers business results, team well-being and personal growth for all individuals.OKRs and goals need to be holistic and also contain metrics for well-being and personal growth. So leaders need to have targets that contain all three. We need a shift from single to multi-dimensional success metrics where results need to come not at the cost of team wellbeing but in harmony with it!HR Leaders must focus on laying equal emphasis on leadership skills and functional skills development. Additionally, to incorporate the balance between empathy and compassion and driving results.Above all, the single silver bullet that addresses all HR woes is purpose. Help current employees discover their personal purpose. Asking prospective employees how joining the company or the particular role will help them live their purpose will be very revealing and also ensure the right fit.If you can match the right purpose-driven employees with the roles that help them live their purpose, you won\u2019t need any other engagement tools to artificially engage employees. Also, the connection will be deeper, more sustainable and more resilient in times of change and uncertainty.",

            "content": "Image source: Getty Images\n\nLike drinking water, writing a to-do list, and staying off social media, some of the best ideas are pretty straightforward. And that might also be the case when it comes to earning passive income.\n\nDespite the FTSE 100 hitting record levels, shares in Unilever (LSE:ULVR) are almost 10% off their 52-week high. So should investors stop overthinking things and start buying the stock?\n\nUnilever\u2019s business\n\nInvestors who don\u2019t read the label on everything they buy are probably familiar with more Unilever products than they can name. But the business is actually in the process of shifting its strategy. It\u2019s moving from trying to infiltrate people\u2019s cupboards by owning every branded product under the sun to focusing on its strongest names. These include the likes of Domestos, Dove, and Persil.\n\nDivested lines include Alberto Balsam (which I like), Brylcreem (which I don\u2019t), and Lever 2000 (which I\u2019ve never heard of). And it\u2019s also selling its ice cream unit, which includes Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Magnum.\n\nDespite the shift, the underlying business model\u2019s still familiar. The firm\u2019s brands give it negotiating power with retailers and its distribution network helps it position its products all across the globe.\n\nDividends\n\nUnless something truly desperate happens, I don\u2019t think demand for the kind of products Unilever sells is going to drop dramatically. And the company\u2019s in a strong competitive position.\n\nInvestors might therefore see the recent drop in the share price as a potential buying opportunity. The dividend yield\u2018s around 3.2%, which doesn\u2019t look like much but that could change if interest rates fall. This is roughly in line with the stock\u2019s 10-year average. But Unilever\u2019s portfolio adjustments have resulted in good sales growth, so I think there\u2019s a decent chance of the dividend increasing from here.\n\nI think investors looking for passive income might do well to consider shares in a company that has recognisable strengths. Especially when it might have a bright future.\n\nRisks\n\nUnilever\u2019s a long way from the cutting edge of technological innovation. But there are still some key risks that investors considering the stock should be aware of. One of the firm\u2019s biggest challenges is its products typically have zero switching costs. People don\u2019t have to buy Dove soap because it\u2019s the only one that\u2019s compatible with their bathroom sink.\n\nAs a result, there\u2019s always a risk of customers trading down to cheaper store brands \u2013 or across to Procter & Gamble products. That means an ongoing battle for market share, where nothing\u2019s certain.",

            "content": "Ben & Jerry\u2019s ratcheted up its censorship lawsuit against Unilever on Friday, accusing its parent company of suppressing a social policy statement the U.S. ice cream maker wanted to release because it mentioned President Donald Trump.\n\nThe allegation came in an amended complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, where Ben & Jerry\u2019s in November accused Unilever of silencing its attempts to express support for Palestinian refugees and end military aid to Israel, and threatening to dismantle its independent board.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s wants a court order freeing the board to continue oversight of its social mission, and requiring Unilever to honor its commitment to make $25 million of payments to groups chosen by the ice cream company.\n\nUnilever and Ben & Jerry\u2019s did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth companies have been publicly at odds since 2021 when Ben & Jerry\u2019s decided to stop selling Cherry Garcia, Chubby Hubby and other ice cream flavors in the Israeli-occupied West Bank because it was inconsistent with the company\u2019s values.\n\nThat led some investors to divest Unilever shares, and Ben & Jerry\u2019s to sue its parent for selling its Israeli business to a local licensee.\n\nA settlement in 2022 required Unilever to respect Ben & Jerry\u2019s independent board and social mission, as well as make the $25 million of payments.\n\nLondon-based Unilever since then announced plans to spin out its ice cream business, including Ben & Jerry\u2019s, to simplify its product portfolio and cut costs. The lawsuit, however, could complicate those plans.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help it, because anytime you have a cloud over it, it makes it harder to either sell it or spin it out. It affects folks\u2019 interpretation of its value,\u201d said Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware law professor and a corporate governance expert.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, NELSON PELTZ AND ELON MUSK\n\nIn the amended complaint, Ben & Jerry\u2019s said its management and board, with input from Unilever\u2019s global head of litigation, worked after Trump\u2019s election on a post to be released on Inauguration Day, discussing hot-button issues such as abortion, climate change, minimum wages and universal healthcare.\n\nBut on Jan. 18, two days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Unilever ice cream chief Peter ter Kulve \u201cunilaterally barred Ben & Jerry\u2019s from issuing the post because it specifically mentioned \u2018Donald Trump,'\u201d the complaint said.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s said ter Kulve appeared to base his decision on intuition, while ignoring the company\u2019s history of challenging the Trump administration.\n\nIt also said ter Kulve soon held a town hall meeting where he touted how Unilever board member and activist investor Nelson Peltz, a Trump supporter, had introduced the president to Elon Musk, the Tesla founder and close Trump adviser.\n\nThe complaint said that according to ter Kulve, \u201cdespite four decades of progressive social activism\u2013and years of challenging the Trump administration\u2019s policies specifically\u2013criticizing Trump was now too taboo for the brand synonymous with \u2018Peace, Love, and Ice Cream.'\u201d\n\nMany companies in retail, banking and other sectors have curtailed support this month for programs whose perceived social impact has drawn opposition from Trump and his supporters.\n\nRESISTANCE TO PAYMENTS\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in a renovated gas station in 1978, and kept its socially conscious mission after Unilever bought it in 2000.\n\nAccording to the amended complaint, Ben & Jerry\u2019s planned to direct $5 million from Unilever to human rights groups, and $20 million over 10 years to support Palestinian almond farmers and a fair trade almond supplier it had long used.\n\nIt said Unilever opposed the $5 million of payments because it believed they would support \u201cPalestinian human rights,\u201d and has not made the second $2.5 million installment.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s also said ter Kulve resisted the $20 million payment because he disliked the 2022 settlement and had not heard of the almond supplier.\n\nUnilever\u2019s dozens of other products include Dove soap, Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, Knorr bouillon cubes, Surf detergent and Vaseline petroleum jelly.",

This project represents another step towards Unilever\u2019s aim to convert to 100% renewable energy sources across its sites globally.\n\nThe project combines 1,672 solar panels from the two facilities to produce a total of 970kW, with an 810Kva inverter to support it. This system is anticipated to generate an outstanding 1.25 million kWh of electricity annually, fulfilling 33% of the facilities\u2019 energy needs. With this most recent installation, Unilever Sri Lanka\u2019s overall solar capacity including that of the Horana factory has increased to 4MW, further supporting the country\u2019s goal of generating 75% of the energy requirement from renewables by 2050.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Damith Abeyratne, Supply Chain Director, Unilever Sri Lanka said: \u201cAt Unilever Sri Lanka, sustainability is a priority. Our recent solar installations in Sapugaskanda are an important step in our efforts to lessen our impact on the environment and support the country\u2019s renewable energy targets. This project serves as a reminder of the private sector\u2019s vital role in contributing to form Sri Lanka\u2019s sustainable future.\u201d\n\nUnilever has an approved science-based target to achieve a 100% reduction in absolute Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, against a 2015 baseline. Achieving net zero emissions throughout its value chain by 2039 is one of Unilever\u2019s long-term ambitions. Focusing on pragmatic steps, sooner rather than later, the company has created a comprehensive Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) that applies globally, guiding its actions to reduce GHG emissions over the next few years.",

No. In fact, it does not even take one thousand pounds.\n\nHere is how someone who had not bought shares before could start investing with less this month.\n\nPrinciples of good investment\n\nAlthough it is possible to start investing with a few hundred pounds, that does not mean it is a good idea to plunge headlong into the stock market without understanding it.\n\nIn fact, that strikes me as a very bad idea \u2013 and a likely way to lose money. The point of investing is the opposite, trying to build not destroy wealth.\n\nSo I think it makes sense for the would-be investor to learn about how the stock market works and also some principles of good investing, like diversifying across different shares.\n\nSetting up a share-dealing account\n\nIt would also be necessary to set up a way to invest, such as share-dealing account or Stocks and Shares ISA. With lots of different options, it is worth spending time to make the best choice for individual circumstances.\n\nThere can be a lag between starting this process and having cash put into the account available to invest, so it seems smart to do this even before choosing particular shares to buy.\n\nHow to invest on a limited budget\n\nHaving less than \u00a31,000 to invest does mean that any beginner\u2019s mistakes would hopefully be less costly than with \u00a31k at stake.\n\nBut there are less attractive practical implications too. One is the potential for minimum fees to eat up a proportionately bigger amount of an ISA than if it had a larger sum (one reason why spending time finding the right ISA can be a good investment in itself).\n\nAnother is diversification. It is harder to spread, say, \u00a3800 across a range of shares than investing a larger amount. It is still possible though, and diversification is a sensible risk-reduction strategy for investors at all levels.\n\nErring towards simplicity, not complication\n\nWhen people start investing they can make the mistake of trying to find little-known companies in the hope they become huge. I say \u201cmistake\u201d because, although that strategy can sometimes work, it can also be an abysmal failure.\n\nMy own approach is to start with a product I understand, like soap powder, and then look for a business that has a sustainable competitive advantage in that field. Unilever (LSE: ULVR) is an example, thanks to its strong portfolio of premium brands and proprietary technology (another is Reckitt).\n\nI then consider the company\u2019s balance sheet to see how healthy its debt position is. I also consider risks. Based on all this, I make a judgment about whether I would like to own a stake in the company.",

The three-word slogan \u2018Mountain Cold Refreshment\u2019 had a misspelling. It read \u2018Mountain Cold Refershment.\"\n\nThe brand quickly issued a \"hilariously informal press release\" explaining that the team at Coors Light \"had a case of the Mondays,\" which interfered with their \"signature chill.\"\n\n\"With this humorous and relatable error, the campaign grabs the viewer's attention and prompts them to take a second glance,\" according to DesignRush. \"It has the traits of a viral marketing campaign, which often relies upon audience interest and engagement.\"\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nBut some social media users were not so laid back about the harmless error.\n\n\u201c'Coors, I think you need to turn on autocorrect! That misspelling of refreshment,' an Instagram user wrote,\u201d according to The Daily Mail. \u201cOthers joked that the beer brand's marketing team may have not been keeping to their Dry January promises when making the adverts because of the spelling mistake. 'Coors Light's refershed marketing team is getting ready to send some \u2018you up?\u2019 texts\u2026,' an Instagrammer wrote.\n\nOthers were more charitable. One Instagram user dubbed it \u201cMonday mountain madness.\u201d\u201cOthers called it 'great advertising' and forgave Coors Light for the advertisement error,\u201d per The Daily Mail.\n\n\u201c'I'm there with you fam! We all make mistakes. Cheers to that!,' an Instagram user wrote.\n\n\u201dCoors Light debuted the botched advertisement on social media platforms, as well as in print publications like The New York Times and Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail, and on big-city billboards this morning in the US - including in New York City's Times Square.The typo didn\u2019t seem to dampen investor confidence. \u201cMolson Coors Beverage Co. (TAP) shares rose about 2.5% in intraday trading Monday, even though they\u2019ve declined roughly 15% over the past year,\u201d notes Reel Chicago. \u201cThe beer giant has since embraced the error with good humor, ensuring fans that while the ads might have been a bit warmer than intended, their beer remains as cold as ever.\u201d",

The Doomdooma factory (DDF) will become Unilever\u2019s third plant in South Asia to receive this honour. Previously, the HUL\u2019s Dapada site received this recognition in 2022, followed by the Sonepat site in 2023.\n\nHUL stands out as the only company in India, with three factories in the country earning the Advanced 4IR End-to-End value chain Lighthouse recognition. The World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Lighthouse Network honours the most digitally advanced factories that transform operations, enhance efficiency, drive sustainable growth, and upskill their workforce. The Doomdooma site runs the 4IR technology in almost every process, with more than 50 initiatives currently in place across the end-to-end (E2E) supply chain.\n\nRohit Jawa, CEO and MD, Hindustan Unilever Limited, said, \u201cWe are proud of the Doomdooma site securing this prestigious recognition. By integrating advanced technologies, we have revolutionised our operations, significantly enhancing productivity and product quality. Such initiatives are not only beneficial to our business but also represent a significant step towards building a better future.\u201d\n\nYogesh Mishra, Executive Director, Supply Chain, HUL, said, \u201cThis recognition is a testament to our relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence and testifies to the increasing strengths of AI and digitisation. It underscores our unwavering commitment to leveraging these technologies to drive efficiency, sustainability, and growth across our operations. We are committed to demonstrating that innovation, sustainability, and workforce development can go hand in hand.\n\nWith an annual production capacity of +5.4 billion units and a team of 675, the DDF site, which is India\u2019s largest beauty & wellbeing manufacturing unit, produces over 130+ SKUs of beauty products, including Glow & Lovely, Pond\u2019s, Vaseline, Sunsilk, Clinic Plus, TRESemm\u00e9, and Dove. Operating in a remote region with limited resources, the site partnered with local institutes to create a skilled workforce and was able to implement 50+ digital use cases to improve end-to-end supply chain agility.\n\nHere are some of the key 4IR applications employed at the factory, which led to the Lighthouse recognition:\n\nBoosting e-commerce efficiency\n\nAn AI-powered vision system maps product features and detects anomalies in real time. This enables rapid one-click changeovers between products, reducing changeover times by 85%.\n\nUnmissable product superiority through data and insights\n\nGenerative AI-enabled consumer insights are used at the site to improve product quality swiftly. The site has achieved 97% accuracy in analysing consumer feedback, which helps in optimising operations.\n\nDynamic planning to meet real-time demand\n\nThe site uses an AI-enabled digital planning system, analysing over 10,000 product combinations to meet real-time demand, reducing the frozen period from 14 days to one, and improving product availability by 92%.\n\nEnabling sustainable packaging\n\nUsing a digital twin approach, the teams are able to create a digital replica of the machine, simulate and test operations virtually, leading to a 60% reduction in laminate plastic waste and a 21% reduction in virgin plastic use.\n\nEnhancing labour productivity\n\nAn in-house-developed AI-powered workforce allocation tool has boosted labour productivity at the site by nearly 400% by assigning staff to high-priority lines based on their skills and providing targeted training to address skill gaps.\n\n\u201cAcross our Global Lighthouse Network, digital technologies are revolutionizing production ecosystems,\u201d said Kiva Allgood, Head of the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, World Economic Forum. \u201cFrom AI-driven control towers to zero-code workflows, Lighthouses exemplify sustainable innovation, setting benchmarks millions can follow to drive transformational change across the entire ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 78th Foundation Day of Hoonlal Higher Secondary School observed in Doomdooma\n\nAlso Watch:",

Here's how to 'future fit' your micro enterprise with education and technology\n\nIn a country with over one million sari-sari stores, it can\u2019t be denied that these stores are deeply embedded in Filipino communities, acting as both economic and social hubs. However, the long-term sustainability of sari-sari stores faces various hurdles.\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 In every thriving Filipino barangay, one of the clearest signs of a vibrant community is the presence of a sari-sari store.\n\nThe humble, yet indispensable sari-sari stores serve as the lifeblood of neighborhoods, providing easy access to daily essentials, a place for quick conversations and most importantly, a livelihood for millions of Filipino families.\n\nSari-Sari stores in Filipino communities\n\nIn a country with over one million sari-sari stores, it can\u2019t be denied that these stores are deeply embedded in Filipino communities, acting as both economic and social hubs. They provide a wide range of products, from household essentials to quick snacks, catering to the daily needs of their neighbors.\n\nHowever, the long-term sustainability of sari-sari stores faces various hurdles.\n\nMany store owners, particularly those managing on a day-to-day basis, encounter challenges like fluctuating sales, limited access to inventory and a lack of business knowledge.\n\nThese obstacles hinder their ability to grow and adapt, especially in a fast-changing market increasingly shaped by technology.\n\nBelieving in the value of malasakit, and that small businesses as Sari-sari stores are key to achieving inclusive growth in the Philippines, Unilever Philippines launched Kabisig Summit, a community-centric approach, embodied in the summit\u2019s name\u2014Kabisig, or \u201carm-in-arm\u201d\u2014aims to build a network of store owners who support one another\u2019s growth.\n\nStrengthening sari-sari store owners\u2019 skills\n\nUnilever\u2019s Kabisig Summit is an innovative initiative designed to tackle the challenges faced by sari-sari store owners.\n\nLaunched in 2016, the summit equips store owners with essential training, tools and technology know-how to enhance their operations. Participants receive valuable education in business management, customer engagement and financial literacy\u2014skills critical for long-term growth.\n\nOne of the program's features is its accessibility. Trainings are conducted in locations close to the stores, minimizing the burden of having to leave their stores and losing a day\u2019s worth of income.\n\nInitially an in-person \"kalyeserye\" program, the Kabisig Summit has evolved to include online training options, ensuring that store owners nationwide can participate without leaving their shops unattended.\n\nSince its inception, the Kabisig Summit has empowered thousands of sari-sari store owners across the Philippines.\n\nUnilever reports that 91% of its participants are women. Store owners who have completed the program report increased earnings, enhanced business practices and greater confidence in managing their enterprises.\n\nPreparing for a future of growth\n\nThe pandemic underscored the need for small businesses to be resilient. In response, Unilever integrated modules on resilience and business continuity planning into the Kabisig Summit.\n\nOne of the most transformative aspects of the program is its focus on digitization. Through Unilever\u2019s digital platform, sari-sari store owners can be future-fit by learning how to manage their businesses more efficiently by digitizing orders, tracking inventory and processing payments.\n\nThe app allows for digitized order capture, enabling store owners to place orders anytime and anywhere, greatly improving convenience.\n\nIt also offers a variety of payment options, which streamlines transaction processing and boosts operational efficiency. An upcoming feature, Inventory Financing, aims to ensure that store owners have sufficient inventory on hand to meet customer demands.\n\nAdditionally, the app provides real-time updates on order status and delivery details, empowering sari-sari store owners to manage their orders more effectively.\n\nEmpowering entrepreneurs through Kabisig Summit\n\nMore than just a training program, the Kabisig Summit fosters a sense of community among participants.\n\nThis collaborative spirit has created a ripple effect of empowerment, with store owners gaining the confidence to grow their businesses and improve their livelihoods.\n\nAccording to Unilever, the success stories emerging from the program are numerous. From a commissioned study, 76% of the Kabisig\u2019s participants reported increased earnings and savings and 79% reported business growth.\n\nBut for Unilever, this is just the beginning.\n\nUnilever\u2019s commitment to supporting sari-sari stores is part of a broader sustainability agenda that aims to empower 2.5 million SMEs in its global retail value chain by 2026.\n\nIn the Philippines, this means ensuring that the backbone of the local economy\u2014sari-sari stores\u2014are equipped to thrive in the future.\n\n\u201cAt Unilever, we believe that empowering MSMEs is an equally important segment in our sustainability agenda,\u201d says Fredy Ong, Unilever Philippines chairman and CEO.\n\n\u201cThe Kabisig Summit is important and personal to me not only because I concurrently head our sales function, but because I am a testament to how a small business can change people\u2019s lives for the better,\u201d he reminisced, as someone who once worked helping in his family\u2019s humble retail business in a public market before joining Unilever.\n\nWhile Unilever continues to expand the Kabisig Summit, it remains focused on empowering store owners with the skills, resilience, and technology they need to succeed.\n\nIn doing so, the company is not just investing in individual livelihoods but contributing to the broader goal of inclusive economic growth for the Philippines.\n\nAs Ong puts it, \"The success of sari-sari stores is also the Filipino people\u2019s success.\"\n\nThe future of sari-sari stores may be digital, resilient and collaborative\u2014but at its heart, it will always be community-driven. And that\u2019s where the true strength of these small stores lies: in their ability to make a big impact on the lives of Filipinos.\n\nEditors Note: This #BrandSpace story is created with Unilever.

It\u2019s making a big impact in manufacturing too, increasing productivity, enhancing resilience and antifragility, reducing waste, improving resource planning \u2013 and much more.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Lighthouse Network recognises the most digitally advanced factories around the world. To meet the criteria, sites must show how they\u2019re using Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as AI, factory automation, cloud computing and the internet of things to transform their ways of working, and drive financial, operational and sustainability improvements.\n\nAt our Tinsukia site in India, 4IR technology runs almost every process, with more than 50 initiatives currently in place across the end-to-end supply chain. It\u2019s this progressive approach that\u2019s led to Tinsukia becoming the eighth Unilever factory to earn Lighthouse recognition.\n\nHere are five ways we\u2019ve scaled up AI to achieve exceptional performance at Tinsukia\n\nRapid changeovers for e-commerce readiness Our e-commerce business is growing fast, and to meet the increasing demand for quick delivery, we need to get our products made, shipped and ready for sale at a rapid pace. At Tinsukia, we\u2019ve implemented an AI-powered vision system which maps product features and identifies anomalies in real time, resulting in rapid one-click changeovers when a machine or line is switched from manufacturing one product to another. The move has made changeover times 85% faster. Unmissable product superiority through data and insights Tinsukia uses generative AI-enabled consumer insights to improve product quality swiftly. Using large language models, the site has achieved 97% accuracy in analysing consumer feedback and turning it into actions, faster than ever before. This has helped the factory achieve a 73% improvement in customer satisfaction scores, and a 21% improvement in reducing manufacturing defects. Boosting production and investing in people A new AI-powered workforce allocation tool has helped to improve labour productivity at Tinsukia by almost 400%. Developed in-house, the tool dynamically allocates the right people to high-priority production lines based on their skills and experience. It also identifies skills gaps and provides targeted training to upskill employees where needed. Swifter sustainable packaging trials through digital twin technology Across Unilever, we\u2019re aiming to reduce virgin plastic by 40% by 2028. AI is helping support that goal at the factory. Teams at Tinsukia have introduced an AI-enabled digital twin approach which is helping us trial more sustainable packaging options at pace and incorporate more recycled content into our packaging. By creating a digital replica of the site online, we can simulate, test and monitor operations virtually before implementing the most successful options in the real world. So far, this has resulted in a 21% reduction in virgin plastic used in our packaging at the site. We\u2019ve also cut the time it takes to run sustainable packaging trials by 84%, increasing the number of trials from two per year in 2019 to 30 in 2023. Dynamic planning to meet real-time demand More than 5.4 billion units a year are manufactured at Tinsukia, for brands including Dove, Vaseline and Pond\u2019s. In fact, it has the largest manufacturing capacity of all our Beauty & Wellbeing factories in South Asia. The site has introduced an AI-enabled digital planning ecosystem for ultra-rapid e-commerce delivery, which means we can now analyse more than 10,000 product combinations using over 300 features, acting on signals to ensure that production supply for these Unilever Power Brands meets real-time demand. As a result, the site has been able to achieve a 92% reduction in the frozen period (the time it takes for production line schedules to be planned and re-set) from 14 days to one, significantly improving our speed to market and market responsiveness.

The news was widely reported at Marca, the trade fair inaugurated this morning in Bologna, where Casalasco is the protagonist with a large stand.\n\nThe Cremona group, already owner of the Pom\u00ec, Pomito and De Rica brands, with an integrated supply chain based on 800 agricultural companies, 5 factories and 70 packaging lines, thus enriches its range with another addition that is well-known and appreciated by German consumers, strengthening its positioning in Germany, where it is already present with the Pomito brand.\n\nTomato al Gusto has been present on German shelves as a ready-made sauce line of the Knorr brand for over twenty years, positioned in the Premium range of tomato-based products, characterized by various recipes with vegetable ingredients up to the Carbonara version, all packaged in 370 and 500 gram bricks.\n\nFor a transitional period of 12 months from the transaction, Casalasco also obtains the right to use the Knorr brand exclusively in combination with this range of products.

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"United States Ice Cream Market by Flavor, Category, Packaging types, Distribution channel and Company Analysis 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nUnited States Ice Cream market is expected to reach US$ 25.49 billion by 2033 from US$ 18.27 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 3.77 % from 2025 to 2033\n\nOne major factor driving the U.S. ice cream business is the growing desire for artisanal and premium ice cream. Customers are increasingly looking for luxurious, premium goods with natural ingredients and inventive, one-of-a-kind flavors. Compared to mass-produced alternatives, artisanal ice cream provides a more individualized, genuine experience since it is frequently made in small batches with meticulous attention to quality.\n\nGrowing interest in gourmet cuisine, sustainability, and the desire for first-rate experiences are the main drivers of this change. Additionally, the desire for small-batch, handcrafted ice creams has increased as a result of the tendency toward indulgence and the exploration of novel, exotic tastes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. ice cream market is expanding thanks in large part to new product choices and inventive flavors. In an effort to appeal to intrepid customers, producers are always experimenting with novel, exotic flavors and inventive combinations. Ice cream companies are stretching the limits of conventional offers with flavors like matcha, tahini, and ube that are inspired by other cultures, as well as decadent pairings like salted caramel and bourbon vanilla.\n\nAdditionally, the customer experience is being improved by inventive mix-ins and toppings like fruit swirls, gourmet biscuits, and nuts. Seasonal discounts and limited-edition flavors can generate buzz and promote recurring business. These developments broaden the consumer base and maintain market vibrancy by appealing to a variety of palates, from daring foodies to those in search of nostalgic pleasures.\n\n\n\nExpanding Distribution Channels\n\n\n\nGrowing distribution networks are a major factor in the U.S. ice cream market's expansion. Customers may now more easily obtain their favorite sweets thanks to the growing availability of ice cream brands in mass merchants, convenience stores, and supermarkets. Customers may now purchase ice cream to be delivered right to their homes thanks to the growth of online platforms like meal delivery services and e-commerce websites.\n\nAdditionally, customers have options for on-the-go eating thanks to the availability of ice cream in convenience stores and quick-service restaurants. Ice cream is now more convenient and available to a larger audience because to its expanding presence in both physical and online retail places, which appeals to busy consumers and increases overall sales. Ice cream will continue to be a popular and accessible treat thanks to its expanding distribution reach.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the United States Ice Cream Market\n\nRising Ingredient and Production Costs\n\n\n\nGrowing manufacturing and ingredient prices are a major obstacle for the American ice cream market. Changes in the supply chain, the weather, and inflationary pressures can cause swings in essential ingredients like dairy, sugar, and flavorings. Unfavorable weather conditions, for example, can affect dairy production and raise milk prices, while disruptions in the global supply chain can raise prices and delay the availability of ingredients. Profit margins may be strained as a result of increased production costs for ice cream producers.\n\n\n\nChanging Consumer Preferences\n\n\n\nGrowing manufacturing and ingredient prices are a major obstacle for the American ice cream market. Changes in the supply chain, the weather, and inflationary pressures can cause swings in essential ingredients like dairy, sugar, and flavorings. Unfavorable weather conditions, for example, can affect dairy production and raise milk prices, while disruptions in the global supply chain can raise prices and delay the availability of ingredients.\n\nIn the American ice cream market, chocolate is a popular favorite\n\n\n\nChocolate flavors are poised to lead the United States ice cream market. This is due to their enduring recognition and versatility. From traditional favorites like chocolate chip and fudge truffles to innovative versions like salted caramel chocolate, chocolate appeals to a vast spectrum of customers. Its wealthy, indulgent flavor satisfies cravings and gives consolation, making it a perennial choice. Chocolate remains a pinnacle desire as consumers seek familiar but interesting flavors, driving its predicted leadership inside the US ice cream market.\n\n\n\nIn the US ice cream market, the impulse category is preferred\n\n\n\nThe impulse category is positioned to increase in the ice cream market. This is owed to a growing awareness of comfort and on-the-move snacking. Impulse purchases thrive, especially in high-visitor areas like comfort shops and tourist destinations. The upward thrust of single-serve packaging and innovative product formats also caters to spontaneous cravings. As customers prioritize comfort and instantaneous gratification, the impulse class is poised to grow, reflecting evolving consumption styles in the ice cream market in the United States.\n\n\n\nIn the US ice cream market, cups and cones are growing in popularity\n\n\n\nCups and cones are poised to dominate the US ice cream market. This is due to the fact that they offer portable and customizable options and cater to various customer possibilities. Cups provide mess-free enjoyment, ideal for on-the-move consumption, while cones give a classic and nostalgic experience. With many flavors and toppings, cups and cones remain famous, riding their expected dominance within the United States ice cream market.\n\n\n\nAmerican consumers prefer to purchase ice cream from hypermarkets and supermarkets\n\n\n\nSupermarkets and hypermarkets are expected to increase their presence within the market. This is because of their extensive accessibility and giant product offerings. With purchasers increasingly searching for comfort and one-stop shopping experiences, these retail channels provide diverse ice cream brands and flavors. Moreover, promotional strategies and aggressive pricing drive impulse purchases. As supermarkets and hypermarkets enlarge their ice cream services, they may be poised to capture a more significant market share.\n\nCompany Analysis: Overview, Recent Developments, Revenue Analysis\n\nNestle SA\n\nUnilever Group\n\nGeneral Mills\n\nDanone S.A.\n\nMondelez International, Inc.\n\nMeiji Co.

            "content": "Rizwan Ahmad & Naveed Seraj, Chief Storyteller and CCO, Viral Edge, speak to Aurora about what makes their digital-first agency different.\n\nAURORA: FOR CONTEXT, PERHAPS WE CAN START WITH A BRIEF SUMMARY OF YOUR BACKGROUNDS BEFORE YOU LAUNCHED VIRAL EDGE.\n\nRIZWAN AHMAD: I graduated in 2009 from the College of Business Management (CBM), majoring in marketing. My first job was at Unilever Pakistan as a management trainee and I remained in marketing there for six years. I started by working on Fair and Lovely and then launched Vaseline. When the digital transformation began in 2010, I took on the digital lead role. I had done several webmaster courses and was really fascinated by the whole thing. My marketing foundations were at Unilever, as the company understands brands as a business. Most of the campaigns came from their global headquarters and I introduced a lot of new agencies to Unilever. However, after six years I realised there was a gap; the tech people were too techie. This made me think about starting a digital content-focused agency that tells stories that would work digitally.\n\nNAVEED SERAJ: I started my career as a banker. From 2003 onwards, I worked for 10 years in banking. Like Rizwan, I had a techie background and worked in alternate delivery channels; apps, internet banking, credit cards \u2013 all digital payment systems. I was a part of the tech side of it for the first three banks. I started my career with Prime Bank; from there, I went to Allied Bank, UBL and Atlas. I then moved towards the e-commerce side of it, only to realise that e-commerce does not exist here. I left banking with the thought of creating an e-commerce ecosystem in Pakistan. I partnered with a courier company called Blue X and established the first e-commerce-driven cash and delivery system. As it happened, Unilever Pakistan was one of our clients, which is where I met Rizwan.\n\nA: Would it be correct to say that although you both have creative titles, neither of you has a classical creative background?\n\nNS: We are not traditional creatives, but we were creative in our limited space and implemented very cutting-edge solutions. Within our ecosystem, we were doing very different things because we did not follow the traditional formula; we implemented our crazy ideas and it kind of worked.\n\nA: How would you define Viral Edge?\n\nRA: When we started Viral Edge in 2015, the internet was beginning to boom and our thought process was that creative agencies would struggle in the next eight to 10 years because they would be too resistant to change. The thought was that we would be the future of the creative agency, although we realised it would take time. The idea was to start as a digital agency and then transform ourselves into what would become the new creative agency. Today, we consider ourselves a creative agency because we understand the full funnel. There are four extremely important core parts for an agency today. The first is the creative \u2013 which has to be digital first. The second is the digital strategy \u2013 and you need a lot of technical knowledge. The third is the ability to amplify digital media and the fourth is the influencer marketing grid. Together, this constitutes the new creative agency and we have all four verticals very well equipped as teams: that is the DNA of the new creative agency.\n\nA: Specifically, what do you offer that is different from the other creative agencies?\n\nRA: The first step is to make our clients understand how not to use the traditional way of engaging with their consumers.\n\nA: What do you mean by \u201chow not to use the traditional way\u201d?\n\nRA: The traditional way is based on a formula. What we do is put together an integrated media campaign for every platform separately.\n\nA: What are the \u201cnots\u201d?\n\nNS: The traditional route of doing things is to make a communication for TV and then roll it out on different digital platforms with the same messaging and that\u2019s it.\n\nRA: We provide customised solutions for each platform. A brand\u2019s core campaign may have five tailor-made creative executions across multiple platforms \u2013 this is far more work in terms of consumer understanding and more complex in terms of campaign delivery.\n\nA: When did your first big break come?\n\nRA: In 2015 when we got the Tapal account.\n\nA: What part of the Tapal account was it?\n\nRA: Digital. At that point, clients didn\u2019t understand digital. In 2015 when Tapal came up with the Fawad Khan campaign, we got them to agree to launch it on digital first, even before they launched it on TV, and it was unheard of for Tapal.\n\nNS: Later we did the \u2018chai wars\u2019 campaign for Tapal \u2013 when knowingly or unknowingly, the competition released an ad with the same promise and this led to a brand war; Red Cup versus Yellow Cup, which attracted a lot of \u2018noticeability\u2019.\n\nRA: We started getting noticed in the digital space and getting more and more brands wanting to work with us in the digital space. In the first five years, we worked with over 100 eateries, including Delizia, GreenO and Broadway, marketing all these eateries from scratch. Afterwards, FMCG brands also noticed us; we implemented a similar framework for them and saw equal success. Within two years, clients were bringing us difficult briefs because we were known for our ability to crack them in unconventional ways.\n\nNS: Our content was very edgy and not at all conventional. Like our name Viral Edge, we had the virality factor from the get-go.\n\nA: What are the major changes you have seen over the 10 years of your existence?\n\nNS: It is such a huge truth, and I don\u2019t know whether people are honest enough to admit it or not \u2013 consumers are so smart, that they are rejecting advertising. It is such a huge truth, yet everybody is in denial \u2013 nobody wants to watch ads anymore. Back in the day, we were forced to watch TV ads because we were watching a TV show or the news or whatever. Ads were forced on us, and we did not have a choice.\n\nRA: According to YouTube numbers, 80% of the audience skip ads, which happens because they are exposed to an advertising model where people don\u2019t want to interact. The way people on social media consume news or entertainment is changing rapidly, and we have to learn what is happening to craft smarter strategies. Nobody cares about high-end big productions anymore but brands still want to invest in them. However, the amount of content you need today has both increased and changed a lot.\n\nNS: These days when we get a brief, we question whether they even need an ad because if you want to say something, you can do it without producing an ad.\n\nA: Any other changes?\n\nNS: AI will increase marketing output insanely, and stuff that was not possible before, will be possible now \u2013 making a million animations a day, or releasing a song by a specific vocalist in 15 minutes. All these iterations can go into the creative ecosystem today, making the output more exciting. AI is bringing us the ability to think in endless ways. There is no limit to thinking.\n\nRA: AI is enabling speed and output, and this will drive the price of creative further down. Pop-up agencies will come saying they can produce the same output for 50% of the cost.\n\nA: Who is doing the thinking? You or AI?\n\nRA: Creatives will use AI to get ideas faster, but it will still have a lot of human input. The idea will still be generated by the creator, but you will also need to understand the possibilities that technology offers. Then, the power of your ideation becomes more complex and you can create more exciting work. This is what will drive future creatives \u2013 using and merging technology in ideation.\n\nA: Do you still believe in consistency as essential to long-term brand building?\n\nRA: The idea of remaining consistent still exists today. A brand that bought into content marketing very early was Red Bull. Yet, Red Bull has a tonality about what they say that remains consistent, and which they express in multiple different ways. Take Pepsi\u2019s \u2018Why Not Meri Jaan?\u2019. We asked 25 different artists to create rap songs based on the original idea and this triggered 10,000 consumers to join in \u2013 today, #WhyNotMeriJaan has more than 10 million unique pieces of content. So while the idea should remain consistent, the forms of content can change. When you talk about creating more content, you don\u2019t want to say different things; you have to stay within that umbrella. But it means having an extremely strong content strategy so that while you say the same thing within that framework, you could also potentially talk about more things.\n\nA: Given that there are usually different partners in front of a client, who determines the \u2018Big Idea\u2019 when it becomes a case of identifying one?\n\nRA: Generally, it comes from the marketing team. When Pepsi\u2019s marketing team changed, they moved away from \u2018Why Not Meri Jaan?\u2019\n\nA: Are you saying the advertising agencies have no influence?\n\nRA: What I am saying is that the brief starts from the marketing team, and then the first go-to agency is their own creative agency. So the creative agency is still the one driving the concept.\n\nA: How often are you in that seat?\n\nRA: Almost 40% of the time for the brands we work on. Digital is becoming increasingly retainer-based and this sometimes gives us an advantage. For example, for Reckitt, we are the only agency on retainer. They don\u2019t have a creative agency on board and when they want to develop a concept, they put it out as a pitch; we win some pitches, BBDO wins some and others go to another agency. Unilever follows the same model for some of their brands and we get the opportunity to pitch. However, if a brand has a creative agency, then that is where they go first. IAL Saatchi & Saatchi are the creative agency for Tapal, but once in a while, we get a couple of projects where we get the creative as well.\n\nA: Do you have a complete complement of people or do you hire on a project basis?\n\nRA: We don\u2019t work on a project-to-project basis. We generally anticipate demand. Ninety-five percent of our business is retainer-based, so we know the demand. At the moment, we manage about 50 to 60 accounts and we have about 75 people; 65 are based in Karachi and 10 are based in Lahore for the Pepsi account. To service these accounts, we need to have the talent in-house. The issue is not only hiring but retaining people. For our part, we have a very high retention. We have built a culture that is accommodating towards Gen Z. The business is growing and we keep on scaling up.\n\nA: Traditionally ad agencies made their money through big production TVCs. In those terms, digital has always been seen as a relatively cheap medium. Has this changed?\n\nRA: Digital is a very, very low-margin business, although it is increasing.\n\nA: But should it be?\n\nRA: No, it shouldn\u2019t be. In a lot of cases, we refuse to take the business if the money is not right. However, digital involves a lot of different campaigns, so there is a lot of value addition. Digital means doing influencer marketing; it also involves productions, maybe small ones, but at scale. We are also buying digital media, which involves a commission. So there are peripherals which add to the agreed retainer. However, Pakistan is still one of the toughest markets to operate in because many companies have not revised their scope of work and not pricing digital right, which is why a lot of agencies have started working for international accounts.\n\nA: What is your ambition for Viral Edge for the next five years?\n\nRA: To strengthen our brand and become number one in Pakistan. We want to sustain our business in Pakistan as well as focus on the GCC market by having a presence in Oman, Dubai and Saudi Arabia.\n\nNS: We want to rule the world, but for now we will focus on becoming the number one agency in Pakistan.\n\nRA: We have been very consistent. We have worked with Pepsi for four years and with Reckitt for three years. We have focused on client retention and protected our name, and if you can do that, you can really do big business. In the last 10 years, we have not done any business development. We just get referrals from clients and are called to multiple pitches. The local landscape is a really big market, and if you can become the market leader, that is a good share.\n\nNS: We are very passion-driven. When we get a brief for an interesting product, it excites us and we give it our 500% regardless of the financial map behind it. We have done this since we started and is one of the reasons why we have been blessed with good portfolios, a good team and a good business output. We just want to do good work which excites us. We try to solve problems with our unique DNA and that is what gives us great satisfaction. Money is a by-product of this and so far we have been blessed with both.\n\nA: What precisely excites you about what you do?\n\nRA: The joy of execution, and seeing your work published; now with digital, you get so much feedback, and when people notice what you have done, you get a high from seeing your work appreciated. NS: We have been challenging the status quo from the start. Even during briefing sessions with clients, we will ask them to pivot; we tell them that they actually don\u2019t want this, what they want is that. We don\u2019t take normal briefs. We are not cut out for formulae; we don\u2019t do vanilla stuff.\n\nRizwan Ahmad and Naveed Seraj were in conversation with Mariam Ali Baig. For feedback: aurora@dawn.com",

We think that\u2019s pretty f***ing great,\u201d the older man tells his younger guest.\n\nTurning to reveal the inside of his suit jacket, arrayed with traditional razor blades and handles, electric trimmers, as well as shaving creams and butters, the concierge leads our initiate to the sink \u2014 but not before departing with a cheeky tap to the lad\u2019s rear end.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the club!\u201d the concierge says enthusiastically as he struts away.\n\nHaving been posted only a little over a week ago, the ad has nonetheless already racked up over 540,000 views. The ad is poised to be featured on CTV, YouTube, Spotify, several podcasts, and other channels.\n\nDollar Shave Club CEO Speaks to Modern Inclusivity, Humor\n\nInstalled as DSC CEO in November 2023 \u2014 shortly after news broke that Unilever was selling the company after about 7 years of holding it as an asset, per a Retail Dive report \u2014 Larry Bodner spoke to the changing nature of humor in today\u2019s era, and how it inclusivity has become central to the brand\u2019s approach to staying relevant, as well as irreverent.\n\n\u201cWe [myself and DSC co-founder Michael Dubin] spent a lot of time on what humor means to our [consumer],\u201d Bodner said. \u201cHow do we bring irreverence to light in this current culture? How do you bring back some breakthrough edginess while still being inclusive?\u201d\n\nBodner pointed to the inclusion of several different male body types and grooming habits as visually representative of that sort of inclusion. Notably absent, the clean-shaven beach-body male model common to most men\u2019s grooming commercials of yore.\n\n\u201cThe resulting balancing act is apparent in \u2018The Club\u2019: not too \u2018bro-y\u2019 but disruptive and fun in a way that plays into longstanding \u2014 if latent \u2014 brand equity. Keying into the brand\u2019s strength while making it contemporary meant highlighting different body types and grooming styles,\u201d Marketing Dive underscored.\n\nDollar Shave Club Joined by Target, Wendy\u2019s in Appealing to an Playfully Edgy New Ad Approach\n\nDollar Shave Club isn\u2019t the only one leaning in on a new trend in advertising \u2014 that of making ads cheeky or edgy in a playful or fun way, without getting too graphic or overtly offensive.\n\nIn November of 2024, Target launched a series of short advertisements featuring a \u201chot\u201d Santa Claus, or Kris for short. The ads featured the muscular stand-in for the traditional Santa plowing through the snow to a Steppenwolf soundtrack, or helping a harried shopper locate the best holiday deals in store.\n\nAnd earlier, in September of that same year, Wendy\u2019s threw a little bit of shade at competitor McDonald\u2019s. At the time, Wendy\u2019s partnered up with website McBroken.com \u2014 a website which tracks which of the Golden Arches\u2019 ice cream machines are out of operation \u2014 to promote its own Frosty desserts as an always-available alternative.",

            "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Unilever PLC ( ).\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Unilever is:\n\n32% = \u20ac7.3b \u00f7 \u20ac23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every \u00a31 worth of equity, the company was able to earn \u00a30.32 in profit.\n\nDoes Unilever Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Unilever has an ROE that is roughly in line with the average (32%).\n\nSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nCombining Unilever's Debt And Its 32% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Unilever, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.32. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free .\n\nOf course Unilever may not be the best stock to buy.

This prestigious recognition comes as a result of the site\u2019s adoption of the 4IR technologies, such as AI, automation, cloud computing and the Internet of Things at scale. Previously, HUL\u2019s Dapada site received this recognition in 2022, followed by the Sonepat site in 2023. HUL stands out as the only company in India, with three factories in the country earning the Advanced 4IR End-to-End value chain Lighthouse recognition.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Lighthouse Network honours the most digitally advanced factories that transform operations, enhance efficiency, drive sustainable growth, and upskill their workforce. The Doom Dooma site runs the 4IR technology in almost every process, with more than 50 initiatives currently in place across the end-to-end (E2E) supply chain.\n\nRohit Jawa, CEO and MD, HUL said, \u201cWe are proud of the Doom Dooma site securing this prestigious recognition. By integrating advanced technologies, we have revolutionised our operations, significantly enhancing productivity and product quality. Such initiatives are not only beneficial to our business but also represent a significant step towards building a better future.\u201d\n\nYogesh Mishra, Executive Director, Supply Chain, HUL, said, \u201cThis recognition is a testament to our relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence, and testifies to the increasing strengths of AI and digitisation. It underscores our unwavering commitment to leveraging these technologies to drive efficiency, sustainability, and growth across our operations. We are committed to demonstrating that innovation, sustainability, and workforce development can go hand-in-hand.\u201d\n\nWith an annual production capacity of 5.4 billion+ units and a team of 675, the DDF site, which is India\u2019s largest Beauty & Wellbeing manufacturing unit, produces over 130+ SKUs of beauty products, including Glow & Lovely, Pond\u2019s, Vaseline, Sunsilk, Clinic Plus, TRESemm\u00e9, and Dove. Operating in a remote region with limited resources, the site partnered with local institutes to create a skilled workforce and was able to implement 50+ digital use cases to improve end-to-end supply chain agility. Here are some of the key 4IR applications employed at the factory, which led to the Lighthouse recognition:\n\nBoosting e-commerce efficiency An AI-powered vision system maps product features and detects anomalies in real-time.

            "content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nCampaign Trail is our analysis of some of the best new creative efforts from the marketing world. View past columns in the archives here.\n\nBack in 2012, Dollar Shave Club debuted with one of the most memorable ads of the decade, if not the century: a direct-to-camera address by real-life co-founder Michael Dubin as he walked through a warehouse and introduced the brand\u2019s direct-to-consumer value proposition. That 90-second ad demonstrated what a disruptor brand could do with an irreverent approach, a hint of nostalgia, a machete and a person in a bear suit.\n\nMore than 28 million views later, Dollar Shave Club is looking to return to its roots with a new campaign that marks its first major marketing move after being acquired by Nexus Capital Management from Unilever, which in 2016 bought Dollar Shave Club in a reportedly $1 billion cash deal.\n\n\u201cThe Club\u201d turns the eponymous establishment into a swanky gentlemen\u2019s club. A 30-second spot features a newcomer sharing a password (\u201cshave money\u201d) before being given a robe and a tour of the velvet-and wood-covered space. The pair encounter three barely dressed men tending to their hair in different ways (a nose hair trim, a back shave, a chest lathering).\n\nThen, the concierge opens his jacket to reveal blades, electrics, creams and butters before welcoming the newcomer to the club with a slap on the butt. A full 60-second cut adds an anatomically correct mirror and a cameo by the person in a bear suit from the viral Dollar Shave ad.\n\nFor Dollar Shave Club, the campaign represents a return to the brand\u2019s humorous, irreverent voice, with what CEO Larry Bodner calls a \u201ctwisted\u201d take on inclusivity.\n\n\u201cWe're for everybody. We're not the crazy technical side of shaving. We're more the approachable and engaging side of self-expression within how people take care of themselves,\u201d the executive said.\n\nNot too \u2018bro-y\u2019\n\nTo get Dollar Shave Club\u2019s marketing back on track, Bodner, who joined as CEO in November 2023, went to the source: Early on, he picked the brain of Dubin (\u201ca marketing savant\u201d) to learn everything he could about the brand\u2019s history. But he knew that it wouldn\u2019t be as simple as re-running the playbook used over a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time on what humor means to our [consumer],\u201d Bodner said. \u201cHow do we bring irreverence to light in this current culture? How do you bring back some breakthrough edginess while still being inclusive?\u201d\n\nThe resulting balancing act is apparent in \u201cThe Club\u201d: not too \u201cbro-y\u201d but disruptive and fun in a way that plays into longstanding \u2014 if latent \u2014 brand equity. Keying into the brand\u2019s strength while making it contemporary meant highlighting different body types and grooming styles.\n\n\u201cFacial hair has become more in vogue than it ever was before, whether that was [because of] COVID or anything else,\u201d the executive said. \u201cBut guys still have to go take care of themselves and we want to be inclusive in that regard as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Club,\u201d created by the brand\u2019s internal creative team and directed by Zack Seckler and Good Times Productions, launched on Jan. 6 and will roll out via CTV, YouTube, Spotify, podcasts, owned digital properties and other channels.\n\nIn the club\n\nThe campaign plays up the brand\u2019s status as the only one in the category to own the concept of a club. While the real-life Dollar Shave Club has no concierge or password, it does offer invites to in-person events, ticket giveaways, merchandise drops, swag and limited-time offers as exclusives to members. Plus, there are plans to make physical club spaces \u201cdown the road,\u201d Bodner says.\n\n\u201cWhat does \u2018club\u2019 mean, and how do you bring that forward?\u201d the executive said. \u201cI look at this as the first leg [that] would romanticize the club within this category.\u201d\n\nUpdating the club, both as a location in ads and one in the physical realm, is only one part of Dollar Shave Club\u2019s next phase. The other is emerging from a period at Unilever that halted the brand\u2019s momentum. While Bodner began his career at Procter & Gamble and appreciates the power of CPG conglomerates, he acknowledges that Dollar Shave Club wasn\u2019t a good fit at Unilever.\n\n\u201cI think the company lost its way when Unilever owned them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a behemoth and it neutered some of the edginess that we're going to bring back to the brand.\u201d\n\nWhile conglomerates like Unilever and P&G can excel at driving business across a variety of brands, they often struggle with incorporating disruptor brands that require a \u201cmaniacal focus\u201d on creative process and commercial elements.\n\n\u201cThese big conglomerates aren't good at the disruptive brands, period,\u201d Bodner said.",

            "content": "Once seen as the future of retail, the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment seems to be losing its sheen. With Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reportedly in buyout talks with Minimalist, a Jaipur-based skincare brand, for Rs 3,000 crore, the sector\u2019s challenges in scaling up are under scrutiny. Amid plateauing sales and dwindling funding, D2C startups face an uphill task to sustain growth.\n\nThe sector witnessed a 19% drop in funding in 2024, falling to $672.8 million from $830.2 million in 2023, as per Tracxn data. This sharp decline follows an even steeper fall from $1.8 billion in 2022. Revenue slumps have compounded the woes: brands such as boAt, Zivame, Wow Skin Science, Ustraa, and Wrogn reported a decline in revenue in FY24, while Mamaearth\u2019s revenue from operations shrank 6.9% in Q2FY25, leading to its first quarterly loss in five quarters.\n\nAnirudh A Damani, managing partner at Artha Venture Fund, attributes this to a misjudgment in consumer behaviour. \u201cMany D2C brands targeted middle-and bottom-tier consumers, expecting online shopping habits to stick post-Covid. However, these consumers remain loyal to established brands like HUL, which offer trust, affordability, and omnipresence,\u201d he said.\n\nWith scaling challenges mounting, acquisitions have become a viable exit strategy. Over the past two years, 21 D2C startups have been acquired by larger players. Notable deals include Reliance\u2019s acquisition of Clovia and Insight Cosmetics, Tata Consumer Products\u2019 purchase of Soulfull and Organic India, and Marico\u2019s buyouts of Beardo, Just Herbs, and Plix.\n\n\u201cAcquisitions allow larger FMCG players to experiment with new consumer segments without risking their core customer base, while providing startups with a much-needed lifeline,\u201d Damani added.\n\nWow Skin Science is reportedly exploring potential buyers, further underscoring the segment\u2019s struggles.\n\nThe shift toward profitability has pressured D2C startups to adopt omnichannel strategies, but offline expansion has proven costly. Leasing and operating physical stores, ensuring consistency across channels, and heavy marketing expenses have weighed on margins. \u201cInvestors are wary of the ongoing cash burn, forcing startups to rethink their business models,\u201d said Dushyant Singh, managing partner at Playbook Partners.\n\nSector-specific slowdowns have also hit startups disproportionately. The declining wearable device market, for instance, has impacted brands like boAt and Noise more acutely than legacy players such as Apple and Samsung, which benefit from diversified portfolios.\n\nWhile Mamaearth\u2019s IPO was a landmark for the D2C ecosystem, its recent struggles have tempered investor confidence. Other D2C players, including boAt, Zappfresh, Lenskart, and BlueStone, have postponed or reconsidered their IPO plans amid intensifying competition and consumer retention challenges driven by quick commerce proliferation.\n\nDespite the hurdles, experts see a silver lining. According to them, this period of consolidation will separate the wheat from the chaff and see only brands with a clear path to profitability survive.\n\nAs the sector navigates a rough patch, the once-thriving D2C ecosystem appears to be entering a phase where survival hinges on sustainable growth and operational efficiency, analysts said.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Avenue Supermarts Ltd. named Anshul Asawa as its chief executive officer-designate after the Indian operator of retail chain DMart posted profit that missed estimates amid competition from e-commerce companies expanding their rapid deliveries business.\n\nAsawa, a 30-year veteran of Unilever Plc, will join as CEO-designate in March and formally take over from Ignatius Navil Noronha from February 2026, the Mumbai-based company said in a filing Saturday. Noronha, who owns 1.95% of DMart, will continue as CEO in the interim. The company has also elevated two executives as senior management personnel.\n\nThe company\u2019s third-quarter profit rose 6.5% to 7.85 billion rupees ($91 million), missing analysts\u2019 estimates for a ninth straight quarter. That\u2019s also the third consecutive quarter of slower profit growth. DMart\u2019s shares declined 13% in 2024, compared with a roughly 9% gain in the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index amid investor concern that online grocery stores like Swiggy Ltd.\u2019s Instamart and Zomato Ltd.\u2019s BlinkIt are taking market share.\n\nFounded by stock market trader Radhakishan Damani at the turn of the century, DMart is facing \u201cincreased intensity in discounting in the FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) category and the consequent impact to high turnover per square feet stores in metro towns,\u201d the company said in a statement Saturday. \u201cHowever, this quarter the impact has relatively reduced versus the previous quarter.\u201d\n\nThe changes in senior management at DMart are being made at a time retail store chains in India are facing increased competition from digital platforms. While food delivery companies are expanding their quick-commerce business, the e-commerce giants like Amazon.com Inc. are starting rapid delivery service.\n\nAsawa, who is the country head of Unilever in Thailand and general manager for the home care business unit in Greater Asia, has had stints in Asia and Europe, according to DMart.\n\nThe company said its home delivery business far exceeds its pick-up point sales contribution and in several towns it now only provides home delivery. \u201cWe are seeing significantly more demand for home delivery compared to pick-up point and hence we continue to align our business to that extent,\u201d the retail chain operator said. Sales at DMart Ready, its online business, climbed 21.5% in the nine months ended Dec. 31.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

Noronha has not offered to renew his role as the retail major's chief after the conclusion of his current term in January 2026.\n\nThe hypermarket chain operator, while announcing its October-December quarter results for fiscal 2024-25 (Q3FY25) today, also gave its management update. With Noronha's exit, Avenue Supermarts picked Unilever's Anshul Asawa as its new CEO Designate. Neville will support Anshul for a smooth transition over the next year as the latter joins the company in March 2025.\n\nDMart leadership transition: Anshul Asawa to replace Neville Noronha Anshul is expected to take over as the MD and CEO on February 1, 2026, after Neville's term concludes, which is one year from now. Asawa, with a 30-year-long stint, currently serves as the Country Head of Unilever in Thailand and the General Manager of the Home Care business unit in Greater Asia.\n\n\u201cAfter more than two decades of exceptional leadership and a glorious tenure at the helm of the business, Neville has chosen not to extend his contract. The Board of Directors honour his decision and expresses profound gratitude for his extraordinary contribution to the company,\u201d said India's leading food and grocery retailer in a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges today.\n\nAvenue Supermarts commended Neville's tenure at DMart, saying that it has been defined by transformative growth, a deep commitment to operational excellence, and the establishment of a strong corporate culture. \u201cHe has built robust managerial teams, implemented efficient systems and processes, and fostered a customer-first approach that has delivered outstanding results for all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Avenue Supermarts CEO Noronha joins the billionaire club\n\nNeville joined DMart in January 2004 and shepherded the retail major from its early years to its current position as one of the largest supermarket chains in the country. Under Neville's stewardship, DMart hit significant milestones, including surpassing the \u20b950,000 crore annual turnover mark and growing from five stores when Neville joined the company to over 380 stores now.\n\n\u201cHis visionary leadership, strategic foresight, and relentless focus on long-term value creation have set the company up for continued success. The foundation laid by Neville Noronha will remain a source of strength and inspiration,\u201d said Avenue Supermarts in its statement.\n\nAcknowledging Neville\u2019s commitment to the company, C.B. Bhave, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Avenue Supermarts, said, \u201cI would like to place on record my appreciation of Neville's vision and hard work in building the company to this scale today. He has demonstrated exceptional leadership skills and dedication in his remarkably successful tenure.\u201d\n\n\u201cA leader who saw the big picture but never lost the eye for detail, Neville ensured that growth and profits were not ends in themselves; rather, they were the by-products of efficiency, fairness and customer value. The entire Board of the Company joins me in this sentiment,\u201d added Bhave.\n\nBorn and raised in Mumbai, Noronha completed his management degree from the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies. Before joining Dmart, Noronha worked with the fast-moving consumer goods firm Hindustan Unilever. Founder and ace investor Radhakishan Damani hired him in 2004 as a head of business, and he took over as CEO in 2007.\n\nReflecting on his stint, Neville Noronha remarked, \u201cI deeply appreciate the opportunity to serve the business. Extremely grateful to each and every one of the early leadership team, especially those who believed in the idea of Dmart and stayed with us for a very long time. Dmart wouldn\u2019t be possible as it is today without them.\n\n\u201cI believe that Dmart is a business model with a multi-decadal growth runway. If we stay on the course of simplicity, efficient costs, happy employees, deep value to customers, and most importantly, not doing anything else, we will remain relevant for a long time. I remain committed to a smooth transition till my tenure ends and available even after that for any counsel the company may need from time to time,\u201d added Noronha.\n\nAnshul Asawa, an IIT Roorkee and IIM Lucknow alumnus, will join DMart after a 30-year-long stint at Unilever, where he held leadership roles overseeing the growth of product categories and developing impactful functions in India, Asia, and Europe. During his tenure of over 15 years in India, Anshul held key leadership positions in sales, marketing, and distribution.\n\nHe led the digitisation efforts at HUL and was also at the forefront of leading product innovations for homecare categories and sales & distribution transformations in urban and rural markets within India. He is known for his consumer-centricity, commercial discipline, and execution focus.",

This data enables us to analyse and optimise washing processes and product formulations.\n\nWe have 80 washing machines available at any one time, including front-loading European automatics and top-loading machines from Asia and Brazil. These machines represent what consumers use at home, allowing us to mimic real-world conditions.\n\nWhat sort of tests do we run?\n\nWe\u2019re world experts in tough stain removal and this is one of the key functional benefits we test for in the Appraisal Lab washing machines. Analysing everyday stains like tea, coffee, wine and cooking oils, we use high-tech scanners to accurately measure the colour of the stain before and after washing. The data generated tells us to what degree the stain has been removed. But consumer needs and wash loads vary hugely, so we also look at other aspects of product performance including malodour removal, freshness and fragrance, and ensuring no residues are left in short cold cycles.\n\nHow does this fit in with the work we do at our Materials Innovation Factory?\n\nThe Materials Innovation Factory (MIF) runs tests in the discovery phase of product innovation. It has the highest concentration of robots doing materials chemistry in the world. These robots operate round the clock, carrying out tests that usually take weeks to complete. MIF robots are programmed to mimic cycles from different types of machine and water conditions. Using computational science, we can change variables to help us predict how well a product will perform. This is the step we take before testing products in the Appraisal Lab washing machines.\n\nDo we always run the same tests?\n\nWe carry out regular studies to identify the critical issues \u2013 or \u2018pain points\u2019 \u2013 affecting consumers, and we constantly adapt our tests to meet these evolving needs. Persil Wonder Wash is a good example, our biggest laundry detergent innovation in a decade. This is our first-ever detergent designed specifically for short cold cycles, so we were testing everything in 15 minutes. Ordinarily, we\u2019d be testing in long wash cycles.\n\nWater conditions vary across the world. Do we take that into account?",

View past columns in the archives here.\n\nBack in 2012, Dollar Shave Club debuted with one of the most memorable ads of the decade, if not the century: a direct-to-camera address by real-life co-founder Michael Dubin as he walked through a warehouse and introduced the brand\u2019s direct-to-consumer value proposition. That 90-second ad demonstrated what a disruptor brand could do with an irreverent approach, a hint of nostalgia, a machete and a person in a bear suit.\n\nMore than 28 million views later, Dollar Shave Club is looking to return to its roots with a new campaign that marks its first major marketing move after being acquired by Nexus Capital Management from Unilever, which in 2016 bought Dollar Shave Club in a reportedly $1 billion cash deal.\n\n\u201cThe Club\u201d turns the eponymous establishment into a swanky gentlemen\u2019s club. A 30-second spot features a newcomer sharing a password (\u201cshave money\u201d) before being given a robe and a tour of the velvet-and wood-covered space. The pair encounter three barely dressed men tending to their hair in different ways (a nose hair trim, a back shave, a chest lathering).\n\nThen, the concierge opens his jacket to reveal blades, electrics, creams and butters before welcoming the newcomer to the club with a slap on the butt. A full 60-second cut adds an anatomically correct mirror and a cameo by the person in a bear suit from the viral Dollar Shave ad.\n\nFor Dollar Shave Club, the campaign represents a return to the brand\u2019s humorous, irreverent voice, with what CEO Larry Bodner calls a \u201ctwisted\u201d take on inclusivity.\n\n\u201cWe're for everybody. We're not the crazy technical side of shaving. We're more the approachable and engaging side of self-expression within how people take care of themselves,\u201d the executive said.\n\nNot too \u2018bro-y\u2019\n\nTo get Dollar Shave Club\u2019s marketing back on track, Bodner, who joined as CEO in November 2023, went to the source: Early on, he picked the brain of Dubin (\u201ca marketing savant\u201d) to learn everything he could about the brand\u2019s history. But he knew that it wouldn\u2019t be as simple as re-running the playbook used over a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time on what humor means to our [consumer],\u201d Bodner said. \u201cHow do we bring irreverence to light in this current culture? How do you bring back some breakthrough edginess while still being inclusive?\u201d\n\nThe resulting balancing act is apparent in \u201cThe Club\u201d: not too \u201cbro-y\u201d but disruptive and fun in a way that plays into longstanding \u2014 if latent \u2014 brand equity. Keying into the brand\u2019s strength while making it contemporary meant highlighting different body types and grooming styles.\n\n\u201cFacial hair has become more in vogue than it ever was before, whether that was [because of] COVID or anything else,\u201d the executive said. \u201cBut guys still have to go take care of themselves and we want to be inclusive in that regard as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Club,\u201d created by the brand\u2019s internal creative team and directed by Zack Seckler and Good Times Productions, launched on Jan. 6 and will roll out via CTV, YouTube, Spotify, podcasts, owned digital properties and other channels.\n\nIn the club\n\nThe campaign plays up the brand\u2019s status as the only one in the category to own the concept of a club. While the real-life Dollar Shave Club has no concierge or password, it does offer invites to in-person events, ticket giveaways, merchandise drops, swag and limited-time offers as exclusives to members. Plus, there are plans to make physical club spaces \u201cdown the road,\u201d Bodner says.\n\n\u201cWhat does \u2018club\u2019 mean, and how do you bring that forward?\u201d the executive said. \u201cI look at this as the first leg [that] would romanticize the club within this category.\u201d\n\nUpdating the club, both as a location in ads and one in the physical realm, is only one part of Dollar Shave Club\u2019s next phase. The other is emerging from a period at Unilever that halted the brand\u2019s momentum. While Bodner began his career at Procter & Gamble and appreciates the power of CPG conglomerates, he acknowledges that Dollar Shave Club wasn\u2019t a good fit at Unilever.\n\n\u201cI think the company lost its way when Unilever owned them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a behemoth and it neutered some of the edginess that we're going to bring back to the brand.\u201d\n\nWhile conglomerates like Unilever and P&G can excel at driving business across a variety of brands, they often struggle with incorporating disruptor brands that require a \u201cmaniacal focus\u201d on creative process and commercial elements.\n\n\u201cThese big conglomerates aren't good at the disruptive brands, period,\u201d Bodner said.",

ESG sets standards to evaluate a business\u2019s sustainability and responsibility. Vietnam is also joining global efforts to create a sustainable future, where the environment is a central pillar prioritised by the government, and is committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nUnilever wins the Sustainable Project Category at the 2024 Human Act Prize award ceremony.

The annual award, organised under the direction of the People\u2019s Newspaper, celebrates individuals and organisations that have made significant societal contributions through innovative, impactful, and sustainable initiatives.\n\nA Unilever Vietnam representative receives the award in the Sustainable Project category. Photo: Unilever Vietnam\n\nAccording to the organisers\u2019 report, Unilever\u2019s scheme excelled in meeting three key criteria: improving production processes, integrating green technologies, and establishing systems to measure environmental impact. By implementing these innovations, Unilever significantly reduced CO2 emissions in its operations, while creating long-term value for both the economy and society.\n\nUnilever's 'Towards a Circular Economy for Plastics Project' was honoured in the same category in 2023.\n\nThis year's award shows that innovation and sustainability are not just slogans but tangible, measurable, and impactful actions. Unilever's success is not just an isolated achievement, it is a sign that sustainability is increasingly becoming the new standard for global businesses.\n\nUnilever is taking bold, comprehensive steps towards carbon neutrality, from production improvements to supply chain restructuring. In Vietnam, the company has achieved a major milestone by transitioning entirely to renewable energy in its manufacturing facilities. The intelligent energy management system at the Bac Ninh factory is a prime example, earning the LEED Green Building Certification, an international standard recognising environmentally friendly and energy-efficient buildings.\n\nLe Thi Hong Nhi (right), vice president of Communications, Corporate Affairs, and Sustainability at Unilever Vietnam, at the event. Photo: Unilever Vietnam\n\nFurthermore, Unilever has invested heavily in green technology projects, such as installing solar power systems and using biofuels as alternatives. The company has introduced groundbreaking changes in its supply chain, including the use of biomass fuel recycled from materials like wood scraps, damaged pallets, and rice husks. This innovation has completely replaced fossil fuels in boilers, reducing CO 2 emissions by nearly 10,000 tonnes annually since 2007.\n\nThe effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in impressive figures: 9,684 tonnes of CO 2 eliminated annually from 2007 to 2022; 511kg of SOx emissions reduced each year through biomass fuel use; and 100 per cent elimination of carton waste in transporting packaging from Dynaplast. Unilever has also implemented and realised a circular economy model in managing waste, such as plastic waste, damaged pallets, and cardboard boxes\u2013transforming waste into energy and fertilisers to support production activities.\n\nUnilever\u2019s efforts have reinforced its leadership role and inspired other businesses to integrate economic development with environmental protection. With the collaboration of the government and the business community, the goal of a net-zero Vietnam by 2050 is entirely within reach.\n\nUnilever Vietnam embracing circular economic benefits With only one-third of plastic waste being recycled, Vietnam is losing nearly 70 per cent of the value of plastic materials, equivalent to nearly $2.2-2.9 billion a year, because of disposal into the environment.\n\nUnilever consistent in sustainability in Vietnam Unilever\u2019s journey of more than 100 years of global development and nearly 30 years in the Vietnamese market has left impressive achievements in sustainable business, worthy of the position of top global sustainable development enterprise.",

            "content": "Reports that Hindustan Unilever is looking to acquire Minimalist, a start-up in the beauty and personal care (BPC) space, for about $350 million is evidence of the difficulties direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands face in scaling up. This is not the first time that consumer giants are showing interest in buying out brands; about two years back ITC had picked up a big stake in Yoga Bar, with an intention to buy more from the promoters in due course. At the time Yoga Bar was available in 6,000 retail outlets across the country and boasted gross margins of about 45%. But revenues were just about Rs 100 crore. As the Yoga Bar promoters said in an interview to this paper, the support from ITC in terms of cash investments and a distribution network of four million outlets had prompted their decision to sell out. Building an offline presence, a channel that most start-up managements acknowledge is now critical to reach more buyers, can be quite challenging as Honasa Consumer has discovered. The revamping of the company\u2019s offline distribution, entailing a shift to the direct distributor model from the super-stockist model, didn\u2019t go down too well. The cost of the adverse impact on the inventory of about Rs 40 crore has been significant for a business that posted an operating profit of Rs 137 crore in FY24.\n\nEven where there is no plan to build an offline distribution channel and D2C brands can get traction online, both on their own sites and also on platforms such as Flipkart or Nykaa, it is not easy to make money. Minimalist, one of the few profitable firms in the BPC space, did fairly well in FY24 to post Rs 374 crore in revenues but its profits were just Rs 10 crore. For their part, legacy offline players across sectors appear to be willing to pay top dollar for a strong online brand offering promoters a deal they simply cannot resist. That probably explains the sale of a 27% stake in Caratlane by promoter Mithun Sacheti to Titan for Rs 4,621 crore sometime back.\n\nFor all the success stories of top companies buying out start-ups, however, investments in seed-stage funding fell to less than $1 billion in 2024 with the number of rounds plummeting by 40% to 925. To be sure, the total investments in 2024 were up only by 6% at $11.1 billion. But even in 2023, investors didn\u2019t seem to be as risk-averse; they put in more than $1 billion in seed-stage investments across 1,545 rounds. In 2024, though, there was a fair bit of reluctance to support yet untested businesses. Just about 395 start-ups got first-time funding rounds compared with 665 in 2023. One doesn\u2019t blame the investors for turning cautious; more money was being made available to businesses than was probably needed and at valuations that were clearly unjustified. However, the fall in seed-stage funding is somewhat disappointing because that is what keeps innovation alive. It\u2019s possible that there are not too many good ideas out there, but the few promising ones shouldn\u2019t lose out for want of capital. That could hurt the ecosystem at a time when a new breed of entrepreneurs is working on some exciting business models. While valuations have corrected hurting returns, initial public offerings have given investors handsome exits. Some of the dry powder could perhaps be ammunition for seed-stage ventures.",

The hard-shelled yet delicate creatures are used to make carmine, a natural red pigment that produces the industry\u2019s standard red pigment. In the case of the Red 0 ingredient, a vegan alternative that Hourglass developed with Unilever, no insects are harmed.\n\nThe second floor, which can be accessed via a corridor decorated with snake motifs, was created by Katie Scott, an illustrator and frequent collaborator of the brand who designed a China-exclusive palette to celebrate the upcoming Year of the Snake.\n\nThe rest of the second floor is dedicated to Hourglass\u2019 pop-up store. From Friday through Sunday, the pop-up will open up to the public and feature a series of interactive events, including the Red 0 trade-in program, a beauty masterclass led by Hourglass experts, and a playful pet portrait booth.\n\nVisitors can book a slot to visit the pop-up on WeChat Mini Program.\n\nThe latest Phantom Volumizing Glossy Balm in Red 0, retailing for $36, is the fourth iteration of the Red 0 ingredient that was launched in 2021. A glossy balm that\u2019s sheer and buildable, the product can be layered with other Red 0 lipsticks to achieve a more intense and vibrant look, Janes said.\n\nHourglass\u2019 Shanghai moment also marks the Unilever brand\u2019s first large-scale offline event since it entered the market officially in 2022.\n\n\u201cA lot of Chinese consumers already knew us for certain hero products, such as the Ambient Lighting Blush, before we officially entered the market. I think as we do more events like this and launch the work with Andr\u00e9s, it\u2019s going to even broaden our awareness here,\u201d explained Janes.\n\nSince it launched its first beauty counter at Hangzhou\u2019s Intime Department Store, Hourglass has been picking up the pace of expansion by working with luxury retail names such as SKP, Taikoo Li and MixC. The brand currently counts 24 beauty counters and one flagship in 17 mainland China cities.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nOur homes contain everything from dust, cooking fumes, and chemicals released from paint, furniture, and cleaning agents. Add to that polluted outdoor air making its way into our homes through ventilation, and you\u2019ve got a cocktail of toxins floating around between your four walls. Clean air has proven positive health benefits. It can provide asthma and allergy relief, prevent sickness from bacteria and viruses, and help us sleep better which in turn boosts our immune system. Clean air even makes us smarter according to research. Blueair (a Unilever company) is a leading producer of premium air purifiers for home and professional use. They launched a new generation of connected products called HealthProtect, which proactively monitor air quality and track levels of fine particles and volatile organic compounds as well as the probability of germ growth. Blueair was already a player in the connected device space, but as it noticed that more of its customers were using connected home products, the company knew it was time to prepare for a future when all its devices, which are popular in over 60 countries, would be connected on the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nTo achieve the global scalability necessary to support a growing number of connected devices around the world, Blueair rapidly developed and deployed its HealthProtect product line using an IoT system on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Building on AWS enables enhanced security and privacy for Blueair\u2019s customers and supports releases of new and upgraded features so that every air purifier continues to deliver value throughout its life span. \u201cFreedom to breathe clean, healthy air as nature intended is our promise to consumers,\u201d says Johan Alvenberg, Global IoT program lead at Blueair. \u201cBy proactively monitoring the air quality and ensuring 24/7 protection against harmful pollutants, we are doing just that. For the tech savvy we have also added smart, premium usability and functions.\u201d\n\nSolution walk-through\n\nBlueair built a complete end-to-end IoT platform on AWS in record time and scaled globally with ease to reach customers in more regions.\n\nCentralizing device management on AWS IoT Core\n\nWhen implementing the HealthProtect product line, Blueair opted to use AWS IoT Core as a central point for managing its growing system of connected devices. From there, it used microservices to store air-quality data and support functionalities such as voice assistance through Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Integration for AWS IoT and 1-Click filter reordering through Amazon Dash Replenishment. The company also introduced a SmartFilter feature, which calculates each filter\u2019s life span, tracks its life cycle, and reminds the customer to replace it when the time comes. It\u2019s simple for customers to automate the reordering of replacement filters either directly from Blueair or through third parties, such as Amazon Dash Replenishment, so customers always have a high level of air purification.\n\nTo engage with their home devices, customers use the Blueair app, which communicates using Amazon API Gateway \u2014a fully managed service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs. Customers can ultimately engage with the device itself by way of Device Shadow, a feature of AWS IoT Core. Device shadows store the latest state of a connected device, which can be read or set at any time, even when an air purifier is turned off. This is critical for supporting the HealthProtect air purifier\u2019s GermShield function, which detects germ-prone environments and kills bacteria and viruses, even when the device is on standby. For security, Blueair leveraged AWS IoT Device Defender and its machine learning feature, ML Detect, to easily implement always-on, proactive security, ensuring the devices were always safe, secured, and fully functional.\n\nFor its computing needs, Blueair uses AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service that enables developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Finally, it securely stores data, including air-quality information, on Amazon DynamoDB, a serverless NoSQL database. The security features built into all AWS services enable secure communication among Blueair\u2019s devices, its mobile app, and AWS. Maintaining high standards for protecting customer privacy has never been simpler for Blueair.\n\nOnce architecture and business requirements were clear, Blueair was able to bring HealthProtect air purifiers from development to initial sales to customers\u2019 homes in less than one year\u2014an acceleration of their product development timeline. Since the turnaround time for new products was previously greater than 1 year, the company achieved a shorter timeline. Not only did Blueair speed time to market, the solution also enables continuous innovation without service disruption to its customers.\n\nConclusion\n\nPlanning for cleaner air on a global scale\n\nBy building a new line of connected air purifiers from the ground up on AWS, Blueair gained the ability to scale up securely, cost efficiently, and with the robust foundation needed to regularly release new features to a growing network of devices. Eventually, the company expects to support millions of connected air purifiers around the world.\n\nBlueair also plans to use artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities on AWS to unlock new, innovative potential. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a premium brand,\u201d says Alvenberg. \u201cOn AWS, we can deliver premium digitally connected experiences as well.\u201d\n\nLearn more about connected home solutions built on AWS IoT.\n\nAbout the authors\n\nSyed Rehan is a Sr. Specialist Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services and is based in London.

Learn More .\n\nOver the last 12 months, Unilever (LSE: ULVR) shares have risen about 16%. However, this figure doesn\u2019t tell the full story. Since 9 September they\u2019ve actually fallen around 12%. So what\u2019s going on with the blue-chip FTSE 100 stock right now? And is this a buying opportunity?\n\nA bond proxy\n\nIn my view, the share price weakness can be largely attributed to interest rates. You see, Unilever\u2019s often seen as a \u2018bond proxy\u2019. This is a type of stock that\u2019s a bit like a bond in that it\u2019s defensive in nature and it pays regular income.\n\nNow when interest rates are falling, and yields on bonds are dropping, bond proxy stocks often do well. That\u2019s because their dividends become more attractive to investors.\n\nHowever, when rates are rising, or expected to stay higher for longer, bond proxies often underperform. That\u2019s because many investors opt to invest in bonds instead (bonds are safer than stocks).\n\nNow, if we look at the Unilever chart, it had a brilliant first three quarters of 2024, rising about 27%. Some of this performance was down to strong results, but for most of this period, investors were expecting major central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to cut rates rapidly.\n\nIn the fourth quarter however, it started to become apparent that due to several variables (eg inflation and economic growth), interest rates may stay higher for longer. And government bond yields surged.\n\nThe yield on 10-year gilts, for example, jumped from 3.7% in mid-September to 4.6% at the end of the year. It was a similar story with US Treasuries with yields on 10-year Treasuries surging from 3.6% to 4.6%.\n\nAll of a sudden, investors could lock in relatively attractive bond yields for the long term. As a result, Unilever shares lost some of their appeal.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nWorth buying?\n\nAre the shares worth considering for an investment portfolio today? I think so.\n\nRecently, the company\u2019s been performing pretty well, thanks to a focus on efficiency by the new management team. And this year, the group\u2019s expected to generate solid earnings growth.\n\nCurrently, earnings per share (EPS) for 2025 are expected to come in at 309 euro cents. That\u2019s 6.3% higher than the forecast for 2024 (290 euro cents).\n\nMeanwhile, the valuation has come down recently. We\u2019re now looking at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 18, which I think is relatively attractive given this company\u2019s brilliant long-term track record (annual returns of nearly 10% over the last decade).\n\nAs for the dividend yield, it\u2019s risen to around 3.5% after the recent share price fall. That\u2019s obviously not the highest out there but it\u2019s decent, especially when you consider that Unilever tends to raise its payout by about 5% a year.\n\nOf course, if interest rates move higher in the near term, I\u2019d expect the stock to continue underperforming. Taking a long-term view however, I think the stock has the potential to generate solid returns when dividends are factored in.",

The grant winners, selected from 50+ applicants, offer novel solutions promoting climate resilience.\n\nDeshifarmer is an agri-tech platform that supports smallholder farmers struggling to access the market and facing high levels of food waste. Its end-to-end solutions connect farmers directly to consumers, cutting out intermediaries and increasing farmers' income, while ensuring safe, traceable food products for consumers. TRANSFORM's support will be pivotal in scaling the enterprise's initiatives, promoting climate-smart agriculture on a larger scale and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Deshifarmer aims to benefit 3,000 farmers and 20,000 consumers in its first year working with TRANSFORM.\n\nTechno Plastic Solution tackles ocean plastic pollution by increasing collection infrastructure in coastal communities and empowering its members with training and efficient collection equipment. With TRANSFORM's help, the enterprise will launch a pilot programme in Kuakata to target discarded fishing nets and PET bottles specifically. It is projected to collect as much as 100 tonnes of plastic waste monthly.\n\nLaunched in October 2023, the Bangladesh Climate Challenge is an initiative to identify and support enterprises working on climate resilience. In addition to grant funding, TRANSFORM supports visionary enterprises in scaling their solutions through business insights, practical experiences, resources, and networks.\n\nThis is the first time that Unilever, the UK Government and EY have worked together locally in Bangladesh to find and select entrepreneurs for the programme. It follows similar initiatives that TRANSFORM recently ran in India and East Africa.\n\nRaviraj Durwas, South Asia Lead at TRANSFORM, Hindustan Unilever, said:\n\n\"Local impact enterprises, with on-the-ground knowledge and insights, are uniquely positioned to address their regional challenges. Therefore, it was important to us at TRANSFORM that we worked with the SAJIDA Foundation and British Asian Trust to find the best innovators from local communities that we otherwise might not have access to. Fuelling their efforts with financial support, mentorship and supply chain access is how we can drive meaningful social and environmental change.\"\n\nSarah Iqbal, Head of Impact Partners at the SAJIDA Foundation said:\n\nWe are delighted to have partnered with TRANSFORM and the British Asian Trust to catalyse real change in Bangladesh. We look forward to seeing how the grantees scale their business and impact,\n\nMarjan Nur, Climate and Environment Adviser at British High Commission Dhaka said:\n\n\"As a major development partner, we know that we cannot achieve the ambitious UN SDG goals with aid alone. We need cross-sector collaboration that draws on the best of our resources, networks and know-how. Equally important, we must ensure decision-making is put in the hands of local champions who understand the local context best. This Challenge exemplifies our efforts to do both.\"\n\nPragyal Singh, Consulting Partner, at EY India said:\n\n\"Social enterprises hold some of the best ideas to drive systematic change and progress against the UN SDGs; and believe that holistic support via funding and business consultancy is key to scaling their impact. TRANSFORM was established to leverage the power of public-private collaboration and do just that for Deshifarmer and Techno Plastic Solution. We look forward to seeing how they can improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in the region and tackle ocean plastic pollution.\"\n\nEshrat Waris, Bangladesh Director from the British Asian Trust said:\n\n\"Following its agenda of climate resilience, the British Asian Trust is proud to support TRANSFORM in unlocking Bangladesh's circular economy potential with innovative, local solutions.\"\n\nTRANSFORM has supported 10 other enterprises in Bangladesh, reaching over three million lives. This includes Bhumijo an impact enterprise dedicated to providing hygienic public toilets and wash facilities for all, serving over 7,000 people a day; who are designing and piloting a scalable refill station distribution model to counteract the problem of plastic pollution caused by single-use sachets.",

Ask The Drum\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an anti-establishment brand with a fun vibe to it in a very scrappy and enjoyable way that permeates the brand\u2019s culture \u2013 that is where we are going back to,\u201d Bodner says.\n\nBodner, who advised the private equity firm Nexus Capital on the acquisition from Unilever, was brought into Dollar Shave Club as chief executive officer to reinvigorate the brand. \u201cWhat attracted me is where we\u2019re going, which is back to where we came from.\u201d\n\nUnilever bought Dollar Shave Club in 2016 for $1bn but sold it just seven years later after the brand performed below \u201cexpectations.\u201d Before the sale, Unilever said that Dollar Shave Club, \u201cwhile marginally profitable, continued to decline in a fiercely competitive market.\u201d Despite its brand fame, Unilever found that it couldn\u2019t turn notoriety into sales.\n\nBodner says that while he has respect for Unilever, the conglomerate \u201cneutered the vibe and fun of what the brand stood for. It just didn\u2019t fit in a vanilla corporate entity.\u201d It\u2019s a common narrative when challenger brands get brought out by conglomerate brands, he says. Brands such as Dollar Shave Club and Liquid Death are \u201crebellious\u201d and \u201cjester\u201d brands that are better off as independents.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only the vibes that got squashed in the Unilever years. Bodner adds that innovation stilted and the price was no longer as competitive as pre-acquisition.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a lot of focus on the commercial dynamics and how you execute. In larger companies, brands sometimes get lost. If it\u2019s just a brand in personal care and there are 20 brands in personal care, you just get lost.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow an independent entity backed by private equity, Dollar Shave Club has assembled a team dedicated to getting the brand \u201cback where it needs to be.\u201d\n\nDollar Shave Club shot to fame in 2012 after its founder, Michael Dubin, dropped a viral launch video that poked fun at the razor industry. The years that followed saw it build a name for itself using witty and anti-establishment advertising.\n\nThis week, Dollar Shave Club released its first brand campaign since the acquisition, which Bodner has dubbed as a \u201crelaunch\u201d campaign. The 60-second spot, titled \u2018The Club,\u2019 reimagines the brand as a private members club with a doorman showing around a potential recruit who tells him that any body size, shape or hair preference is accepted.\n\nThe idea behind the campaign, Bodner says, is to \u201cbring back to the emotion of the club \u2013 no matter what your body type or your demographic, you can all fit in the club as we accept everybody.\u201d\n\nThe ad, which will roll out on CTV, YouTube, Spotify and podcasts from January 6, was created in-house. This first iteration of \u2018The Club\u2019 is just through advertising but Bodner teases that the team has been working up ideas for in-person activations and even a more permanent physical space in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertising is \u201ccritical\u201d for the future success of Dollar Shave Club, Bodner tells The Drum. \u201cDollar Shave Club has the scale of a fairly sizable business, but the mentality is startup and, within that, we know we need to drive more awareness of the brand to get it back to its roots, so advertising is going to be paramount to driving our growth.\u201d\n\nBodner is planning a big advertising push in the first quarter of the year and then a second hit in the second half of the year. From there the business will take the learnings and optimize for an even bigger push in 2026. Beyond advertising, the ambition is for Dollar Shave Club to expand into shaving adjacent categories, work up an offering for women and, further in the future, acquire other brands.\n\n\u201cThere was a period where it was incredibly successful under Michael Dubin, there was a period with Unilever where it tried to do certain things that, frankly, didn\u2019t work, and it didn\u2019t work in its culture and its corporate behemoth entity,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s a relaunch, getting back to where some of the roots of where Michael Dubin was.\u201d",

Shopping for food (credit: INGIMAGE)\n\n\u201cHigh inflation contributed to price increases, but in some cases, it seems that prices rose beyond actual expenses, and many companies also implemented operational efficiency measures during this period.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to ignore the fact that the increase in operational profit margins in the industry largely reflects its high level of concentration,\u201d he added. \u201cIt seems that the right balance between encouraging business activity and tempering the cost of living has yet to be found.\u201d\n\nCompanies facing criticism\n\nCompanies that raised prices on food products have been criticized over the past year. Some of the biggest firms in the sector, including Tnuva, Osem, and Strauss, have raised prices \u2013 in some cases multiple times.\n\nLast month, Strauss said it would increase its prices on chocolate and coffee as much as 18%. Unilever quickly followed suit, announcing price hikes of 12% to 16%. In June, Unilever raised its prices for chocolate and other products.\n\nSome companies have cited increased costs of raw materials to justify the higher prices. Their critics have said decreases in the prices of raw materials did not result in lower prices, adding that some of the increases in the cost of raw materials seemed to be unrelated to subsequent price hikes.

They don\u2019t have to be related when you are a mega-monopoly.\u201d\n\nCentralization in Israel\u2019s food sector has hurt competition, she said.\n\nThe high and rising cost of living has caused trepidation for Israelis as the new year brought with it tax and price hikes and increased utility costs. The war has been one of several factors that have created an environment that enables companies to increase prices as public and political attention is elsewhere, according to critics of the price hikes.\n\nLiam Adiv/Maariv contributed to this report.",

The owner of Lakm\u00e9 is expected to ink the deal within the current financial year, the people said.\n\nWhile discussions are underway for a majority control, HUL intends to buy a 100% stake in the company over a period of two-to-three years, said one of the people on condition of anonymity, citing the talks are private. Currently, Minimalist counts Peak XV Partners as investors, who own a 27% stake, while the remaining stake is owned by founder brothers Rahul and Mohit Yadav.\n\n\"In line with our business strategy, on an ongoing basis, we evaluate various strategic opportunities for growth and expansion of our business,\" an HUL spokesperson told NDTV Profit in an emailed response. \"We will make appropriate disclosures whenever there is any material development that requires disclosure under applicable laws.\"\n\nThe deal, if it materialises, will rank among the largest deals in the skincare industry in recent years. Besides, it underscores the trend of consolidation among new-age brands\u2014which often encounter difficulties in scaling beyond a certain point\u2014being acquired by legacy FMCG companies.\n\nMinimalist, however, stands out as a rare outlier. Founded in 2020, Minimalist sells a range of ingredient-based products, including sunscreen and serum. The Jaipur-based direct-to-consumer brand generated a revenue of Rs 350 crore in the financial year-ending March 2024, an 86% jump over last year, according to Tracxn.\n\nData showed that Minimalist has remained consistently profitable since fiscal 2021 amid competition from similar brands such as Dr. Sheth\u2019s, The Derma Co., Dot & Key, and WOW Skin Science. Many Gen Zs would agree that Minimalist popularised cheaper alternatives to the much-hyped super serums in India, often inspired by Canadian skincare brand The Ordinary.",

The story will be updated based on their responses. Its investor, Peak XV Partners, declined to comment on the matter.\n\nFounded in 2020 by siblings Mohit and Rahul Yadav, Minimalist develops and sells clinically tested skincare, haircare and body care products using \u2018active\u2019 ingredients.\n\nThe Jaipur-based startup has raised about $15 Mn from investors like Peak XV Partners, Twenty Nine Capital Partners, among others. Interestingly, Unilever Ventures picked up some stake in the startup in its Series A funding round in 2021. According to reports, the funding round valued the startup in a range of $75 Mn to $80 Mn.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023-24 (FY24), the startup\u2019s net profit more than doubled to INR 10.9 Cr from INR 5.2 Cr in FY23 on the back of a strong growth in its top line.\n\nPertinent to mention that the beauty and personal care segment constitutes about 37% of HUL\u2019s revenues.

Skin cleansing declined primarily on account of pricing actions taken during the year,\u201d the company said in its investor presentation.\n\nIf materialised, this would mark the first acquisition by the FMCG major in this space.\n\nIts last startup stake acquisition was of two D2C nutrition brands OZiva and Wellbeing Nutrition back in 2022. While it bought OZiva for INR 264.28 Cr, it acquired a 19.8% equity stake in Wellbeing Nutrition through primary infusion and secondary buyout for a consideration of INR 70 Cr.\n\nSource Link",

According to sources briefed on the matter, the deal, once finalized, will mark one of the largest acquisitions in the D2C skincare industry in recent years.\n\nIf successful, this acquisition will represent a meteoric rise in Minimalist\u2019s valuation, which has grown from \u20b9630 crore (around $75 million) to \u20b93,000 crore ($350 million) in just three years. This growth is attributed to the company\u2019s consistent revenue increase and a stable profit profile.\n\nMinimalist, founded by Mohit Yadav and Rahul Yadav, has been a standout performer in the D2C sector, maintaining profitability for at least four consecutive years. The company\u2019s revenue nearly doubled in FY24, reaching \u20b9350 crore compared to \u20b9184 crore in FY23. Profits also more than doubled during the same period, rising from \u20b95 crore to \u20b911 crore.\n\nThe startup\u2019s financial discipline is further evident in its valuation metrics. Minimalist is commanding a revenue multiple of approximately 10X, significantly higher than the 4-6X multiple typically seen in similar D2C deals.\n\nResponding to media queries an HUL spokesperson said: \u201cIn line with our business strategy, on an ongoing basis, we evaluate various strategic opportunities for the growth and expansion of our business. We will make appropriate disclosures whenever there is any material development that requires disclosure under applicable laws.\u201d\n\nHUL\u2019s interest in Minimalist comes three years after Unilever Ventures, the venture capital arm of its parent company, invested \u20b9110 crore ($15 million) in the startup to scale its operations.\n\nThis potential acquisition aligns with a broader trend of FMCG giants acquiring new-age brands to tap into younger customer bases and expand their digital footprints. Companies such as Marico, ITC, and Dabur have also made similar moves, acquiring brands like Beardo, Plix, and Yogabar.\n\nWhile many of these deals have been characterized as slump sales, with D2C startups unable to scale sustainably, Minimalist stands out as an exception. Its robust financial performance and market discipline position it as a strategic and high-value acquisition for HUL.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to provide HUL with tech capabilities and access to Minimalist\u2019s growing customer base while enabling Minimalist to leverage HUL\u2019s vast network and resources for rapid scaling.\n\nMinimalist\u2019s founders, Mohit Yadav and Rahul Yadav, have not commented on the potential deal.\n\nFollow Startup Story",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nDove unveiled its first body confidence program for women, timing the launch to the period when many set New Year\u2019s resolutions that focus on weight loss, dieting and other beauty-oriented goals, according to a press release.\n\nThe online program looks to combat what the CPG marketer calls \u201cthe pursuit of perfect,\u201d or the chase for an idealized image that can harm self-esteem. Prior research conducted by Dove found that millennial women have the lowest body confidence compared to other generations.\n\nThe Dove Self-Esteem Project for Women lives on the brand\u2019s website and offers videos, an activity workbook and other tips. Dove is also encouraging followers to write down and then rip up resolutions on sticky notes and post their videos to TikTok as part of a #NewYearsUnresolution social media push.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nA new year means a new body confidence-focused initiative from Dove, which for over two decades has built out a \u201cReal Beauty\u201d platform that challenges unhealthy image standards for women. Rather than running a conventional paid advertising campaign, the Unilever-owned brand is entering 2025 with an online educational resource that intends to help consumers change their perceptions of New Year\u2019s resolutions that tend to center on goals like dieting, weight loss and appearing more youthful.\n\nThe Dove Self-Esteem Project for Women, the first of its kind from Dove, covers four core topics: Healing the relationship with one\u2019s own body; defining body confidence and what it looks like in day-to-day life; addressing what influences and impacts body confidence, including external societal pressures; and redefining beauty on one\u2019s own terms. Naturally, Dove products could play a role on some of those self-empowerment journeys.\n\nThe initiative follows findings published by Dove last year that revealed millennial women, a core target audience, have particularly poor self-esteem. The Real State of Beauty Report, the most extensive research published by the brand to date, also showed that one-third of women surveyed would trade a year of their life to achieve their conception of a \u201cperfect\u201d body. Furthermore, 69% said they would avoid social engagements due to low confidence in their appearance, contributing to a sense of alienation.\n\nAlong with the online program rollout, Dove is pushing consumers to put themselves out there with a #NewYearsUnresolution drive on TikTok, an app known for setting beauty and cosmetics trends among demographics like Gen Z and millennials.\n\nOther brands are stepping up efforts to tackle New Year\u2019s resolutions that can be unrealistic. RXBar, the protein snack bar that boasts a simple list of ingredients, is touring around a B.S. Blocker Truck as a counter to \u201cNew Year, New You\u201d marketing and asking consumers to report ads they perceive as toxic, which the vehicle will try to block out.\n\nDove is coming off a year of change in its marketing leadership. Alessandro Manfredi, a longtime Unilever marketer and an architect of \u201cReal Beauty,\u201d departed the personal care company in July.",

The brand sells its offerings through its own website and major e-commerce platforms, including Amazon, Nykaa and Flipkart.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe startup has seen rapid growth in recent years, with its revenue jumping to Rs 347 crore in the 2023-24 fiscal year from Rs 184 crore in 2022-23.\n\nDuring the same period, its profits more than doubled to Rs 10.83 crore, reflecting a trend of strong financial discipline that has positioned the company as a rare profitable player in the D2C sector.\n\nHUL's portfolio expansion\n\nHUL, which previously acquired a 51% stake in D2C nutrition brand Oziva, appears eager to grow its digital business by adding high-growth startups to its portfolio.\n\nThe company acknowledged that, as part of its broader strategy, it routinely evaluates potential acquisitions but did not confirm any final decision regarding Minimalist. Industry sources suggest the valuation multiple for Minimalist could stand at around 10 times its annual revenue\u2014significantly higher than the 4-6 times range commonly seen in similar deals.\n\nBacking from notable investors\n\nPeak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital) is among Minimalist\u2019s major external investors, holding a 27.9% stake. The co-founders together own roughly 62% of the company.\n\nHaving raised only about $17 million, Minimalist\u2019s remarkable jump in valuation\u2014from around Rs 630 crore to a potential Rs 3,000 crore\u2014reflects its rapid expansion and steady profitability.\n\nThis comes at a time when major consumer companies are increasingly absorbing new-age brands to tap younger consumers and accelerate innovation. HUL\u2019s interest follows similar moves by Marico, ITC and Dabur, which have also acquired or invested in digital-first brands.\n\nWhile several D2C startups struggle to scale beyond a certain point, leading to what some call \u201cslump sales,\u201d Minimalist stands out as an example of consistent growth and profitability.",

It\u2019s about making sure that we are clear about the business case for sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not an NGO, we\u2019re a corporation, so we have to be clear about sustainability as a performance driver, rather than just a good thing to do for society. That\u2019s a key shift we\u2019ve tried to make in recent years.\n\n\u201cI think where Unilever perhaps overstepped a few years ago was talking about brand purpose in isolation to everything else you need for a brand to grow and be successful. You need great innovation, you need the right pricing point, you need it to be available.\u201d\n\nIn October that year, Schumacher detailed Unilever\u2019s plans to stop \u201cforce-fitting\u201d brand purpose across its entire portfolio, expressing his belief that the company\u2019s sustainability efforts had been \u201cspread too thinly\u201d.\n\nThen in April 2024, Unilever\u2019s chief executive scaled back on ESG targets, prompting scrutiny from environmental activists.\n\nIn a Q1 2024 trading statement, Schumacher justified the revised targets by saying that Unilever was \u201cnot watering down\u201d but instead \u201cdoubling down in those areas that most materially impact the business and where a more focused approach will enable us to drive real change at scale\u201d.\n\nThis story first appeared on PRWeek U.K.",

Royal Warrants are removed if a product is no longer manufactured or available; or if the goods or services are no longer required. Presumably, the King\u2019s household has different needs to that of his predecessor, so it\u2019s understandable that the list of suppliers would be amended accordingly.",

This research started back in 2021 and in 2023, prototypes of the machine were developed which are fit and suitable for Bangladesh,\" he said.\n\nThe URefill machine is designed to make sustainable shopping easy and accessible.\n\n\"It is simple. Once a customer buys our liquid products, be it Lifebuoy, Dove, or Sunsilk, they do not necessarily have to purchase another container in the future. They can bring their own container, simply access an URefill machine where they can refill the product in their container as per their requirement. No new plastic container is involved in this process. Customers get their products at a more affordable price and the environment is not burdened with more plastic waste. Win-win for all of us,\" Shadman explained.\n\nInitiatives like URefill have the potential to make a long-term impact among consumers.\n\nBy using the same bottle repeatedly, consumers become an active part of a new beginning - a much-anticipated industry-wide shift against plastic waste. It promotes the practice of reusing plastic packaging. It is not only confined to the idea of everyday convenience but also about making sustainability a lifelong habit.\n\nBy refilling, consumers reduce their plastic footprint by 90% each time they use the URefill machine.\n\n\"It is wonderful to see an overwhelming response from our customers and partners. This has been initially rolled out in Badda markets; we are scaling up our initiative and rolling out more machines in the coming months to meet the growing interest of consumers and retail shops,\" Shadman said.\n\nThe initiative also provides significant savings, with refills offering about 20% savings per serve, compared to purchasing regular packs.\n\nUnilever Bangladesh has initially rolled out URefill machines in Badda markets. \"We are scaling up our initiative and rolling out more machines in the coming months to meet the growing interest of consumers and retail shops,\" said Shadman.\n\nThe potential for URefill extends beyond urban markets.\n\n\"Any kind of FMCG liquid products such as handwash liquid, dishwash liquid or detergent liquid can be part of the refill machine. This model can be expanded to other options like B2B, university campuses, hostels, and industrial factories for flexible usages,\" he added.",

            "content": "New Delhi: In little more than a couple of years, quick commerce has turned into the great hope of India\u2019s startup landscape. Zomato, Zepto and Swiggy dominate, even as Big Basket, Amazon and others are trying to muscle in. In this beeline for a slice of retail, what\u2019s going to happen to that staple of the Indian street\u2014the neighbourhood kirana store?\n\nWhen big box stores such as Big Basket entered the Indian market, kirana stores were predicted to be on their way out, mirroring the trend in more developed markets such as the US, where small mom-and-pop shops simply couldn\u2019t compete with the scale and pricing power of a Walmart.\n\nAs of 2023-24, according to data compiled by the National Sample Survey, there were around 22.8 million \u2018unincorporated\u2019 establishments conducting some sort of trade. The vast majority of these\u2014between 80% and 90%\u2014were specifically in retail trade (kiranas), employing an average of less than two workers. And while the number of such retail outlets grew by about 230,000 in a year between 2022-23 and 2023-24, their count fell by a similar number between 2015-16 and 2023-24.\n\nThe government\u2019s Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (2023-24), the data that was released late last month, covers three broad sectors. These are trade (of which 80-90%, as pointed out earlier, are retail trade shops); manufacturing, and \u2018other services\u2019 (establishments engaged in services sectors other than retail).\n\nAll these establishments are tiny. On average, they employ barely 1-2 people, including the proprietor. On average, they do \u20b93 lakh to \u20b97 lakh of business a year, depending on whether they are located in rural or urban areas. The survey does not cover construction firms or the agricultural sector.\n\nIn 2010-11, trade establishments accounted for around 36% of all unincorporated establishments. Five years later, and even as late as 2021-22, that share was relatively constant. But in the two years since that share has declined by about 6.6 percentage points.\n\nThe declining importance of kiranas in overall retail in India shows up in the macro numbers as well. As of 2015-16, the trade sector, comprising retail and wholesale trade, generated around \u20b913 trillion of GDP (or, more precisely, gross value added). Of this, 34% was accounted for by unincorporated enterprises or kiranas, a share that had risen by 4 percentage points from 2010-11. But by 2023-24, this share had fallen sharply to around 22%.\n\nSo, are kiranas on the way out? It\u2019s too early to say. The unique economics of quick commerce means that the most intense competition is likely to be felt in specific, highly dense and urbanized large cities, at least for now.\n\nQuick economics\n\nUltimately, the \u2018decline\u2019 of kiranas may have come about from a combination of factors\u2014for example, demonetization rather than just quick commerce.\n\nBut as has been widely pointed out, quick commerce strikes at the heart of the kirana business\u2014groceries and daily staples. By cutting out not just traditional retailers but also wholesalers and distributors and sourcing directly from manufacturers like ITC or Hindustan Unilever, quick commerce can essentially cannibalize all those juicy margins and still offer prices below that of the traditional retail shop. The extent to which e-commerce, in general, has affected the retail market in India is indicated by the fact that for a company like ITC, \u2018digitally enabled\u2019 sales and \u2018modern trade\u2019 accounted for 31% of the company\u2019s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales in 2023-24, up from 17% in 2019-20.\n\nZomato\u2019s quick commerce business, for instance, built on the acquisition of Blinkit, saw its average monthly transacting customers rise from 2.9 million in 2022-23 to 5.1 million in 2023-24. In 2023-24, each of its \u2018dark\u2019 stores averaged a gross order value of about \u20b98 lakh per day. According to a Mint story, a survey by NIQ of 4,500 customers in 16 cities, 31% of urban Indians use quick commerce for their primary grocery shopping.\n\nView Full Image A file photo of Albinder Dhindsa, CEO of Blinkit.\n\nThis is a business driven by cheap labour, especially \u2018gig\u2019 workers. They, in effect, implement the core proposition of quick commerce\u2014home delivery of everything from daily groceries to iPhones within 10-15 minutes. At Zomato, for instance, an average of 67,000 delivery workers a month delivered about 203 million orders in 2023-24.\n\nWhat adds to the bottom line and attractiveness to investors is that, in line with other such platforms globally, none of the quick commerce businesses treat such workers as employees. Thus, they avoid the statutory employment benefits. While such workers are called \u2018gig\u2019 workers, they are, in effect, the same as older forms of informal or casual labour, but working for online platforms instead.\n\nKiranas in flux\n\nCurrently, the economics of quick commerce means the biggest bang for their buck comes in dense, urban areas. Here, quick commerce companies can locate their dark stores to achieve a minimum level of business to be viable. According to the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), which represents FMCG distributors, around 200,000 kirana stores have shut down over the last year, with 45% of those closures being in metros and a further 30% in tier-I cities.\n\nView Full Image According to the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation, around 200,000 kirana stores have shut down over the last year. (Rajesh Kumar/Mint)\n\nThe National Sample Survey (NSS) data on unincorporated enterprises doesn\u2019t break down the data by metros. While it does have a rural-urban split, that data has not been released for 2023-24 yet. Between 2015-16 and 2022-23, the previous period, retail outlets in urban areas fell by 9.4%, or 1.15 million outlets. Between 2010-11 and 2015-16, in contrast, such outlets in urban areas rose by close to 20%. Interestingly though, in 2022-23, kiranas in rural areas fell by around 56,000 outlets from a year earlier.\n\nWhat about urban areas across states?\n\nInterestingly, the data shows a mixed bag, with both poorer and richer states seeing an increase in kiranas, and a serious decrease as well. Jharkhand, for instance, saw a 21% increase in unincorporated trade establishments between 2015-16 and 2022-23. But so did Gujarat (19%), a much richer state, over the same period. At the other end of the spectrum, it\u2019s a similar story. Uttar Pradesh, the state with the largest number of such establishments, saw a dramatic decline of 26% over a seven-year period, but so did Karnataka, again a richer state (a 32% decline over the same period).\n\nEmployment report\n\nIn the normal course of economic growth, the demise of small stores might be less worrying if the workers employed there find gainful employment elsewhere. Unincorporated trade establishments, such as the one surveyed by the NSS, accounted for 39.7 million workers in 2023-24, about a million more than in 2015-16. So, while their relative importance has declined, the sector is still growing, albeit more slowly.\n\nBut over the last decade, small enterprises in general\u2014across manufacturing, trade and other services\u2014suffered a series of setbacks. It started with demonetization in 2016, which hit a largely cash-driven economy; the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) in 2017, and finally the covid-19 crisis in 2020.\n\nThis is visible in the NSS data. Across all three major sectors covered by the survey\u2014trade, manufacturing and \u2018other services\u2019\u2014growth in value added for the average establishment between 2010-11 and 2015-16 was 9-13% per year. But in the period after that, the average annual growth in value added fell to around 3-4% per year. Even the post-covid \u2018bump\u2019 to the rest of the economy seems to have given the small enterprises sector a pass.\n\nUnincorporated trade establishments, such as the one surveyed by the NSS, accounted for 39.7 million workers in 2023-24, about a million more than in 2015-16.\n\nWith employment in such enterprises, the story becomes more complex. For trade and small-scale manufacturing, it\u2019s a similar story as with value added. The trade sector saw employment grow by less than 1 percentage point per annum between 2015-16 and 2023-24, while manufacturing saw a decline of 0.84% per annum. With \u2018other services\u2019 it\u2019s a different story. In this sector, employment actually fell between 2010-11 and 2015-16 but then rebounded strongly in the eight years after, growing at a relatively healthy 3.2% per annum.\n\nWhy this contrast? Both trade and manufacturing are struggling in the face of intense competition, one from quick commerce formats, the other from large-scale manufacturing. This competition has always been there, but it has intensified in the last decade or so. In this scenario, \u2018other services\u2019 has become a refuge for businesses and workers who have had to exit the other two sectors and have failed to find employment elsewhere, in larger-scale manufacturing or the more \u2018organized\u2019 services.\n\nAn optimistic prediction might be that the coming fall in unincorporated sector employment will be offset by the increasing use of gig work elsewhere. For instance, a range of estimates predict a huge jump in employment in the \u2018gig\u2019 economy. A Niti Aayog report in 2022 predicted that the total number of gig workers (which would include workers in non-platform sectors such as construction) would increase from around 6-7 million in 2020-21 to about 23.5 million by 2029-30. Again, \u2018gig\u2019 work is simply another word for workers who are in a more precarious \u2018informal\u2019 labour market with little job security or benefits.\n\nView Full Image The number of gig workers is expected to increase from around 6-7 million in 2020-21 to about 23.5 million by 2029-30. (Mint)\n\nAs the report itself points out, the share of \u2018gig\u2019 workers working in the \u2018organized\u2019 sector\u2014that is, large enterprises covered by labour laws and required to provide benefits to employees\u2014rose from 26% in 2011-12 to 38% by 2019-20. \u201cThus, there is a persistence of informal work relations in the sector. When we read this along with the trends in the organized sector, it can be seen informal work is now penetrating the organized sector workforce through the gig and platform modes of work.\"\n\nAnd while the \u2018informalization\u2019 of labour in the organized industry was earlier due to the increasing use of contract labour, the shift is now toward \u2018gig\u2019 or task-based forms of work, even in large industries, according to the report.\n\nAnd as this shift picks up pace, it will affect small enterprises to a greater degree, because the earlier competitive \u2018advantage\u2019 they had, of not being subject to labour laws because they were too small, is now gone. These are all variables that impact the landscape that kirana stores are a part of\u2014and chips away at their foundation.\n\nhowindialives.com is a search engine for public data",

            "content": "Unilever Bangladesh is driving a transformative shift in consumer behaviour with its innovative 'URefill' initiative, a machine designed to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainability.\n\nAs part of the company's ongoing commitment to sustainability, URefill aims to revolutionise how everyday products are purchased and used, making a significant impact on both environment and consumer habits.\n\nThe 'URefill Machine' is the first-ever refill machine designed for dispensing liquid products to consumers, says a statement.\n\n\"To tackle plastic pollution with the speed and urgency needed, we aim to create solutions appropriate for the local market, scalable and will inspire consumers to be a part of the refill-reuse revolution,\" said Shadman Sadikin, Marketing Director-Homecare at Unilever Bangladesh.\n\n\"Unilever Bangladesh has partnered with its global TRANSFORM initiative and Bopinc to design the URefill machine for the general trade environment. This research started back in 2021 and in 2023, prototypes of the machine were developed which are fit and suitable for Bangladesh,\" he said.\n\nThe URefill machine is designed to make sustainable shopping easy and accessible.\n\n\"It is simple. Once a customer buys our liquid products, be it Lifebuoy, Dove, or Sunsilk, they do not necessarily have to purchase another container in the future. They can bring their own container, simply access an URefill machine where they can refill the product in their container as per their requirement. No new plastic container is involved in this process. Customers get their products at a more affordable price and the environment is not burdened with more plastic waste. Win-win for all of us,\" Shadman explained.\n\nInitiatives like URefill have the potential to make a long-term impact among consumers.\n\nBy using the same bottle repeatedly, consumers become an active part of a new beginning - a much-anticipated industry-wide shift against plastic waste. It promotes the practice of reusing plastic packaging. It is not only confined to the idea of everyday convenience but also about making sustainability a lifelong habit.\n\nBy refilling, consumers reduce their plastic footprint by 90% each time they use the URefill machine.\n\n\"It is wonderful to see an overwhelming response from our customers and partners. This has been initially rolled out in Badda markets; we are scaling up our initiative and rolling out more machines in the coming months to meet the growing interest of consumers and retail shops,\" Shadman said.\n\nThe initiative also provides significant savings, with refills offering about 20% savings per serve, compared to purchasing regular packs.\n\nUnilever Bangladesh has initially rolled out URefill machines in Badda markets. \"We are scaling up our initiative and rolling out more machines in the coming months to meet the growing interest of consumers and retail shops,\" said Shadman.\n\nThe potential for URefill extends beyond urban markets.\n\n\"Any kind of FMCG liquid products such as handwash liquid, dishwash liquid or detergent liquid can be part of the refill machine. This model can be expanded to other options like B2B, university campuses, hostels, and industrial factories for flexible usages,\" he added.",

ET has compiled a list of 18 stocks for 2025, recommended by six leading brokers, covering large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap segments that could be outperformers during the year.LTP: Rs 1,593 | Target: Rs 1,880From a long-term perspective, Bharti Airtel is expected to keep gaining market share, driven by high penetration rates and minimal capex needs. Airtel's future growth looks promising with a stronger digital portfolio and increasing per-user data consumption. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock, supported by the company\u2019s superior margins, strong subscriber growth, and higher 4G conversions.LTP: Rs 720 Target: Rs 860Fortis presents a strong investment case, driven by impressive revenue growth and solid financial performance. The expected improvements in occupancy rates along with rising ARPOB and strategic brownfi eld expansions are set to signifi cantly enhance its profi tability. The company\u2019s leadership in key therapies such as cardiac and oncology, combined with rising insurance penetration in India, is expected to sustain strong demand for its services.LTP: Rs 172 | Target: Rs 215The bank appears to have restarted its growth journey, with demand-led growth visible in the core segments. As the revamped processes yield results and the bank begins pursuing growth in the non-core retail segment, we expect growth to improve further.LTP: Rs 2,327 | Target: Rs 3,200HUL aims to enhance its portfolio, focusing on beauty and wellness segments like skincare, haircare, and colour cosmetics through innovation and deeper market penetration. With significant rural exposure, the company is well-positioned to benefi t from increased government spending on rural development and a favourable base effect.LTP: Rs 1,282 | Target: Rs 1,600With easing LNG prices and the pricing power of the company, margins are likely to normalise going forward. Its valuations are compelling, given superior return ratios among the city gas distribution players. Going forward, we expect its growth momentum to sustain backed by its cost competitiveness and experienced management.LTP: Rs 1,573 | Target: Rs 2,639Sobha plans to launch 5.5 MSF of new projects in H2FY25, with a focus on Bengaluru, where easing approval challenges are driving faster launches. As a leading player in the mid-premium real estate segment, Sobha\u2019s extensive land bank across regions offers a strong growth cushion.LTP: Rs 1,885 | Target: Rs 2,250It is the second-largest Indian IT company having a full capability stack. The company will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of higher discretionary spending.LTP: Rs 930 | Target: Rs 1,150We are positive on JSPL on the back of capacity expansion, multiple margin accretion projects lined up and the lowest leverage among peers.LTP: Rs 822 | Target: Rs 950We believe Aegis, which captures the complete logistics value chain starting from sourcing and terminalling to retail distribution of LPG, would benefi t from increasing LPG penetration in the country.LTP: Rs 6,835 | Target: Rs 8,200Stock has de-rated 25% in the last one year as earnings growth decelerated. We believe it is now time to turn constructive with visibility of 20-25% earnings growth from FY26 onwards as sharp COF-led net interest margin pressures abate and credit costs eventually moderate from the second quarter of FY26 onwards.LTP: Rs 474 | Target: Rs 700With the rising claims ratios due to high medical infl ation, and disease incidences, STAR plans to take a price hike in 65-70% of its retail portfolio in FY25. On distribution, the strategy is to expand the agency force.LTP: Rs 3,235 | Target: Rs 4,000CEAT has signed an agreement to acquire Michelin's Camso OffHighway construction equipment bias tyre and tracks business. The acquisition, estimated to be 7-8% EPS accretive in FY26, is a strategic move to scale up CEAT's OHT vertical, expand its product portfolio, and gain access to a broad network of international OEMs and OHT distributors.LTP: Rs 1,924 | Target: Rs 2,300HCL is well-positioned to navigate the GenAI revolution, leveraging its strong healthcare and BFSI exposure. Among Tier-I players, HCL Tech\u2019s strengths in data engineering, ER&D, and ERP modernisation make it a key benefi ciary of the anticipated recovery in tech spending during 2025 and 2026.LTP: Rs 874 | Target: Rs 950The company is a frontrunner in the hospitality sector with its strategic vision, operational excellence, and innovative growth avenues. Its \u2018Accelerate 2030\u2019 plan highlights its ambitious growth strategy, with a focus on doubling its hotel portfolio to 700-plus hotels and driving 14% revenue CAGR.LTP: Rs 2,934 | Target: Rs 4,200The brokerage has become the third-largest discount broker by NSE active clients, driven by its cost-effi cient client acquisition strategy targeting the younger generation in Tier 2 and 3 towns. Diversifying into wealth management, loan distribution, AMC, and scaling up its AP channel set to enhance customer lifetime value and drive long-term value creation.LTP: Rs 1,283 | Target: Rs 1,490The bank has one of the best return ratios among private banks with RoA and RoE of 2.5% and 18.7% in FY24. We expect industry-leading return ratios to continue in the medium to long term on account of industry-leading credit growth and stable margin.LTP: Rs 3,470 | Target: Rs 3,800The high growth will be sustained due to a strong order book accretion and stable enquiry pipeline, gradual capacity expansion at the new Kheda plant and product range/geo expansion from Mabel acquisition in Chennai.LTP: Rs 724 | Target: Rs 1,013The leading flexible workspace provider in India plans to reach 135,000 seats by FY25-end, adding 30,000\u201340,000 seats annually thereafter.

            "content": "The lower volatility in the UK market presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly given its attractive dividend yields. The FTSE 100 offers a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK firms, provides slightly lower but still appealing income prospects. This setup allows investors to explore higher-growth sectors, such as smaller companies while benefiting from rising dividends. According to BlackRock, UK dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, aligning with long-term inflation. Stocks that consistently grow their dividends often have stable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, presented a rather interesting take on the UK market's limited exposure to technology stocks. He pointed out that this reduced exposure has made the UK stock market less volatile compared to the US, where technology stocks are a key driver of market fluctuations. Mould observed that, despite its criticisms, the UK market experienced a relatively stable summer compared to the US, attributing this to differences in valuation and the relative expectations of the two markets.\n\nLindsay Matcham, involved in futures sales trading at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, suggested that UK equities could appeal to investors seeking diversification. She noted that these stocks offer attractive valuations, strong dividend yields, and reduced concentration risk.\n\nThat said, investing in UK stocks can still be a worthwhile choice. While the UK market lacks significant technology companies, its equities in sectors like finance, energy, and mining provide diversification opportunities that complement the tech-heavy and highly valued US markets. In addition, the UK\u2019s index faces less risk from tariffs and trade restrictions. Goldman Sachs Research highlighted that UK equities could gain from various government measures, such as pension reforms aimed at boosting domestic investment in UK stocks and policies supporting homebuilding initiatives.\n\nIn recent years, investors have shown a preference for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies, over UK equities. Over the past decade, the British index has achieved a 6% annual total return compared to 13% for the US broader market. Analysts suggest that this underperformance is partly due to weak earnings, domestic political instability, and the absence of a significant technology sector in the UK market. However, a notable factor is the sharp decline in valuations as investors have steered away from UK stocks. Goldman Sachs remarked that the challenge is not a lack of interest from foreign investors, who currently hold about two-thirds of the UK market capitalization, but rather the limited participation of domestic investors in UK equities.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Champions List: 2024 Rankings by Yield . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) stands against the other U.K. dividend champions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nJanus Henderson\u2019s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted this upward trend, revealing that UK dividends reached approximately $86 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the $63.1 billion distributed in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we reviewed the UK CCC Dividend list, which highlights UK companies with the longest histories of dividend growth. This list is based on the structure of David Fish\u2019s US Dividend Champions spreadsheet and serves as a useful tool to help identify and screen dividend growth stocks in the UK. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 29 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA supermarket shelf overflowing with a variety of fast-moving consumer goods.\n\nUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL)\n\nDividend Yield as of December 29: 3.25%\n\nUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is a British multinational consumer goods company that offers a wide range of related products. In the first half of 2024, the company experienced a 4.1% increase in sales on an underlying basis, driven by three consecutive quarters of positive volume growth. Pricing adjustments were in line with expectations, showing a gradual decrease. Improved gross margins provided the company with the ability to invest more in innovation, resulting in a significant boost to overall profitability. Its operating profit reached \u20ac6.1 billion, reflecting a 17.1% year-over-year growth.\n\nUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL) has decided to abandon its plans to sell its \u20ac15 billion ice cream division to private equity firms and will instead focus on pursuing an independent public listing for the unit. Earlier this year, in March, the consumer goods company announced its intention to spin off its ice cream business and explore interest from private equity buyers for popular brands like Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Magnum, and Wall\u2019s. In the past 12 months, the stock has delivered a return of over 18.5%.\n\nHotchkis & Wiley Funds highlighted Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)\u2019s strong performance in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is one of the world\u2019s leading suppliers of consumer goods in the food, home care, and personal care categories, maintaining #1 or #2 market share over 75% of its business. With a new CEO and the involvement of an activist investor (Trian), Unilever is focused on execution and consistency, expecting low to mid-single digit volume-driven top line growth over the medium term, profit growth ahead of sales growth due to operating leverage and mix, and consistent return of cash to shareholders. Additionally, the company has announced plans to separate the Ice Cream business (13% of 2023 sales), which is expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and increase organic sales growth to 4-6% annually. Over the last quarter, the stock price reached a five-year high, as the company has continued to execute the plans laid out above. Unilever has not yet released their official third quarter results but has reiterated their confidence in achieving 3-5% organic sales growth for the full year, with the majority of this growth being driven by volume.\u201d\n\nUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL) also highlighted a strong performance in its cash segment, with free cash flow amounting to \u20ac2.2 billion during the period. By the end of the first half, the company had \u20ac4.97 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from \u20ac4.1 billion at the close of December 2023. The company's interim dividend comes in at \u00a30.3696 per share for a dividend yield of 3.25%, as of December 29.\n\nOf the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 22 hedge funds held stakes in Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), up from 21 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of roughly $2 billion. With over 16.7 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall UL ranks 5th on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of UL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Warrants are awarded to companies that regularly provide their goods or services to the Royal Household. Those companies can also display the Royal Arms on their packaging.\n\nThe latest list does not include Cadbury or Unilever, which owns multiple brands including Dove, Ben & Jerry's, Magnum and Hellmann's and Best Foods. No specific reasons were given for why the two companies were stripped of their warrants.\n\nCadbury said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d over losing its royal warrant for the first time in 170 years, per a recent statement obtained by Fortune.\n\nRelated It may be a rocky Easter for Cadbury as they face new child labor allegations\n\nThe royal warrant removals come after Unilever and Cadbury\u2019s parent company Mondelez (MDLZ) faced criticism from Ukraine\u2019s government for continuing to sell its products and make profits in Russia following the nation\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In June, activist group B4Ukraine wrote an open letter to Charles, urging him to get rid of royal warrants for several companies, namely Mondelez and Unilever. They said \u201cthe continued presence and financial support of these companies in Russia only serve to prolong the brutal war against Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhilst we are disappointed to be one of hundreds of other businesses and brands in the UK to not have a new warrant awarded, we are proud to have previously held one, and we fully respect the decision,\u201d Mondelez said in a statement.\n\nSimilarly, Unilever said: \u201cWe are very proud of the long history our brands have supplying the royal household and of the warrants they have been awarded during this time, most recently by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\u201d\n\nAccording to the royal family\u2019s website, warrants \u201cmay not be renewed if the quality or supply for the product or service is insufficient, as far as the relevant Royal Household is concerned.\u201d",

Unox\u2019s Noodles and Cup-a-Soup products are a good fit with the mini meals category and will therefore remain part of the total Unilever Foods portfolio.\n\nHeiko Schipper, president Unilever Foods, said: \u201cUnox is a beloved and iconic brand in the Netherlands and the decision to part with it has not been easy. The association with Dutch winter activities, such as the New Year\u2019s Dive in Scheveningen and ice-skating events, along with its distinctive orange hat branding and wide range of award-winning advertising campaigns, has cemented Unox\u2019s place in Dutch culture.\n\n\u201cZwan is a cherished brand in Belgium, associated with comfort and nostalgia and with quick and easy meals, making the brand a beloved part of everyday Belgium life. I am convinced that under Zwanenberg Food Group\u2019s ownership, Unox and Zwan will be able to quickly adapt to trends and remain relevant in this competitive market.\u201d\n\nSjoerd van der Laan, CEO of Zwanenberg Food Group, said: \u201cThe Unox and Zwan brands are a wonderful addition to our range. We are a broad food company with strong brands. After the acquisition of the Unilever factory in Oss in 2018, the acquisition of the Unox and Zwan brands is a great addition that fits in perfectly with our ambitions.\u201d\n\nThe deal includes the production of soup-in-pouch in the factory in Poznan.\n\nThe binding offer is subject to the usual closing conditions, regulatory requirements, and consultation processes.\n\nWe expect to complete the deal within 2025.\n\nThe deal is subject to usual closing conditions, regulatory requirements, and consultation processes.

However, companies like Renner, Hope, and Unilever are investing in diversity\u2014a market that continues to expand.\n\nBrazil\u2019s plus-size fashion segment is expected to generate R$15 billion by 2027, reflecting 75% growth over the past decade, according to a study by the Brazil Plus Size Association (ABPS).\n\n\u201cIn addition to fashion, Ashua, Renner\u2019s plus-size brand, is helping reshape how the market views and serves Brazilians\u2019 physical diversity,\u201d said Renata Altenfelder, chief marketing officer at Lojas Renner. According to her, Ashua was launched 2016 as an online retailer, offering versatile pieces in sizes L to 5XL. By 2018, the brand expanded into the brick-and-mortar segment, with 19 physical stores nationwide today.\n\n\u201cOur designs highlight curvy bodies, and we invest in research and studies of Brazilian body types to develop pieces based on real body shapes, aligning with our customers\u2019 biotype,\u201d Ms. Altenfelder said.\n\nHope Group also recognized that expanding sizes in its lingerie and pajama lines not only celebrates Brazilian women\u2019s bodies but also caters to a market with specific features and purchasing power. \u201cFor years, fashion adhered to narrow beauty standards, limiting options for different body types due to production, commercial, and cultural barriers. Hope believes diversity is positive, reflecting the variety of bodies and profiles representing Brazilian women,\u201d said Nat\u00e1lia Matuck, product manager at Hope.\n\nInitiatives that embrace body diversity are still rare among Brazil\u2019s vast fashion and beauty companies, highlighting the issue\u2019s sensitivity.\n\n\u201cBrands that won\u2019t find it normal to offer extended size ranges exclude a large segment of the population with purchasing power,\u201d said Juliana Ferraz, partner at Holding Clube, an experiential marketing company. Ms. Ferraz created the Body event, which explores body positivity and breaking beauty standards. In its third edition, held in October, the event attracted sponsors including Coca-Cola, Colcci Sport, Dove, Bradesco, and Nestl\u00e9. Over 2,000 people gathered at Instituto Tomie Ohtake in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cWe need to talk more about free bodies that can gain or lose weight but are always included in society and the consumer market,\u201d Ms. Ferraz said.\n\nThe body positivity movement emerged in the 1960s in the United States and has since evolved, attracting new voices and perspectives.\n\nIn Brazil, the debate around body diversity gained momentum through social media, becoming a platform for expression and resistance against conventional beauty standards.\n\nParadoxically, these same digital platforms promote diversity and reinforce the pursuit of beauty ideals, exposing users to unrealistic images. Now, a new challenge is emerging: the growing influence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to the 2024 Real State of Beauty report by Dove, based on interviews with over 33,000 participants across 20 countries, one in three women feels pressured to alter their appearance due to AI-driven beauty standards.\n\n\u201cAs we transition to an era where 90% of online content is expected to be AI-generated by 2025, we reaffirm our commitment to never use AI to create or distort the images of women featured in our advertisements,\u201d said Unilever CMO Andreza Graner.\n\nLast summer in Brazil, following research indicating that 51% of persons with disabilities and 42% of overweight individuals had avoided going to the beach due to structural limitations, Dove, in partnership with agency Soko (now Droga5), redesigned the classic folding beach chair to be larger and sturdier.\n\n\u201cTransforming the beach into an inclusive space for those who feel excluded reinforces the importance of aligning brand purpose with core strategy,\u201d said Brisa Vicente, co-president of Droga5.\n\nThe growing demand for discussions around body positivity helps explain the rise of events like Body, which grew from 350 attendees in its first edition in 2022 to over 2,000 this year. \u201cAn event with 75 female volunteers participating in panels and mentoring sessions on women\u2019s freedom and body liberation highlights the increasing relevance of the topic,\u201d said Bradesco CMO Nathalia Garcia. Ms. Garcia participated in a panel on finance and entrepreneurship. \u201cThe focus is body liberation, but the Body event also opens the floor for related topics like women\u2019s empowerment and financial education,\u201d she explained. Among this year\u2019s attendees were executives like Daniela Cachich, president of Ambev\u2019s Beyond Beer division, and Patricia Weiss, president of the Branded Content Marketing Association (BCMA) in Brazil and Portugal. Both participated in a panel about menopause.\n\nAccording to Ms. Cachich, brands need to address this issue. \u201cBy the time women reach senior leadership roles, many are entering menopause, which remains a taboo affecting the industry, as we have very few products and innovations that meet the needs and challenges of this stage of life,\u201d she said.",

The main issue is that it\u2019s capital intensive.\n\nIce cream needs a frozen supply chain, making it expensive to produce, transport, and store. This might not be an issue for a company that has a wider a range of frozen products, but that\u2019s not Unilever.\n\nAs a result, the firm\u2019s looking to focus on its other divisions. And these have also been growing well in 2024, which I think justifies the CEO\u2019s ongoing strategy.\n\nThe big risk\n\nThe big unknown with Unilever at the moment is what the company will be able to get by selling its ice cream business. And there\u2019s a lot at stake here. During the first nine months of 2024, the unit brought in around 15% of total revenues, so the company needs to realise a decent price by selling the business. But there are no guarantees.\n\nI think Unilever\u2019s best outcome is to find a buyer that can incorporate its brands into an existing infrastructure. But the intention to sell is well-known and that isn\u2019t usually conducive to attracting high prices.\n\nEarlier this year, the Financial Times reported earlier this year that Unilever\u2019s looking to launch the unit as a standalone business. And that\u2019s what\u2019s catching my attention for 2025.\n\nThe opportunity\n\nI\u2019m waiting to see what happens with Unilever this year. But I\u2019m very much open to the idea that there could be a big opportunity on the way if the ice cream unit trades by itself on the stock market.\n\nStocks that come onto the market through divestitures are often unpopular with investors. Haleon, for example, initially fell 22% after being spun out of GSK, before climbing 55%.\n\nLikewise, WK Kellogg shares fell 30% after being divested from Kellanova. But it has almost doubled since then and investors who bought at the lows would be getting over 6% back each year in dividends.\n\nThis is where I think the opportunity might be. I\u2019ll be looking at what happens with the ice cream company, especially if it appears as a standalone business on the stock market.\n\nRisks and rewards\n\nUncertainty over the outcome of the firm\u2019s plan to divest the business makes it hard to work out what the Unilever share price should be. But I\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the company.\n\nWith where the stock is right now, it\u2019s likely I\u2019ll be more interested in the new company than the existing one. But I\u2019m not ruling anything out going into 2025.",

There are also constraints for cost and capital, which means they can't hold a large inventory. They can't have a large amount of capital blocked and want more frequent service,\" Neelakantan said.Within the consumer goods market, HUL has the largest distribution network in India with over 3,500 distributors across 2,000 towns serving nine million stores including a direct reach of three million outlets.The company had piloted its latest distribution model-Samadhan-near Chennai nearly two years ago to take on online business-to-business (B2B) startups that have the advantage of serving multiple companies at the same time as well as offering next-day delivery.In India, kirana stores, serviced by either distributors or wholesalers, control nearly 80% of FMCG sales. While organised retail and wholesalers including Flipkart Wholesale, Udaan, and Reliance Cash and Carry make up about 5% of FMCG sales, they get greater leverage over supplies and price due to their scale.The maker of Rin, Dove and Lux said while the traditional supply chain is often labour intensive, high maintenance and is prone to errors, distributors ensure that the relationship with the outlet is sustained, and they remain part and parcel of the supply chain going forward. Under the new model, absolute returns earned by distributors will remain unchanged while HUL bears the cost of warehousing operations.\"The kirana stores actually want assurance of delivery. So, the frequency of ordering, the kind of lines that they order, the kind of depth that they order keeps increasing with greater assurance of service and delivery,\" said Neelakantan.HUL has also carved out separate sales teams for each of its ecommerce verticals spanning marketplace, quick commerce and beauty retailers, which have a combined workforce of about 200 employees. Half of this team either has digital or technology experience, or has earlier worked with direct to consumer or ecommerce firms, and their average age is almost a decade younger than the larger organisation.\"So, the kind of quality of conversation itself is very different, because they know what's happening externally. How we deal with quick commerce is very different from how we deal with marketplace kind of setups and how we deal with the beauty kind of Nykaas of the world. So we don't have a singular e-commerce team. The portfolios in these channels are very different,\" said Neelakantan, adding that 50-55% of the portfolio it sells online is distinct from what it sells in modern trade and general trade.HUL has also been consistently upgrading its internal ordering app Shikhar, which allows neighbourhood stores to order directly from the company but are still serviced by distributors. At present, Shikhar generates more than a third of HUL's sales.",
