            "content": "Investing.com -- UBS Global Research has revised its financial outlook for U.S. rail companies, leading to reduced EPS estimates and price targets, citing potential softening in industrial end markets.\n\nUBS analysts express concerns that in 2025, inflation could outpace revenue generated from price and mix for Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC).\n\nWhile strong productivity gains are still anticipated for UNP and NSC, these are not projected to offset the impact on EPS.\n\nSpecifically, UBS Global Research has lowered its 2025 EPS estimates: for UNP from $11.80 to $11.60, for NSC from $12.90 to $12.60, and for CSX from $1.83 to $1.71.\n\nThe analysts also adjusted their 2026 EPS estimates downward (UNP by 4%, NSC by 7%, and CSX by 8%) to reflect yield performance aligned with a more subdued cyclical rebound.\n\nThis has resulted in revised price targets: CSX's price target has been cut from $39 to $36, NSC's from $305 to $284, and UNP's from $255 to $245.\n\nUBS analyzes factors affecting rail industry pricing and profitability. For CSX and NSC, price/mix contributed to revenue growth in 2024 (CSX: 2.5%, NSC: 1.9%), but growth is forecast to slow in 2025 (CSX: 0.2%, NSC: 1.2%) due to declines in coal yield and flat merchandise volume.\n\nIn contrast, UNP's price/mix is projected to improve from a 0.9% year-over-year increase in 2024 to a 2% increase in 2025, driven by flat intermodal yield and growth in coal yield.\n\nThe analysts flag a broader trend of downshifting in rail industry pricing since the early 2010s, increasing cyclicality.\n\nCoal yields ex. fuel, which grew at an average of 6% per year from 2005 to 2015, slowed to 2% from 2015 to 2024, influenced by completed repricing of long-term contracts and linkage to commodity prices.\n\nMerchandise revenue per car ex. fuel growth moderated from an average of 5% annually (2005-2015) to 2.5%-3% since, with the lowest growth (around 2% per year) during 2015-2021, coinciding with Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) implementation.\n\nIntermodal yields ex. fuel consistently grew in the 1.5%-2% range until 2023/2024.\n\nProductivity gains are increasingly important for U.S. railroads. From 2005 to 2021, U.S. rails reliably delivered growth in revenue per mile ex. fuel that exceeded cost per mile by 150-200 basis points per year.\n\nWhile the revised estimates for UNP and NSC reflect a similar spread in 2025 and 2026, this is largely attributed to cost-side productivity improvements.\n\nThe analysts suggest that while rails can achieve strong productivity in an environment of weak volumes, achieving high single-digit or better earnings growth will require improvement in both price/mix and volume.\n\nThis content was originally published on Investing.com",

            "content": "Left: Craig Richardson was recognized by Union Pacific\u2019s resource group, EASE, for his years of dedication. Right: Craig and his wife pose on the Lincoln Business Car and at the railroad\u2019s CEO Excellence Awards.\n\nAs Union Pacific\u2019s executive vice president, chief legal officer and corporate secretary Craig Richardson prepares to retire at the end of March, he reflects on a career dedicated to service \u2013 both to his country and to the railroad\u2019s vision of Building America.\n\n\u201cMy career reflects an intense devotion to the love of my country and building America,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cThere\u2019s an aspect of pride and professional meaning that comes from the past, and there\u2019s a part that comes from the present.\u201d\n\nHis journey has been anything but ordinary. Before joining Union Pacific, Richardson spent decades working in government, law and corporate leadership. His early career included roles in the U.S. Department of State, the Pentagon and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. He also served in the White House during the Reagan administration under the National Security Advisor. As an intelligence officer, he was deployed to the Cambodian border and the Philippines to oversee critical operations.\n\nIn 1988, Richardson was commissioned in the U.S. Navy Reserves, where he served for 21 years, including active-duty mobilization after Sept. 11, 2001. During this time, he also pursued his long-held ambition of becoming a lawyer, attending Stanford Law School. His legal career took him from the West Coast to Denver, where he and his family settled in 1993. There, he built a distinguished career in the energy sector, serving as vice president and general counsel for El Paso Corporation\u2019s Pipeline Group.\n\nAfter serving as outside counsel for Union Pacific, Richardson officially joined the railroad in 2016 as associate general counsel, moving to a vice president position and, in December 2020, stepped into the chief legal officer role. Throughout his tenure, he led the company\u2019s legal team through unprecedented regulatory challenges and industry scrutiny, delivering significant victories for Union Pacific.\n\nFor Richardson, working for the railroad has also carried deep historical significance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a history buff, and I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the American presidency. Who else can say they work for a company founded by Abraham Lincoln?\u201d he said. \u201cLincoln stood for correcting one of the greatest moral failings in our history, and he gave his life for it. The fact that his signature put this railroad into existence is incredibly meaningful.\u201d\n\nAmong the moments he\u2019s most proud of, Richardson reflects on regulatory cases with long-lasting impacts for the broader rail industry. He speaks highly of his team, who has successfully defended Union Pacific in historic legal victories, including those related to passenger rail and labor relations.\n\n\u201cThis is all about the incredible team I have \u2013 lawyers, paralegals, risk management professionals and outside counsel \u2013 who have left a mark on me more than perhaps any time in my career,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cThe first word that comes to mind is excellence. Union Pacific has attracted and retained some truly remarkable legal and risk management professionals.\u201d\n\nRichardson is also proud of Union Pacific\u2019s strong ties to the military, with nearly 20% of its workforce made up of veterans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a coincidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a shared sentiment between a military career and a career at Union Pacific \u2013 both are deeply connected to service, discipline and something greater than oneself.\u201d\n\nAs he enters retirement, Richardson looks forward to spending more time with his family, especially his first grandchild and his labrador, in the Rockies. He also plans to travel \u2013 with a return trip to Japan on the horizon \u2013 and continue his leadership roles on corporate boards and community organizations.\n\nAnd, of course, he\u2019ll be keeping an eye on Union Pacific.\n\n\u201cI will always have Union Pacific in my heart, even if I\u2019m not in the office,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cThis is a company built on integrity. We are an honorable organization, and when we give our word, we keep it. That\u2019s a legacy I\u2019m proud to have been a part of.\u201d",

            "content": "All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nUnion Pacific in Focus\n\nHeadquartered in Omaha, Union Pacific (UNP) is a Transportation stock that has seen a price change of 1.8% so far this year. The railroad is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.34 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.31%. This compares to the Transportation - Rail industry's yield of 1.64% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.59%.\n\nLooking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5.36 is up 1.5% from last year. In the past five-year period, Union Pacific has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.44%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Union Pacific's current payout ratio is 48%. This means it paid out 48% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nLooking at this fiscal year, UNP expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $12.01 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 8.30%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\n\nHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, UNP is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).",

            "content": "In addition to being the President of the United States, Donald Trump is one of the nation's most well-known billionaires. Much of his wealth is tied to real estate ventures bearing his name. While he may not be personally trading stocks day to day, Trump\u2019s 2024 financial disclosure report provides a window into his investment strategy and portfolio\u2014and it's one that many investors might find surprisingly relatable. If you look at Trump\u2019s stock positions that are over $15,000, you'll find a mix of blue-chip dividend payers, high-potential growth names, and even a few artificial intelligence (AI) plays. With the exception of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ: DJT), the portfolio is more practical than flashy\u2014rooted in fundamentals rather than speculation. In fact, some might even consider it boring. The takeaway for retail investors is that there's something to be said for a portfolio that strikes a balance between growth potential and steady income. In this special presentation, we're highlighting seven stocks in Donald Trump's portfolio that any investor could consider adding to their watchlist.\n\nQuick Links\n\n#1 - Chevron (NYSE:CVX)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s affection for the oil and gas industry, so it\u2019s no surprise that two of his core stock holdings are Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM). Chevron is the world\u2019s seventh-largest integrated energy company, and it's global footprint includes a major presence in the highly productive Permian Basin. One of the biggest stories surrounding Chevron right now is its proposed merger with Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES). While the deal has been delayed due to arbitration with ExxonMobil over rights to a key Hess asset, many industry insiders still expect the merger to go through. And while Chevron doesn\u2019t lack free cash flow, the merger with Hess will accelerate its growth.\n\nThat means investors should not be concerned about the company\u2019s dividend. Chevron is a Dividend Aristocrat with a 38-year history of increasing its dividend. And it\u2019s been increasing that dividend at an annualized three-year growth rate of 7.08%.\n\nAbout Chevron\n\nCurrent Price $156.80 Consensus Rating Moderate Buy Ratings Breakdown 12 Buy Ratings, 4 Hold Ratings, 0 Sell Ratings. Consensus Price Target $174.13 (11.1% Upside)\n\n#2 - Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)\n\nLockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) is a natural fit in Trump\u2019s portfolio, aligning closely with his \u201cpeace through strength\u201d philosophy\u2014a doctrine shared by several past presidents. As one of the world\u2019s largest defense contractors, Lockheed Martin plays a central role in U.S. national security. The company receives approximately 10% of the Pentagon\u2019s entire budget, and roughly 75% of its total revenue comes from defense contracts.\n\nContrary to analysts\u2019 expectations, the March 2025 continuing resolution (CR) passed by Congress included an increase in defense spending. And even though modern warfare is evolving rapidly, Lockheed will still have a place at the table with its expertise in AI and cybersecurity. This should give investors confidence that Lockheed can continue delivering strong total returns\u2014averaging about 19% annually over the past decade\u2014while also generating the cash flow needed to maintain and grow its dividend, which has been increased for 22 consecutive years.\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin\n\nCurrent Price $455.15 Consensus Rating Hold Ratings Breakdown 5 Buy Ratings, 9 Hold Ratings, 1 Sell Ratings. Consensus Price Target $539.53 (18.5% Upside)\n\n#3 - Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)\n\nTrying to time the market is never a good strategy, but market trends can offer investors clues about when the economy could shift. And the next two stocks in Donald Trump\u2019s portfolio are well-positioned to benefit from the early stages of an economic recovery. First up is Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), best known as a global leader in heavy equipment manufacturing, which has performed well since September 2022, shortly after Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\nTwo factors are creating long-term demand for Caterpillar\u2019s equipment: Upgrading America's physical infrastructure will take years (if not decades), and more companies are committing to onshoring manufacturing in the United States. Because of this, many investors see Caterpillar as both a symbol and a driver of economic growth. Even if they have to wait for CAT stock to run higher, they have the security of Caterpillar's dividend\u2014which the company has increased for 30 consecutive years, with an impressive three-year annualized growth rate of 8.25%.\n\nAbout Caterpillar\n\nCurrent Price $305.88 Consensus Rating Hold Ratings Breakdown 9 Buy Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 2 Sell Ratings. Consensus Price Target $383.80 (25.5% Upside)\n\n#4 - Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNext up is Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE: UNP), one of the nation's leading transportation and logistics companies. As a major railroad operator, Union Pacific moves a wide range of goods\u2014from agricultural products to industrial materials\u2014which not only diversifies its revenue but also broadens its geographic footprint, both key to maintaining its competitive edge. Of equal importance for investors is the company's balance sheet. Union Pacific consistently maintains a healthy cash position between $1 billion and $3 billion. That financial strength supports its dependable dividend, which has grown at a 7.17% annualized rate over the past three years.\n\nThat cash flow can also help mitigate any impact from the Trump administration's tariff policy, which could impact railroad stocks. However, in its January 2025 earnings report, the company reaffirmed it is on track to achieve its long-term goals of high single-digit to low double-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth through 2027.\n\nUnion Pacific stock hasn't been immune to the economy's ups and downs. Over the past three years, UNP stock has posted a negative total return of 7.3%. However, in the last year, the total return became positive, which may signal better days to come.\n\nAbout Union Pacific\n\nCurrent Price $225.16 Consensus Rating Moderate Buy Ratings Breakdown 14 Buy Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 1 Sell Ratings. Consensus Price Target $261.95 (16.3% Upside)\n\n#5 - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nYou can see where the income in Donald Trump\u2019s portfolio is coming from, but what about the growth? That's where one of Trump\u2019s largest holdings, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA), comes in.\n\nAccording to his 2024 financial disclosure report, Trump owns between $500,000 and $1 million worth of NVDA stock. While there\u2019s no indication of when or for how long he\u2019s owned the stock, the position size suggests a belief in the AI story fueling NVIDIA\u2019s strong growth.\n\nThe continued growth of AI will be the make-or-break catalyst for NVDA stock. And in the next 12 months, it could be a tough stock to hold. As of early 2025, short-term traders have their hooks in the stock which is down over 17% for the year.\n\nThat can make it difficult to look at the bigger picture. But, if you\u2019re a long-term investor, that\u2019s the only view that matters. And with market share leads in almost every area in which it does business\u2014GPUs, data centers, and AI infrastructure\u2014NVIDIA is still likely to be a solid choice for risk-tolerant growth investors.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\n\nCurrent Price $103.00 Consensus Rating Moderate Buy Ratings Breakdown 38 Buy Ratings, 4 Hold Ratings, 0 Sell Ratings. Consensus Price Target $169.89 (64.9% Upside)\n\n#6 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nAnother beaten-down stock in Trump\u2019s portfolio is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). According to the FDR, Trump owns between $50,000 and $100,000 in TSLA stock. Remember: this information was released before Elon became publicly associated with Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nAt first glance, a Tesla investment might seem at odds with Trump\u2019s skepticism toward electric vehicles (EVs). But reducing Tesla to just a car company misses the bigger picture\u2014especially with Elon Musk at the helm. The reality is that Tesla\u2019s true growth potential lies beyond EVs. Its advancements in autonomous driving, powered by artificial intelligence, could be transformative. Considering that Trump owns a piece of many Magnificent 7 stocks, it\u2019s easy to assume that he doesn't think the tech sector is a bubble.\n\nAnd when you look at TSLA stock through that broader prism, it seems like a significant value at its current price. As a playground for traders, the stock will experience some volatility in both the short and long term. But for investors who can stomach the swings, Tesla offers exposure to multiple disruptive technologies and a chance to ride one of the most ambitious innovation stories of the decade.\n\nAbout Tesla\n\nCurrent Price $266.56 Consensus Rating Hold Ratings Breakdown 22 Buy Ratings, 9 Hold Ratings, 7 Sell Ratings. Consensus Price Target $312.65 (17.3% Upside)\n\n#7 - McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD)\n\nDepending on your point of view, one of the funnier (or more horrifying) moments of Trump\u2019s first term was when he served McDonald\u2019s to college athletes visiting the White House to celebrate their national championship. Love it or hate it, that moment reflects Trump\u2019s genuine affection for the brand\u2014so it shouldn't surprise investors that McDonald\u2019s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) is one of his larger stock holdings.\n\nIn fact, Trump's love of McDonald\u2019s mirrors Warren Buffett's love of Coca-Cola. Both men are loyal fans of the product and the stocks.\n\nAt a time when consumer discretionary spending is under pressure, McDonald\u2019s is making a push to reclaim its title as a value brand. And it seems to be working.

            "content": "\u201cDuring the pandemic, people had more time on their hands, stimulus checks, and took an opportunity on the market decline. This is complemented by the fact that younger people starting out in their careers, who tend to make less than those further on in their career cycle, haven\u2019t phased out yet for Roth IRA contributions.\u201d\n\nAnother contributing factor has been the investment activity of younger households, particularly those with higher incomes. Many were able to invest substantial amounts during the pandemic, relative to their previous financial positions. Research from the Federal Reserve indicated that inflation-adjusted wealth for Americans under 40 surged by an impressive 80% between the first quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2023, largely driven by stock market gains. Evan Potash, executive wealth management advisor at TIAA, made the following comment about it:\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Center for Retirement Research (CRR), the increase in Roth IRA adoption has been most pronounced among the highest-earning third of households. The organization attributes this trend in part to fintech platforms like Robinhood, which have made financial instruments more accessible in recent years.\n\nRoth IRAs are not just popular among retirees; they are also gaining traction among young investors. Data from the US Federal Reserve, analyzed by Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research (CRR), shows that the share of households led by individuals in their 20s who own a Roth IRA has surged, rising from 6.6% in 2016 to 19.2% in 2022. Surya Kolluri, head of the TIAA Institute, has highlighted the Roth IRA as one of the most effective tools for retirement savings. He noted that the potential for tax-free growth over several decades could have a significant impact on long-term wealth.\n\nA Roth IRA, or individual retirement account, is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed for retirement. Unlike employer-sponsored plans such as 401(k)s, a Roth IRA is managed independently. This means the account is opened directly with a financial provider, contributions are arranged personally, and investment choices\u2014whether selecting assets individually or working with an investment manager\u2014are entirely up to the account holder. Roth IRAs are accessible only to individuals with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) below $165,000 for single filers. The annual contribution limit is set at $7,000, with an increased cap of $8,000 for those aged 50 and older. For individuals earning more than $150,000, contribution limits gradually phase out.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Roth IRA Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other best Roth IRA stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile the rise in Roth IRA participation is beneficial for higher earners, those with lower incomes have not experienced the same level of growth. Research from the CRR found that in 2022, only 4% of households led by individuals in their twenties from the lowest third of the income distribution were investing in a Roth IRA. Although this marks an increase from 2% in 2016, it remains far below the 41% participation rate among those in the top third of earners.\n\nAdditional studies indicate that the wealth gap between the richest and poorest young individuals continues to widen. Research published by the University of Chicago Press shows that the wealthiest 10% of millennials hold 20% more wealth than the richest baby boomers did at the same age. In contrast, those at the lower end of the income scale have either seen little to no growth in their wealth or, in some cases, a decline.\n\nWhen building a Roth IRA portfolio, it is essential to focus on diversification to maximize long-term growth while managing risk. A well-balanced portfolio can include a mix of various asset classes that cater to different investment goals and risk tolerances. According to analysts, it may be beneficial to maintain a well-rounded portfolio that includes index funds, such as those tracking the broader market, along with dividend-paying and value stocks. In addition, investors might consider target-date funds or a combination of stocks, bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) to enhance diversification. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best Roth IRA stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected companies that have long-term growth catalysts, dividend growth history, solid business fundamentals, and positive analyst coverage. From that group, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 7% based on analyst price targets, as of March 23. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) the Best Roth IRA Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nAn intermodal container train winding through a rural landscape.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nAnalysts Upside Potential: 13.78%\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a Nebraska-based shipping & receiving and supply chain management company. UNP is an attractive investment because railroad companies play a crucial role in transporting heavy goods, raw materials, agricultural products, and fuels efficiently over land. With the infrastructure already in place, companies like Union Pacific primarily allocate costs to maintaining their networks, covering expenses such as fuel and labor. As the economy grows, revenue in the railroad industry can increase over time. This makes investing in railroads a strategic way to capitalize on long-term US economic expansion. Since the start of 2025, the stock has surged by over 2%.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) reported $25.3 billion in revenue, marking a 1.54% increase compared to the previous year. The company reached a preliminary deal with its largest customer to reduce shipping volume by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. In addition, it has gained full control over its SurePost service. To adapt, UNP is restructuring its US network and launching a multi-year efficiency initiative aimed at streamlining operations and achieving approximately $1 billion in cost savings.\n\nIn February, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) increased its quarterly dividend by 0.6% to $1.64 per share, extending its streak of dividend growth to 23 consecutive years. As of March 23, the stock yields 2.29%, making it an appealing choice for income-focused investors. The company\u2019s strong cash flow continues to support shareholder returns, generating $10.1 billion in operating cash flow and $6.3 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2024. UNP also returned $5.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\n\nOverall, UNP ranks 6th on our list of best Roth IRA stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 15 Dividend Zombies to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other dividend zombies to invest in.\n\nThe broader market has posted consecutive annual gains of 25%, largely fueled by growth stocks and companies capitalizing on the rising demand for artificial intelligence. Despite this, dividend stocks remain a key part of a strong investment strategy. Over time, dividends play an increasingly significant role in returns, and historical data shows that from 1987 through the end of 2023, reinvested dividends accounted for roughly 55% of the market\u2019s total gains.\n\nWhile recent market gains have largely been driven by a few non-dividend-paying companies, the landscape is evolving. Several major tech firms introduced dividend policies last year, emphasizing their commitment to returning capital to shareholders. They view dividends as a valuable complement to share buybacks. Although initial dividend yields from tech stocks remain modest, the total payout is substantial, with just three companies expected to distribute an estimated $17 billion over the next year, as reported by J.P. Morgan.\n\nThis shift sends a significant signal to the market. The report highlighted that the best opportunities in dividend stocks come from \u201cCompounders\u201d\u2014companies with a strong history of consistently increasing dividends. Nearly half of the strategy focuses on these firms, which are supported by steady earnings growth. Compounders not only ensure reliable income but also provide a solid foundation for generating long-term portfolio outperformance.\n\nDividend zombies are a lesser-known category within dividend investing. These companies have consistently paid dividends to shareholders for 100 years or more. Some have even increased their payouts over time, earning a place among the elite dividend aristocrats. Their ability to sustain such a long track record is largely due to strong cash flows and solid financial health. This strong financial position makes these stocks appealing to investors.\n\nAccording to a report by Nuveen, dividend growth stocks have historically delivered a strong mix of earnings expansion, cash flow stability, and well-managed dividend policies. They have demonstrated solid performance in rising markets while also offering resilience during downturns and periods of market volatility. Over time, companies that consistently increase or initiate dividends have outperformed those that merely maintain payouts, do not pay dividends, or reduce them. In addition, they have achieved these returns with lower risk, as reflected in their lower standard deviation.\n\nDividend stocks are also appealing today from a valuation perspective. The market\u2019s heavy concentration in a few stocks and the excitement around AI have led to historically low relative valuations for dividend-paying companies. This creates an opportunity for investors to tap into a long-term trend that combines income generation with growth by investing in businesses with solid fundamentals and a track record of steady dividend increases. Historically, this segment has provided downside protection, making it a strategic option for adding stability and diversification to an equity portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we selected companies that have paid dividends for over 100 years and also have strong dividend growth histories. Some of these companies are dividend kings, which means that they have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the consecutive years of dividend payments.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nConsecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 125\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), the American provider of freight transportation services, transports a wide range of goods and commodities, providing exposure to multiple industries, including agriculture, automotive, and energy. In recent years, the company has prioritized efficiency by diversifying its revenue streams and expanding its geographic presence\u2014key strategies for staying competitive in the rail transportation sector.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) reported $6.12 billion in revenue, reflecting a slight 1% decline compared to the previous year. However, a 5% rise in revenue carloads helped mitigate some of the decrease. The company improved its operating ratio to 58.7%, marking a 220-basis-point enhancement, despite a 70-basis-point impact from the ratification of a crew staffing agreement. Operating income increased by 5%, reaching $2.5 billion.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has maintained uninterrupted dividend payments for 125 years and has raised its payouts for 18 consecutive years. In fiscal 2024, it generated over $9.3 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with more than $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company\u2019s quarterly dividend comes in at $1.34 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.29%, as of March 23.\n\nOverall, UNP ranks 9th on our list of dividend zombies to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

This development coincides with a 2.63% rise in the company's share price over the last quarter. The quarter also saw Union Pacific declare a cash dividend of $1.34 per share and initiate a significant share repurchase program, reflecting confidence in its financial health. In parallel, market dynamics showed mixed trends with declines in major technology stocks but an overall market rise of 2.9% over the past week, which may have influenced broader investor sentiment, including toward UNP.\n\nNYSE:UNP Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past five years, Union Pacific has achieved a total return of 86.45% through a combination of share price appreciation and dividends. This robust performance can be attributed to several pivotal developments within the company. Union Pacific's strategic initiatives, including operational excellence and infrastructure investments, have effectively improved network efficiency and business volume capacity. The company's expansion into renewable diesel facilities and Gulf Coast industrial projects has opened new revenue streams, supporting overall growth.\n\nWhile the railroad company has faced challenges like tariff uncertainties, coal demand declines, and inflation impacts, it has successfully managed these risks by adjusting pricing strategies and implementing innovative solutions. Additionally, the recent share repurchase program announced in February 2025, set to acquire up to 100 million shares, underscores the company\u2019s confidence in its continuing financial stability. By maintaining a consistent focus on efficiency and innovation, Union Pacific remains well-positioned within the industry despite recent underperformance relative to broader market trends.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Union Pacific Corporation's ( ) price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 20.9x might make it look like a sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 17x and even P/E's below 10x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.\n\nUnion Pacific certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs There Enough Growth For Union Pacific?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Union Pacific's to be considered reasonable.\n\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 6.0%. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 12% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 9.5% per annum over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 11% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.\n\nIn light of this, it's curious that Union Pacific's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\n\nWe've established that Union Pacific currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.\n\nYou should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nIf these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Union Pacific, explore to get an idea of what else is out there.\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

            "content": "Union Pacific\u2019s UNP efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks are encouraging. However, soft freight revenues are concerning as they are hurting growth.\n\nFactors Favoring UNP\n\nUNP is focused on rewarding its shareholders. Strong free cash flow supports the shareholder-friendly activities at Union Pacific. Free cash flow in 2023 was $1.54 billion. In 2023, the company returned $3.9 billion to its shareholders. Union Pacific hiked dividends twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP upped its quarterly dividend by a further 10% to $1.30 per share. In July 2024, UNP increased its dividend by a further 3% to $1.34 per share. The company has paid dividends on common stock for 125 consecutive years, reflecting its pro-shareholder approach. Management resumed buying back shares in the second quarter of 2024. UNP bought back shares worth $1.5 billion in 2024.\n\nU.S. equity markets have been experiencing extreme volatility lately, largely due to escalating trade tensions. Stocks have been tumbling on fears of a recession as uncertainty grows over President Trump\u2019s tariff policies. In view of the prevalent uncertainties surrounding the economy and the rise in inflation over the past few months, the railroad industry is likely to suffer.\n\nAs it is, Union Pacific is suffering big time due to a decline in volumes as a result of soft consumer markets. Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment. To combat the revenue weakness due to the freight downturn, UNP is looking to cut costs to drive the bottom line. To improve efficiency, UNP is using longer trains, boosting freight car velocity. Due to the cost-cut efforts, operating expenses declined 3% year over year in 2024.\n\nPrice Performance of the UNP Stock\n\nShares of Union Pacific have gained 2.6% so far this year, outperforming the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry\u2019s 1.5% decline.\n\nYTD Price Comparison\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Risks for the UNP Stock\n\nWith consumer spending and business investments remaining low, production levels have decreased in response to reduced demand. As a result of low demand, there is less need for transportation services to move goods, resulting in a freight recession. Below-par freight rates are also hurting UNP\u2019s prospects.\n\nDue to low revenues, the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) at UNP increased 220 basis points to 62.3% at the end of 2023 from the 2022 reading. Operating ratio is likely to deteriorate i.e. increase, since a lower value of the metric is preferable, going forward due to the costs associated with the recently inked labor deals. Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment. Reduced fuel surcharge revenues, too, are a concern.\n\nUNP's financial metrics indicate that leverage is elevated and a massive negative for its shareholders. The long-term debt burden of the company was $29.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, which translates into a debt-to-capitalization of 66.4%. The figure is well above the sub-industry\u2019s 49.4%.\n\nUNP\u2019s Zacks Rank\n\nUNP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nInvestors interested in the Transportation sector may consider SkyWest SKYW and Frontier Group ULCC.\n\nSkyWest currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other best industrial dividend stocks to invest in now.\n\nIndustrial stocks play a crucial role in economic growth, encompassing a wide range of businesses, from manufacturing to transportation. This sector often performs well during periods of economic expansion and stands to gain from higher government investment in infrastructure projects. Although the sector is diverse, companies within it exhibit common characteristics and are positioned to benefit from several overarching trends. These factors contribute to the view that industrials play a significant role in the equity portion of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nIn recent years, the industrial economy has generally experienced improving demand trends, though certain areas, such as manufacturing automation, have shown signs of weakening. A report by Edward Jones suggested that while the recovery is expected to continue, several near-term uncertainties could impact the sector\u2019s growth. These include a potential slowdown in economic expansion, ongoing geopolitical challenges, and declining business and consumer confidence.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Most Undervalued Bitcoin Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nAdditionally, the growing risk of a global trade war between the United States and key trading partners has introduced further uncertainty for the industrial sector. While the administration has announced tariffs on materials such as steel and aluminum, the full impact of these measures remains unclear. Further tariff actions are anticipated, with a likely focus on China and the European Union. In response, these regions are expected to retaliate through tariffs or other policy measures.\n\nIn 2024, the industrial sector delivered solid returns overall, though it slightly trailed the broader market in what was a strong year for stocks. A report by Fidelity Investments noted that industrials started the year on a strong footing, generally keeping pace with the broader market through April. However, the sector underperformed in May and June before rebounding in July, emerging as one of the market\u2019s stronger segments. It largely maintained those relative gains through mid-December. This uneven performance reflected a balance between optimism surrounding a potential soft landing for the US economy and a surge in major construction projects, contrasted with concerns over weak manufacturing indicators and historically high stock valuations.\n\nThe Fidelity report also highlighted several key themes that could present investment opportunities in the coming year. One of the primary themes is the resurgence of manufacturing within the United States. Various factors are driving an unprecedented wave of reinvestment in domestic infrastructure, efforts to onshore supply chains to mitigate geopolitical risks, and increased investments in electrification and artificial intelligence development.\n\nThe cyclical nature of industrial stocks has contributed to strong performance over time. Over the past three years, the market\u2019s Industrial Index has slightly outpaced the broader market, driven by solid growth across several key industries, including Aerospace & Defense, Building Products, Machinery, and Electrical Equipment. This year, as stocks have been in negative territory for a while now, the industrial sector has recorded a 0.74% decline, while the broader market has fallen by nearly 3%.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the fourth quarter of 2024 and selected industrial companies across various segments within the industry, including manufacturing, construction, aerospace and defense, machinery and equipment, transportation and logistics, as well as utilities. From this pool of companies, we identified 12 dividend companies and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them at the end of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 93\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a US-based railroad holding company that transports a diverse range of products and commodities, giving it broad exposure across various industries, including agriculture, automotive, and energy. In recent years, the company has focused on improving efficiency by expanding its revenue sources and strengthening its geographic reach\u2014key factors in maintaining competitiveness in the rail transportation sector.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) reported $6.12 billion in revenue, reflecting a 1% year-over-year decline. However, a 5% increase in revenue carloads helped offset some of the downturn. The company\u2019s operating ratio improved to 58.7%, a 220-basis-point enhancement, despite a 70-basis-point impact from a crew staffing agreement ratification. Operating income rose by 5%, reaching $2.5 billion.\n\nA strong cash position has allowed Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) to remain one of the best industrial stocks that offer dividends. The company has consistently paid dividends for 125 consecutive years and has increased its payouts for 18 straight years. In fiscal 2024, it generated more than $9.3 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its quarterly dividend currently sits at $1.34 per share for a dividend yield of 2.25%, as of March 17.\n\nOverall, UNP ranks 1st on our list of best industrial dividend stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other best railroad stocks to buy now.\n\nIn February, the Association of American Railroads reported that intermodal volumes remained robust, rising 6.4% year-over-year. Weekly originations hit an all-time high in February, averaging 276,654 units. This growth was fueled by steady consumer spending and some importers ordering extra shipments ahead of possible tariffs. So far in 2025, intermodal volume is up 8.5%, and container volume has jumped 9.5%, setting a new record for this period. Moving forward, intermodal growth will depend on consumer demand, which is closely tied to job market strength and potential trade policy shifts.\n\nHowever, American railroads experienced a 4.5% drop in carloads, moving 843,618 units in February. In the last five months, January had the first increase in carloads, but harsh winter weather, including flooding in the Northeast and freezing temperatures across most of the country, interrupted operations and obstructed freight handling. Without these weather challenges, rail volumes likely would have been higher. Coal being the largest commodity moved by rail continued its downward trend, with carloads dropping 8.2% in February and marking the 14th consecutive month of declines.\n\nAs the US ramps up its trade war under President Trump, freight railroads are preparing for the fallout. New tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China, and the EU are set to take effect soon, potentially disrupting a massive trade network. In 2024, American railroads handled $203.1 billion in cross-border trade with Canada and Mexico, being almost evenly split between the two, as reported by CNBC. The rail industry is a huge economic driver, generating $233.4 billion in output and supporting around 750,000 jobs in 2023. Texas is a major hub for freight rail employment since it handles most of the US to Mexico rail traffic. Railroads also reinvested $26.8 billion in infrastructure last year, mostly through private funding. As trade tensions rise, the industry remains focused on keeping goods moving and ensuring rail infrastructure stays strong.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we focused on making a list of all railroad and railcar stocks that are publicly listed in the United States. Using Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 hedge fund database, we examined the hedge fund sentiment for each stock and selected 10 most popular ones. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024.",

            "content": "Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nUnion Pacific in Focus\n\nUnion Pacific (UNP) is headquartered in Omaha, and is in the Transportation sector. The stock has seen a price change of 2.74% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $2.68 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.29%. In comparison, the Transportation - Rail industry's yield is 1.57%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.6%.\n\nLooking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5.36 is up 1.5% from last year. In the past five-year period, Union Pacific has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.44%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Union Pacific's payout ratio is 48%, which means it paid out 48% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nEarnings growth looks solid for UNP for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $12.02 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 8.39%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\n\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, UNP is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months.

            "content": "Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends.

            "content": "Suva, 6 March 2025 \u2013 The Fijian Broadcasting Corporation (FBC) officially handed over its Resilience Action Plan to Kamal Kishore, Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) for Disaster Risk Reduction, marking a significant milestone as the first broadcaster in the South Pacific to develop a detailed disaster preparedness and response plan (DPRP).\n\nThe handover ceremony took place during a roundtable discussion at FBC headquarters during Mr. Kishore's visit to Fiji. This initiative follows the recent Pacific Media Partnership Conference in Suva, where Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) members emphasized the importance of disaster preparedness in the media sector through a Joint Commitment urging all broadcasters across the region to develop similar comprehensive plans for disaster scenarios. FBC's groundbreaking efforts align with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction's (UNDRR) ongoing work to promote engagement across all of society in disaster risk reduction.\n\nMr. Kishore highlighted the essential role of broadcasters during disasters, noting that FBC's plan ensures the continued delivery of early warning messages to communities at risk.\n\n\"One of the things that we promote at UNDRR is that disaster risk reduction is not just the business of the disaster management office, but everybody's business,\" said Mr. Kishore. \"This really exemplifies that you've embraced the notion of disaster risk reduction and resilience building in your operation.\"\n\nMr. Kishore emphasized that while accurate forecasts and warnings are often generated before disasters strike, the means of disseminating this critical information can be compromised during extreme events \u2013 making broadcaster preparedness essential for effective early warning systems.\n\nUNDRR initiative drives action plan\n\nThe development of FBC's Resilience Action Plan was triggered by the organization's participation in an online DRR Knowledge Course during UNDRR and World Broadcasting Union's \"Media Saving Lives\" initiative in 2021. The training engaged 35 FBC staff across departments including Strategy, Technology, News and Programming.\n\nThe plan represents a direct response to lessons learned during Cyclone Winston in 2016, when storm flooding inundated FBC's ground-floor studios and disrupted broadcasting services at a critical time when the public needed information most.\n\nAfter extensive consultations with all staff, the plan became operational in late 2024, positioning FBC as a pioneer among media organizations in Small Island Developing States (SIDS).\n\nEnsuring continuous service during disasters\n\nFBC's Chief Executive Officer and the Resilience Committee Chair outlined how their plan creates a framework for operational sustainability and public safety during disasters. The approach includes staff training, infrastructure protection, and specialized content delivery protocols for emergency situations to ensure the delivery of reliable and timely information to the public.\n\nThe plan addresses four key focus areas: Leadership & Development, Media Awareness Content, Stakeholder Engagement, and Safety & Sustainability. It includes the establishment of a permanent FBC Resilience Committee and an Incident Management Team that activates during emergencies, as well as provisions for contingency broadcast stations and emergency broadcast schedules for different types of disasters.\n\n\"Having a Resilience Action Plan means we are now on a path to improving how we can handle any incident, not just disasters. The plan is practical and will keep evolving as we learn more. We feel much more in control of our future, but there\u2019s still a lot of work ahead,\" said Fabian Randerath, Chair of the FBC Resilience Committee.\n\nBy implementing the Resilience Action Plan, FBC directly contributes to broader disaster resilience efforts in the Pacific region, supporting UNDRR's strategic objectives and the UN Secretary-General's Early Warnings for All Initiative to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems.",

            "content": "Union Pacific Corporation ( ) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Union Pacific\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Is Union Pacific Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Union Pacific seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Union Pacific today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $285.79, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Union Pacific\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nWhat does the future of Union Pacific look like?\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Union Pacific's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 22%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? UNP\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on UNP, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Union Pacific at this point in time. Every company has risks, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Union Pacific, you can use our free platform to see our list of over\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

            "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 Best Railroad Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nIn February, the Association of American Railroads reported that intermodal volumes remained robust, rising 6.4% year-over-year. Weekly originations hit an all-time high in February, averaging 276,654 units. This growth was fueled by steady consumer spending and some importers ordering extra shipments ahead of possible tariffs. So far in 2025, intermodal volume is up 8.5%, and container volume has jumped 9.5%, setting a new record for this period. Moving forward, intermodal growth will depend on consumer demand, which is closely tied to job market strength and potential trade policy shifts.\n\nHowever, American railroads experienced a 4.5% drop in carloads, moving 843,618 units in February. In the last five months, January had the first increase in carloads, but harsh winter weather, including flooding in the Northeast and freezing temperatures across most of the country, interrupted operations and obstructed freight handling. Without these weather challenges, rail volumes likely would have been higher. Coal being the largest commodity moved by rail continued its downward trend, with carloads dropping 8.2% in February and marking the 14th consecutive month of declines.\n\nAs the US ramps up its trade war under President Trump, freight railroads are preparing for the fallout. New tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China, and the EU are set to take effect soon, potentially disrupting a massive trade network. In 2024, American railroads handled $203.1 billion in cross-border trade with Canada and Mexico, being almost evenly split between the two, as reported by CNBC. The rail industry is a huge economic driver, generating $233.4 billion in output and supporting around 750,000 jobs in 2023. Texas is a major hub for freight rail employment since it handles most of the US to Mexico rail traffic. Railroads also reinvested $26.8 billion in infrastructure last year, mostly through private funding. As trade tensions rise, the industry remains focused on keeping goods moving and ensuring rail infrastructure stays strong. Let\u2019s take a look at the best railroad stocks to invest in with the current economic backdrop.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we focused on making a list of all railroad and railcar stocks that are publicly listed in the United States. Using Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 hedge fund database, we examined the hedge fund sentiment for each stock and selected 10 most popular ones. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n10.

However, rail orders fell 8.5%, and backlog declined 26%, largely due to a strategic pullback in rail products and UK investments. On the bright side, the global friction management backlog surged 53.4%, offsetting some of the decrease. Moreover, strong cash flow allowed debt reduction for FSTR and stronger financial leverage. The Union Pacific settlement will also add $8 million per year in cash flow for the company. On March 3, 2025, L.B. Foster Company (NASDAQ:FSTR) announced a new $40 million share repurchase program that will run until February 2028.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database found L.B.

Established in 1989 in response to the growing interdependence of Asia-Pacific economies and the advent of regional economic blocs (such as the European Union and the North American Free Trade Area) in other parts of the world, APEC works to raise living standards and education levels through sustainable economic growth and to foster a sense of community and an appreciation of shared interests among Asia-Pacific countries. At the end of the 1990s APEC\u2019s membership included its 12 founding members\u2014Australia, Brunei, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States\u2014as well as Chile, China, Hong Kong, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Russia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), the South Pacific Forum (SPF), and the secretariat of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) maintain observer status.\n\nAt its 1994 summit meeting, APEC set an ambitious goal of achieving a free trade and investment regime in the Asia-Pacific region by 2010 for members with developed economies and by 2020 for members with developing ones. The following year it adopted the Osaka Action Agenda, a plan to implement APEC\u2019s goals of liberalizing trade and investment, facilitating business activities, and promoting economic and technical cooperation. Despite these commitments, APEC\u2019s effectiveness has been limited by its requirement that all its decisions be made by consensus. Although APEC seeks unanimity, decisions can be taken in the absence of unanimity; however, decisions are not legally binding on member governments.\n\nAPEC is organized into numerous committees, ad hoc policy groups, working groups, and a business advisory council. The committees, which examine issues such as trade and investment, economic trends, and budgetary matters, meet twice per year. The working groups are headed by experts and consider specific issues, including energy, tourism, fishing, transportation, and telecommunications. The organization\u2019s chair, which rotates annually, hosts an annual summit meeting and meetings of foreign and economic ministers and other senior officials. The APEC secretariat, established in 1993 and headquartered in Singapore, provides advisory and logistic services as well as research and analysis.",

            "content": "Economic Uncertainty Remains : A rise in inflation over the past couple of months has unsettled markets as investors worry that the Federal Reserve could delay its next rate cut till the second half of the year. This could have an adverse effect on the economy's health. With inflation remaining a concern, risks associated with an economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Sluggish economic growth and inflationary woes are likely to make markets more volatile in the coming days. Rising economic uncertainty does not bode well for railroad stocks.\n\nDecline in Oil Priceis a Tailwind : The decline in expenses on fuel represents another tailwind for the industry. Notably, oil prices declined almost 6% from the beginning of 2025 to date. As fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, a fall in oil prices bodes well for the bottom-line growth of railroad stocks.\n\nStrong Financial Returns for Shareholders: With economic activities gaining pace from the pandemic lows, more and more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile through dividends and buybacks to pacify long-suffering shareholders. This underlines their financial strength and confidence in the business. Among the Transportation \u2013 Railroad industry players, CSX Corporation CSX announced an 8.3% increase in the quarterly dividend in February 2025.\n\nWhile freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.\n\nThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry includes railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.\n\nDespite the challenges surrounding the industry, Union Pacific Corp. , Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. and Norfolk Southern Corp. appear better placed to tide over the challenges. Declining fuel costs represent a tailwind as far as bottom-line growth is concerned.\n\nThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry faces challenges, ranging from inflationary pressures and resultant high interest rates to concerns pertaining to supply-chain disruptions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #148. This rank places it in the bottom 40% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe sell-side analysts covering the companies in this industry have been decreasing their estimates. Over the past year, the industry's consensus earnings estimate for the current year has decreased 6.2%.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that investors can retain, given their growth prospects, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 and Sector\n\nThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 Composite index as well as the broader sector over the past year.\n\nOver this period, the industry has declined 10.5% compared with the S&P 500 Index's northward movement of 12.5% and the broader sector's decline of 10%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 6.14X compared with the S&P 500's 8.06X. It is above the sector's P/B ratio of 4.21X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.92X, as low as 5.72X and at the median of 7.38X.\n\n3 Stocks to Keep an Eye On\n\nWe are presenting three Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks that are well-positioned to grow in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nUnion Pacific: Headquartered in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific, through its subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates in the railroad business in the United States.\n\nRelatively stable e-commerce demand, cost-cutting efforts to boost the bottom line and consistent initiatives to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases bode well for UNP's prospects. Further, UNP has a stellar track record with respect to earnings surprises. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missed the mark in the remaining quarter), with an average beat of 3.35%.\n\nCanadian Pacific: Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Canadian Pacific manages a transcontinental freight railway in Canada, the United States and Mexico.\n\nWe are encouraged by the Canadian Pacific's decision to pay dividends consistently. Such a move instills investors' confidence and positively impacts the company's bottom line. Canadian Pacific has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise. The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining quarter), delivering an average surprise of 1.76%.\n\nNorfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern engages in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods in the United States.\n\nE-commerce demand is supporting Norfolk Southern's shipment volumes. The company utilizes the Precision Scheduled Railroading operating plan to reduce costs and enhance services for optimal asset utilization. We are impressed by Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Its strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. NSC's focus on improving service, safety, and productivity despite the challenges is commendable.\n\nNSC has a solid track record with respect to earnings surprises. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missed the mark in the remaining quarter), with an average beat of 2.94%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Here are three reasons why UNP doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own.\n\nWhy Do We Think Union Pacific Will Underperform?\n\nPart of the transcontinental railroad project, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is a freight transportation company that operates a major railroad network.\n\n1. Weak Sales Volumes Indicate Waning Demand\n\nRevenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (the number of units sold). While both are important, volume is the lifeblood of a successful Rail Transportation company because there\u2019s a ceiling to what customers will pay.\n\nOver the last two years, Union Pacific\u2019s units sold averaged 1% year-on-year growth. This performance was underwhelming and suggests it might have to lower prices or invest in product improvements to accelerate growth, factors that can hinder near-term profitability.\n\nUnion Pacific Units Sold\n\n2. EPS Barely Growing\n\nAnalyzing the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) shows whether a company's incremental sales were profitable \u2013 for example, revenue could be inflated through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nUnion Pacific\u2019s EPS grew at an unimpressive 5.7% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. On the bright side, this performance was better than its 2.2% annualized revenue growth and tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nUnion Pacific Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\n3. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\nAs you can see below, Union Pacific\u2019s margin dropped by 5 percentage points over the last five years. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal higher capital intensity and investment needs. Union Pacific\u2019s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 11.6%.\n\nUnion Pacific Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nWe cheer for all companies making their customers lives easier, but in the case of Union Pacific, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. With its shares lagging the market recently, the stock trades at 20.7\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $247.85 per share). This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think there are better stocks to buy right now. We\u2019d suggest looking at a fast-growing restaurant franchise with an A+ ranch dressing sauce.",

            "content": "(Read Lee Iacocca\u2019s Britannica entry on Chrysler.)\n\nEarly life\n\nChrysler was the third of four children of Henry (\u201cHank\u201d) and Anna Marie (\u201cMary\u201d) Chrysler. When he was three, his family moved to Ellis, Kan., where his father, a lifelong railroad engineer, went to work for the Kansas Pacific Railroad (later a division of the Union Pacific Railroad Company).\n\nAs a child, Walter Chrysler dreamed of following in his father\u2019s footsteps in the railroad business. He developed a passion for machinery that would last his entire life. Although Hank Chrysler was adamant that his son go to college, Walter defied him and began an apprenticeship in a railroad machine shop when he was 17 years old. He spent the next 20 years working his way up the echelons of railroad engineering, developing a reputation for his creative mechanical mind and his tireless enthusiasm. Quoting the poet Walt Whitman, he once said of his work, \u201cTo me, every hour of the day and night is an unspeakably perfect miracle.\u201d\n\nIn 1901, after an engagement of nearly five years, Chrysler married his childhood sweetheart, Della Forker, and they settled in Salt Lake City, Utah, where Chrysler was working for the Denver and Rio Grande Railway (later part of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Company). The couple had four children\u2014Thelma, Bernice, Walter, Jr., and Jack. Chrysler enjoyed the itinerant life of the railroad business, and the family moved frequently as he accepted positions of increasing responsibility. He made a name for himself as a master of plant efficiency, culminating in a position as works manager of the American Locomotive Company in Pittsburgh, Pa., at a starting salary of $8,000 a year.\n\nIn 1908 Chrysler bought his first car, the Locomobile. He had fallen in love with the sleek vehicle when he saw it at the Chicago Auto Show, but its $5,000 price tag was far above his means. He had only $700 in savings and a family to support, and he did not know how to drive. But, unable to get the car out of his mind, he borrowed $4,300 to make the purchase and had the car shipped home by rail. Before he even figured out how to drive his new possession, Chrysler spent time studying its mechanical system, taking it apart and putting it back together again, until he knew it through and through.\n\nAt General Motors\n\nChrysler did not enter the automobile business until he was 36 years old, when he met Charles Nash, president of General Motors (GM). At the time, Chrysler was earning $12,000 a year at the American Locomotive Company, but Nash persuaded him to join GM as the manager of the Buick plant in Flint, Mich., for only half that amount. In the years to come, Chrysler would completely revolutionize Buick\u2019s manufacturing system, introducing assembly-line processes pioneered by Henry Ford and more than tripling production.",

            "content": "The Zacks Transportation - Rail industry faces challenges, ranging from inflationary pressures and resultant high interest rates to concerns pertaining to supply-chain disruptions.\n\nDespite the challenges surrounding the industry,Union Pacific Corporation UNP, Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited CP and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC appear better placed to tide over the challenges. Declining fuel costs represent a tailwind as far as bottom-line growth is concerned.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry includes railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services. While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.\n\nFactors Deciding the Industry's Outlook\n\nStrong Financial Returns for Shareholders:With economic activities gaining pace from the pandemic lows, more and more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile through dividends and buybacks to pacify long-suffering shareholders. This underlines their financial strength and confidence in the business. Among the Transportation \u2013 Railroad industry players, CSX Corporation CSX announced an 8.3% increase in the quarterly dividend in February 2025.\n\nDecline in Oil Priceis a Tailwind: The decline in expenses on fuel represents another tailwind for the industry. Notably, oil prices declined almost 6% from the beginning of 2025 to date. As fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, a fall in oil prices bodes well for the bottom-line growth of railroad stocks.\n\nEconomic Uncertainty Remains: A rise in inflation over the past couple of months has unsettled markets as investors worry that the Federal Reserve could delay its next rate cut till the second half of the year. This could have an adverse effect on the economy\u2019s health. With inflation remaining a concern, risks associated with an economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Sluggish economic growth and inflationary woes are likely to make markets more volatile in the coming days. Rising economic uncertainty does not bode well for railroad stocks.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #148. This rank places it in the bottom 40% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe sell-side analysts covering the companies in this industry have been decreasing their estimates. Over the past year, the industry\u2019s consensus earnings estimate for the current year has decreased 6.2%.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that investors can retain, given their growth prospects, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 and Sector\n\nThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 Composite index as well as the broader sector over the past year.\n\nOver this period, the industry has declined 10.5% compared with the S&P 500 Index\u2019s northward movement of 12.5% and the broader sector\u2019s decline of 10%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 6.14X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 8.06X. It is above the sector\u2019s P/B ratio of 4.21X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.92X, as low as 5.72X and at the median of 7.38X.\n\n3 Stocks to Keep an Eye On\n\nWe are presenting three Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks that are well-positioned to grow in the near term. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nUnion Pacific: Headquartered in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific, through its subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates in the railroad business in the United States.\n\nRelatively stable e-commerce demand, cost-cutting efforts to boost the bottom line and consistent initiatives to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases bode well for UNP\u2019s prospects. Further, UNP has a stellar track record with respect to earnings surprises. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missed the mark in the remaining quarter), with an average beat of 3.35%.\n\nPrice and Consensus: UNP\n\nCanadian Pacific: Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Canadian Pacific manages a transcontinental freight railway in Canada, the United States and Mexico.\n\nWe are encouraged by the Canadian Pacific\u2019s decision to pay dividends consistently. Such a move instills investors\u2019 confidence and positively impacts the company\u2019s bottom line. Canadian Pacific has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise. The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining quarter), delivering an average surprise of 1.76%.\n\nPrice and Consensus: CP\n\nNorfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern engages in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods in the United States.\n\nE-commerce demand is supporting Norfolk Southern\u2019s shipment volumes. The company utilizes the Precision Scheduled Railroading operating plan to reduce costs and enhance services for optimal asset utilization. We are impressed by Norfolk Southern\u2019s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Its strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. NSC\u2019s focus on improving service, safety, and productivity despite the challenges is commendable.\n\nNSC has a solid track record with respect to earnings surprises. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missed the mark in the remaining quarter), with an average beat of 2.94%.\n\nPrice and Consensus: NSC\n\nThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).\n\nZacks Investment Research",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nIn 2024, several major tech companies surprised investors by announcing their first-ever dividend payments. Traditionally, technology firms reinvest billions annually to fuel growth, leading to the perception that they rarely distribute dividends. However, as more large-cap companies prioritize enhancing shareholder returns, a balanced approach\u2014focusing on both income generation and stock appreciation\u2014is increasingly becoming the norm. The market has been experiencing uncertainty in recent days, leaving investors concerned about its future direction. Given this unpredictability, a wise strategy is to consistently invest in high-quality dividend stocks when they are attractively priced, rather than attempting to time market fluctuations.\n\nREAD ALSO: Dividend Stock Portfolio For Income: Top 10 Stocks to Buy\n\nAn analysis of historical trends suggests that undervalued stocks have delivered stronger long-term returns. Research conducted by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth French of Dartmouth College highlighted that stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the broader market index between 1963 and 1990, according to Oakmark Funds. Their findings also noted that growth investors often favored companies with exciting prospects, while value investors focused on more traditional, overlooked stocks. In the long run, value investors tended to see better results.\n\nDuring the high-inflation environment of 2022, value stocks declined by 7%, whereas growth stocks saw a steeper drop of 28.6%. Furthermore, value stocks in the US posted their strongest relative performance against growth stocks since the dot-com crash of 2000.\n\nAnalysts suggest that value stocks tend to hold up relatively well during economic downturns. During recessions, investors often become more risk-averse and seek out stable, resilient investments, which frequently include value stocks. A report by GMO examined the performance of undervalued stocks during US recessions since 1969, using valuation metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-earnings, Composite Value, and a combination of value models within their Opportunistic Value strategies. While the firm does not recommend constructing portfolios based solely on traditional price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios, the report found that even these simple metrics have historically performed fairly well during recessions. Notably, all value models\u2014except price-to-book\u2014delivered stronger returns during recessionary periods (including the COVID-19 downturn) than in non-recession months over the past 55 years.\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed in recent years, largely due to the rising hype surrounding AI-related investments. Despite this, analysts continue to favor dividend stocks for their strong long-term potential. Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist, Dave Sekera, recently shared insights on their future outlook and current valuation. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thinking that dividend stocks are a good place to be in the first half of the year, where you can at least capture some of those high dividends for the next couple of quarters. I also like that those stocks are going to be lower in duration. So if we do have interest rates continuing to climb, those would perform better. And of course, then we also have the unknowns of exactly what a Trump presidency is going to bring here in the first quarter and even into the second quarter. So I think that there is probably more downside risks of the market in the short term than upside risk. So therefore, I like a lot of these dividend stocks, which of course are more often than not in the value category.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create this list, we screened for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 25, as of February 26. Then, we picked companies from that list that have a reliable history of paying dividends consistently to their shareholders. We ranked the resulting list based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 93\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of February 26: 20.53\n\nAn American railroad holding company, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) transports a wide range of products and commodities, providing it with broad exposure across multiple industries. This diversification helps cushion the impact of slowdowns in any one market segment. The company has enhanced its key operational systems, such as Positive Train Control (PTC), Computer-Aided Dispatch (CADx), and Transportation Management (NetControl), to strengthen safety measures. In addition, it has implemented Precision Gate Technology (PGT), which streamlines entry and exit at ramps and provides a seamless rolling-gate experience for drivers, cutting down the time required for container drop-offs and pickups.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) posted revenue of $6.12 billion, reflecting a 1% decline from the prior year. However, a 5% increase in revenue carloads helped offset some of the weakness. The company\u2019s operating ratio improved to 58.7%, marking a 220-basis-point enhancement, despite a 70-basis-point impact from the ratification of a crew staffing agreement. Moreover, operating income rose 5% to $2.5 billion.\n\nOn February 6, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) announced a quarterly dividend of $1.34 per share, maintaining its previous payout. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.18%, as of February 26. The company remained financially strong in FY24, generating over $9.3 billion in operating cash flow and ending the quarter with more than $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This stability has enabled Union Pacific to pay dividends consistently for 125 years and raise its payouts annually for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list.\n\nOverall, UNP ranks 7th on our list of best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other top dividend stocks to buy.\n\nThe sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nDividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market\u2014excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.\n\nGlobal dividend growth had been slowing since the post-COVID recovery, but that trend reversed last year, with the growth rate accelerating to 8%. Shareholders received approximately $180 billion more in payouts than in 2024, which came as a surprise given the prevailing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, according to an S&P Global report. The firm projects that total global dividend payments will remain at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nAnalysts point out that earnings growth has traditionally been the key driver of dividend increases. With strong earnings growth recorded last year, expectations for 2025 are even higher. Goldman projects an 11% rise in earnings per share this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024, which is expected to drive a 7% increase in dividends, compared to a 6% rise last year. Meanwhile, Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, holds an even more optimistic view, forecasting a 12% dividend boost this year, supported by accelerating earnings growth.",

            "content": "Looking forward, as per Harris William\u2019s report, the transportation and logistics sector is expected to grow rapidly in 2025, propelled by M&A activity and economic recovery. The automotive and heavy-duty aftermarkets remain resilient due to higher maintenance demand as new car prices rise. Investors are attracted to non-discretionary services such as repairs and fleet management. Third-party logistics (3PL) is evolving with technologically advanced solutions to optimize supply chains. Transportation infrastructure services (TIS) continue to draw investment due to their critical role in maritime, rail, and road networks. Companies that provide important, high-demand solutions have growth potential, making the sector a prime target for capital deployment and innovation.\n\nAccording to S&P Global\u2019s report, despite a minor slowdown in GDP growth to 2.0% from 2.7% in 2024, the transportation infrastructure industry in the United States is anticipated to experience consistent demand and expansion in 2025. While volume growth in enplanements, port containers, transit ridership, and automobile traffic may moderate, most modes of transportation will continue to grow through 2027. Public transit ridership is projected to stay at 90% of pre-pandemic levels unless external factors, such as reduced remote work or congestion pricing, boost demand. Meanwhile, enplanements, port container traffic, and vehicle travel are likely to stay above pre-pandemic levels, resulting in stable financial performance for this market.\n\nAs of February 22, 2025, the broader market's transportation industry had returned 3.14% in the previous year, 5.25% in the previous five years, and 4.85% over the last ten. However, performance was negative, at 2.24% year to date and 0.80% over three years.\n\nAccording to the Business Research Company , the transport market has expanded significantly in recent years. It is projected to rise from $6941.93 billion in 2024 to $7522.07 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 8.4%. Economic expansion, population increase, technical improvements, and consumer behavior are all factors that contributed to historical growth. Meanwhile, the transportation sector is anticipated to boom significantly in the next few years. It will reach $9968.7 billion in 2029, with a compound annual growth rate of 7.3%. Regionally, Western Europe had the largest transport market in 2024. Asia-Pacific was the second-largest inland water transport market.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Transportation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other transportation stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFrank Mountcastle Head of M&A Group, Head Managing Director, commented:\n\n\"The transportation and logistics industry's mix of established and emerging growth drivers will continue to attract a wide set of investors,\" \"The future is bright for businesses that embrace technology to create efficiencies and add more value while bringing specialized capabilities and a broader array of solutions to their customers.\"\n\nAccording to the PWC\u2019s Transportation and Logistics: US Deals 2025 outlook, the U.S. transportation and logistics industry saw $51.5 billion in deal value across 71 announced transactions in the six months ended November 15, 2024, up from $39.5 billion and 69 agreements in the previous period. This growth shows that investor confidence is rising in line with improved profitability. The transportation and logistics (T&L) sector is seeing an increase in dealmaking due to strong economic conditions and investor confidence. Following the Federal Reserve's first rate decrease in over four years and the next administration's deregulatory agenda, M&A activity is expected to revive. While financial purchasers' participation has slowed, strategic participants are driving transactions, particularly as freight rates and profitability stabilize. Trucking consolidation, railroad logistics innovation, and technological developments in logistics are all key themes to keep an eye on. To profit on the expected market rebound, dealmakers will need agility in fundraising, talent retention, and a strong M&A playbook.\n\nDarach Chapman, US Transportation and Logistics Deals Leader, stated:\n\n\u201cT&L deals activity is set to rebound, driven by demand recovery and supply rationalization. However, macro factors such as trade policy and deregulation will continue to shape M&A opportunities.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through holdings of Transportation ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 transportation stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds in Q4 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. We have used the stock\u2019s Market Cap as of February 22 as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJim Cramer on Union Pacific (UNP): \"Railroads? I Just Think We\u2019re Not Being Thoughtful\"\n\nAn intermodal container train winding through a rural landscape.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 93\n\nOne of the Best Transportation Stocks, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a rail freight transportation firm. It has a large railroad network over 23 states, and it is actively growing its mainline and terminal capacity by building new sidings and extending old ones. These projects are especially critical in high-growth areas like the Pacific Northwest, where modifications are being made to enable growing exports of soda ash and grain. In the Southwest, attempts are being made to improve intermodal services. In addition, the company is implementing new technology like GPS tracking for containers and rail pulse systems to boost service reliability, provide real-time tracking, and improve customer communication.\n\nThe stock has surged by more than 7% so far in 2025. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) had a 5% rise in revenue carloads, which contributed to improved financial results in Q4 2024. Despite a 70-basis-point setback due to the ratification of a crew staffing agreement, its operating ratio grew to 58.7%, representing a 220-basis-point improvement. The operating income rose by 5% to $2.5 billion. Furthermore, management is confident about 2025, with a $4.5 billion share repurchase plan and a capex target of $3.4 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst David Vernon boosted Union Pacific Corporation's (NYSE:UNP) price target to $284 from $277, maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock. According to the firm, railroads have transitioned from a consensus-long sector to a very boring group, dragged down by sluggish demand and battling with cost pressure and margin erosion. Bernstein believes that \"we are moving past the worst of times.\"\n\nBretton Fund stated the following regarding Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe main detractor was Dream Finders, taking 1.5% off the fund, and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) was a minor detractor with a -0.2% impact. The rail industry has seen tepid revenue growth the past few years as higher-revenue coal volume declines and is replaced by lower-revenue intermodal volume sourced from ocean and truck carriers. Despite the growth challenge, Union Pacific managed to cut costs and grow earnings per share by 6%. The stock returned -5%.\u201d\n\nOverall UNP ranks 3rd on our list of the best transportation stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks.\n\nIn 2024, several major tech companies surprised investors by announcing their first-ever dividend payments. Traditionally, technology firms reinvest billions annually to fuel growth, leading to the perception that they rarely distribute dividends. However, as more large-cap companies prioritize enhancing shareholder returns, a balanced approach\u2014focusing on both income generation and stock appreciation\u2014is increasingly becoming the norm. The market has been experiencing uncertainty in recent days, leaving investors concerned about its future direction. Given this unpredictability, a wise strategy is to consistently invest in high-quality dividend stocks when they are attractively priced, rather than attempting to time market fluctuations.\n\nREAD ALSO: Dividend Stock Portfolio For Income: Top 10 Stocks to Buy\n\nAn analysis of historical trends suggests that undervalued stocks have delivered stronger long-term returns. Research conducted by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth French of Dartmouth College highlighted that stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the broader market index between 1963 and 1990, according to Oakmark Funds. Their findings also noted that growth investors often favored companies with exciting prospects, while value investors focused on more traditional, overlooked stocks. In the long run, value investors tended to see better results.\n\nDuring the high-inflation environment of 2022, value stocks declined by 7%, whereas growth stocks saw a steeper drop of 28.6%. Furthermore, value stocks in the US posted their strongest relative performance against growth stocks since the dot-com crash of 2000.\n\nAnalysts suggest that value stocks tend to hold up relatively well during economic downturns. During recessions, investors often become more risk-averse and seek out stable, resilient investments, which frequently include value stocks. A report by GMO examined the performance of undervalued stocks during US recessions since 1969, using valuation metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-earnings, Composite Value, and a combination of value models within their Opportunistic Value strategies. While the firm does not recommend constructing portfolios based solely on traditional price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios, the report found that even these simple metrics have historically performed fairly well during recessions. Notably, all value models\u2014except price-to-book\u2014delivered stronger returns during recessionary periods (including the COVID-19 downturn) than in non-recession months over the past 55 years.\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed in recent years, largely due to the rising hype surrounding AI-related investments. Despite this, analysts continue to favor dividend stocks for their strong long-term potential. Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist, Dave Sekera, recently shared insights on their future outlook and current valuation. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thinking that dividend stocks are a good place to be in the first half of the year, where you can at least capture some of those high dividends for the next couple of quarters. I also like that those stocks are going to be lower in duration. So if we do have interest rates continuing to climb, those would perform better. And of course, then we also have the unknowns of exactly what a Trump presidency is going to bring here in the first quarter and even into the second quarter. So I think that there is probably more downside risks of the market in the short term than upside risk. So therefore, I like a lot of these dividend stocks, which of course are more often than not in the value category.\u201d\n\nIn view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create this list, we screened for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 25, as of February 26. Then, we picked companies from that list that have a reliable history of paying dividends consistently to their shareholders. We ranked the resulting list based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:HD) is an American multinational home improvement retail corporation that offers related products and services to its consumers. The company operates in over 2,300 locations across North America and is influenced by shifts in the real estate market. While the company is known for its consistent growth and strong profitability, it has faced challenges due to high mortgage rates. These higher borrowing costs have led to a slowdown in home sales and a reduced number of properties on the market, ultimately impacting consumer spending on home improvement projects. The stock has surged modestly by just 0.52% since the start of 2025.\n\nThat said, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) recently reported strong fourth-quarter earnings for 2024, with revenue reaching $39.7 billion\u2014an increase of more than 14% compared to the previous year.

(NYSE:MRK) is an American multinational pharmaceutical company, headquartered in New Jersey. The company offers innovative health solutions to its consumers. The stock has declined by nearly 10% since the start of 2025. The recent drop in stock price is primarily attributed to lower-than-expected revenue guidance for 2025. The company projected revenue between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion, falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations of $67.31 billion. Another factor impacting its outlook is the temporary suspension of Gardasil shipments to China, with deliveries expected to resume by mid-2025.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported $15.6 billion in revenue, reflecting a 7% increase from the same period the previous year. The company has strengthened its leadership in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, with its flagship cancer treatment, Keytruda, playing a key role in transforming cancer care and driving substantial revenue growth. Strong market positioning has allowed Merck to generate significant cash flow, supporting shareholder returns. In fiscal 2024, Keytruda sales climbed 18% year-over-year, reaching $29.5 billion.\n\nOn January 28, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend.

The company is prioritizing its oncology pipeline as a key driver of future growth, with plans to introduce several blockbuster drugs by 2030. To strengthen its portfolio, the company is expected to continue seeking acquisitions of promising pharmaceutical firms. A significant portion of its pandemic-related earnings was used to acquire Seagen, a biotech company specializing in oncology, for $43 billion.\n\nAdditionally, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported a 12% operational revenue increase from its non-COVID products over the past year, highlighting its strategic focus on execution. The company successfully reached its $4 billion net cost savings target through an ongoing cost realignment program and has now raised its goal to approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. Under its Manufacturing Optimization Program, Pfizer aims to achieve $1.5 billion in net cost savings by 2027, with initial savings expected in the latter half of 2025. The company remains confident in its ability to restore pre-pandemic operating margins in the years ahead.\n\nPfizer Inc.

In addition, it has implemented Precision Gate Technology (PGT), which streamlines entry and exit at ramps and provides a seamless rolling-gate experience for drivers, cutting down the time required for container drop-offs and pickups.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) posted revenue of $6.12 billion, reflecting a 1% decline from the prior year. However, a 5% increase in revenue carloads helped offset some of the weakness. The company\u2019s operating ratio improved to 58.7%, marking a 220-basis-point enhancement, despite a 70-basis-point impact from the ratification of a crew staffing agreement. Moreover, operating income rose 5% to $2.5 billion.\n\nOn February 6, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) announced a quarterly dividend of $1.34 per share, maintaining its previous payout. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.18%, as of February 26.

            "content": "Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nUnion Pacific in Focus\n\nBased in Omaha, Union Pacific (UNP) is in the Transportation sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 7.83%. The railroad is paying out a dividend of $1.34 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.18% compared to the Transportation - Rail industry's yield of 1.49% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.54%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5.36 is up 1.5% from last year. Union Pacific has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 8.44%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Union Pacific's current payout ratio is 48%. This means it paid out 48% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nLooking at this fiscal year, UNP expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $11.99 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 8.12%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\n\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, UNP is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nLast Wednesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, questioned whether the market was still following a clear and predictable business cycle, suggesting there were \u201chuge conflicting currents\u201d that made the economy difficult to navigate. Reflecting on his early days in the industry, Cramer explained that back then, understanding the business cycle was important.\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Suggested Buying These 8 Stocks on Weakness and Jim Cramer Talked About These 12 Stocks Recently\n\n\u201cIf business was too strong, the Fed might raise rates, pull things off. If business was too weak, you might have some rate cuts. You always had to pay attention to these things, right, because you didn\u2019t wanna fight the Fed.\u201d\n\nBut on that particular day, with the Dow gaining 71 points, the S&P advancing by 0.24% to reach a new all-time record, and the Nasdaq edging up by 0.07%, Cramer began to reconsider whether the traditional concept of the business cycle had become outdated.\n\nCramer went on to highlight the puzzling movements in specific sectors, especially food and beverage and drug stocks, which showed some unexpected gains. These industries, often seen as immune to economic cycles, seemed to defy the typical patterns.\n\nHe pointed out that in light of the current administration\u2019s stance on food policy, especially with a health and human services secretary who has expressed disdain for processed foods and vaccinations, it was not just a cycle affecting these sectors anymore, it felt more like a targeted attack on the industries themselves. Cramer wondered, \u201cWhat if RFK Jr. wakes up tomorrow and says, \u2018I\u2019m banning Fruit Loops\u2019 or stopping weight loss shots?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, everyone in this administration seems to think that the federal government could do whatever it wants. That\u2019s not, that\u2019s not how our system works or at least it\u2019s not how the Constitution says it works, but the blight\u2019s very much with us, even with today\u2019s reprieve.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 19. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 93\n\nCommenting on Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) during the episode, Cramer said:\n\n\u201cUnion Pacific didn\u2019t seem all that exciting either. Coal\u2019s weak, chemicals\u2019 horrible, those are the ones that go into plastic.\u201d\n\nUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) provides transportation services for a broad range of products, including agricultural goods, chemicals, metals, petroleum, and automobiles, serving various industries such as agriculture, construction, and manufacturing. As we mentioned in our article, Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle, Cramer commented on the company and said:\n\n\u201cYes, let\u2019s talk about the railroad. I mean it\u2019s a gigantic railroad. Reported excellent numbers. Jim Vena is now running it. . . The operating ratio which of course you want to go lower was superb. And David I\u2019ve got to tell you, they\u2019ve got strong core pricing gains for industrials which I think is where you\u2019re gonna do very well. Premium strength to, in international West Coast imports. This is really good and they, intermodal growth. I\u2019ve got to tell you, this just may be one of the great reports. Now I\u2019m gonna go a step too far. Alright. But the President is an old energy guy. West Virginia, Wyoming, Pennsylvania. The three biggest coal producers, Wyoming at the top, okay. Coal. I think coal\u2019s gonna come back in fashion\u2026 [When asked why?] Well those three states went for Trump. . .natural gas is, I think is going to five. And at that point they switch. Because there\u2019s really coal all over the country and we\u2019re going to export a lot. . . And by the way, coal was thirty percent of how we heated things in ten years ago and now it\u2019s down to fifteen percent.\u201d\n\nOverall, UNP ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Union Pacific Railroad has made some progress in its effort to transfer three of its commuter rail lines to Metra control. But one major issue remains \u2014 how much Metra will pay for using the tracks, platforms and rail yards, which Union Pacific will continue to own.\n\nThe fate of the deal is important in Evanston, since the UP-North line that runs through the city is one of the lines affected.\n\nFor the past six years, the freight railroad has been trying to get out of the commuter rail business. Under the transfer plan first envisioned in 2023, UP would keep ownership of the rail tracks and some stations, while Metra would operate the trains. Metra has this kind of arrangement with freight railroads for North Central Service, SouthWest Service and Heritage Corridor lines.\n\nThe two entities are currently in the process of moving Union Pacific employees who handled the commuter rail operations over to Metra. But according to UP spokesperson Robynn Tysver, the two entities made several attempts to figure out the track usage issue, to no avail.\n\nThere is also the matter of the ultimate fate of three Evanston stations, which Union Pacific still owns. Tysver indicated that the freight railroad isn\u2019t interested in selling the stations, but it is open to Metra and/or the City of Evanston leasing them.\n\nLong transition\n\nThe current arrangement dates back to the 1970s, when the Regional Transportation Authority was set up to subsidize private-public transit services. Chicago & North Western Railroad, which controlled the three lines at the time, agreed to keep the service going on behalf of what would eventually become Metra, using its own crews to run and maintain trains. When Union Pacific bought the company in 1995, it continued the arrangement.\n\nBut in 2019, UP decided to get out of the commuter rail business \u2014 something that Metra initially resisted. In 2023, the two sides agreed to begin the transfer, which was supposed to be completed in March 2024.\n\nLast fall, mechanics and customer service agents transferred to Metra. According to UP, the transfer of train engineers, conductors and other employees involved in keeping trains running are expected to be completed by April.\n\nDuring its Feb. 19 meeting, the Metra Board of Directors approved an amendment to the existing agreement that sets April 16 as the date of the transfer. The agreement was approved as part of a larger consent agenda, unanimously and without discussion.\n\nOnce the transfer is complete, Union Pacific will continue to dispatch the trains and maintain the tracks.\n\nBut the question of how much Metra will pay UP for the right to use tracks, platforms and other infrastructure remains unresolved.\n\n\u201cIn August 2024, Metra and Union Pacific agreed to mediate the compensation matter before the Surface Transportation Board,\u201d a Union Pacific press release indicated. \u201cThe mediation, which had been extended several times, ended Jan. 31, 2025, without an agreement. Union Pacific extended an offer to Metra to use binding arbitration to resolve the issue.\u201d\n\nLiisa Stark, UP\u2019s vice president of public affairs, stated that \u201cwe are committed to reaching a financial agreement this year that is fair to both parties.\u201d\n\nTysver declined to share any further details on the compensation issue.\n\nStation ownership\n\nCentral Street train station. Credit: RoundTable File Photo\n\nWhile UP doesn\u2019t own all of the stations on its lines, it owns the three stations in Evanston: the Main Street, Davis Street and Central Street stations. Tysver said the UP-owned stations were never part of the transition, but she said the railroad is willing to lease them.\n\n\u201cUnion Pacific seeks to earn a fair market return for all its properties and intends to seek compensation for use of the stations,\u201d she said. \u201cMetra or the City of Evanston is free to make an offer to lease the station properties.\u201d\n\nAll three station buildings have waiting rooms and spaces that have been rented. Davis Street station\u2019s ground level is home to the Alcove Evanston restaurant, while the other two stations\u2019 retail spaces are unoccupied.",

            "content": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Union Pacific ( ) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Union Pacific is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.16 = US$9.8b \u00f7 (US$68b - US$5.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nSo, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Transportation industry average of 7.1% it's much better.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Union Pacific compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can for free.\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nThere hasn't been much to report for Union Pacific's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Union Pacific to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Union Pacific is paying out 37% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nIn summary, Union Pacific isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 68% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.\n\nUnion Pacific does have some risks though, and we've spotted that you might be interested in.\n\nWhile Union Pacific may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nThe sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nDividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market\u2014excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.\n\nGlobal dividend growth had been slowing since the post-COVID recovery, but that trend reversed last year, with the growth rate accelerating to 8%. Shareholders received approximately $180 billion more in payouts than in 2024, which came as a surprise given the prevailing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, according to an S&P Global report. The firm projects that total global dividend payments will remain at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nAnalysts point out that earnings growth has traditionally been the key driver of dividend increases. With strong earnings growth recorded last year, expectations for 2025 are even higher. Goldman projects an 11% rise in earnings per share this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024, which is expected to drive a 7% increase in dividends, compared to a 6% rise last year. Meanwhile, Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, holds an even more optimistic view, forecasting a 12% dividend boost this year, supported by accelerating earnings growth.\n\nHistorically, dividends accounted for 40% of the market\u2019s total returns from 1936 to 2012, but their contribution has dropped to just 16% over the past decade, according to a BofA Securities research note published late last year. However, Kwon expects dividends to play a more substantial role in overall market returns moving forward. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and identified the top 10 companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and have dividend yields of at least 1%, as of February 25.

            "content": "Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Union Pacific's shares before the 28th of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 31st of March.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$1.34 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.36 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Union Pacific stock has a trailing yield of around 2.2% on the current share price of US$245.55. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Union Pacific can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Union Pacific\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Union Pacific's payout ratio is modest, at just 48% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Union Pacific generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (55%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.\n\nIt's positive to see that Union Pacific's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNYSE:UNP Historic Dividend February 23rd 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see Union Pacific earnings per share are up 5.8% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Union Pacific has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.",

            "sentiment": null,
            "probability": null,
            "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, of course, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb and vice versa.\n\nThe ability to identify stocks that are likely to top quarterly earnings expectations can be profitable, but it's no simple task. Here at Zacks, our Earnings ESP filter helps make things easier.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.\n\nWith this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.\n\nIn fact, when we combined a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. Perhaps most importantly, using these parameters has helped produce 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.\n\nMost stocks, about 60%, fall into the #3 (Hold) category, and they are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with a #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) rating, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market, with Strong Buy stocks outperforming more than any other rank.\n\nShould You Consider International Seaways?\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to quickly look at a qualifying stock. International Seaways (INSW) holds a #3 (Hold) at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.81 a share seven days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 27, 2025.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $0.81 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.70 Zacks Consensus Estimate, International Seaways has an Earnings ESP of +16.19%. Investors should also know that INSW is one of a large group of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nINSW is just one of a large group of Transportation stocks with a positive ESP figure. Union Pacific (UNP) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nUnion Pacific is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 24, 2025. UNP's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.79 a share 63 days from its next earnings release.\n\nUnion Pacific's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at +0.18% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.79.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, INSW and UNP could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Why These 15 Transportation Stocks Are Skyrocketing So Far in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other transportation stocks.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs threat is making the broader market more volatile, but some stocks in the transportation industry are benefiting from it as frontloading increases and shipping rates surge. Moreover, the past few years have been solid for most types of transportation stocks in the energy industry due to shipping getting more expensive after February 2022 and even more expensive as using the Suez Canal became risky in late 2023.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s not just energy transportation stocks that stand to benefit. Airline stocks have struggled recently, but as interest rates come down lower, some are already starting to post solid gains. 2025 could be a breakout year for the transportation industry as a whole. As such, it\u2019s worth looking into those that have delivered the most gains so far in 2025.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, I screened the top-performing transportation software stocks year-to-date. Stocks that I have covered recently will be excluded from this list.\n\nI will also mention the number of hedge fund investors in these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nJim Cramer on Union Pacific (UNP): \"Railroads? I Just Think We\u2019re Not Being Thoughtful\"\n\nAn intermodal container train winding through a rural landscape.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 78\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a rail freight transportation company.\n\nThe stock is up significantly so far in 2025 as it posted solid Q4 2024 earnings. It posted EPS of $2.91, which surpassed analyst estimates and grew 7.4% year-over-year. Moreover, management is optimistic about 2025 and features a $4.5 billion share repurchase plan, along with a CapEx target of $3.4 billion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect Union Pacific Corporation's earnings per share to grow 8.3% year-over-year to $12.01.\n\nThe consensus price target of $261.4 implies 4.87% upside.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation stock is up 9.29% year-to-date.\n\nOverall UNP ranks 15th on our list of the transportation stocks that are skyrocketing so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

Support is at a price of 15,600 \u2013 16,100 with this area being quite important for USDT (USDT). A break through this area will make the EMA/200 confirmed to move down.\n\n2.MANTRA (OM)\n\nThe strengthening of MANTRA (OM) is quite significant, MANTRA (OM) has increased by more than 100% since it was confirmed to have successfully continued the Bullish trend on January 26, 2025. The RSI indicator shows that MANTRA (OM) has moved away from the Overbought area with a positive area in the trend change.\n\n3.Hedera (HBAR)\n\nFailure to form a Candle above the 5,600 \u2013 6,500 area caused Hedera (HBAR) to experience a correction, cutting below the WMA/75 so that the MACD indicator shows that the trend is in a negative area.\n\n4.Chainlink (LINK)\n\nThe Bullish trend movement will continue positive changes with a trend that can penetrate the 410,000 \u2013 500,000 Chainlink (LINK) area, potentially heading towards the next Resistance in the range of 550,000 \u2013 650,000.\n\n5.Litecoin (LTC)\n\nThe potential for Litecoin (LTC) to penetrate the Resistance of 2,150,000 \u2013 2,350,000 is quite wide open, currently the Candle is being held back by the EMA/75 with the MACD indicator indicating a positive trend change with an upward line intersection.\n\n5 Aset Kripto Bearish\n\n1.Krypton DAO (KRD)\n\nThe price movement of Krypton DAO (KRD) has not shown positive strengthening, the previous trend was able to move beyond WMA/85 but failed to survive and weakened again as depicted by the MACD indicator, weakening beyond the 3,200 level will indicate that Krypton DAO (KRD) has touched its lowest price.\n\n2.VELO (VELO)\n\nAfter the 560 \u2013 640 area became a strong Resistance area, the inability of the trend to Break this area caused VELO (VELO) to weaken quite deeply and had an impact on the trend turning into a Downtrend.\n\n3.Just a chill guy (CHILLGUY)\n\nJust a chill guy (CHILLGUY), is identified if there is no significant price movement in the 4-hour chart. Just a chill guy (CHILLGUY) is still moving stagnantly, the trend has failed to break the Resistance of 800 \u2013 1,200.\n\n4.Popcat (POPCAT)\n\nUnable to penetrate the Resistance area of ??6,000 \u2013 7,000 has a negative impact on the price of Popcat (POPCAT), the price has weakened again and moved below WMA/85, making the Bearish trend increasingly dominant.\n\n5.SLERF (SLERF)\n\nThe opportunity for SLERF (SLERF) to touch its lowest price is quite large, the MACD indicator indicates that the trend is in a negative area with SLERF (SLERF) currently moving below WMA/85.\n\nNOTE: If the 5 EMA crosses the WMA 75, 85 and 200 EMA lines and the lines intersect from the bottom up, then the market trend tends to go up (bullish), each table above shows that if the 5 EMA value is higher than the 75.85 WMA and 200 EMA, the market tends to go up (bullish).\n\nIf the RSI and MACD values ??show the same condition, it means that the market is showing the same trend. Overbought or oversold conditions are an indicator that the market is already at the point of changing direction of a trend.\n\nATTENTION: All contents which includes text, analysis, predictions, images in the form of graphics and charts, as well as news published on this website, is only used as trading information, and is not a recommendation or suggestion to take action in transacting either buying or selling. certain crypto assets.

This rolling tribute highlights the pivotal role rail played and continues to play in the global economy and the transformative contributions of our nation\u2019s 16th president.\n\nUnion Pacific No. 1616 - The Lincoln Locomotive (Photo: Business Wire)\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s history is Union Pacific\u2019s history,\u201d said Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena. \u201cBy signing the Pacific Railway Act of 1862, President Lincoln created our railroad and ignited The Great Race to connect the country and fuel the economy \u2013 roles our industry still plays today.\u201d\n\nRailroads move about 59 tons of goods annually for every American across more than 140,000 miles of privately owned tracks. At Union Pacific, on top of money spent to operate the railroad, an additional $10 million in capital is invested every day into infrastructure, technology and network expansion to provide the safe, reliable service American businesses and families rely on.\n\n\u201cPresident Lincoln wanted to unite the nation, and through his actions, railroads were a catalyst for national growth, representing major advances in innovation and technology,\u201d Vena said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be part of an industry that is still a major part of the central nervous system of the North American economy and continues to provide innovative solutions that unleash economic innovation.\u201d\n\nNo. 1616 is the second presidential locomotive in Union Pacific\u2019s Heritage Fleet, joining No. 4141, created to honor President George H.W. Bush. On Dec. 6, 2018, Union Pacific was honored to participate in President Bush\u2019s funeral train, led by No. 4141, from Spring to College Station, Texas , where the locomotive is on permanent display at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nThe Lincoln locomotive is being painted by proud Union Pacific employees and will be officially unveiled at a celebration this spring. The paint scheme has the unique colors of Lincoln\u2019s era and serves as a nod to locomotive No. 119, one of the two locomotives present at Promontory Summit, Utah , marking the completion of the first transcontinental railroad, officially uniting the eastern and western parts of the nation.\n\nThis year marks Lincoln\u2019s 216th birthday and the locomotive will travel the rails, serving as a traveling ambassador and participating in community events and educational programs that highlight the historic role of railroads in America\u2019s growth and its continued contribution to our country, communities and economy. Future dates will be announced at UP.com.\n\nA limited-edition commemorative poster is available for sale at the Union Pacific Store.\n\nABOUT UNION PACIFIC\n\nUnion Pacific (NYSE: UNP) delivers the goods families and businesses use every day with safe, reliable and efficient service.

The company connects major ports, industrial hubs, and international rail networks while transporting agricultural products, automotive goods, chemicals, and other commodities.\n\nShares of the major freight rail system operator have lagged behind the broader market over the past 52 weeks. UNP has risen 1.6% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied nearly 23% . However, shares of UNP are up 9.4% on a YTD basis, outpacing SPX\u2019s 3.6% gain.\n\nFocusing more closely, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company has underperformed the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s ( XLI ) 18.7% return over the past 52 weeks.\n\nShares of Union Pacific surged 5.2% on Jan. 23 after the company reported Q4 2024 EPS of $2.91 , surpassing analyst expectations and marking a 7.4% year-over-year increase. Despite a slight revenue miss at $6.1 billion, investors focused on operational improvements, including a 6% increase in car miles per employee and enhanced freight car velocity. Additionally, management\u2019s bullish outlook for 2025, featuring a $4.5 billion share repurchase plan and a capital expenditure target of $3.4 billion, reinforced investor confidence, driving the stock higher.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect UNP\u2019s EPS to grow 8.3% year-over-year to $12.01. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It topped the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion.\n\nAmong the 25 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 14 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d nine \u201cHolds,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 24, Baird raised Union Pacific\u2019s price target to $265 , maintaining an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating.\n\nAs of writing, UNP is trading below the mean price target of $264.32. The Street-high price target of $285 implies a potential upside of 14.3% from the current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

UNP has risen 1.6% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied nearly 23% . However, shares of UNP are up 9.4% on a YTD basis, outpacing SPX\u2019s 3.6% gain.\n\nFocusing more closely, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company has underperformed the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s ( XLI ) 18.7% return over the past 52 weeks.\n\nShares of Union Pacific surged 5.2% on Jan. 23 after the company reported Q4 2024 EPS of $2.91 , surpassing analyst expectations and marking a 7.4% year-over-year increase. Despite a slight revenue miss at $6.1 billion, investors focused on operational improvements, including a 6% increase in car miles per employee and enhanced freight car velocity. Additionally, management\u2019s bullish outlook for 2025, featuring a $4.5 billion share repurchase plan and a capital expenditure target of $3.4 billion, reinforced investor confidence, driving the stock higher.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect UNP\u2019s EPS to grow 8.3% year-over-year to $12.01. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It topped the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion.\n\nAmong the 25 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 14 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d nine \u201cHolds,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 24, Baird raised Union Pacific\u2019s price target to $265 , maintaining an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating.\n\nAs of writing, UNP is trading below the mean price target of $264.32.

            "content": "Union Pacific Corporation is a leading transportation and logistics company based in Omaha, Nebraska. Founded in 1862, the company has a rich history of serving customers across North America with safe, reliable and efficient rail transportation solutions. Union Pacific operates in two business segments: Railroad and Premium Operations.\n\nThe Railroad segment comprises the company's core operations, including freight transportation and logistics services. The Premium Operations segment includes Union Pacific's subsidiary, Union Pacific Distribution Services, which provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries.\n\nWith over 32,000 miles of rail network across 23 states, Union Pacific connects major markets and communities across North America. The company is committed to sustainability and has set ambitious goals to reduce emissions and increase the use of alternative fuels.\n\nUnion Pacific has consistently performed in the transportation and logistics industry, delivering strong financial results over the past few years. It is also important to mention that Union Pacific's debt levels have been relatively stable over the past few years. For several years, the company has maintained a healthy cash position between 1 - 3 billion dollars.\n\nUnion Pacific operates in the transportation and logistics industry, which is highly competitive and regulated. The industry has seen significant changes in recent years, including the growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.\n\nUnion Pacific faces competition from other railroads, trucking companies and intermodal transportation providers. The company also competes with alternative modes of transportation, such as air and sea freight. Regulatory and political issues, such as changes in trade policies and environmental regulations, can impact the industry and create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nDespite these challenges, Union Pacific has maintained its market position and continues to invest in technology and innovation to improve its services and meet the evolving needs of its customers.\n\nUnion Pacific's leadership team is led by Lance Fritz, who has been the company's Chairman, President and CEO since 2015. Fritz joined Union Pacific in 2000 and has held several leadership roles. The management team also includes other experienced executives who bring diverse skills and expertise to the company.\n\nUnion Pacific has several growth opportunities in the transportation and logistics industry. The company has invested in technology and innovation to improve its services and increase efficiency. For example, Union Pacific has implemented Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), a new operating model that has enhanced train speeds and reduced costs.\n\nThe company also has opportunities for growth in new markets and industries. Union Pacific's subsidiary, UPDS, provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries, including automotive, chemicals and agriculture. The company could expand its services into other sectors and markets to drive growth.\n\nUnion Pacific faces several risks and challenges in the transportation and logistics industry. Changes in consumer preferences and competitive pressures can impact the company's revenue and profitability. The shift towards e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions could also create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nUnion Pacific also faces risks related to its operations and infrastructure. The company's rail network is subject to weather and natural disasters, which can disrupt operations and impact the company's financial performance. Union Pacific also faces cybersecurity and data privacy risks, which could impact the company's operations and reputation.",

Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H. Watson Chair in Value Investing at the University of Toronto and was previously an Associate Professor at the Columbia Business School.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop Large-Cap Growth Stocks\n\nFactor-Based Stock Portfolios\n\nDividend Aristocrats 2025\n\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\n\nTop S&P 500 Stocks\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Union Pacific operates in two business segments: Railroad and Premium Operations.\n\nThe Railroad segment comprises the company's core operations, including freight transportation and logistics services. The Premium Operations segment includes Union Pacific's subsidiary, Union Pacific Distribution Services, which provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries.\n\nWith over 32,000 miles of rail network across 23 states, Union Pacific connects major markets and communities across North America. The company is committed to sustainability and has set ambitious goals to reduce emissions and increase the use of alternative fuels.\n\nUnion Pacific has consistently performed in the transportation and logistics industry, delivering strong financial results over the past few years. It is also important to mention that Union Pacific's debt levels have been relatively stable over the past few years. For several years, the company has maintained a healthy cash position between 1 - 3 billion dollars.\n\nUnion Pacific operates in the transportation and logistics industry, which is highly competitive and regulated. The industry has seen significant changes in recent years, including the growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.\n\nUnion Pacific faces competition from other railroads, trucking companies and intermodal transportation providers. The company also competes with alternative modes of transportation, such as air and sea freight. Regulatory and political issues, such as changes in trade policies and environmental regulations, can impact the industry and create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nDespite these challenges, Union Pacific has maintained its market position and continues to invest in technology and innovation to improve its services and meet the evolving needs of its customers.\n\nUnion Pacific's leadership team is led by Lance Fritz, who has been the company's Chairman, President and CEO since 2015. Fritz joined Union Pacific in 2000 and has held several leadership roles. The management team also includes other experienced executives who bring diverse skills and expertise to the company.\n\nUnion Pacific has several growth opportunities in the transportation and logistics industry. The company has invested in technology and innovation to improve its services and increase efficiency. For example, Union Pacific has implemented Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), a new operating model that has enhanced train speeds and reduced costs.\n\nThe company also has opportunities for growth in new markets and industries.

The company could expand its services into other sectors and markets to drive growth.\n\nUnion Pacific faces several risks and challenges in the transportation and logistics industry. Changes in consumer preferences and competitive pressures can impact the company's revenue and profitability. The shift towards e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions could also create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nUnion Pacific also faces risks related to its operations and infrastructure. The company's rail network is subject to weather and natural disasters, which can disrupt operations and impact the company's financial performance. Union Pacific also faces cybersecurity and data privacy risks, which could impact the company's operations and reputation.",

            "content": "Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\n\nUnion Pacific in Focus\n\nBased in Omaha, Union Pacific (UNP) is in the Transportation sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 6.16%. Currently paying a dividend of $1.34 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.21%. In comparison, the Transportation - Rail industry's yield is 1.46%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.49%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5.36 is up 1.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Union Pacific has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.44%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Union Pacific's payout ratio is 48%, which means it paid out 48% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nUNP is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $12.01 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 8.30%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.\n\nHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, UNP is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025. Handpicked by Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian, this portfolio has been stunningly and consistently successful.

They\u2019re not watching television anymore.\u201d\n\nDeborah Steele, News Director at the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union, points out that the universal availability of multimedia news on the web is a major advantage, ensuring inclusivity for all.\n\n\u201cMaintaining a multi-platform delivery is really important so that those people who only have access to radio can still get content, people who are in the groove with television content can still see that, but it\u2019s possible to provide more entry points to news content that make sure that no one is left out.\u201d\n\nThe workshops and conferences organized by Asia Pacific Broadcasting Union and Fijian Broadcasting Corporation will continue tomorrow.\n\nClick Here for Viti Plus Link\n\nStream the best of Fiji on VITI+.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Tells Viewers To Not Trust Billionaires & Discusses These 11 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other stocks Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the potential impact on Wall Street from President Trump\u2019s potential actions against Denmark, Panama, and South Africa. Amongst other actions, the President has vowed to make Denmark\u2019s Greenland territory a part of the US and threatened to cut funding to South Africa over allegations of land confiscations.\n\nCramer believes that the \u201cstreet sells\u201d in response to these actions. He stated \u201cThat\u2019s what happens. I\u2019m not in any hurry to buy anything. We just were at a high. We had some big turmoil in tech as it was. We got a lot of quarters this week.\u201d However, while the absolute near-term outlook might be uncertain, all sectors aren\u2019t bad. According to Cramer \u201cThe only stuff I would think about buying are the drugs, medical device. Because their business, for the most part, not made in China, not made in Mexico. So those are the ones.\u201d\n\nOne outcome that was clear from the November election campaigns was that President Trump differs significantly from President Biden when it comes to policy. However, he might continue one aspect of the previous administration. Cramer shared that when it comes to drug prices \u201cRemember, the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act], under Biden, they did lower the prices. I think that\u2019s something that President Trump would continue to do.\u201d He also believes that \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a canard, the drug companies charge a lot here.\u201d\n\nOne interesting discussion during the show surrounded hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones\u2018 comments about the general economic climate being \u201cprecarious.\u201d Cramer took issue with Jones\u2019 word choice. He started by outlining \u201cI want to point out that once again, we have billionaires on. And billionaires always say it\u2019s incredibly precarious.\u201d As a result, Cramer pointed out that \u201cPeople at home therefore sell and they miss great opportunities to buy because they hear that it\u2019s really precarious from someone who\u2019s a billionaire so therefore it is.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC TV host urged people to keep investing as \u201cyou can\u2019t make money listening to a billionaire because they already have made money.\u201d When asked whether his advice meant that he was encouraging stock buying at a time when markets were dipping he replied \u201cNo, look I\u2019m not saying to buy. I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s a very tough word, precarious makes it sound like that we are in a systemic moment. I save that for 2007, 2008 when we were precarious.\u201d",

The event, held in New York City on Tuesday, brought together PR pros from all parts of the industry to address the trends most impacting their day-to-day practice and equip them for the complex tasks ahead.\n\nHere are highlights from the day.\n\nKeynote: Communications lessons from the West Wing\n\nBen LaBolt, former President Joe Biden\u2019s communications director in 2023, also served as national press secretary for former President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign and as a key press aide in the Obama White House.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at PRDecoded, LaBolt described the change in the media environment from the Obama to Biden years as \u201cimmense.\u201d He said general media viewership had fractured to the point where even a once highly coveted sit-down interview with the president rarely generates the impact that it would have a few years earlier.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven for the president of the United States, the interview that breaks through and reaches the whole country just doesn\u2019t happen unless something crazy happens,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Whittle, social media manager at Duolingo, discussed how her team responded to the TikTok ban resulting in a spike of popularity to the RedNote app, and users flocking to Duolingo to learn Mandarin as a result.\n\n\n\n\u201cUltimately, the strategy of Duolingo and the day-to-day content team is to be clued into the trends and react appropriately where inspired,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was kind of a moment where all the stars aligned.\u201d\n\n\n\nTikTok influencer Timm Chiusano said that one easy, and often overlooked, way for a brand to connect with users is through widely shared experiences, such as how they\u2019re feeling on a certain day and time every week.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne trend that never goes away is the date and time,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is in the same headspace on a Monday morning. Everyone is in the same headspace on a Friday afternoon.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson safety: How to mitigate personal threats and harassment\n\nWhen a spokesperson is the public face of an unpopular company decision, they can become a target for angry \u2013 and unhinged \u2013 people on the internet.\n\nUma Iyer, the National Women\u2019s Law Center\u2019s chief of external affairs, said some people have sent her messages telling her to \u201cgo kill herself.\u201d\n\nTo mitigate such threats, having good online security protocols is essential, the panelists advised. This includes making sure personal online profiles are locked down.\n\n\u201cAnywhere I put photos of my child is locked down,\u201d said REI\u2019s head of communications, community and inclusion Halley Knigge. \u201cI am careful about my spouse\u2019s profiles as well.\u201d\n\nIt is also wise to get close to the company\u2019s security team, noted panelist Lisa Kaplan, founder and CEO of Alethea.\n\n\u201cCompanies are best positioned to deal with these types of threats if there is already a plan in place,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nInternal PR experts explained how to look at workplace culture from a comms perspective, answering the following questions:\n\n\n\nWhat do each of you see as comms, this unique role and most important role in creating and or advancing a workplace culture?\n\n\n\nClarissa Beyah, chief communications officer at Union Pacific Corporation One, said, \u201cIt's codifying culture with who you are and what you want to be? And then it's amplifying culture through channels.\u201d\n\n\n\nGarrett Marquis, CCO and managing director for BNY, said, \u201cThere's been a transformation taking place, and I think a lot of companies can reflect on this, certainly over the last five years, from COVID to today, and where a lot of companies are going over the next couple of years. It actually comes first with defining the culture that we want, and it's a little bit of defining where we were.\u201d\n\nConservative activists have targeted the likes of Target, Ford, Harley-Davidson, Tractor Supply, Lowe\u2019s and John Deere to reexamine the way they approach social and cultural issues and engage all stakeholders, creating a conundrum for communications professionals.\n\nGwen Fisher, managing director of FisherTrent Communications, said companies must continue to communicate with all stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\u201cWorking in the biopharma and biotech industry, considering all stakeholders is really critically important,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're trying to get medicines to people so you have to consider your employees. If we're thinking about how to communicate, we actually think about it holistically, and how we're going to have to reach all of those stakeholders and how we communicate about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nPanelist Christina Maldonado, VP of investor relations at Teneo, agreed with Fisher.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsidering stakeholders on a holistic basis is extremely important,\u201d she said. \u201cShareholders are only one of the stakeholders of a company. You have to consider your customers, your suppliers, so on and so forth, depending on what industry you're in.\u201d\n\n\n\nChanning Martin, global chief diversity and social impact officer at Interpublic Group, explained some companies that have stepped back from initiatives did so from a reactive stance.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me take a step back, because I think what I've been seeing is a knee jerk reaction and a lot of chaos, trying to understand how to sift through the chaos,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think we're seeing a lot of companies that are responding out of fear.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Steel, SVP of communications at the Business Roundtable, explained how the nonprofit organization sees the issue.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's an interesting thing because we talk about it very differently than a lot of other people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeriodically, we've issued statements on the purpose of corporation, and the last one had been in 1997 very, very shareholder focused.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that in order to benefit shareholders in the long term, \u201cyou have to talk about investing in your employees, your customers and the communities in which you operate.\u201d",

            "content": "In a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the potential impact on Wall Street from President Trump\u2019s potential actions against Denmark, Panama, and South Africa. Amongst other actions, the President has vowed to make Denmark\u2019s Greenland territory a part of the US and threatened to cut funding to South Africa over allegations of land confiscations.\n\nCramer believes that the \u201cstreet sells\u201d in response to these actions. He stated \u201cThat\u2019s what happens. I\u2019m not in any hurry to buy anything. We just were at a high. We had some big turmoil in tech as it was. We got a lot of quarters this week.\u201d However, while the absolute near-term outlook might be uncertain, all sectors aren\u2019t bad. According to Cramer \u201cThe only stuff I would think about buying are the drugs, medical device. Because their business, for the most part, not made in China, not made in Mexico. So those are the ones.\u201d\n\nOne outcome that was clear from the November election campaigns was that President Trump differs significantly from President Biden when it comes to policy. However, he might continue one aspect of the previous administration. Cramer shared that when it comes to drug prices \u201cRemember, the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act], under Biden, they did lower the prices. I think that\u2019s something that President Trump would continue to do.\u201d He also believes that \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a canard, the drug companies charge a lot here.\u201d\n\nOne interesting discussion during the show surrounded hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones\u2018 comments about the general economic climate being \u201cprecarious.\u201d Cramer took issue with Jones\u2019 word choice. He started by outlining \u201cI want to point out that once again, we have billionaires on. And billionaires always say it\u2019s incredibly precarious.\u201d As a result, Cramer pointed out that \u201cPeople at home therefore sell and they miss great opportunities to buy because they hear that it\u2019s really precarious from someone who\u2019s a billionaire so therefore it is.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC TV host urged people to keep investing as \u201cyou can\u2019t make money listening to a billionaire because they already have made money.\u201d When asked whether his advice meant that he was encouraging stock buying at a time when markets were dipping he replied \u201cNo, look I\u2019m not saying to buy. I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s a very tough word, precarious makes it sound like that we are in a systemic moment. I save that for 2007, 2008 when we were precarious.\u201d\n\nComparing the President\u2019s current administration to the previous one he commented:\n\n\u201cI think that the president gave us last time some tax cuts ahead so you kind of felt that there was some good things happening. Here he comes up with this first which makes it feel like that you justify what he said on Friday when he said he didn\u2019t care about the markets. Ultimately, David, he does care about the markets. And I don\u2019t think he wants them down badly.\u201d\n\nCramer also speculated that if tariffs make Canadian oil more expensive then US producers could be incentivized to produce more. He doesn\u2019t \u201cThink they\u2019re going to produce much more because that\u2019s their whole . . .they\u2019ve all tried to keep their production down because they want prices up. That\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 3rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\n11. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 66\n\n\n\nThe Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) is a health insurance and pharmacy benefits manager. Its shares are down by 8.9% over the past twelve months mostly driven by souring sentiment in Congress surrounding healthcare managers. This group of firms has struggled as investors have wondered whether a breakup of large firms is in play, and due to President Trump vowing to take on the healthcare middleman. Cramer commented on The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)\u2019s shares gaining simply because it was an American firm amidst turmoil that sent other stocks falling:\n\n\u201cCigna up six bucks. Okay, go ahead, go ahead buy it up six. I wouldn\u2019t buy it up six if it was a great day. I mean, it\u2019s not a great day.\u201d\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 66\n\n\n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of the better-performing telecommunications stocks. Its shares are up by 46.9% over the past twelve months and have gained a strong 8.4% year-to-date. The recent performance of T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)\u2019s shares is driven by a strong fourth-quarter report which saw the firm maintain its trend of robust subscriber additions. In Q4, the firm added 903,000 postpaid subscribers which built upon the 865,000 additions in Q3. Here is what Cramer said about T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS):\n\n\u201cPeople want to just, they want to buy instantly. They can\u2019t even, T-Mobile. T-Mobile\u2019s great but do you have to like go pay up three? I mean, you know come on, it\u2019s a bad day. Live with it.\u201d\n\n9. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 69\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a restaurant chain known for its Mexican cuisine. Cramer has discussed the stock several times in his shows over the past couple of months. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\u2019s shares have gained 19.2% over the past twelve months as the firm has successfully executed its growth strategy. This strategy involves adding more restaurants to its portfolio, and the firm expects to open as many as 345 restaurants in 2025. During his show, Cramer commented on the impact of Mexican tariffs on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\u2019s business:\n\n\u201cTake Chipotle. Chipotle\u2019s only down a dollar. And I like Chipotle very very much, I think it\u2019s a great company. But they have avocados. And they have tomatoes. Now most of our, the plurality of our tomatoes come from Mexico. Almost all of our avocado comes from Mexico and they\u2019re trying to get it from every single province. So I could argue that, I would argue that that\u2019s stock\u2019s too high. Remember I really like it but it sells like 51 times earnings.\u201d\n\n8. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 70\n\n\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a healthcare and pharmaceutical firm that is one of Cramer\u2019s favorite stocks because of its schizophrenia medicine. The firm\u2019s Cobenfy drug for schizophrenia is the first of its kind in decades. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)\u2019s shares have gained 24% over the past year as they have benefited from other catalysts as well such as the FDA\u2019s approval of its cancer drug Opdivo. Cramer\u2019s comments, as expected, surrounded Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)\u2019s Cobenfy drug:\n\n\u201cI mean, look, my charitable trust owns Bristol-Myers, I think Bristol-Myers is [inaudible]. They\u2019ve got a new drug, uh Cobenfy. Yeah Cobenfy which is about schizophrenia, first new drug in thirty years.\u201d\n\n7. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 78\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a sizable railroad operator whose shares are flat over the past year. The firm has struggled because of a sluggish industrial economy which has reduced the demand for its services. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\u2019s shares did rise by 5% in January after the firm\u2019s fourth-quarter results led to a $2.96 profit per share which beat analyst estimates of $2.78. In his previous appearances, Cramer has speculated that Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) can benefit from a resurgence in the coal market under President Trump. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cYou know Carl not a lot of downgrades today. And I think that there should have been. I think that Loop Capital downgrading a lot of the transports, particularly the railroads, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, that made a ton of sense. TSX. Union Pacific brings a huge amount back and forth and back and forth. . . . So I don\u2019t think those are what you buy. And I just think that we are not being thoughtful. A lot of stocks are being downgraded today. Now I\u2019m as negative as say David Kostin from Goldman who\u2019s talking about a five percent decline. But I do think that there should have been more downgrades and because transport, commerce\u2019s going to slow. And the rails in particular because that\u2019s how we get a lot of stuff. Union Pacific\u2019s huge down there. KSU\u2019s huge. Those made sense.\u201d\n\n6. PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 78\n\nPDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is a new entrant in the Chinese eCommerce industry that rose to prominence locally due to high inflation reducing consumer purchasing power. The firm\u2019s business model enables users to buy in groups to grow their bargaining power and secure better prices. PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)\u2019s platforms are also making inroads into the West through their low-cost products which the firm is able to offer due to its relationships with Chinese merchants. However, quality control and delivery times have been problematic. Here is what Cramer said:\n\n\u201cYeah, Temu and Shein are losers here. . . . when you order from Temu, which I have ordered from, and Shein which I have ordered from, you don\u2019t know when [sic]you come. I mean I ordered some Temu for my wife, it came well after her birthday, I had to slip it into Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 99\n\n\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the world\u2019s largest pure-play electric vehicle manufacturer. While Cramer discusses the firm\u2019s CEO Elon Musk quite a lot on his show, his comments about the firm are rather limited. About Musk, he believes that the Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO is one of the smartest people in the world. Cramer is also a believer in Musk\u2019s claims of making humanoids the key driver of the firm\u2019s narrative in the future. The host is encouraged by NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell chips which come with key features to enable humanoid robots. Here are Cramer\u2019s latest remarks for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA):\n\n\u201c[On TSLA being down 5%] That\u2019s wrong. Yeah because that\u2019s a domestic. . . . \u201cI would buy Tesla before I would buy any of those others . . . GM, Ford, they don\u2019t even know they make [inaudible]\u201d\n\n4. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\n\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world\u2019s most valuable company \u2013 a title that it recently retook from NVIDIA after the DeepSeek selloff last week. The firm\u2019s latest quarterly results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates with the results powered by the solid performance of its personal computer and services business. Cramer is a long-time believer in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares, and defended the firm multiple times in January after social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg claimed that innovation had finished at the firm since its co-founder Steve Jobs\u2019 passing. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why I worry about the term precarious again is that why don\u2019t people own Apple here? Well they\u2019ve been told so many times that times are precarious that they\u2019ve sold it! They\u2019ve sold Amazon cause it\u2019s precarious. They\u2019ve sold Microsoft! And I\u2019m saying that in 2007 it was precarious. These other times we worked it through. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d\n\n3. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world\u2019s leading AI GPU company whose shares were dealt an unbelievable blow earlier this month. The stock bled 17% of its value during the DeepSeek selloff and is down by 14% year-to-date as investors re-calibrate their estimates about the amount of spending required to set up AI models. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a regular feature of Cramer\u2019s shows. Throughout this year, he has insisted that the firm is ushering in an industrial revolution and criticized sanctions levied against its products by the US government. Here are his latest remarks about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):\n\n\u201c[On Trevor Noah and NVIDIA] That sent chills through me because that meant that there isn\u2019t an area that doesn\u2019t own NVIDIA. And that kinda has to end before you can buy it. \u201cNVIDIA did everything they were told to do. And they have evidence that Singapore did not. . . they have actual evidence of where Singapore put their chips. But I think that this company has now been footballed so to speak. When I meet people, they own it. Now I\u2019m not trying to, I don\u2019t want people to lose money. But I think there is a cohort of people that doesn\u2019t know what NVIDIA does. That\u2019s worried about DeepSeek. I\u2019m not as worried. I do think that the CUDA platform they have is going to come out fine. And that the more GPTs there are, they are a winner. But they are in quiet period. And during quiet period people get very nervous and they sell. Imagine a lot of work on NVIDIA this weekend, then you watch the Grammy\u2019s, you say well look, jeez all my work was nullified by a guy who some people regard as a comedian who mentioned it. I don\u2019t want the broad notion, NVIDIA is a froth stock in a sense that everybody owns it that I talk to. But it\u2019s a great company. And I think ultimately it will be a winner but it has to be a loser first before it\u2019s a winner. \u201c[on a 24% drawdown] That may not be enough, no, it may not be enough because you really have to shake out people. I mean that\u2019s what happens. When you have a really great company that everybody is in and you don\u2019t have a lot of people know what it is, that is a recipe for even further selloff. And then, buy. Because it\u2019s going to win because nobody\u2019s close to them. Nobody. \u201cBut remember, they\u2019re moving past the 200 and the new one Blackwell. . .there\u2019s going to be a lot of different companies that have a better than DeepSeek. I think that Google\u2019s better than DeepSeek.\u201d\n\n2. Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235\n\n\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is the most valuable social media company in the world. The firm has been in the news for several reasons in 2025. It made headlines after announcing a decision to scrap fact-checking on Facebook and replace it with a community notes platform similar to X. Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) CEO\u2019s appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast also drew Cramer\u2019s attention, and so did Zuckerberg announcing $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 to build a data center the size of Manhattan. Overall, Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s performance depends on its ability to monetize AI and retain advertiser spending on its platforms. Cramer is a fan of the stock:\n\n\u201cMeta was down sixteen points this morning. Someone was selling it. Now normally I would have called that guy a chowderhead. I\u2019m just saying was ill informed. That was just really an incredibly poor sale because it didn\u2019t make any sense at all. They didn\u2019t have exposure. And yet the person sold it down sixteen. I don\u2019t understand that. Why sell it down sixteen? What was he thinking? Or she thinking? \u201cI don\u2019t want to buy anything up, today, but I think that down sixteen was someone who just panicked. And you never make any money panicking. And that person is saying, wow, I hope no one knows that I did this because I feel really stupid. . .that person was very ill informed and I don\u2019t get that.\u201d\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 286\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the largest eCommerce retailer in the US. Its presence in the lucrative cloud computing industry via the AWS platform has also allowed the firm to develop a dual moat with high volume and high margin businesses. After the DeepSeek selloff, Cramer shared that some quarters believed that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) could benefit as AI training costs dropped. To wit, the stock did gain 1% during the selloff while others bled billions of dollars in market value. Here are Cramer\u2019s latest remarks for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n\u201cAnd Amazon\u2019s a winner because Jassy has said, the CEO, has said over and over again that he doesn\u2019t make any money off of those two other than being able to sell them where you actually get a [inaudible]. And that\u2019s what his advantage is that when you order from Temu, which I have ordered from, and Shein which I have ordered from, you don\u2019t know when you come. I mean I ordered some Temu for my wife, it came well after her birthday, I had to slip it into Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\nAMZN is a stock Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure.

            "content": "Union Pacific Corporation is a leading transportation and logistics company based in Omaha, Nebraska. Founded in 1862, the company has a rich history of serving customers across North America with safe, reliable and efficient rail transportation solutions. Union Pacific operates in two business segments: Railroad and Premium Operations.\n\nThe Railroad segment comprises the company's core operations, including freight transportation and logistics services. The Premium Operations segment includes Union Pacific's subsidiary, Union Pacific Distribution Services, which provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries.\n\nWith over 32,000 miles of rail network across 23 states, Union Pacific connects major markets and communities across North America. The company is committed to sustainability and has set ambitious goals to reduce emissions and increase the use of alternative fuels.\n\nUnion Pacific has consistently performed in the transportation and logistics industry, delivering strong financial results over the past few years. It is also important to mention that Union Pacific's debt levels have been relatively stable over the past few years. For several years, the company has maintained a healthy cash position between 1 - 3 billion dollars.\n\nUnion Pacific operates in the transportation and logistics industry, which is highly competitive and regulated. The industry has seen significant changes in recent years, including the growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.\n\nUnion Pacific faces competition from other railroads, trucking companies and intermodal transportation providers. The company also competes with alternative modes of transportation, such as air and sea freight. Regulatory and political issues, such as changes in trade policies and environmental regulations, can impact the industry and create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nDespite these challenges, Union Pacific has maintained its market position and continues to invest in technology and innovation to improve its services and meet the evolving needs of its customers.\n\nUnion Pacific's leadership team is led by Lance Fritz, who has been the company's Chairman, President and CEO since 2015. Fritz joined Union Pacific in 2000 and has held several leadership roles. The management team also includes other experienced executives who bring diverse skills and expertise to the company.\n\nUnion Pacific has several growth opportunities in the transportation and logistics industry. The company has invested in technology and innovation to improve its services and increase efficiency. For example, Union Pacific has implemented Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), a new operating model that has enhanced train speeds and reduced costs.\n\nThe company also has opportunities for growth in new markets and industries. Union Pacific's subsidiary, UPDS, provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries, including automotive, chemicals and agriculture. The company could expand its services into other sectors and markets to drive growth.\n\nUnion Pacific faces several risks and challenges in the transportation and logistics industry. Changes in consumer preferences and competitive pressures can impact the company's revenue and profitability. The shift towards e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions could also create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nUnion Pacific also faces risks related to its operations and infrastructure. The company's rail network is subject to weather and natural disasters, which can disrupt operations and impact the company's financial performance. Union Pacific also faces cybersecurity and data privacy risks, which could impact the company's operations and reputation.",

            "content": "The U.S. stock market was rocked Monday after President Donald Trump kicked off a possible global trade war. Shares of companies spanning the auto, industrial, retail and beverage industries with international supply chains were hit particularly hard.\n\nTrump on Saturday slapped a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, while adding a 10% levy on imports from China. The president said Monday that he's pausing the Mexico tariffs for one month after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to immediately send 10,000 soldiers to her country's border to prevent drug trafficking. Trump also ramped up his tariff threats to the European Union.\n\nWatch NBC 5 free wherever you are WATCH HERE WATCH HERE\n\nTariffs could not only increase the cost of transporting goods across borders, they could also disrupt supply chains and crimp business confidence. Goldman Sachs warned that Trump's latest action could cause a 5% sell-off in U.S. stocks due to the hit to corporate earnings. Here are some of the most affected industries and stocks:\n\nAutomakers\n\nGet top local stories in DFW delivered to you every morning with NBC DFW's News Headlines newsletter. SIGN UP SIGN UP\n\nThese tariffs could have a material impact on the global automotive industry, which has a heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America.\n\nDetroit's big three car makers \u2014 General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis \u2014 could feel the pain from disrupted supply chains as a result of tariffs and may be forced to shift production from foreign factories to the United States.\n\nFood and beverage\n\nConstellation Brands, a large importer of alcohol from Mexico, is leading a sell-off among booze stocks.\n\nCanada has threatened to pull American alcohol from its government-run liquor shelves in response to Trump's 25% tariffs.\n\nRestaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill and avocado company Calavo Growers could feel the pain from more costly supplies, as these companies import avocados from Mexico.\n\nRetailers\n\nSportswear brands Nike and Lululemon could be vulnerable to Trump's tariffs because of their heavy reliance on Chinese imports, including fabrics. Their sizable business in China could also be hurt by the negative sentiment from the trade war.\n\nDiscount retailers such as Five Below could be among the hardest hit businesses, as imports from China usually make up a significant portion of their sales. Dollar General shares initially sold off on tariff news but finished Monday in the green. Dollar General put its direct import percentage at 4% in 2023. Another victim could be Canada Goose, a Canada-based luxury outerwear firm.\n\nRailroads\n\nTariffs could be damaging to railroad operators, as heavy duties could slow the flow of goods being transported to the U.S., hurting their revenue and profits.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation moves freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada and Mexico. Norfolk Southern and Canadian Pacific Kansas City are also exposed to the tariffs.\n\nChinese e-commerce\n\nTrump's tariffs also targeted a trade provision that helped fuel the explosive growth of budget online retailers, including Temu. The orders against China, Canada and Mexico all halt a trade exemption, known as \"de minimis,\" which allows exporters to ship packages worth less than $800 into the U.S. duty-free.\n\nPDD Holdings-owned Temu and Alibaba's AliExpress may no longer be able to take advantage of the loophole to sell cheap apparel, household items and electronics.\n\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify that Dollar General put its direct import percentage at 4% in 2023.",

            "content": "Recent statements by President Donald Trump regarding potential changes in the status of the Panama Canal have raised concerns about possible impacts on various stocks and exchange-traded funds. After all, some 4% of global trade passes through the canal, with more than 70% of that traffic bound for or coming from the U.S., according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhat Happened: On Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panama\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Washington will \u201ctake measures necessary\u201d if Panama does not immediately take steps to put an end to what Trump considers China\u2019s influence and control over the Panama Canal.\n\nFollowing the talks with Rubio, who is on a tour of Central America, Mulino signaled he would review agreements involving China and Chinese businesses. Since Trump took office, he has reiterated his threat to forcibly retake the Panama Canal, which generates some $2.5 billion in annual revenue for Panama.\n\nAs a critical conduit for international maritime trade, any changes to its operations could naturally affect companies involved in shipping, logistics and transportation.\n\nWhich Companies Might Be Affected? Quite A Few\n\nLet's start with the shipping-owning company SFL Corporation Ltd. SFL, which is engaged in the ownership and operation of vessels and offshore-related assets. There are two others that could see changes: Costamare Inc. CMRE, which owns and charters container ships, and Navios Maritime Holdings NMPGY, an international owner and operator of dry cargo vessels.\n\nNext, we have the railway companies that provide freight services across the U.S. These include CSX Corp CSX, Norfolk Southern Corp NSC, Union Pacific Corp UNP, Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd CP and the Canadian National Railway Co CNI.\n\nNow let's look at the ETFs that focus on all of the above \u2014 shipping, air freight and the courier industries.\n\nU.S. Global Sea to Sky Cargo SEA, Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping BDRY provides exposure to the daily change in the price of dry bulk freight futures and SPRD S&P Transportation ETF XTN, which represents the transportation segment of the S&P Total Market Index (\"S&P TMI\") designed to track the broad U.S. equity market.\n\nRead Also:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

Each year, JUST Capital begins by polling the American public on a fully representative basis on their priorities for business behavior. It then evaluates how the largest corporations in the country perform against those criteria. Leading companies are recognized for their performance on top priority issues such as: paying fair, living wages; supporting worker well-being; career advancement, training, and work-life balance; treating customers fairly; creating value for shareholders; communicating transparently; strengthening communities; and ethical leadership.\n\nThe Top 10 Most JUST Companies of 2025 are:\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (second year at #1) HP Inc. Bank of America Corporation Union Pacific Corp Accenture plc Trane Technologies Eversource Energy The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Citigroup Inc. The Cigna Group\n\n\"It is an honor for HPE to be recognized by JUST Capital as #1 on the JUST 100 for the second consecutive year,\" says HPE President and CEO Antonio Neri. \"The recognition is a testament to HPE's commitment to responsible business, including prioritizing the long-term development and well-being of our team members, delivering ethical and sustainable innovation, and applying our technology to solve societal problems at a global and local level.\"\n\nThe Public's Priorities Power The Rankings\n\nIn a year marked by significant geopolitical, cultural, and economic change, business leaders are under pressure with high performance expectations and intense scrutiny. The central message from the public, as detailed in JUST Capital's Americans Views on Business Report and Polling released in 2024, is clear: focus on the basics, do right by your customers, look after your workers, create value for your shareholders, and lead with integrity.\n\nDespite being highly polarized on political issues, Americans are generally united in their expectations for corporations - particularly in areas where positive corporate conduct dovetails with positive business performance - and concerned about kitchen table issues like their economic well-being, how they are treated as consumers, and being able to support their families. Many appear to be distrustful of institutions as they call for increased transparency, corporate accountability, and ethical leadership.\n\nThe JUST Capital 2025 Rankings of America's Most JUST Companies and JUST 100 list celebrate top-performing Russell 1000 companies that are demonstrating leadership in meeting these concerns and responding to the needs of the American people. By tapping into public sentiment, these Rankings offer corporate leaders an objective, empirical roadmap across stakeholder issues that helps businesses navigate a changing socio-political and economic landscape in order to unlock enduring business value.\n\nJUST Business Is Better Business\n\nThis promise of value creation is not mere conjecture. As of December 31, 2024 the JULCD (212.2%) - which tracks the top 50% of Russell 1000 companies ranked by JUST Capital by industry, and is constructed to match its industry weights - has out-performed Russell 1000 Cap-Weighted Benchmark (202.04%) by 10.11% since inception. The JUST 100 (116.7%) - which includes the top 100 Russell 1000 companies ranked by JUST Capital - has out-performed Russell 1000 Equally Weighted Benchmark (70.8%) by 45.8% since inception.\n\n\"JUST Capital Rankings stand apart because they measure companies against what matters most: the priorities set by the American public,\" says JUST Capital CEO Martin Whittaker. \"When companies - like those featured in this year's Rankings - actively deliver on stakeholder expectations, namely those of American workers, consumers, and shareholders, they create enduring business value while advancing solutions to our nation's most pressing economic challenges. It's a powerful win-win.\"\n\nIntroducing: JUST Intelligence\n\nToday's corporate leadership demands data-driven insights that align with stakeholder interests and drive lasting value. JUST Capital is excited to introduce JUST Intelligence - a cutting-edge analytics tool that empowers companies to navigate complex stakeholder issues and fuels their competitive advantage.\n\nThis year, all ranked companies will have access to standard JUST Intelligence features including an interactive explorer of their performance in the 2025 Rankings and highlights of their highest and lowest performing data points. JUST Intelligence subscribers can dive deeper on critical data points, benchmark against peers, and identify best practices of top-performing companies.\n\n\"In a rapidly evolving and high-pressure landscape, today's corporate leaders need a strategic insider to support their competitive edge. JUST Intelligence is that strategic insider,\" says Whittaker. \"We are extremely proud to bring empirical evidence to corporate leaders that allows them to cut through the noise, benchmark their performance, make smarter decisions, and ultimately be more successful in the marketplace.\"\n\nAbout JUST Capital\n\nThe mission of JUST Capital, an independent nonprofit, is to demonstrate how just business - defined by the priorities of the public - is better business. Our goal is to help companies create value for all their stakeholders - their workers, customers, communities, the environment, and shareholders - by focusing on the issues that matter most to Americans. To date, we've polled more than 182,000 Americans on the issues they believe companies should prioritize when it comes to just business behavior, and those insights guide our work. We believe that business and markets can and must be a force for the greater good and that by shifting the resources of the $21.6 trillion private sector, we can drive competition to build a better future for all. Our research, rankings, indexes, initiatives, and new offerings like the JUST Jobs Scorecard help track, analyze, incentivize, and scale corporate stakeholder performance.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDuring a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it\u2019s crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends.\n\nDividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth.\n\nAlso read: 8 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Invest in\n\nAccording to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future.\n\nThe main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment.\n\nSince then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters.\n\nInvestors and analysts both support companies that have raised their payouts. Companies that consistently raise their dividends typically manage economic downturns better because they have strong business models, solid balance sheets, and promising earnings potential. These qualities make them attractive to investors, and historical data shows that the market tends to reward them. Stocks of companies that increase dividends often outperform the broader market while experiencing lower volatility. According to a report by AGF Investments, the companies in the broader market that grew their dividend between January 1990 and August 2024 grew by 12.1%, compared with an 11% return of companies that pay no dividends and a 10.8% return of dividend cutters. With market conditions improving, it\u2019s not surprising that an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this article, we first scanned a list of stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is an American transport company, based in Nebraska. In its recently announced Q4 2024 earnings, the company posted revenue of $6.12 billion, which fell by 1% from the same period last year. However, the company experienced a 5% increase in revenue carloads, contributing to a stronger financial performance. Its operating ratio improved to 58.7%, reflecting a 220-basis-point enhancement, despite a 70-basis-point setback from the ratification of a crew staffing agreement. In addition, operating income rose by 5%, reaching $2.5 billion.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) runs an extensive railroad network across 23 states and is actively expanding its mainline and terminal capacities by constructing new sidings and extending existing ones. These initiatives are particularly important in high-growth areas such as the Pacific Northwest, where enhancements are being made to support increased exports of soda ash and grain. In the Southwest, efforts are focused on strengthening intermodal services. In addition, the company is incorporating advanced technologies, including GPS tracking for containers and rail pulse systems, to enhance service reliability, offer real-time tracking, and improve communication with customers.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\u2019s cash position also came in strong. In FY24, the company generated over $9.3 billion in operating cash flow. It ended the quarter with over $1 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. This strong cash position has enabled the company to pay regular dividends to shareholders for 125 years in a row. In addition, it has raised its payouts for 18 consecutive years, which makes UNP one of the most promising stocks that pay dividends. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $1.34 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.16%, as of January 30.\n\nAs of the end of Q3 2024, 78 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), compared with 82 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4.48 billion.\n\nOverall UNP ranks 9th on our list of the most promising dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Union Pacific Corporation is a leading transportation and logistics company based in Omaha, Nebraska. Founded in 1862, the company has a rich history of serving customers across North America with safe, reliable and efficient rail transportation solutions. Union Pacific operates in two business segments: Railroad and Premium Operations.\n\nThe Railroad segment comprises the company's core operations, including freight transportation and logistics services. The Premium Operations segment includes Union Pacific's subsidiary, Union Pacific Distribution Services, which provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries.\n\nWith over 32,000 miles of rail network across 23 states, Union Pacific connects major markets and communities across North America. The company is committed to sustainability and has set ambitious goals to reduce emissions and increase the use of alternative fuels.\n\nUnion Pacific has consistently performed in the transportation and logistics industry, delivering strong financial results over the past few years. It is also important to mention that Union Pacific's debt levels have been relatively stable over the past few years. For several years, the company has maintained a healthy cash position between 1 - 3 billion dollars.\n\nUnion Pacific operates in the transportation and logistics industry, which is highly competitive and regulated. The industry has seen significant changes in recent years, including the growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.\n\nUnion Pacific faces competition from other railroads, trucking companies and intermodal transportation providers. The company also competes with alternative modes of transportation, such as air and sea freight. Regulatory and political issues, such as changes in trade policies and environmental regulations, can impact the industry and create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nDespite these challenges, Union Pacific has maintained its market position and continues to invest in technology and innovation to improve its services and meet the evolving needs of its customers.\n\nUnion Pacific's leadership team is led by Lance Fritz, who has been the company's Chairman, President and CEO since 2015. Fritz joined Union Pacific in 2000 and has held several leadership roles. The management team also includes other experienced executives who bring diverse skills and expertise to the company.\n\nUnion Pacific has several growth opportunities in the transportation and logistics industry. The company has invested in technology and innovation to improve its services and increase efficiency. For example, Union Pacific has implemented Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), a new operating model that has enhanced train speeds and reduced costs.\n\nThe company also has opportunities for growth in new markets and industries. Union Pacific's subsidiary, UPDS, provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries, including automotive, chemicals and agriculture. The company could expand its services into other sectors and markets to drive growth.\n\nUnion Pacific faces several risks and challenges in the transportation and logistics industry. Changes in consumer preferences and competitive pressures can impact the company's revenue and profitability. The shift towards e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions could also create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nUnion Pacific also faces risks related to its operations and infrastructure. The company's rail network is subject to weather and natural disasters, which can disrupt operations and impact the company's financial performance. Union Pacific also faces cybersecurity and data privacy risks, which could impact the company's operations and reputation.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other safe stocks to buy for the long term in 2025.\n\nThe US stock market is often regarded as one of the most reliable and resilient financial markets in the world. With its deep liquidity, broad participation, and historical ability to recover from downturns, it has long been a cornerstone of wealth creation for individual and institutional investors. While it is subject to short-term volatility, its long-term performance and structural advantages make it a reliable platform for investment. It has a proven track record of delivering strong returns over the long term. The S&P 500, a benchmark index that represents the performance of 500 large-cap US companies, has averaged an annual return of approximately 10% since its inception in 1926. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the market\u2019s historical trajectory has been one of growth, driven by corporate innovation, economic expansion, and rising consumer demand.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nDuring major crises such as the Great Depression, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the market experienced sharp declines but eventually rebounded to new highs. For example, after the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the S&P 500 recovered within six months and went on to hit record levels, underscoring its resilience. One of the key factors contributing to the reliability of the US stock market is its breadth and diversity. The market includes a wide array of industries, from technology and health care to consumer goods and energy, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios to reduce risk. Additionally, US exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are among the most liquid in the world, making it easy for investors to buy and sell shares efficiently. This liquidity and diversification provide a level of stability that is unmatched in many other markets, offering investors confidence in the market\u2019s ability to withstand shocks and recover from volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 Stocks, AI Power Demand & Healthcare. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn his recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the S&P\u2019s best eight-session rally since August. As most stock market gains by then had been due to mega-cap stocks, Cramer shared that \u201cI do like to see that this is a rally that\u2019s not led by\u201d either Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock that tumbled by 15% on Monday or by the firm responsible for designing the iPhone.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Cramer was happy that stocks were instead being led higher by sectors that had underperformed lately. One of these is healthcare, and the CNBC host shared his excitement by sharing \u201cOr how about the drugs? How about the drugs!\u201d He added \u201cI mean last week I was at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. And no one liked the drugs! They exploded yesterday!\u201d\n\nYet, even though the \u2018drugs were exploding,\u2019 Cramer also mentioned other sectors that were having bull markets. According to him \u201cSo what I\u2019m saying is that, many bull markets each day. Banks had a bull market. Drugs had a bull market. Rails had a bull market. I think I love it! . . .This is what I want! Not broad on one day, but broad over time.\u201d\n\nAs to the reason behind his optimism, Cramer outlined \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be the same old, same old!\u201d He was irate over market and media sentiment indicating that multiples of the Magnificent 7 stocks were overstretched. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared \u201cLike yesterday there was a piece in the FT, I like the FT. But they were talking about how you know, now things are really stretched.\u201d He believes that the argument that the multiples are overstretched doesn\u2019t explain the S&P\u2019s rally as \u201cIt\u2019s not a Mag 7 rally for heaven\u2019s sake. It\u2019s not!\u201d\n\nCramer added, \u201cWell I just think this is one of those markets where when you have a good quarter, bingo.\u201d When co-host David Faber asked him why he believed that non-tech sectors were driving the market since technology stocks had done well until that point, Cramer replied and stated \u201cI\u2019m saying, this particular jaunt is not led by the usual suspects. I said all that stuff.\u201d He added \u201cBut what I\u2019m saying is that there are other stocks besides tech. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. And that yesterday was about healthcare. It was about healthcare and it hasn\u2019t been about healthcare for a long time. The healthcare stocks, the HMOs were terrific.\u201d\n\nAnother topic that he\u2019s recently discussed is European stocks. When Cramer was asked why it\u2019s not easy to find top-tier growth in Europe, he shared that \u201cIt is[n\u2019t]. And yet, Europe is much discussed as being doing well because the rates are so low in Germany.\u201d\n\nCramer also commented on the high power demand from AI data centers and how it\u2019s affecting natural gas stocks. He believes \u201cWe have to spend, so much time on power, because we are beginning to get, what I\u2019d be doing with these natural gas companies, they\u2019re being green-lit, and they\u2019re not being talked about, and they\u2019re starting to realize, why is everything being nuclear?\u201d The reason behind some folks doubting nuclear power, according to Cramer, is \u201cBecause nuclear is seven to eight years. Okay, seven to eight years.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 24th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 78\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is one of the largest railroad operators in America. Since it primarily transports industrial raw materials and bulk goods all over the US, the stock is dependent on economic activity. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\u2019s shares jumped by 5% in January after its Q4 results revealed a $2.96 profit per share that beat analyst estimates of $2.78. Following the report, Cramer was full of praise for the company. He commented that Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\u2019s operating ratio was \u201csuperb\u201d and added that not only can it benefit from stronger pricing but also from a potential boom in coal demand in America. This time around, he compared Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) with another railroad firm, CSX:\n\n\u201cBut, you\u2019ll see these beautiful one-off moves. Union Pacific great quarter versus CSX.\u201d\n\nOverall UNP ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Despite this dip in revenue, the company surprised analysts with a GAAP profit of $3.23 per share, surpassing consensus estimates by 8.4%.\n\nPerformance Metrics: An Overview\n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation has consistently demonstrated strong profitability over the last five years, with an impressive average operating margin of 33.1%. The recent quarter saw this figure jump to 37.4%, signifying improved efficiency in handling expenses. This enhanced performance is reflected in Norfolk Southern's better-than-expected earnings per share (EPS), which climbed from $2.33 in the prior year to $3.23.\n\nFuture Projections and Market Context\n\nSell-side analysts anticipate a 3.4% growth in Norfolk Southern Corporation's revenue over the next 12 months. This projected growth might be buoyed by new product lines and services, although it remains below the sector's average expectations. The railroad industry, including Norfolk Southern, faces the ongoing challenge of balancing economic cycles and operational costs like fuel, as noted by the insights sourced from the IndexBox platform.\n\nShareholder Insights and Market Reaction\n\nAlthough Norfolk Southern saw a two-year annual EPS decline of 8.7%, it managed to exceed current analyst expectations. The company's concerted efforts in share buybacks over the last five years, amounting to a 13.3% reduction in share count, have been beneficial for shareholders. Nevertheless, the stock held steady at $251.50 immediately following the earnings announcement, indicating a cautious market reaction to the mixed results.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "In this piece, we will look at the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the S&P\u2019s best eight-session rally since August. As most stock market gains by then had been due to mega-cap stocks, Cramer shared that \u201cI do like to see that this is a rally that\u2019s not led by\u201d either Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock that tumbled by 15% on Monday or by the firm responsible for designing the iPhone.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Cramer was happy that stocks were instead being led higher by sectors that had underperformed lately. One of these is healthcare, and the CNBC host shared his excitement by sharing \u201cOr how about the drugs? How about the drugs!\u201d He added \u201cI mean last week I was at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. And no one liked the drugs! They exploded yesterday!\u201d\n\nYet, even though the \u2018drugs were exploding,\u2019 Cramer also mentioned other sectors that were having bull markets. According to him \u201cSo what I\u2019m saying is that, many bull markets each day. Banks had a bull market. Drugs had a bull market. Rails had a bull market. I think I love it! . . .This is what I want! Not broad on one day, but broad over time.\u201d\n\nAs to the reason behind his optimism, Cramer outlined \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be the same old, same old!\u201d He was irate over market and media sentiment indicating that multiples of the Magnificent 7 stocks were overstretched. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared \u201cLike yesterday there was a piece in the FT, I like the FT. But they were talking about how you know, now things are really stretched.\u201d He believes that the argument that the multiples are overstretched doesn\u2019t explain the S&P\u2019s rally as \u201cIt\u2019s not a Mag 7 rally for heaven\u2019s sake. It\u2019s not!\u201d\n\nCramer added, \u201cWell I just think this is one of those markets where when you have a good quarter, bingo.\u201d When co-host David Faber asked him why he believed that non-tech sectors were driving the market since technology stocks had done well until that point, Cramer replied and stated \u201cI\u2019m saying, this particular jaunt is not led by the usual suspects. I said all that stuff.\u201d He added \u201cBut what I\u2019m saying is that there are other stocks besides tech. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. And that yesterday was about healthcare. It was about healthcare and it hasn\u2019t been about healthcare for a long time. The healthcare stocks, the HMOs were terrific.\u201d\n\nAnother topic that he\u2019s recently discussed is European stocks. When Cramer was asked why it\u2019s not easy to find top-tier growth in Europe, he shared that \u201cIt is[n\u2019t]. And yet, Europe is much discussed as being doing well because the rates are so low in Germany.\u201d\n\nCramer also commented on the high power demand from AI data centers and how it\u2019s affecting natural gas stocks. He believes \u201cWe have to spend, so much time on power, because we are beginning to get, what I\u2019d be doing with these natural gas companies, they\u2019re being green-lit, and they\u2019re not being talked about, and they\u2019re starting to realize, why is everything being nuclear?\u201d The reason behind some folks doubting nuclear power, according to Cramer, is \u201cBecause nuclear is seven to eight years. Okay, seven to eight years.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 24th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\n10. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 31\n\n\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a semiconductor company that sells power management, signal processing, and other products to smartphones, auto, and other industries. Its shares are down by 15.4% over the past year as the firm has struggled to maintain revenue growth due to a slowdown in both of its targeted industries. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)\u2019s stock slumped by 18% in July and the first week of August after the firm\u2019s profit dropped despite meeting analyst estimates. Cramer appreciated Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)\u2019s management for being honest about its troubles:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you went to Liam Griffin, at Skyworks Solutions, he says listen, I can\u2019t outrun cellphones. Not everybody sells into a data center! Not everyone sells into data center, and everybody seems to want nothing but. . . .\u201d\n\n9. Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 52\n\n\n\nTwilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) is a software company that provides products to businesses to enable them to communicate and stay in touch with their customers. While big tech roils in the aftermath of investor worries about China\u2019s DeepSeek AI startup\u2019s low model costs, Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) is one of the best-performing stocks year to date. Its shares are up by 27% so far this year primarily on the back of an optimistic margin guidance that predicted that margins will touch at least 21% in 2027. Margins are key for SaaS stocks such as Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO), and here\u2019s what Cramer said:\n\n\u201c[on TWLO saying they\u2019ll meet the top end of their guidance] Yeah the customer relationship management product is really fabulous. They have expanded, they\u2019ve done a great job. It\u2019s a great product. Great product.\u201d\n\n8. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 57\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in America. Its shares have lost 3.5% over the past year as a slow phone upgrade cycle due to inflation-constrained consumer spending and slow wireless equipment sales have led to the firm missing several quarterly earnings estimates. However, the tale turned in January when Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\u2019s shares jumped by 2.8% after the firm added 568,000 wireless subscribers in Q4 to beat analyst estimates of 487,500 and mark the highest quarterly growth in five years. Cramer, however, believes that the results were insufficient to drive the shares higher:\n\n\u201c[Commenting on Verizon stock jumping after earnings] On that number!\u201d\n\n7. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 57\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the oldest chip manufacturing companies in America. Its shares are up by 12.6% over the past year as the firm\u2019s broad product portfolio that enables data center connectivity has helped it navigate the downturn in the industrial sector. As of H1 2024, 76% of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\u2019s revenue came from industrial businesses. Consequently, the firm\u2019s shares fell by 3.4% in January after its Q1 midpoint EPS guidance of $1.05 missed analyst estimates of $1.17. Cramer believes that Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\u2019s exposure to industrial companies means that it should be viewed as an industrial stock:\n\n\u201cRight. People keep wanting Texas Instruments to be something other than it is. It\u2019s an industrial company. Very good. 20% of business is in China by the way. Love the China. And uh why people think they can divorce themselves from the end market, particularly auto and industrial, crazy. You\u2019re gonna have Joe Hinricks on, the CEO of CSX. You know he said, what\u2019s weak? Automotives, uh, interest rate sensitive things, housing. Texas Instruments is an industrial company. And it trades like one. And these analysts keep thinking it\u2019s going to trade like the Texas Instruments of 1982, 84. They ought to get the program. I think that Texas Instruments is very forthcoming. They used to be less forthcoming. But they\u2019re basically saying, look, our markets aren\u2019t that good. And they can\u2019t outrun their own markets. \u201cI love the fact that they\u2019re straight forward. That they\u2019re not doing well in embedded, they\u2019re saying, listen, we\u2019re missing, we\u2019re missing, we\u2019re missing. People are missing. Enough already.\u201d\n\n6. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 61\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is one of the few companies in the world that has successfully made a splash with its weight loss drugs. Most of Cramer\u2019s recent remarks for the firm have analyzed its product strength with respect to American weight loss drug giant Eli Lilly. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\u2019s stock slipped by 17.8% in December after its weight loss drug trial missed investor expectations. They shed an additional 5.3% in January after its weight loss treatments were selected for Medicare price negotiations. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO):\n\n\u201c[On the results of Novo\u2019s latest drug trial] Okay, one and a half, it\u2019s early. Remember it\u2019s a one half trial. Now, you cane make these, you can finagle Lilly versus Novo. It\u2019s hard, very hard to do actual comparisons because some are by forty eight weeks, some are shorter weeks. Some are bigger. . . what really matters? Boom, Eli Lilly\u2019s scripts are way up. And if you\u2019re looking at the fourth quarter, remember fourth quarter was a disappointment. David Ricks came on Mad Money, he came on our show. What did he say? He said we botched the launch. This is the beginning. Wolfe puts out the scripts, the numbers for Lilly were really good. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been waiting for. We can do this head to head of the phase one, the half. Forget that. Novo\u2019s down so much, anything they put out . . .and this thing causes, you know it like makes you feel better. It wouldn\u2019t matter. What matters is that Mounjaro and Zepbound weekly scripts are finally, finally doing good. And they have been not good. . . .\u201d \u201cLilly versus Novo this morning. Not one. Looked at every single data test that there is. Not one.\u201d\n\n5. Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 62\n\nCheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) is an American energy company that operates primarily in the midstream portion of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply chain. Its shares are up by 35% over the past year as the firm benefited from higher Asian LNG prices and an 11.6% share price surge after the November Presidential Election. Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG)\u2019s shares are up by 1.80% year-to-date as well due to rising LNG demand in America which surged to a record 15.2 billion cubic feet per day as 2024 ended. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG):\n\n\u201cCheniere\u2019s been an unbelievable story. I remember when Cheniere was at two bucks. I mean cause what happened is this that we ended up having reverse all the pipes when Cheniere started natural gas we were importing. Then it turned to an export. Look they\u2019re not making, they have revenue, revenue downstream. \u201cWell if you wanna play on what the President is saying about how we can weaponize it, weaponize the natural gas, this is it.\u201d\n\n4. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 62\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the most well-known financial services firms in America. The firm is one of the earliest movers in the payment card industry. Its shares are up by 57% over the past year as American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) managed to beat multiple quarterly estimates in 2024 either through higher spending on its platforms or through financial discipline. In 2025, its shares are up by 5.7% after having dropped by 3.2% since its Q4 earnings report. The results saw American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) guide 2025 revenue growth at a 9% midpoint which appeared to be a tepid beat over analysts\u2019 8.1% estimate. Cramer, however, gushed about the stock:\n\n\u201cWhat I think that\u2019s most impressive about Amex, and I think that would really perplex Jay Powell, this spend is insane in this country. The amount of people traveling. The bump up to first class, from commercial, from the, you know what second class we\u2019ll call it, David. Uh, the amount of people just, the frequency at which people are having a dinner out. I don\u2019t know what to say, there\u2019s a burst of optimism that is being translated into spend. And particularly for younger people that I\u2019m just flabbergasted about. It just can\u2019t stop! \u201c[on whether the high spending was leading to the stock\u2019s strong performance] Well I think that this is the last poor quarter, and I talked to Steve Squeri, this keeps happening. The stock goes up huge ahead. I mean there\u2019s one of the greatest charts of all time. And then people say oh it wasn\u2019t, you know eight to ten, it gave to eight to ten, so it didn\u2019t blow things away. I mean this guy is delivering a level of consistency that is so much better than everybody else. You could take all those fintech stories and this is just the best one. . . . .But American Express, no flies, good quarter, Steve Squeri doing a terrific job, at one point the stock was down twelve. I don\u2019t know who does this, uh ahead of the quarter, but when I speak to them I just think, just wow and their customers love it.\u201d\n\n3. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 63\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a healthcare giant that ended 2024 on a tepid note. Its shares gained a modest 3.8% during the year as the firm battled the fallout from its infant formula lawsuit through mostly strong earnings reports because of its medical devices business. Like other mega American healthcare companies, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is facing tightness in China. However, in his previous remarks, Cramer has been optimistic about the firm\u2019s diabetes portfolio which includes glucose monitoring devices. The optimism was warranted as Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\u2019s shares have gained 10% since its Q4 earnings came with a midpoint 2025 profit per share guidance of $5.15 which was in line with estimates. Cramer was surprised about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\u2019s share surge:\n\n\u201cAbbot Labs was the market leader yesterday. That\u2019s new. That\u2019s new.\u201d\n\n2. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 67\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is an American consumer and commercial bank headquartered in McLean, Virginia. Like other bank stocks, the shares have been on a tear since the November US Presidential Election. Since the election, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)\u2019s shares have gained 25%. The stock has been helped by the fact that consumer spending has remained robust in America to allow it to earn income through interest via credit card debt. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has sizable exposure to credit card spending, and according to Cramer, its merger with Discover can further improve prospects:\n\n\u201cBy the way Capital One when they merge with Discover is going to be really really fabulous and we\u2019re working a lot on that one.\u201d\n\n1. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 78\n\n\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is one of the largest railroad operators in America. Since it primarily transports industrial raw materials and bulk goods all over the US, the stock is dependent on economic activity. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\u2019s shares jumped by 5% in January after its Q4 results revealed a $2.96 profit per share that beat analyst estimates of $2.78. Following the report, Cramer was full of praise for the company. He commented that Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\u2019s operating ratio was \u201csuperb\u201d and added that not only can it benefit from stronger pricing but also from a potential boom in coal demand in America. This time around, he compared Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) with another railroad firm, CSX:\n\n\u201cBut, you\u2019ll see these beautiful one-off moves. Union Pacific great quarter versus CSX.\u201d\n\nUNP is a stock Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure.

With its deep liquidity, broad participation, and historical ability to recover from downturns, it has long been a cornerstone of wealth creation for individual and institutional investors. While it is subject to short-term volatility, its long-term performance and structural advantages make it a reliable platform for investment. It has a proven track record of delivering strong returns over the long term. The S&P 500, a benchmark index that represents the performance of 500 large-cap US companies, has averaged an annual return of approximately 10% since its inception in 1926. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the market\u2019s historical trajectory has been one of growth, driven by corporate innovation, economic expansion, and rising consumer demand.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nDuring major crises such as the Great Depression, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the market experienced sharp declines but eventually rebounded to new highs. For example, after the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the S&P 500 recovered within six months and went on to hit record levels, underscoring its resilience. One of the key factors contributing to the reliability of the US stock market is its breadth and diversity. The market includes a wide array of industries, from technology and health care to consumer goods and energy, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios to reduce risk. Additionally, US exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are among the most liquid in the world, making it easy for investors to buy and sell shares efficiently. This liquidity and diversification provide a level of stability that is unmatched in many other markets, offering investors confidence in the market\u2019s ability to withstand shocks and recover from volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP), as well as a micro-cap stock Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation.\n\n\n\nServiceNow had 2020 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV) at the end of third quarter, which represents 14% year-over-year growth in customers. ServiceNow had 15 deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV and six deals of more than $10 million. It closed 96 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV.\n\n\n\nServiceNow had 44 new Now Assist customers spending more than $1 million in ACV, including six with more than $5 million and two with more than $10 million. It is riding on an expanding partner base. However, NOW is suffering from persistent inflation, stiff competition, and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on ServiceNow here >>>)\n\n\n\nAlibaba shares have gained +23.7% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry\u2019s gain of +43.8%. The company is benefiting from strong momentum across its international commerce retail business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC\u2019s retail businesses and strength in AliExpress\u2019 Choice are contributing well.\n\n\n\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth.\n\n\n\nStrength in Lazada, AliExpress and Trendyol is expected to continue benefiting Alibaba\u2019s international business. However, rising expenses related to new initiatives are a concern. Macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations remain risks.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Union Pacific have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (+3.7% vs. -0.6%). The company is looking to cut costs to combat the revenue weakness. In the meantime, the railroad operator continues paying dividends. UNP is also active on the buyback front. UNP repurchased shares worth $1.5 billion in 2024. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n\n\nHowever, Union Pacific is suffering big time as ecommerce sales have normalized and consumer markets have softened. Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment.\n\n\n\nReduced fuel surcharge revenues, too, are a concern. Due to these headwinds, volumes declined 1% year over year in 2023. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated 220 basis points in 2023, mainly due to revenue woes. Given the soft freight market scenario, the revenue weakness is likely to persist.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>>)\n\n\n\nNatural Health Trends shares have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (-13% vs. +23.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $55.61 million is facing rising costs and regulatory hurdles limit growth. Cash flow constraints and intense competition add pressure.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Natural Health maintains strong liquidity with $46.3 million in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, 2024, and generated $0.5 million in operational cash flow (excluding tax payments) year to date. Operating losses improved from $1.4 million to $0.9 million year to date, supported by robust gross margins of 74.1%.\n\n\n\nThe company leverages market leadership in Hong Kong and China (78% of revenue) but faces risks from weak consumer spending and overreliance on these regions. Efforts in product expansion, digital initiatives, and market diversification (e.g., Colombia entry) position it for growth, but declining active membership (-10.9% year over year) poses challenges.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Health Trends here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Elevance Health, Inc.

            "content": "Union Pacific Corporation is a leading transportation and logistics company based in Omaha, Nebraska. Founded in 1862, the company has a rich history of serving customers across North America with safe, reliable and efficient rail transportation solutions. Union Pacific operates in two business segments: Railroad and Premium Operations.\n\nThe Railroad segment comprises the company's core operations, including freight transportation and logistics services. The Premium Operations segment includes Union Pacific's subsidiary, Union Pacific Distribution Services, which provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries.\n\nWith over 32,000 miles of rail network across 23 states, Union Pacific connects major markets and communities across North America. The company is committed to sustainability and has set ambitious goals to reduce emissions and increase the use of alternative fuels.\n\nUnion Pacific has consistently performed in the transportation and logistics industry, delivering strong financial results over the past few years. It is also important to mention that Union Pacific's debt levels have been relatively stable over the past few years. For several years, the company has maintained a healthy cash position between 1 - 3 billion dollars.\n\nUnion Pacific operates in the transportation and logistics industry, which is highly competitive and regulated. The industry has seen significant changes in recent years, including the growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.\n\nUnion Pacific faces competition from other railroads, trucking companies and intermodal transportation providers. The company also competes with alternative modes of transportation, such as air and sea freight. Regulatory and political issues, such as changes in trade policies and environmental regulations, can impact the industry and create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nDespite these challenges, Union Pacific has maintained its market position and continues to invest in technology and innovation to improve its services and meet the evolving needs of its customers.\n\nUnion Pacific's leadership team is led by Lance Fritz, who has been the company's Chairman, President and CEO since 2015. Fritz joined Union Pacific in 2000 and has held several leadership roles. The management team also includes other experienced executives who bring diverse skills and expertise to the company.\n\nUnion Pacific has several growth opportunities in the transportation and logistics industry. The company has invested in technology and innovation to improve its services and increase efficiency. For example, Union Pacific has implemented Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), a new operating model that has enhanced train speeds and reduced costs.\n\nThe company also has opportunities for growth in new markets and industries. Union Pacific's subsidiary, UPDS, provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries, including automotive, chemicals and agriculture. The company could expand its services into other sectors and markets to drive growth.\n\nUnion Pacific faces several risks and challenges in the transportation and logistics industry. Changes in consumer preferences and competitive pressures can impact the company's revenue and profitability. The shift towards e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions could also create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nUnion Pacific also faces risks related to its operations and infrastructure. The company's rail network is subject to weather and natural disasters, which can disrupt operations and impact the company's financial performance. Union Pacific also faces cybersecurity and data privacy risks, which could impact the company's operations and reputation.",

            "content": "The best dividend stocks to buy now are companies that provide significant paydays and stability. After all, a 5% dividend is cold comfort if the share price of your investment drops 50%.\n\n\n\nThat means investors should place a priority on dividend investments that have staying power as well as income potential. While there's no such thing as a sure thing, it is possible to sidestep risk and volatility by focusing on stocks with consistent profits, a strong track record of dividend growth as they share those profits with investors, and a sustainable payout ratio where these dividend stocks have the fundamentals to support payouts even if the economy gets choppy.\n\nThe following list of the 15 best dividend stocks spans stocks in a variety of sectors. However, each of these names stands good chance of hanging tough no matter what happens in 2025:\n\nDividend Stock Sector Market Value Forward Dividend Yield* AbbVie Inc. (ticker: ABBV) Health care $364 billion 3.2% Altria Group Inc. (MO) Consumer staples $93 billion 7.4% Amcor PLC (AMCR) Consumer cyclical $15 billion 5.1% American Tower Corp. (AMT) Real estate $95 billion 3.2% AT&T Inc. (T) Communication services $193 billion 4.2% BHP Group Ltd. (BHP) Materials $127 billion 4.9% CME Group Inc.

(KMB) Consumer staples $46.7 billion 3.6% Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Health care $115 billion 6.5% Prologis Inc. (PLD) Real estate $112 billion 3.3% United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Industrial $101 billion 5.6%\n\n*As of Feb. 26 close.\n\nAbbVie Inc. (ABBV)\n\nSector: Health care\n\nMarket value: $364 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.2%\n\nAbbVie is currently among the top pharmaceutical companies in the world based on sales, with projections of almost $60 billion in revenue expected for fiscal 2025 \u2013 which will grow to almost $64 billion in fiscal year 2026 if projections hold. It continues to thrive thanks to an impressive product pipeline that includes blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which treat things such as Crohn's disease and arthritis. That strong mix of drugs and consistent revenue has led to great long-term dividend growth, with payouts currently at $1.64 annually, up more than three-fold from just 51 cents quarterly back in 2015.\n\nAltria Group Inc. (MO)\n\nSector: Consumer staples\n\nMarket value: $93 billion\n\nDividend yield: 7.4%\n\nTobacco giant Altria is the obvious place to begin for almost any kind of dividend investor. MO has incredibly reliable revenue from an entrenched (and addictive) product portfolio that includes Marlboro cigarettes, Black & Mild pipe and cigar products, and smokeless tobacco like Copenhagen and Skoal. The steady profits and sales fuel steady dividend growth, with Altria boasting 55 consecutive annual dividend increases after its last boost to $1.02 per quarter as of August. What's more, MO stock has done more than just deliver dividends, as shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index in the past 12 months, with 34% gains versus 17% for the broader market.\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

Open An Account View Disclosure\n\nAmcor PLC (AMCR)\n\nSector: Consumer cyclical\n\nMarket value: $15 billion\n\nDividend yield: 5.1%\n\nBased in Switzerland, Amcor is a leader in packaging that sees strong and reliable demand for its products. While technically in the discretionary sector, its purchasers are staples producers like beverages and processed foods companies and pharmaceutical firms. Making blister packs of pills and cardboard milk cartons isn't particularly glamorous, but it's a crucial part of the global economy and one that has proven to be quite durable regardless of short-term disruptions. And with dividends adding up to roughly two-thirds or so of earnings, income investors can be sure their quarterly checks from this cheap dividend stock should keep rolling in for the foreseeable future.\n\nAmerican Tower Corp. (AMT)\n\nSector: Real estate\n\nMarket value: $95 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.2%\n\nAmerican Tower is a specialist in multi-tenant communications real estate, which includes telecom towers, fiber optic networks, data centers and other important infrastructure components that power our digital lives. With a portfolio of 148,000 communications sites and a highly interconnected footprint of U.S. data center facilities, AMT operates an incredibly reliable business thanks to both its reach and the ever-increasing demand for data. The company's generous $1.62 quarterly dividend is up roughly three-fold from just 42 cents per quarter to start 2015, proving its long-term commitment to dividend growth. And since AMT is structured as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and must deliver 90% of taxable income back to shareholders, it has a clear mandate to continue its practice of generous dividends in the years ahead.\n\nSector: Communication services\n\nMarket value: $193 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.2%\n\nAT&T has roots tracing back to 1885 and is among the dominant telecoms on the planet. It is certainly not resting on its laurels, however, after embarking on a restructuring plan in 2022 to streamline operations and reduce its long-term debt and maintain its customer base of 120 million accounts. The moves seem to be winning over Wall Street lately, however, with shares up more than 80% from their 2023 lows and up almost 20% since Jan. 1. The prospect of rate cuts coupled with lower debt and almost $40 billion operating cash flow has given many investors confidence that this company has what it takes to continue paying big-time dividends for quite some time.\n\nBHP Group Ltd. (BHP)\n\nSector: Materials\n\nMarket value: $127 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.9%\n\nMaterials stocks can be risky in part because they are tied to commodity prices and cyclical industrial demand more than any unique product or operational edge. That said, in an inflationary environment the materials that miners like BHP take out of the ground are worth more than ever \u2013 which makes now the perfect time to consider a dividend stock like this one. BHP is among the biggest natural resources companies on the planet, operating in Australia, Asia, Europe, North America and South America and produces materials including copper, iron ore, coal, silver, gold, uranium and nickel. Though BHP only pays dividends twice a year, it delivers a yield more than three times that of the S&P 500 at present.\n\nCME Group Inc. (CME)\n\nSector: Financial\n\nMarket value: $90 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.4%\n\nFounded in 1898, CME is one of the world's largest exchanges for futures and options contracts. These derivatives are generally in demand for risk management, but they become even more popular on Wall Street during times of change and uncertainty \u2013 two things that seem to be the order of the day in 2025. In particular, S&P 500 futures used to hedge against market volatility are booming, as are futures tied to Treasury markets and crude oil. As volumes remain strong, CME has seen shares rise about 20% in the past six months even as the S&P has only tacked on about 5% or so in the same period. And long-term, the dominant nature of this derivatives exchange means it will be able to support its generous dividend going forward.\n\nDominion Energy Inc. (D)\n\nSector: Utilities\n\nMarket value: $48 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.7%\n\nUtilities are among the best dividend stocks to buy thanks to consistent sales that fuel reliable dividends. Dominion is a leading utility in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., operating in Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina to serve about 2.8 million customers across its network of 80,000 miles of electricity lines and nearly 100,000 miles of gas pipelines. With a wide moat thanks to the high costs of entry and highly regulated nature of the business, Dominion is as stable a business as you will find on Wall Street.\n\nEnterprise Product Partners LP (EPD)\n\nSector: Energy\n\nMarket value: $72 billion\n\nDividend yield: 6.5%\n\nEnergy stocks can be risky if they are overly dependent on favorable pricing in the oil and gas market. Enterprise Products Partners is one of the best dividend stocks to buy because it is largely independent from commodity prices thanks to a model as a transportation and storage specialist. As a \"midstream\" energy company, EPD simply charges other energy firms for use of its pipelines to transport crude oil, petrochemicals and natural gas \u2013 regardless of whether the market prices are good or bad for those fossil fuels. As a result, the stock just logged its 27th year of consecutive dividend increases in January, proving a long-term commitment to driving shareholder value through generous and regular paydays.\n\nFifth Third Bancorp (FITB)\n\nSector: Financials\n\nMarket value: $29 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.5%\n\n\n\nIt's tempting to gravitate toward megabanks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) as icons of stability in the financial sector. And while that's normally the case, it's worth noting that talk of cross-border disruptions post serious risks to interconnected global institutions \u2013 while the U.S. regional banking sector, on the other hand, remains insulated from the fallout of a global trade war. Fifth Third is among the largest regional banks, making it the perfect \"goldilocks\" dividend stock in the financial sector because it is neither too small to be risky nor too large to be exposed to geopolitical fallout. Shares are up about 30% in the past 12 months to handily outperform the S&P 500 in the same period, with FITB delivering a juicy dividend on top of that.\n\n\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)\n\nSector: Health care\n\nMarket value: $392 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.0%\n\nJ&J is one of just two companies with the tip-top \"AAA\" rating for its credit \u2013 tech giant Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is the other \u2013 and boasts an amazing 62 consecutive years of dividend growth to make it one of the most bulletproof dividend stocks out there. It is also one of the 25 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization, regardless of sector. That's thanks to a long history of innovation and drug research, which has given birth to its current blockbusters that include bone cancer treatment Darzalex and anti-inflammatory drug Stelara. The general low-risk nature of drug sales plus the specific scale and strength of this market leader make it among the best dividend stocks to buy.\n\nSector: Consumer staples\n\nMarket value: $46.7 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.6%\n\nKimberly-Clark is the paper products powerhouse behind Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kleenex, Cottonelle and other ubiquitous household brands. These products are mainstays of any budget in both good times and bad, meaning KMB is a blue-chip stock that has staying power regardless of the macroeconomic environment. From an income perspective, Kimberly-Clark is equally sturdy, with a 53-year history of consecutive annual dividend growth after the declaration of its March dividend of $1.26 per share. There may not be breakneck growth or innovation ahead for its products, but it remains one of the best dividend stocks to buy for investors who want a low-volatility and low-risk company.\n\nPfizer Inc. (PFE)\n\nSector: Health care\n\nMarket value: $115 billion\n\nDividend yield: 6.5%\n\nA Wall Street darling and top performer just a few years ago, more recently Pfizer has struggled thanks to stumbles with both its vaccine business as well as its attempt to compete in the increasingly lucrative obesity drug market. Shares have been roughly cut in half from their late 2022 peak as a result. This Big Pharma mainstay may have fallen on hard times, but it's also worth noting that this firm has deep roots tracing back to 1849 \u2013 and in the here and now, it remains comfortably profitable, with dividends only about 60% of total profits. As one of the most respected brands in health care, PFE likely isn't going anywhere \u2013 so if you don't mind the recent volatility, this could be a big-time dividend bargain to consider.\n\nPrologis Inc. (PLD)\n\nSector: Real estate\n\nMarket value: $112 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.3%\n\nPrologis is the largest stock in the U.S. real estate sector, but isn't a traditional housing or office space play. Instead, this firm specializes in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. PLD is a key part of the global supply chain with warehouses, with 1.2 billion square feet of space across 19 different countries and top clients including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and FedEx Corp. (FDX). These top-tier clients make it highly likely PLD will thrive for years to come, and its structure as a REIT demands that Prologis delivers 90% of its taxable income back to shareholders. That creates a mandate for generous and consistent dividends that have grown from 40 cents quarterly in 2015 to $1.01 right now.\n\nUnited Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)\n\nSector: Industrial\n\nMarket value: $101 billion\n\nDividend yield: 5.6%",

            "content": "Conversely, the US under the Trump administration has taken a different path. Trump\u2019s inaugural speech signaled a pivot toward promoting fossil fuels and scaling back support for renewable energy sources. This shift is reflected in the actions of major financial institutions, such as the world\u2019s six largest banks withdrawing from a major climate coalition, and BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, pulling out of a similar group. This move is seen as a significant setback by sustainably-minded investors as the financial industry plays a crucial role in financing companies and achieving net-zero emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement.\n\nEurope has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable investing, with a pledge to achieve \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d by 2050, or net-zero emissions. The European Union has also implemented ambitious mandatory ESG and sustainability reporting requirements, setting a high bar for corporate transparency and responsibility. This regulatory framework not only supports sustainable investing but also creates a fertile ground for asset managers to develop and market ESG-focused products with higher profit margins and a global reach.\n\nOn January 24, Morningstar reported that the landscape of sustainable investing is entering a new era of complexity, characterized by a stark divide between the United States and Europe. This shift was precipitated by a series of significant events, including President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement. The decision underscores a growing divergence in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities, with Europe taking a leading role and the US moving in the opposite direction.\n\nIn recent years, the investment landscape has seen a significant shift towards socially responsible investing strategies. Among these, humane investing has gained considerable traction. Humane investing is a comprehensive socially responsible investing strategy that encompasses several key aspects. Firstly, it involves the reduction of animal products. This can range from food and fashion to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, focusing on companies that minimize or eliminate the use of animal products. Secondly, it ensures that businesses respect human rights and address any adverse outcomes. This includes fair labor practices, anti-discrimination policies, and ethical supply chain management. Thirdly, it promotes environmental conservation, such as reducing carbon footprints, sustainable sourcing, and waste reduction. Lastly, it involves shareholder activism, where investors engage with companies to improve welfare practices.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP ) stands against other best humane stocks to invest in now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor asset managers, this two-speed world presents both challenges and opportunities. European managers, who operate in a market where sustainability is mainstream, are likely to gain a competitive advantage. They can leverage their expertise in ESG to attract asset owners, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, who are increasingly allocating to ESG-focused strategies. This could lead to a preference for European managers, especially in impact investing, where they can demonstrate greater commitment and expertise.\n\nUS-based managers, on the other hand, are likely to adopt a more pragmatic approach, aligning their strategies with local market demands and avoiding vocal advocacy for ESG. This \u201cgreenhushing\u201d strategy is necessary to navigate the regulatory and political headwinds in the US while maintaining a global presence, particularly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nAs the demand for ethical and sustainable investment options grows, humane investing provides a compelling pathway to drive positive change while achieving financial growth.\n\nWhy Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) Is One of the Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now?\n\nAn intermodal container train winding through a rural landscape.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 best humane stocks to invest in now, we used environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies. We then looked at their ESG rating from S&P Global and picked 8 companies that have a minimum ESG score of 60. We also used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database as of Q3 2024 to find the number of hedge fund holders for each company. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 78\n\nESG Score: 63\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is one of the largest freight rail networks in the United States and operates a vast network spanning 23 western states with over 32,000 miles of track. The company is known for its focus on fuel efficiency, emissions reduction, and community engagement. Union Pacific Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:UNP) long-term sustainability goals align with the growing demand for eco-friendly transportation options.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is focusing on expanding mainline and terminal capacities, constructing new sidings, and extending existing ones. These initiatives are especially significant in key growth regions such as the Pacific Northwest, where the company is enhancing its ability to handle soda ash and export grain, and the Southwest, where it is boosting intermodal capabilities. Additionally, the company is investing in advanced technologies such as GPS tracking for containers and rail pulse to improve service reliability, offering customers real-time tracking and enhanced communication.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is also diversifying its service offerings to meet the changing demands of its customers. For example, the company recently introduced a new domestic intermodal service that has reduced transit times between Southern California and the Chicago area by two days. This innovation has attracted new customers and strengthened existing relationships.\n\nOverall, UNP ranks 4th on our list of the best humane stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Thursday evening\u2019s dip followed a historic day for the S&P 500, as markets digested strong corporate earnings and the broader implications of Trump\u2019s speech at the World Economic Forum. The focus on tariffs, interest rates, and the question of how do tariffs impact the economy has reshaped market dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Market Trends: S&P 500 and US Stock Futures\n\n\n\nAfter the S&P 500 hit a record close, US stock futures mildly decline after S&P 500 record close became the narrative driving markets.\n\nS&P 500 Futures dropped slightly, losing 0.1% to 6,147.0 points.\n\nNasdaq 100 Futures fell by 0.1% to 22,009.25 points.\n\nDow Jones Futures dipped to 44,727.0 points.\n\nThis decline highlights ongoing concerns sparked by Trump\u2019s speech, which emphasized the importance of tariffs and their role in protecting American industries. Investors are left asking how do tariffs impact the economy, as they weigh the potential benefits against risks such as inflation and trade wars.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Speech Highlights and Economic Impacts\n\nTrump\u2019s speech at Davos tackled major economic issues, including tariffs, interest rates, and global trade policies. These themes are central to understanding current market trends, including why US stock futures mildly decline after S&P 500 record close.\n\nInterest Rates and Economic Recovery\n\nA key takeaway from Trump\u2019s speech was his call for interest rate cuts. He argued that reducing rates would accelerate economic recovery, making the U.S. more competitive globally. The Federal Reserve\u2019s response to this pressure remains uncertain, but it has left investors on edge.\n\nHow Do Tariffs Impact the Economy?\n\nThe recurring theme of tariffs dominated Trump\u2019s speech, sparking renewed discussions on how do tariffs impact the economy. Tariffs aim to protect domestic industries, but they often lead to higher costs for consumers and strained trade relationships. For example, fears of aluminum tariffs caused stocks like Alcoa and Freeport-McMoRan to drop significantly.\n\nTariffs are a double-edged sword, as shown in Trump\u2019s speech. While they can safeguard American jobs, their broader economic impact continues to divide experts. Understanding how do tariffs impact the economy is essential for investors navigating these uncertain times.\n\n\n\n\n\nS&P 500\u2019s Record Close Amid Mixed Signals\n\nDespite the cautious outlook for US stock futures, the S&P 500 reached a record close of 6,118.72 points, reflecting a 0.5% gain. This performance underscores the resilience of certain sectors despite market volatility.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nGE Aerospace shares surged by 6.6%, driven by strong quarterly results.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation gained 5.2% after reporting operational improvements.\n\nOn the other hand, American Airlines and Electronic Arts (EA) faced steep losses, with EA dropping 16.7% due to underperformance in its gaming division.\n\nThe materials sector also struggled, with fears of new tariffs\u2014another topic from Trump\u2019s speech\u2014contributing to declines.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Do Tariffs Impact the Economy? A Closer Look\n\nA recurring question in market circles is how do tariffs impact the economy. As highlighted in Trump\u2019s speech, tariffs are designed to reduce reliance on foreign goods and encourage domestic production. However, they also introduce several challenges:\n\nHigher Costs for Consumers: Tariffs raise prices on imported goods, affecting purchasing power. Retaliatory Trade Wars: Countries affected by tariffs often impose their own, disrupting global supply chains. Market Uncertainty: Businesses dependent on international trade face increased risks and costs.\n\nInvestors tracking US stock futures mildly decline after S&P 500 record close are factoring in these complexities, particularly as the Federal Reserve deliberates its next move.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: Navigating a Dynamic Market\n\nThe slight downturn in US stock futures mildly decline after S&P 500 record close reflects market recalibrations in response to earnings reports and geopolitical developments. Trump\u2019s speech has reignited debates on tariffs and their role in shaping the economy. Questions like how do tariffs impact the economy remain at the forefront, influencing investment strategies and market sentiment.\n\nStaying informed about US stock futures, Trump\u2019s speech, and the evolving understanding of how do tariffs impact the economy is crucial for navigating today\u2019s volatile markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering shares, indices, forex (foreign exchange) and commodities for trading and price predictions, remember that trading CFDs involves a significant degree of risk and could result in capital loss.\n\nPast performance is not indicative of any future results.

We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the Company\u2019s ability to sustain given debt levels (including leases) with the cash generated from operations. In addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the Company\u2019s credit rating. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is debt to net income ratio. The tables above provide reconciliations from net income to adjusted EBITDA, debt to adjusted debt, and debt to net income to adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.8% and 3.6% , respectively.

In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance criterion in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives.

Operating revenue fell 1% to $6.12 billion, slightly missing forecasts compiled by Visible Alpha.\n\nUnion Pacific's earnings growth came as fuel costs plunged 23% to $581 million, and the average fuel price per gallon consumed dropped 24% to $2.41. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of average fuel cost declines.\n\nThe company also said freight car velocity improved 1% to 219 daily miles per car, and workforce productivity grew 6% to 1,118 car miles per employee.\n\nUnion Pacific projected full-year EPS would be consistent with reaching its three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the range of a high-single-digit to low-double-digit percent.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks, while popular among investors, have been underperforming for a while. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, attributed this lag to a straightforward reason: their limited exposure to the technology sector. Although technology wasn\u2019t the top-performing sector in 2024, it came close and now represents a significant portion of the market.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t suggest that dividend stocks are fundamentally weak or that they won\u2019t rebound in the future. Alex Bryan, Morningstar\u2019s director of product management for equity indexes, believes that changing market dynamics could benefit dividend investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cFrom a valuation standpoint, dividends look more attractive than they did a year ago, and that\u2019s partially because of the relative underperformance that they\u2019ve had. Bonds are certainly more competitive relative to dividends. But if you look at dividend-paying stocks relative to the rest of the equity markets, I think they\u2019re becoming more attractive relative to other stocks.\u201d\n\nOther analysts also suggested that dividend-paying stocks might stage a comeback in 2025 due to growing investor demand for cash returns. The broader market\u2019s dividend yield fell below 1.19% in 2024, marking a 20-year low, compared to its long-term average of 4.3%. With interest rates recovering on risk-free investments like Treasurys, companies are facing increased competition for yield. As a result, many are raising dividends or initiating them for the first time. Notably, some major tech giants began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market their shift toward value positioning within a high-growth sector.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nIn 2024, companies in the broader market that paid dividends returned around 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg. The average dividend yield for these companies was approximately 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield stood at about 1.5%.\n\nWolfe Research\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist, Chris Senyek, offers a unique perspective on investing in dividend stocks. While investors typically focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek suggested exploring other opportunities. He highlighted companies initiating dividends for the first time and those that have recently reduced their payouts. Initiating a dividend indicates management\u2019s confidence in maintaining steady earnings and cash flow, while also attracting a new group of investors.\n\nSenyek also noted that shares of companies that cut dividends tend to underperform leading up to the cut, perform in line with the market shortly after, and begin to outperform about six months later. The key is to identify companies that may be at risk of cutting dividends and to reconsider those that reduced payouts a few months earlier. To forecast potential cuts, Senyek examines companies with high dividend yields, substantial debt, and elevated payout ratios. For potential new dividend payers, Senyek seeks out companies with robust free cash flow yields that are actively repurchasing shares and maintaining manageable debt levels. In view of this, we will take a look at stocks with steady dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nUpside Potential as of January 20: 10.88%\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is an American transport company, headquartered in Nebraska. The company operates railroads, connecting 23 states. It is focusing on increasing mainline and terminal capacities by building new sidings and extending existing ones. These efforts are especially critical in growth regions like the Pacific Northwest, where the company is improving its handling of soda ash and grain exports, and the Southwest, where it is enhancing intermodal services. Moreover, the company is investing in advanced technologies like GPS tracking for containers and rail pulse systems to improve service reliability and provide customers with real-time tracking and better communication. The stock has surged by nearly 3% since the start of 2025.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) reported $6.01 billion in revenue, which saw a modest 1% rise compared to the same period last year. Freight revenue, excluding fuel surcharges, saw a 5% increase, driven by a 6% growth in revenue carloads. The company\u2019s operating income also experienced an 11% boost, reaching $2.4 billion.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\u2019s cash position also remained strong for FY24. In the first nine months of the year, the company posted an operating cash flow of $6.7 billion, which showed a growth from $5.9 billion in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow saw a notable increase, climbing to $1.8 billion from $955 million the previous year. The company has been a generous dividend payer, providing regular payouts to shareholders for the past 125 years. Moreover, it also maintains an 18-year track record of consistently growing its payouts, which makes UNP one of the best stocks with steady dividends. Its quarterly dividend comes in at $1.34 per share for a dividend yield of 2.27%, as of January 20.\n\nOf the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 78 funds held stakes in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), compared with 82 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $4.48 billion.

The Premium Operations segment includes Union Pacific's subsidiary, Union Pacific Distribution Services, which provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries.\n\nWith over 32,000 miles of rail network across 23 states, Union Pacific connects major markets and communities across North America. The company is committed to sustainability and has set ambitious goals to reduce emissions and increase the use of alternative fuels.\n\nUnion Pacific has consistently performed in the transportation and logistics industry, delivering strong financial results over the past few years. It is also important to mention that Union Pacific's debt levels have been relatively stable over the past few years. For several years, the company has maintained a healthy cash position between 1 - 3 billion dollars.\n\nUnion Pacific operates in the transportation and logistics industry, which is highly competitive and regulated. The industry has seen significant changes in recent years, including the growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.\n\nUnion Pacific faces competition from other railroads, trucking companies and intermodal transportation providers. The company also competes with alternative modes of transportation, such as air and sea freight. Regulatory and political issues, such as changes in trade policies and environmental regulations, can impact the industry and create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nDespite these challenges, Union Pacific has maintained its market position and continues to invest in technology and innovation to improve its services and meet the evolving needs of its customers.\n\nUnion Pacific's leadership team is led by Lance Fritz, who has been the company's Chairman, President and CEO since 2015.

Union Pacific's subsidiary, UPDS, provides transportation and logistics services to customers across multiple industries, including automotive, chemicals and agriculture. The company could expand its services into other sectors and markets to drive growth.\n\nUnion Pacific faces several risks and challenges in the transportation and logistics industry. Changes in consumer preferences and competitive pressures can impact the company's revenue and profitability. The shift towards e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions could also create challenges for Union Pacific.\n\nUnion Pacific also faces risks related to its operations and infrastructure. The company's rail network is subject to weather and natural disasters, which can disrupt operations and impact the company's financial performance.

And while we will still get some bank earnings, the rest will be in a diverse group of industries including transportation, pharmaceuticals, and consumer staples.\n\nEven though FANGMAN has gone away, Netflix is still one of the biggest names to report this week. It will be one of those most closely watched. It\u2019s also been a hot stock over the last year, hitting new highs in 2024.\n\nCan it keep the momentum of the last several years?\n\nWill the bulls be out for the big cap stocks this week?\n\n5 Stocks to Watch for Earnings This Week\n\n1. Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX )\n\nNetflix has beat 3 quarters in a row but it has only missed 2 times in the last 3 years. That\u2019s an impressive record.\n\nShares of Netflix are up 79% in the last year but it still trades at an attractive valuation of just 36.7x forward earnings.\n\nWill Netflix beat again?\n\n2. Abbott Laboratories ( ABT )\n\nAbbott Laboratories is a big pharmaceutical company. It has only missed one time in the last 5 years and it was in 2021. What an extraordinary earnings surprise track record, given the pandemic was in 2020.\n\nShares of Abbott Labs have been moving in a narrow trading range for several years. It\u2019s trading down 0.3% over the last year. Abbott Labs still isn\u2019t cheap, however. It has a forward P/E of 22.\n\nWill Abbott Laboratories break out of its trading range soon?\n\n3. Union Pacific Corp. ( UNP )\n\nUnion Pacific is coming off an earnings miss last quarter after it had beat 4 quarters in a row prior to that.\n\nShares of Union Pacific have struggled over the last year as the transportation industry was in a recession. It fell 0.7% over the prior year. Union Pacific is now trading with a forward P/E of 19.5.\n\nIs it time to take a chance on the railroads like Union Pacific again?\n\n4. American Airlines Group Inc. ( AAL )\n\nAmerican Airlines has beat 2 quarters in a row but it has only missed twice since 2021. That\u2019s a good earnings surprise track record.\n\nShares of American Airlines have rallied in the last year as international travel demand stayed strong. It\u2019s up 41% over that period. American Airlines is cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.3.\n\nDo the airline stocks, like American Airlines, still have some gas left in the tank in 2025?\n\n5. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ( ISRG )\n\nIntuitive Surgical has beat 7 quarters in a row and has only missed twice in the last 5 years. It has a great earnings surprise track record.\n\nIntuitive Surgical already pre-announced preliminary fourth quarter revenue results which saw DaVinci system revenue up 36% in the fourth quarter due to higher average selling prices and a lower mix of leased systems. The stock soared on the announcement.\n\nShares of Intuitive Surgical are up 65.1% over the last year and are at new all-time highs. It\u2019s not cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 75.4.\n\nIs it too late to get into Intuitive Surgical?\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other best shipping stocks to invest in now.\n\nShipping refers to the transportation of goods and commodities from one place to another, encompassing various modes of transportation such as road, rail, air, and sea. The shipping industry plays a vital role in connecting businesses and consumers across the globe by facilitating the exchange of goods and driving economic growth. From the delivery of online purchases to the transportation of raw materials and finished goods, shipping plays an essential component of modern commerce. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the cargo shipping market size was recorded at 11.89 billion tons in 2024 and is expected to reach 14.72 billion tons by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 2.7%. The industry is diverse, with companies specializing in different modes of transportation, such as trucking, rail freight, air cargo, and marine shipping, as well as logistics and courier services.\n\nInvesting in shipping stocks can be a lucrative opportunity, as the industry is closely tied to consumer spending, economic growth, and global trade. As e-commerce continues to grow, the demand for fast and reliable shipping services is increasing, driving up revenues and profits for shipping companies. Additionally, the rise of just-in-time manufacturing and same-day delivery is creating new opportunities for companies that can provide flexible and efficient logistics solutions. The shipping industry is also experiencing a shift towards digitalization, with the adoption of technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience.\n\nRead Also: 12 Cheapest Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential and Top 10 Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAccording to a report by Hillebrand Gori, part of DHL Global, the shipping industry has experienced significant growth and evolution in 2024, marked by both opportunities and challenges. The report highlights the persistent growth in demand, driven by strong market activity across key regions, particularly in North and Latin America.\n\nThe growth in demand has been met with an expansion in the global container fleet, which is set to increase by a further 5% in 2025. However, the report notes that operational challenges, such as re-routings due to geopolitical risks in regions like the Red Sea, continue to affect capacity and scheduling. Vessels are often rerouted, leading to delays and higher fuel costs. Additionally, labor unrest in countries such as India and on the U.S. East Coast disrupted supply chains. Companies must adapt to these pressures by investing in resilient logistics solutions and closely monitoring geopolitical developments.",

            "content": "SANDPOINT \u2014 During a Wednesday meeting, city staff and officials explored the possibility of buying a 2.53-acre right of way near the intersection of Larch Street and U.S. 2 for the purpose of expanding park and trail access.\n\nIf purchased, the parcel could house a \u201cpocket park\u201d next to a low-income neighborhood and be used to extend the multimodal Sandpoint-Dover Community Trail.\n\nCommunity Planning and Development Director Jason Welker presented the opportunity during the meeting; he explained that the 50-foot-wide, 500-yard-long property is owned by Union Pacific Corporation and contains a disused railway.\n\nWelker said that Sandpoint has been in negotiations with Union Pacific, and that the landowner is willing to sell the property to Sandpoint for $659,000 \u2014 a price lower than the $740,000 value determined in an appraisal commissioned by the city.\n\n\u201cThey're giving us first right of refusal. If we don't buy it now, it will be bought by a private developer,\u201d Welker said.\n\nWelker told councilors the property is close to a cluster of city-owned parcels in the area, and that a purchase could bring the community one step closer to having an uninterrupted trail spanning the greater Sandpoint area.\n\n\u201cImagine a shared use path connecting the city of Ponderay to the city of Dover. This is the way to achieve that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an essential piece of property.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that purchasing the land could create an opportunity to improve park and trail access for a neighborhood that includes subsidized senior and low-income housing.\n\n\u201cThis is one of our only low-income neighborhoods in Sandpoint,\u201d Welker said. \u201cIt's a great thing to provide a park to a traditionally underserved part of town.\u201d\n\nCouncilors expressed support for expanding parkland and noted that the property could eventually connect to land owned by nonprofit Friends of the Pend d\u2019Oreille Bay Trail and house an expanded trail system north of Sandpoint.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of other people who have put effort and thought into continuing a pathway here,\u201d said Council President Deb Ruehle. \u201cI think if we shy away from this purchase ... we might look in the rear-view mirror and wish we had made this purchase.\u201d\n\nCouncilor Kyle Schreiber said he wanted to see the right of way protected from development, but that he recognized the point made by commenter Clay Hutchison, who earlier in the meeting argued that the landowner\u2019s asking price was too high and encouraged the city to seek a way to have the parcel donated in exchange for relieving Union Pacific of liability.\n\n\u201cI don't know if there are any other possibilities out there,\u201d Schreiber said. \u201cI would certainly hate to see this piece get snatched up while we tried to figure that out.\u201d\n\nIf councilors vote to approve the purchase, the land would likely be bought using impact fee funds earmarked for parks expansion and improvement collected from developers when they construct new structures in Sandpoint.\n\nAdditionally, Mayor Jeremy Grimm noted that the parcel falls within Sandpoint\u2019s urban renewal footprint, allowing tax dollars to from the fund to potentially support the purchase.\n\nWelker told attendees that it will inevitably take time to develop the area, even if the purchase is made soon.\n\n\u201cThese are long, long-term plans,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are not things we're going to implement in the next few years, even if we take ownership of this right of way.\u201d\n\nSandpoint\u2019s Parks and Recreation Commission will review the buying opportunity at its next meeting Feb. 12. If approved, Welker said that staff will come to councilors for final permission next month.",

In this chart, the price is displaying a significant resistance to the trendline that\u2019s forming above it. Additionally, it has broken down below the support level at $206.77, indicating a bearish momentum and the potential for further price declines.\n\nThe price is currently trading between the range of $206.77 and $199.01 after a fall of -6.92% because of the strong selling pressure. In the last two trading sessions, the price had formed a strong bearish candle at $206.77, reflecting the bears\u2019 presence at that level.\n\nIf the UNP price gives a breakout of $206.77 then, the price may be seen rising to the trendline forming above. If it also breaks above the trendline, then it may reach its resistance level at $216.57.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other best safe dividend stocks for 2025.\n\nThe year 2024 was exceptional for US stocks, with the broader market climbing over 23% and the tech-focused NASDAQ gaining 29%. These impressive results were driven by the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group of stocks, which rose nearly 67%, alongside several other large-cap stocks. It marked the second consecutive year of over 20% gains for the broader market, a feat not seen since the late 1990s. Analysts and investors are optimistic about the market\u2019s future, as 2024 demonstrated remarkable strength, suggesting the positive trend could continue. However, despite the current upbeat outlook, investor sentiment could shift quickly due to factors such as global tensions, economic developments, or unforeseen events.\n\nNo matter how the market trends, investors tend to gravitate towards safe stocks that offer stability, particularly during challenging times. Among these secure investment choices, dividend stocks are especially favored. These stocks are typically issued by companies with a reliable history of consistent dividend payments, often from well-established sectors such as utilities, consumer goods, or healthcare.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nHistorical analysis consistently shows that dividend stocks tend to outperform other asset classes across various market cycles. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns for US stocks. From 1980 to 2019, a period marked by a significant decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the returns from the broader market. The report further mentioned that dividends become especially valuable in a low-interest-rate environment, offering a steady cash flow when other fixed-income options are less attractive. Once companies start paying dividends, they rarely stop, and most increase their payouts over time. Paying dividends can make a stock more appealing to investors, potentially boosting its value. Over the last decade, dividends for the benchmark index have grown annually, with an average compound growth rate of just over 7%. In strong markets, dividends have enhanced total returns, while in years with low or negative returns, such as 2020 and 2022, dividends played a larger role in total returns, helping to bolster portfolio resilience.\n\nRegarding the safety of dividend stocks, analysts recommend that investors prioritize dividend growth rather than chasing yield traps. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, stressed the importance of focusing on dividend growth, highlighting that it is a distinct strategy from high-dividend investing. He explained that dividend growth reflects a company\u2019s strong competitive position and positive future prospects. A dividend growth portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector distribution and growth versus value characteristics, such as price-to-earnings ratios. While it has a value-oriented approach, it is more balanced and core-focused compared to a high-dividend portfolio.",

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Union Pacific's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n\nThe top 25 shareholders own 47% of the company\n\nUsing data from alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Union Pacific Corporation ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Union Pacific.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Union Pacific?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Union Pacific. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Union Pacific's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Union Pacific is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.2% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Union Pacific\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Union Pacific Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$247m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Union Pacific. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Union Pacific better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Union Pacific has we think you should be aware of.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nThe year 2024 proved favorable for dividends, even though the Dividend Aristocrats Index lagged behind the broader market. Throughout the year, US companies consistently increased or upheld their dividend payouts. In addition, several major tech firms began offering dividends, signaling to investors that it\u2019s possible for a company to focus on both growth and shareholder returns. By September 30, 2024, approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P index were distributing dividends, a figure that has remained fairly stable over the past decade. Notably, nearly 24% of these dividend-paying firms were in the technology sector, a significant increase from 13% ten years ago. Sectors such as healthcare and industrials also experienced notable growth in the number of companies offering dividends. This broader distribution of dividends has expanded the range of investment opportunities, giving equity-income investors more access to high-growth, dynamic, and innovative companies. Given these developments, analysts remain optimistic about their performance heading into 2025.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors\n\nAnalysts note that, from a broad perspective, earnings growth has traditionally been the primary driver of dividends. Last year saw strong earnings growth, and they anticipate an even better performance in 2025. Goldman predicts an 11% increase in earnings per share for this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024. This is expected to result in a 7% rise in dividends, compared to a 6% increase last year. Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, offers a more optimistic outlook, forecasting a 12% boost in dividends this year, fueled by accelerating earnings growth.\n\nDividends historically accounted for 40% of the market\u2019s total return from 1936 to 2012 but have contributed only 16% over the past ten years, according to a research note from BofA Securities released late last year. Looking forward, Kwon anticipates that dividends will have a more significant impact on total returns compared to the previous decade.\n\nDividends hold particular significance, especially as the broader market has experienced consecutive gains of over 20%, a scenario not seen since the late 1990s. Moreover, the low payout ratio, currently at 29% compared to the historical average of 50%, suggests there is considerable potential for companies to increase their dividend payouts. Kwon pointed out that another key factor supporting dividend investing is the growing number of retired baby boomers seeking income. With cash products yielding around 4%, there is a strong demand for dividends, as investors are looking for immediate cash returns and are pressuring companies to increase their dividend distributions.\n\nThis optimism about dividend stocks is largely rooted in their historical performance, as they have been instrumental in reducing overall portfolio volatility and can help cushion losses when stock prices decline. Research indicates that dividend-paying stocks often outperform their non-dividend-paying counterparts during bear markets, such as during the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis. This may be because companies that pay dividends are typically larger, more established, and more profitable, making them more resilient than the broader market.\n\nFrom October 2019 to September 2024, a period marked by significant fluctuations in the market\u2019s total performance, equity income funds demonstrated lower volatility and reduced downside risk compared to the broader market. Given this, we will discuss the most reliable dividend stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a stock screener to identify companies with a history of dividend growth spanning over 10 years. From this group, we selected companies offering dividend yields of at least 1% as of January 12. From that selection, we identified the ten stocks that hedge funds favored the most during the third quarter of 2024, based on data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is an American transportation company that operates railroads, connecting 23 states. Railroads provide an incredibly efficient way to transport goods over land, with Union Pacific playing a central role in moving a wide range of bulk commodities. This diverse revenue stream helps stabilize the company\u2019s income, though its performance is still influenced by economic cycles. When the economy is doing well, demand for products like agricultural goods, industrial materials, and energy increases, driving a higher need for the company\u2019s services. On the other hand, during economic downturns, demand for these goods tends to fall. Despite these cyclical fluctuations, railroads typically maintain strong operating margins regardless of economic conditions.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) posted revenue of $6.01 billion, marking a 1% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Freight revenue, excluding fuel surcharge income, grew by 5%, driven by a 6% rise in revenue carloads. The company\u2019s operating income reached $2.4 billion, an 11% increase.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) also showed a solid cash position. In the first nine months of the year, it reported an operating cash flow of $6.7 billion, up from $5.9 billion during the same period last year. Free cash flow for the period also increased significantly, reaching $1.8 billion compared to $955 million in the previous year. The company has consistently honored its commitment to shareholders, having paid uninterrupted dividends to investors for 125 consecutive years. In addition, it has been growing its payouts for 18 consecutive years, which makes UNP one of the best dividend stocks. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $1.34 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.38%, as of January 12.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) was a part of 78 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, compared with 82 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes held by these funds have a total value of over $4.4 billion.\n\nOverall UNP ranks 8th on our list of the most reliable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other logistics stocks.\n\nThe Logistics Industry: Current Dynamics\n\nLogistics companies transporting goods around the world continue to navigate uncertainty as Donald Trump plans to impose 60% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. As reported by CNBC, Dave Bozeman, the new CEO of C.H. Robinson, sees an opportunity in Trump tariffs. The logistics giant is a top 3 carrier on the China-U.S. freight lane also carrying nearly 10% of the freight on the US-Mexico lane. Citi transportation analyst Ari Rosa considers the company\u2019s business diversified enough to work through tariffs despite its global forwarding business being very exposed to China. The CEO\u2019s stance on the tariffs was quite positive as well, as he stated:\n\n\u201cThe freight still has to move. It might just move at a different starting point, and we would still be there to move that.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Ravi Jakhar of the firm Allcargo Group, the world\u2019s LCL consolidation leader and India\u2019s largest integrated logistics solutions provider, reiterated optimism regarding the Trump tariff risks. He mentioned how over 4 years ago when sanctions came in from the Trump administration, the firm saw an increased import into its Vietnam offices from China and improved export out of Vietnam, alongside increased momentum in Indonesia and the Philippines. In his opinion, whether it is a short-term tariff sanction or a long-term structural trend, trade flows could change in terms of origins and destinations but the overall trade flows would remain robust as long as manufacturing and consumption are there.\n\nAs of what\u2019s recent in the logistics landscape, the holiday season is in full swing, with holiday surcharges playing a crucial role in profitability for logistics companies since they charge their big retail customers extra fees on a per-package basis compared to their June volume during the busy holiday season. The increase in e-commerce is also benefitting such logistics providers and full truckload carriers. Simultaneously, an increase in freight in anticipation of future tariffs is also being seen.\n\nA survey from Merchants Fleet and Atomik Research of decision-makers in organizations that typically transport freights of consumer-packaged goods throughout the US revealed that 88% saw AI as useful in alleviating pressures on their fleets this peak delivery season. AI\u2019s data-driven capabilities are to streamline operations and decision-making, with the majority of the respondents citing supply chain optimization as a primary benefit. Other advantages mentioned were improved route optimization, enhanced inventory management, and reduced downtime by identifying maintenance issues with fleet vehicles.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now, we went through stock screeners, ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 11 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds: 78\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a railroad holding company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. Union Pacific Railroad, the principal operating company of Union Pacific Corporation, provides a critical link in the global supply chain by connecting 23 states in the western two-thirds of the US by rail.\n\nUnion Pacific was established by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862 and has been building America for over 160 years. The company is uniquely positioned as it serves many of the fastest-growing population centers in the United States while operating from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways and seamlessly connecting with Canada\u2019s rail systems. It is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways.\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has already laid the foundation for its success as it posted year-over-year improvements for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024, in reportable injury rates, freight car velocity, and locomotive productivity among other major metrics. Recently, the company closed 2024\u2019s third quarter, demonstrating strategic success. Improved safety and service performance drove solid revenue growth which translated into third-quarter earnings per diluted share up 10% and operating income up 11%. Hence, the firm is positioned well to lead in safety, service, and operational excellence.\n\nOverall UNP ranks 1st on our list of the best logistics stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.\n\nPartly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 8.2% over the past year against the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 26.2% appreciation. The broader Zacks Transportation sector has plunged 3.1% in the said time frame.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite the challenges surrounding the industry,some railroad companies like Union Pacific Corporation UNP and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC have consistently paid dividends to their shareholders, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.\n\nDividend growth stocks generally belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to significant market swings, and act as a hedge against uncertainty-induced stock market volatility as is the case currently. They offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.\n\nAdditionally, these companies generally have strong fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity and a strong balance sheet.\n\nHow to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?\n\nIn order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each stock mentioned below presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nUnion Pacific: Headquartered in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific, through its subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates in the railroad business in the United States. Currently, UNP has a market capitalization of $139.40 billion.\n\nUNP pays a quarterly dividend of $1.34 ($5.36 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.33% yield at the current stock price. The company\u2019s payout ratio is 49% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 8.75%. (Check Union Pacific\u2019s dividend history here).\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)\n\nUnion Pacific Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | Union Pacific Corporation Quote\n\nUNP has paid dividends on its common stock for 125 consecutive years, reflecting its pro-shareholder approach. Union Pacific\u2019s consistent initiatives to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases look encouraging. In 2022, UNP paid dividends worth $3.16 billion and repurchased shares worth $6.28 billion. In 2023, the company returned $3.9 billion to its shareholders through dividends ($3.2 billion) and buybacks ($0.7 billion). During the first nine months of 2024, UNP paid $2.40 billion in dividends and repurchased shares worth $831 million. Notably, management expects to buyback shares worth $1.5 billion in 2024.",

            "content": "Click the link to read the article on the High Country News website (Jonathan P. Thompson):\n\nI wandered back and forth on the bridge for the next hour or so, stopping frequently to snap another photo, meditate vertiginously on the river and limestone cliffs or to gaze again in awe at the magnificent, uncanny creatures. Politics and the election results became irrelevant, at least for a moment, and it was with a newfound sense of serenity that I finally got back into the car and headed north.\n\nAs I reached the bridge, I noticed some onlookers looking intently downstream with binoculars. I followed their gaze to see a trio of giant, bald-headed, feathered creatures perched on the steel beams of the automobile bridge, looking a bit like the flying monkeys in the old Wizard of Oz film. They were California condors, maybe 10 in all, apparently waiting for an afternoon carrion snack to float by on the slow-moving emerald waters far below.\n\nIn mid-November, 10 days after 77 million of our fellow Americans chose Donald J. Trump to be their next president, I found myself at the old Navajo Bridge, which spans Marble Canyon and the Colorado River downstream from Lees Ferry in northern Arizona. I got out of my car, stretched and ambled toward the pedestrian bridge, which mirrors the newer one for automobiles.\n\nMy mental calm was quickly shattered, however, as news trickled out about Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks and plans. It is becoming increasingly clear that we are entering a perilous political era in which the federal government\u2019s role is fundamentally altered. This includes a multi-pronged assault on our public lands and the rules, regulations, laws and agencies designed to protect them. Those condors on the Colorado River could be among the many victims.\n\nJudging from the record of Trump\u2019s first term, his campaign platform, his Cabinet picks so far and Project 2025, the right wing\u2019s \u201cpresidential playbook,\u201d it\u2019s clear that he will once again attempt to dismantle the administrative state \u2014 and he\u2019ll likely be better at it this time. The destruction will include gutting federal agencies, replacing experienced staffers with Trump loyalists and eviscerating protections for human health and the environment. The goal is to shrink the government, slash spending on safety nets and social programs to fund more tax cuts for the wealthy, and (of course) remove regulatory barriers standing in the way of ever-growing corporate profits. With the likes of Elon Musk buying his way into the administration, it promises to be a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires.\n\nTrump actually summed up this ethos better than I ever could in a social media post, when he vowed to give anyone who invested at least $1 billion \u201cin the United States of America \u2026 fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals. GET READY TO ROCK!!!\u201d He seemed to be responding to global mining corporation Rio Tinto, which is behind the proposed Resolution Copper Mine at Oak Flat in Arizona, urging the new administration to weaken environmental laws and expedite permitting for big mines.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump made his hostility toward public lands clear as he reduced national monuments and rolled back regulations on fossil fuel extraction. This time, he promises a repeat performance, backed by a GOP-dominated Congress, a conservative-leaning Supreme Court and an army of professional ideologues who have been eagerly preparing for this moment for the last four years.\n\nWe can expect him to try to shrink or entirely rescind national monuments \u2014 particularly Bears Ears, Grand Staircase-Escalante and the Baaj Nwaavjo I\u2019tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon \u2014 potentially reopening hundreds of thousands of acres of uranium-rich lands to new mining claims during a time when the domestic uranium industry is experiencing a revival.\n\nHe will likely reward petroleum companies for donating generously to his campaign by implementing his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d policies. He\u2019ll open up more public land to oil and gas leasing, including in the Alaskan Arctic, and rescind drilling bans on Thompson Divide in western Colorado and around Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico. He\u2019ll roll back new EPA rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas and mercury pollution from coal power plants.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s hunger for \u201cenergy dominance\u201d and corporate freedom don\u2019t come for your public lands, the \u201cCult of Efficiency\u201d probably will. Musk donated $277 million to Trump\u2019s campaign. In return, he has been chosen to co-chair the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he has vowed to slash some $2 trillion in allegedly \u201cwasteful\u201d spending.\n\nWhat this will actually mean remains unclear. But Trump\u2019s suggestion that he may try to privatize the U.S. Postal Service because it\u2019s not \u201cprofitable\u201d and must be \u201csubsidized\u201d gives a good indication of what Musk\u2019s quasi-department will be targeting. The USPS is designed to provide a public good, not a profit, and its priorities are fulfilling that mission, not maximizing efficiency. After all, how could delivering a letter to some remote rural backwater for some 50 cents ever be efficient?\n\nAnd if the USPS is a problem, then what about public lands and the agencies that manage them? Sure, they provide ecological benefits, stewardship of and free access to millions of acres of stunning landscapes, wildlife habitat and so much more. And yet, they are \u201csubsidized\u201d to the tune of tens of billions of dollars each year, making them ripe for Musk\u2019s chopping block. Utah, with the support of other conservative states, has offered to make Musk\u2019s job easier with a lawsuit seeking to seize control of the \u201cunappropriated\u201d federal land in its midst. Because those states can\u2019t afford to manage those lands at a loss, they would almost certainly sell them off to private interests.\n\nAnd what about those condors? For years, industry and conservative politicians have tried to weaken the Endangered Species Act because it stood in the way of development and profits. Project 2025 calls for an escalation of these efforts, which now have more support in Congress \u2014 and from the efficiency cult.\n\nThe federal government has spent at least $35 million so far on the California condor program. It\u2019s an effort that has so far paid off by helping to bring the species back from the brink of extinction; the wild population is up to almost 600 from an 1980s low of just 22 birds. Public goods such as species restoration simply don\u2019t fit into narrow Musk\u2019s profit-focused vision. And the condor remains fragile, threatened by lead poisoning, power lines, wind turbines and avian influenza, and it is not yet self-sustaining.\n\nIn the weeks since the election, I\u2019ve seen a number of pundits, politicians and even advocates calling on land, water and air defenders to take a more conciliatory approach, to forge alliances with oil and gas companies, to abandon calls to \u201ckeep it in the ground,\u201d to work with Republicans to speed up permitting reform in order to expedite renewable energy development, even if it does mean more fossil fuel development as well. Yet if ever there was a time not to give in, this is it. America\u2019s public lands are under unprecedented attack from nearly every front. Now we need to be even more vigilant and fierce in our defense of it. [ed. emphasis mine]\n\nOut on that bridge, something compelled me to hang my body a little too far over the rail so I could gaze straight through the empty space toward the river. My vertigo was overcome by the thrill of seeing, just below me on a steel girder, a juvenile condor, its pink beak jutting from a thatch of dark brown feathers. That, I thought, is certainly worth fighting for.",
